Title: Van der Waals-Driven Network Restructuring Explains Time-Dependent Piezoresistivity in Soft Nanocomposites
Authors: Logan Ritchie, Elke Pahl, Iain Anderson
Abstract: Carbon-elastomer composites exhibit complex piezoresistive behaviour that cannot be fully explained by existing macroscopic or microstructural models. In this work, we introduce a network-based modelling methodology to explore the hypothesis that van der Waals interactions between carbon particles contribute to the formation of a conductivity-promoting network structure prior to curing. We combine a discrete aggregate-based representation of filler with a mesh-free, quasi-static viscoelastic model adapted from bond-based peridynamics, resolving equilibrium states through energy minimization. The resulting particle networks are analysed using graph-theoretic measures of connectivity and conductivity. Our simulations reproduce several unexplained experimental phenomena, including long-timescale resistivity decay, non-monotonic secondary peaks upon strain release, and the increasing prominence of these features with higher filler density. Crucially, these behaviours emerge from the interplay between viscoelastic stresses and van der Waals interactions. We show that the resistance response of the network operates over different characteristic timescales to the viscoelastic stress response. The approach has potential for understanding and predicting emergent behaviour in composite materials more broadly, where material characteristics often depend on percolating network structure.

Title: A Robust Synthesis of Fluorosurfactants with Tunable Functions via a Two-Step Reaction
Authors: Jiyuan Yao, Shijian Huang, Shuting Xie, Zhenping Liu, Yueming Deng, Luca Carnevale, Mingliang Jin, Loes I. Segerink, Da Wang, Lingling Shui, Sergii Pud
Abstract: Fluorosurfactant-stabilized microdroplets hold significant promise for a wide range of applications, owing to their biological and chemical inertness. However, conventional synthetic routes for fluorosurfactants typically require multiple reaction steps and stringent conditions, such as high temperatures and anaerobic environments. This complexity poses a significant limitation to the development of fluorosurfactant synthesis and their subsequent applications in droplet-based systems. In this work, we present a robust two-step synthesis of fluorosurfactants with tunable functionalities. Microdroplets stabilized by these fluorosurfactants exhibit enhanced stability and biocompatibility. Notably, these fluorosurfactants facilitate the formation of nanodroplets that efficiently transport and concentrate fluorophores with high selectivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that colloidal self-assemblies with tunable morphologies can be engineered by modulating interactions between the fluorosurfactants and colloidal particles. Our synthetic approach provides a strategy for the rapid production of functional fluorosurfactants under mild conditions, enabling droplet-based microfluidic techniques with applications in biology and material science.

Title: Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in a quantum fractal
Authors: Biplab Pal
Abstract: Fractal geometries exhibit complex structures with scale invariance self-similar pattern over various length scales. An artificially designed quantum fractal geometry embedded in a uniform magnetic flux has been explored in this study. It has been found that due to quantum mechanical effect, such quantum fractal display an exotic electronic property which is reflected in its transport characteristics. Owing to this uniform magnetic flux piercing through each closed-loop building block of the fractal structure, an electron traversing through such a fractal geometry will pick up a nontrivial Aharonov-Bohm phase factor, which will influence its transport through the system. It is shown that, one can completely block the transmission of an electron in this fractal geometry by setting the value of the uniform magnetic flux to half flux quantum. This phenomenon of Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in this quantum fractal geometry has been supported by the computation of the energy spectrum, two-terminal transport and persistent current in its various generations. This result is very robust against disorder and could be useful in designing efficient quantum algorithms using a quantum fractal network.

Title: The role of confined water in the emergence of electrostatic strong coupling as revealed by nanoseparated charged lipid layers
Authors: Swen Helstroffer, Ludovic Gardré, Giovanna Fragneto, Arnaud Hemmerle, Léo Henry, Laurent Joly, Fabrice Thalmann, Claire Loison, Pierre Muller, Thierry Charitat
Abstract: This study investigates the interplay between Strong Coupling (SC) attraction and hydration repulsion in nanoconfined water between like-charged phospholipid layers. It challenges the assumption that SC attraction requires multivalent counterions by showing that hydration water can enhance electrostatic interactions. We combine reflectivities with numerical simulations to analyze supported phospholipid layers under different relative humidity and surface charge densities. X-ray fluorescence demonstrates that we can control the valence of the associated counterions. Experimental measurement of the water thickness, combined with precise determination of charged surface positions by numerical simulations, enable us to compare our experiments with a theoretical model. It shows that charge-screening by hydration water induces SC attraction, even at moderate surface charge densities with monovalent counterions. Furthermore, hydration repulsion is stronger for DPPS compared to DPPC. These findings offer insights into the forces that control interactions between phospholipid layers and have important implications for biological and colloidal systems.

Title: Electronic origin of the reorganization energy in interfacial electron transfer
Authors: Sonal Maroo, Leonardo Coello Escalante, Yizhe Wang, Matthew P. Erodici, Jonathon N. Nessralla, Ayana Tabo, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Ke Xu, David T. Limmer, D. Kwabena Bediako
Abstract: The activation free energy of electron transfer (ET) reactions is governed by a crucial parameter: the reorganization energy. In heterogeneous ET at electrified solid-liquid interfaces, it is presumed that only factors in the electrolyte phase are responsible for determining the reorganization energy. Here, we demonstrate the contribution of the electronic density of states (DOS) of the electrode to the reorganization energy. Using van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional crystals, we tune the DOS of graphene and measure its impact on outer-sphere ET. We find the ensuing variation in ET rate arises from modulation in a reorganization energy associated with image potential localization in the electrode, which is dependent on the DOS. This work establishes a fundamental role of the electrode electronic structure in interfacial charge transfer.

Title: Revisiting vestigial order in nematic superconductors: gauge-field mechanisms and model constraints
Authors: Ilaria Maccari, Egor Babaev, Johan Carlström
Abstract: The possibility that nematicity induced by electron pairing could persist above the superconducting transition temperature represents a form of composite order, sometimes referred to as a vestigial nematic phase. However, it remains debated whether--and under what conditions--such a phase can emerge in realistic models of nematic superconductors. Recent analytical work [1] concluded that vestigial nematic phases and related mechanisms do not arise in commonly used models proposed, for example, for Bi2Se3-based candidates. To address this question, we perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of a three-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model of a nematic superconductor. Consistent with the findings of Ref.[1], our numerical results confirm that the commonly considered models do not exhibit vestigial nematic phases or nematic-fluctuation-induced charge-4e superconductivity. In the second part of the study, we investigate a different class of models and show that, under restrictive conditions, vestigial nematic order can be stabilized by an alternative mechanism: intercomponent coupling mediated by a gauge field or the effects of strong correlations.

Title: Magnetic Interactions and Cluster Formation: Boosting Surface Thermopower in Topological Insulators
Authors: M. Tirgar, H. Barati Abgarmi, J. Abouie
Abstract: This study theoretically investigates the thermoelectric properties of magnetic topological insulators (TIs), with a focus on the effects of magnetic atom exchange interactions on the thermopower of their surfaces. Our findings demonstrate that interactions among magnetic atoms significantly enhance the Seebeck coefficient. The formation of magnetic clusters through exchange interactions increases the scattering of Dirac electrons, thereby improving the thermoelectric power factor. We conducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations across various configurations, including ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bulk materials, comparing magnetic clustering in Ising and Heisenberg models. Special attention was given to cluster definitions related to surface critical temperatures. Our analysis indicates that the size and number of magnetic clusters influence relaxation times, as well as electrical and thermal resistivities, ultimately affecting the thermopower. Optimized interlayer and intralayer interactions can elevate the surface thermopower of TIs to values comparable to those observed in antiferromagnetic ${\rm MnTe}$, renowned for its unique spin-based thermoelectric properties. This work highlights the potential of magnetic TIs for thermoelectric applications and sets the stage for future research.

Title: Pull-off force prediction in viscoelastic adhesive Hertzian contact by physics augmented machine learning
Authors: Ali Maghami, Merten Stender, Antonio Papangelo
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the adhesive properties of viscoelastic Hertzian contacts is crucial for diverse engineering applications, including robotics, biomechanics, and advanced material design. The maximum adherence force of a Hertzian indenter unloaded from a viscoelastic substrate has been studied with analytical and numerical models. Analytical models are valid within their assumptions, numerical methods offer precision but can be computationally expensive, necessitating alternative solutions. This study introduces a novel physics-augmented machine learning (PA-ML) framework as a hybrid approach, bridging the gap between analytical models and data-driven solutions, which is capable of rapidly predicting the pull-off force in an Hertzian profile unloaded from a broad band viscoelastic material, with varying Tabor parameter, preload and retraction rate. Compared to previous models, the PA-ML approach provides fast yet accurate predictions in a wide range of conditions, properly predicting the effective surface energy and the work-to-pull-off. The integration of the analytical model provides critical guidance to the PA-ML framework, supporting physically consistent predictions. We demonstrate that physics augmentation enhances predictive accuracy, reducing mean squared error (MSE) while increasing model efficiency and interpretability. We provide data-driven and PA-ML models for real-time predictions of the adherence force in soft materials like silicons and elastomers opening to the possibility to integrate PA-ML into materials and interface design. The models are openly available on Zenodo and GitHub.

Title: Explainable Machine Learning for Oxygen Diffusion in Perovskites and Pyrochlores
Authors: Grace M. Lu, Dallas R. Trinkle (Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801, USA)
Abstract: Explainable machine learning can help to discover new physical relationships for material properties. To understand the material properties that govern the activation energy for oxygen diffusion in perovskites and pyrochlores, we build a database of experimental activation energies and apply a grouping algorithm to the material property features. These features are then used to fit seven different machine learning models. An ensemble consensus determines that the most important features for predicting the activation energy are the ionicity of the A-site bond and the partial pressure of oxygen for perovskites. For pyrochlores, the two most important features are the A-site $s$ valence electron count and the B-site electronegativity. The most important features are all constructed using the weighted averages of elemental metal properties, despite weighted averages of the constituent binary oxides being included in our feature set. This is surprising because the material properties of the constituent oxides are more similar to the experimentally measured properties of perovskites and pyrochlores than the features of the metals that are chosen. The easy-to-measure features identified in this work enable rapid screening for new materials with fast oxide-ion diffusivity.

Title: Pseudogap in electron-doped cuprates: thermal precursor to magnetism
Authors: Emmanouil K. Kokkinis, Andrey V. Chubukov
Abstract: We study pseudogap behavior in a metal near an antiferromagnetic instability and apply the results to electron-doped cuprates. We associate pseudogap behavior with thermal magnetic fluctuations and compute the fermionic self-energy along the Fermi surface beyond Eliashberg approximation. We analyze the spectral function as a function of frequency (energy distribution curves, EDC) and momentum (momentum distribution curves, MDC). We show that the EDC display pseudogap behavior with peaks at a finite frequency at all momenta. On the other hand, MDC peaks disperse within the pseudogap, ending at a gossamer Fermi surface. We analyze magnetically-mediated superconductivity and show that thermal fluctuations almost cancel out in the gap equation, even when the self-energy is obtained beyond the Eliashberg approximation. We favorably compare our results with recent ARPES study [K-J Xu et al, Nat. Phys. 19, 1834-1840 (2023)].

Title: Nitrogen-Vacancy Magnetometry of Edge Magnetism in WS2 Flakes
Authors: Ilja Fescenko, Raman Kumar, Thitinun Gas-Osoth, Yifei Wang, Suvechhya Lamichhane, Tianlin Li, Adam Erickson, Nina Raghavan, Tom Delord, Cory D. Cress, Nicholas Proscia, Samuel W. LaGasse, Sy-Hwang Liou, Xia Hong, Jose J. Fonesca, Toshu An, Carlos A. Meriles, Abdelghani Laraoui
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnets are of significant interest both as a platform for exploring novel fundamental physics and for their potential applications in spintronic and optoelectronic devices. Recent magnetic bulk measurements have indicated a weak ferromagnetic response in WS2 and theoretical predictions suggest that the edges of such flakes exhibit magnetization when at least one edge of a flake is partially hydrogenated. Here, we use room-temperature wide-field quantum diamond magnetometry to image pristine and Fe-implanted WS2 thin flakes of variable thickness, exfoliated from a bulk crystal and transferred to nitrogen-vacancy (NV)-doped diamond substrates. We provide the first direct evidence of edge-localized stray fields, growing linearly with the applied magnetic field and reaching up to 4.7 uT. Magnetic simulations using alternative models favor the presence of edge magnetization aligned along an axis slightly tilted from the normal to the WS2 flake plane. Our observations open intriguing opportunities on the use of WS2 for spintronics applications.

Title: Role of Nematic Fluctuations on Superconductivity in FeSe$_{0.47}$Te$_{0.53}$ Revealed by NMR under Pressure
Authors: Qing-Ping Ding, Juan Schmidt, Jose A. Moreno, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield, Yuji Furukawa
Abstract: The relationship between antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations (SF), nematic fluctuations, and superconductivity (SC) has been central to understanding the pairing mechanism in iron-based superconductors (IBSCs). Iron chalcogenides, which hold the simplest crystal structure in IBSCs, provide a good platform to investigate the relationship. Here, we report $^{77}$Se and $^{125}$Te nuclear magnetic resonance studies of FeSe$_{0.47}$Te$_{0.53}$, which is located close to a nematic quantum critical point (QCP), under pressures up to 1.35 GPa. Both the superconducting critical temperature and AFMSF were found to be enhanced under pressure, which suggests a correlation between SC and AFMSF in FeSe$_{0.47}$Te$_{0.53}$. However, the contribution of AFMSF to SC in FeSe$_{0.47}$Te$_{0.53}$ was found to be much less compared to that in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$, suggesting that nematic fluctuations play a dominant role in the SC in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ around the nematic QCP.

Title: Semiconductor quantum well magnetic memory using confinement from proximity exchange fields for high magnetoresistances in a field-effect transistor
Authors: William S. Rogers, Jean Anne C. Incorvia
Abstract: There is a growing demand for highly-performant memories and memristive technologies for use in in-memory computing. Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) have thus far addressed this need in the field of spintronics. Despite their low write power and high speeds, MTJs are limited by their modest on/off ratio at room temperature, which motivates a search for beyond-MTJ spintronic devices. In this work, we propose a device that uses two layers of ferromagnetic insulator (FMI) cladding a semiconductor QW, which is able to modulate the QW bandgap via electronic confinement resulting from proximity magnetization at the interfaces of the quantum well depending on the relative magnetization of the FMI layers. We predict that this device has the potential for very high magnetoresistances (MRs) possibly exceeding 10,000% at room temperature. We also predict that this device will operate with maximal MR in charge neutrality, and that electrostatic gating may promote the device to act as a magnetic memtransistor. This motivates the search for candidate materials and ultimately experimental demonstration of magnetic QW memories or memtransistors, which may have the potential to advance the state of the art in logic, memory, or neuromorphic circuits.

Title: Mid infrared imaging of mass transport in polymer electrolyte membranes of an operating microfluidic water electrolyzer
Authors: Stéphane Chevalier, Meguya Ryu, Jean-Christophe Batsale, Junko Morikawa
Abstract: This study investigates water transport in a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer using operando infrared spectroscopic imaging. By testing different H2SO4 anolyte concentrations, it examines electrochemical performance, water diffusion, and membrane hydration. Higher anolyte concentrations increased standard deviations in current densities and led to water diffusion gradients revealed by infrared imaging and confirming localized water transport variations. The study highlights the need for improved water management and optimized electrolyzer design for stable and efficient PEM electrolysis in industrial applications.

Title: Domain formation and correlation effects in quenched uniaxial ferroelectrics: A stochastic model perspective
Authors: Olga Yu. Mazur, Yuri A. Genenko, Leonid I. Stefanovich
Abstract: The stochastic analysis of the polarization domain structures, emerging after quenching from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state, in terms of the polarization correlation functions and their Fourier transforms is a fast and effective tool of the materials structure characterization. In spite of a significant volume of experimental data accumulated over the last three decades for the model uniaxial ferroelectric triglycine sulfate, there were no theoretical tools to comprehend these data until now. This work summarizes the recent progress in understanding of the experiments by means of the original stochastic model of polarization structure formation based on the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory and the Gauss random field concept assuming the predominance of the quenched polarization disorder over the thermal fluctuations. The system of integrodifferential equations for correlation functions of random polarization and electric field turns out to be analytically solvable. The model provides explanations to a range of experimental results on the polarization formation kinetics including the time-dependent correlation lengths and correlation functions on the macroscopic spatial and time scales. Notably, it predicts the dependence of the ferroelectric coercive field on the initial disordered state characteristics, which can be controlled by quenching parameters like the initial temperature and the cooling rate, thus paving the way for tailoring the functional properties of the material.

Title: Robust superzone gap opening in incommensurate antiferromagnetic semimetal EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ under in-plane magnetic field
Authors: J. Green, Arpit Arora, Madalynn Marshall, Wanfei Shan, Péter Udvarhelyi, Zachary Morgan, Prineha Narang, Huibo Cao, Ni Ni
Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and charge transport in semimetals has emerged as a fertile ground for discovering novel electronic phenomena. A notable example is the recent discovery of electronic commensuration arising from a spin moiré superlattice (SMS), realized as double-q spin modulation in the antiferromagnetic semimetal EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$. Here, we investigate the in-plane magnetic-field tunability of the SMS using neutron scattering, magnetic and transport measurements. We reveal an incommensurate noncollinear cycloidal magnetic ground state. Temperature-field phase diagrams constructed with field tilting uncover multiple spin-reoriented phases, suggesting the critical role of in-plane field components in driving magnetic transitions. Despite substantial spin reorientation of the double-q phase, we observe a persistent gap opening, evidenced by strong suppression in both Hall and longitudinal conductivities. Model calculations attribute this robustness to the stability of SMS under tilting fields. Our results establish EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ as a tunable platform for exploring spin-texture-driven superzone gap opening in electronic states.

Title: Qubit based on 0-$π$ Josephson junctions
Authors: N. Stefanakis
Abstract: We investigate the static properties of 0-$\pi$ Josephson junctions, with particular emphasis on their application in superconducting quantum circuits. Using a theoretical framework based on the sine-Gordon equation, we analyze the phase evolution for 0-$\pi$ junctions under various boundary and excitation conditions. These junctions, characterized by spatially varying phase shifts, offer promising configurations for qubit implementations due to their intrinsic symmetry and potential robustness against decoherence. We explore the energy landscape, quantized levels, and switching dynamics relevant for qubit state manipulation. Additionally, we present models for phase, flux, and charge qubit designs, emphasizing their operational principles and readout mechanisms. This work provides insights into the engineering of Josephson-based qubits and supports their continued development as scalable components for quantum information processing.

Title: Can experimentally-accessible measures of entanglement distinguish quantum spin liquids from disorder-driven "random singlet" phases ?
Authors: Tokuro Shimokawa, Snigdh Sabharwal, Nic Shannon
Abstract: At the theoretical level, quantum spin liquids are distinguished from other phases of matter by their entanglement properties. However, since the usual measure of entanglement, entanglement entropy, cannot accessed in experiment, indentifying quantum spin liquids in candidate materials remains an acute problem. Here we show other, experimentally-accessible, measures of entanglement can be used to distinguish a quantum spin liquid from a competing disorder-driven "random singlet" phase, in a model of a disordered antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice. The application of these results to the triangular-lattice systems YbZnGaO$_4$, YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ and KYbSe$_2$ is discussed.

Title: A Universal Matrix Ensemble that Unifies Eigenspectrum Laws via Neural Network Models
Authors: Arata Tomoto, Jun-nosuke Teramae
Abstract: Random matrix theory, which characterizes the spectrum distribution of infinitely large matrices, plays a central role in theories across diverse fields, including high-dimensional data analysis, ecology, neuroscience, and machine learning. Among its celebrated achievements, the Marchenko--Pastur law and the elliptic law have served as key results for numerous applications. However, the relationship between these two laws remains elusive, and the existence of a universal framework unifying them is unclear. Inspired by a neural network model, we establish a universal matrix ensemble that unifies these laws as special cases. Through an analysis based on the saddle-node equation, we derive an explicit expression for the spectrum distribution of the ensemble. As a direct application, we reveal how the universal law clarifies the stability of a class of associative memory neural networks. By uncovering a fundamental law of random matrix theory, our results deepen the understanding of high-dimensional systems and advance the integration of theories across multiple disciplines.

Title: Accelerating the Search for Superconductors Using Machine Learning
Authors: Suhas Adiga, Umesh V. Waghmare
Abstract: Prediction of critical temperature $(T_c)$ of a superconductor remains a significant challenge in condensed matter physics. While the BCS theory explains superconductivity in conventional superconductors, there is no framework to predict $T_c$ of unconventional, higher $T_{c}$ superconductors. Quantum Structure Diagrams (QSD) were successful in establishing structure-property relationship for superconductors, quasicrystals, and ferroelectric materials starting from chemical composition. Building on the QSD ideas, we demonstrate that the principal component analysis of superconductivity data uncovers the clustering of various classes of superconductors. We use machine learning analysis and cleaned databases of superconductors to develop predictive models of $T_c$ of a superconductor using its chemical composition. Earlier studies relied on datasets with inconsistencies, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address this, we introduce a data-cleaning workflow to enhance the statistical quality of superconducting databases by eliminating redundancies and resolving inconsistencies. With this improvised database, we apply a supervised machine learning framework and develop a Random Forest model to predict superconductivity and $T_c$ as a function of descriptors motivated from Quantum Structure Diagrams. We demonstrate that this model generalizes effectively in reasonably accurate prediction of $T_{c}$ of compounds outside the database. We further employ our model to systematically screen materials across materials databases as well as various chemically plausible combinations of elements and predict $\mathrm{Tl}_{5}\mathrm{Ba}_{6}\mathrm{Ca}_{6}\mathrm{Cu}_{9}\mathrm{O}_{29}$ to exhibit superconductivity with a $T_{c}$ $\sim$ 105 K. Being based on the descriptors used in QSD's, our model bypasses structural information and predicts $T_{c}$ merely from the chemical composition.

Title: Unlocking Photon Magnon Interplay via Saturation Magnetization
Authors: Sachin Verma, Jiten Mahalik, Abhishek Maurya, Rajeev Singh, Biswanath Bhoi
Abstract: Photon magnon hybrid systems present a promising platform for the development of next generation devices in quantum information processing and quantum sensing technologies. In this study, we investigate the control of photon magnon coupling (PMC) strength through systematic variation of the saturation magnetization in a planar hexagonal ring resonator (HRR) integrated with a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film configuration. Using full wave numerical simulations in CST Microwave Studio, we demonstrate that tuning the Ms of the YIG film from 1750 Oe to 900 Oe enables systematic control over the coupling strength across the 127 to 51 MHz range at room temperature. To explain the observed PMC dynamics, we develop a semiclassical analytical model based on electromagnetic theory that accurately reproduces the observed coupling behavior, revealing the key role of spin density in mediating the light matter interaction. The model is further extended to include the effects of variable magnon damping across different Ms values, enabling broader frequency control. These findings establish Ms as a key tuning parameter for tailoring PMC, with direct implications for the design of tunable hybrid systems for reconfigurable quantum devices.

Title: Unveiling the thermal transport properties of Biphenylene nanotubes: A molecular dynamics study
Authors: Jhionathan de Lima, Cristiano F. Woellner
Abstract: Biphenylene nanotubes (BPNNTs) represent a novel class of carbon-based nanomaterials, constructed by rolling a biphenylene network (BPN) monolayer into a one-dimensional tubular structure. In this study, the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs are investigated using reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. At room temperature, the lattice thermal conductivity of armchair and zigzag BPNNTs is found to be approximately 100 W/m.K and 90 W/m.K, respectively. These values are at least one order of magnitude lower than those of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). This significant reduction is attributed to the unique atomic arrangement of BPNNTs, which promotes enhanced phonon scattering and significantly lower phonon group velocity. Furthermore, the effects of nanotube length, diameter, and temperature on thermal transport are systematically analyzed. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the geometry- and temperature-dependent thermal behavior, a comprehensive analysis of phonon dispersion relations, vibrational density of states, and phonon group velocities is conducted. This study offers valuable insight into the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs, with implications for thermal management and energy-related applications.

Title: Symmetry-broken magneto-toroidal artificial spin ices: magnetization states and dynamics
Authors: G. Alatteili, L. A. Scafuri, E. Iacocca
Abstract: Magneto-toroidal artificial spin ices (MT-ASIs) are arrangements of nanomagnets that exhibit spontaneous toroidization. A ferrotoroidic order could have implications on the propagation of spin waves through this artificial spin ice, including the development of topological edge modes. Here, we numerically investigate the magnetization dynamics of an MT-ASI with and without spatial symmetry breaking. Through micromagnetic simulations, we compute the energies and ferromagnetic resonance spectra of the four lowest-order states, which exhibit ferrotoroidicity, antiferrotoroidicity, and no toroidicity. As expected, we find that the resonant modes split when spatial symmetry is broken. To determine whether our system exhibits topologically protected edge modes, we perform semi-analytical calculations to first estimate the ferromagnetic resonance and then compute the band structure. Our results show that symmetry-broken MT-ASIs are reconfigurable by magnetic field protocols, and that their band structures depend on magnetization state. Calculation of the Chern number indicates that the bands are topologically trivial in all cases, suggesting that the dynamic magnetic coupling is weak. The absence of a non-zero Chern number is proof of the weak dynamic coupling in ASIs, which must be addressed to unlock their full potential in magnonics applications.

Title: Measuring the mechanical properties of asymmetric membranes in computer simulations -- new methods and insights
Authors: Oded Farago
Abstract: We present Monte Carlo simulations of an ultra coarse-grained lipid bilayer with different number of lipids on both leaflets. In the simulations, we employ a new method for measuring the elastic parameters of the membrane, including the area per lipid, area elasticity modulus, and bending rigidity. The method also allows to measure the spontaneous curvature and non-local bending modulus, which are not accessible by standard computer simulations with periodic boundary conditions. For membranes with lipid densities much smaller than the liquid to gel transition density, $\rho_g$, we find a very good agreement between the simulation results and the theory expressing the bilayer elastic free energy as the sum of quadratic free energies in the strains associated with the area density and the local curvature of the monolayers. The theory fails when the lipid area density (in the symmetric reference case) is only slightly smaller than $\rho_g$. Increasing the degree of asymmetry and changing the density of the condensed leaflet to a value larger than $\rho_g$, causes the layer to phase separate between regions with distinct densities which, in turn, may also induce density variations in the dilated liquid layer. Moreover, the phase separation may also trigger local curvature variations along the membrane, which can be attributed to the disparity between the values of the elastic parameters of the coexisting bilayer segments that are mechanically coupled. This mechanism leading to density-curvature variations and instabilities may play a role in cellular processes occurring in liquid-ordered raft domains that are surrounded by the disordered liquid matrix of the cell.

Title: Integrability and exact large deviations of the weakly-asymmetric exclusion process
Authors: Alexandre Krajenbrink, Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: The weakly asymmetric exclusion process (WASEP) in one dimension is a paradigmatic system of interacting particles described by the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) in the presence of driving. We consider an initial condition with densities $\rho_1,\rho_2$ on either side of the origin, so that for $\rho_1=\rho_2$ the gas is stationary. Starting from the microscopic description, we obtain exact formulae for the cumulant generating functions, and large deviation rate functions of the time-integrated current and the position of a tracer. As the asymmetry/driving is increased, these describe the crossover between the symmetric exclusion process (SSEP) and the weak noise regime of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation: we recover the two limits and describe the crossover from the WASEP cubic tail to the $5/2$ and $3/2$ KPZ tail exponents. Finally, we show that the MFT of the WASEP is classically integrable, by exhibiting the explicit Lax pairs, which are obtained through a novel mapping between the MFT of the WASEP and a complex extension of the classical anisotropic Landau-Lifshitz spin chain. This shows integrability of all MFTs of asymmetric models with quadratic mobility as well as their dual versions.

Title: Dislocation Glides in Monolayered Granular Media: Effect of Lattice Constant
Authors: Fumiaki Nakai, Takashi Uneyama, Yuto Sasaki, Kiwamu Yoshii, Hiroaki Katsuragi
Abstract: A recent study demonstrated that granular crystals containing a single dislocation exhibit dislocation glide analogous to that observed in atomic-scale crystals, resulting in plastic deformation at yield stresses several orders of magnitude lower than those of dislocation-free crystals. The yielding behavior strongly depends on the interparticle friction coefficient $\mu$: dislocation glide occurs for friction coefficients below a critical value $\mu_c$, while crystalline order deteriorates above $\mu_c$. In this work, we use discrete element method simulations to systematically investigate how the lattice constant, which determines the interparticle spacing and is a fundamental parameter in microscopic crystalline solids, and the friction coefficient $\mu$ influence the yielding behavior in monolayered granular crystals with dislocation. By decreasing the lattice constant, we find an increase in the critical friction coefficient $\mu_c$, allowing dislocation glide to persist at higher friction values. Furthermore, we observe a linear scaling of yield stress with normal stress, except at extremely low friction coefficients.

Title: Soft superconductivity in covalent bismuth dihydride BiH2 under extreme conditions

Abstract: Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride, successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase P21m BiH2 exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 70 K among MH2type hydrides apart from H2S. The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for P21m and C2m BiH2 indicate that the upper critical fields miu0Hc2(0) is 12 to 16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar Tc. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH2, about 1.1 106 m s, which allows to classify BiH2 as a soft molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning. Measurements of the current voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum Jc(0) is 10 kA mm2), which indicates the presence of two s wave superconducting gaps in BiH2 at 172 to 176 GPa: deltaL(0) is 6.9 1.2 meV and deltaS(0) is 1.5 meV.

Authors: Juan Pablo Carrillo-Mora, Moniellen Pires Monteiro, V.I. Marconi, Maria Luisa Cordero, Ricardo Brito, Rodrigo Soto
Abstract: The trajectories of microswimmers moving in narrow channels of widths comparable to their sizes are significantly altered when they encounter another microswimmer moving in the opposite direction. The consequence of these encounters is a delay in the progress of both swimmers, which can be conceptualized as an instantaneous effective backward displacement. Similarly, the modeling of tumble events in bacteria, which occur over a finite time, can be represented as an instantaneous effective displacement in addition to a change in direction. Such effective displacements can be incorporated directly into a kinetic theory for the partial densities of swimmers moving in the channel. The linear analysis of the resulting equation yields the critical density at which clusters emerge. The methodology is then applied to the case of soil bacteria moving in long channels of cross-section 1.8~${\mu}$m $\times$ 1.8~${\mu}$m. The tracking of the swimmers permits the straightforward acquisition of the effective displacements, which in turn allows the critical density (${\rho}_{\text{crit}}\simeq$ 0.10 bact/${\mu}$m) to be predicted prior to cluster formation. The advantage of this proposed approach is that it does not necessitate the determination of an effective density-dependent speed, which is a requisite of the standard motility-induced phase separation theory.

Title: Data Mining and Computational Screening of Rashba-Dresselhaus Splitting and Optoelectronic Properties in Two-Dimensional Perovskite Materials
Authors: Robert Stanton, Wanyi Nie, Sergei Tretiak, Dhara J. Trivedi
Abstract: Recent developments highlighting the promise of two-dimensional perovskites have vastly increased the compositional search space in the perovskite family. This presents a great opportunity for the realization of highly performant devices, and practical challenges associated with the identification of candidate materials. High-fidelity computational screening offers great value in this regard. In this study, we carry out a multiscale computational workflow, generating a dataset of two-dimensional perovskites in the Dion-Jacobson and Ruddlesden-Popper phases. Our dataset comprises ten B-site cations, four halogens, and over 20 organic cations across over 2,000 materials. We compute electronic properties, thermoelectric performance, and numerous geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for the high-throughput computation of Rashba-Dresselhaus splitting. Finally, we use this dataset to train machine learning models for the accurate prediction of band gaps, candidate Rashba-Dresselhaus materials, and partial charges. The work presented herein can aid future investigations of two-dimensional perovskites with targeted applications in mind.

Title: Strange metallicity encompasses high magnetic field-induced superconductivity in UTe2
Authors: T.I. Weinberger, H. Chen, Z. Wu, M. Long, A. Cabala, Y. Skourski, J. Sourd, T. Haidamak, V. Sechovsky, M. Valiska, F.M. Grosche, A.G. Eaton
Abstract: The heavy fermion material UTe$_2$ hosts a suite of exotic superconducting phases, the most extreme of which resides in a narrow angular window of intense magnetic fields $>$ 40 T. Here we report that in the angular and field regime in which field-induced superconductivity is most robust, the normal-state resistivity exhibits a linear temperature dependence characteristic of strange metallicity, sharply contrasting with the Fermi-liquid behavior observed at low fields and away from this angular window. Through angle-dependent magnetotransport measurements in high magnetic fields, we find that the strange metal state is confined to a narrow angular range where field-induced superconductivity is also maximized, suggesting a shared underlying mechanism. These findings reveal a novel setting for strange metallicity - proximate to spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity - and point to the presence of quantum critical fluctuations, likely of a magnetic origin. The coexistence of strange metallicity and putatively spin-triplet pairing challenges prevailing paradigms of non-Fermi-liquid phenomenology, and highlights UTe$_2$ as a unique platform for exploring the interplay between unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality.

Title: Efficient and Accurate Machine Learning Interatomic Potential for Graphene: Capturing Stress-Strain and Vibrational Properties
Authors: Felipe Hawthorne, Paulo R. E. Raulino, Ronaldo Rodrigues Pelá, Cristiano F. Woellner
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer an efficient and accurate framework for large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, effectively bridging the gap between classical force fields and \textit{ab initio} methods. In this work, we present a reactive MLIP for graphene, trained on an extensive dataset generated via \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The model accurately reproduces key mechanical and vibrational properties, including stress-strain behavior, elastic constants, phonon dispersion, and vibrational density of states. Notably, it captures temperature-dependent fracture mechanisms and the emergence of linear acetylenic carbon chains upon tearing. The phonon analysis also reveals the expected quadratic ZA mode and excellent agreement with experimental and DFT benchmarks. Our MLIP scales linearly with system size, enabling simulations of large graphene sheets with \textit{ab initio}-level precision. This work delivers a robust and transferable MLIP, alongside an accessible training workflow that can be extended to other materials.

Title: Polymer (imperfect) single-file diffusion: A phase diagram
Authors: Hanyang Wang, Gary W. Slater
Abstract: We use Langevin dynamics (LD) simulations to investigate single-file diffusion (SFD) in a dilute solution of flexible linear polymers inside a narrow tube with periodic boundary conditions (a torus). The transition from SFD, where the time (t) dependence of the mean-square displacement scales like $\langle x^2\rangle \sim t^{1/2}$, to normal diffusion with $\langle x^2 \rangle \sim t$, is studied as a function of the system parameters, such as the size and concentration of the polymer chains and the width of the tube. We propose a phase diagram describing different diffusion regimes. In particular, we highlight the fact that there are two different pathways to normal long-time diffusion. We also map this problem onto a one-dimensional Lattice Monte Carlo model where the diffusing object represents the polymer center of mass. Possible extensions of this work to polydisperse polymer solutions, one-dimensional electrophoresis and DNA mapping are discussed.

Title: Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations with large spin splitting in highmobility Al0.8Ga0.2Sb/InAs/ Al0.8Ga0.2Sb quantum-well heterostructures
Authors: Zhenghang Zhi, Hanzhi Ruan, Jiuming Liu, Xinpeng Li, Yong Zhang, Qi Yao, Chenjia Tang, Yujie Xiao, Xufeng Kou
Abstract: We report the epitaxial growth of high-quality Al0.8Ga0.2Sb-InAs-Al0.8Ga0.2Sb quantum well films featured by high carrier mobility and strong spin-orbit coupling. By appropriately optimizing the Al-to-Ga ratio in the AlGaSb barrier layer, the quantum confinement of the heterostructure is significantlyenhanced, which results in both an ultra-high electron mobility of 924000 cm2/Vs and a giant magnetoresistance ratio of 365000 at low temperatures. Meanwhile, pronounced Shubnikov-deHaas quantum oscillations persist up to 30 K, and their single-frequency feature indicates a well defined Fermi surface without subband mixing in the two-dimensional electron gas channel. Moreover, the large effective g-factor of 12.93 leads to the observation of Zeeman splitting at large magnetic fields. Our results validate the AlGaSb/InAs quantum well heterostructures as a suitable candidate for constructing energy-efficient topological spintronic devices.

Title: Inhomogeneity-driven multiform Spontaneous Hall Effect in conventional and unconventional superconductors

Abstract: The spontaneous Hall effect (SHE), a finite voltage occurring transversal to the electrical current in zero-magnetic field, has been observed in both conventional and unconventional superconductors, appearing as a peak near the superconducting transition temperature. The origin of SHE is strongly debated, with proposed explanations ranging from intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms such as spontaneous symmetry breaking and time-reversal symmetry breaking (BTRS), Abrikosov vortex motion, or extrinsic factors like material inhomogeneities, such as non-uniform critical temperature (Tc) distributions or structural asymmetries. This work is an experimental study of the SHE in various superconducting materials. We focused on conventional, low-Tc, sharp transition Nb and unconventional, intermediate-Tc, smeared transition Fe(Se,Te). Our findings show distinct SHE peaks around the superconducting transition, with variations in height, sign and shape, indicating a possible common mechanism independent of the specific material. We propose that spatial inhomogeneities in the critical temperature, caused by local chemical composition variations, disorder, or other forms of electronic spatial inhomogeneities could explain the appearing of the SHE. This hypothesis is supported by comprehensive finite elements simulations of randomly distributed Tc by varying Tc-distribution, spatial scale of disorder and amplitude of the superconducting transition. The comparison between experimental results and simulations suggest a unified origin for the SHE in different superconductors, whereas different phenomenology can be explained in terms of amplitude of the transition temperature in respect to Tc-distribution.

Title: Antipolar and short and long-range magnetic ordering in quasi-two-dimensional AgCrP2S6
Authors: Chaitanya B. Auti, Atul G. Chakkar, Shantanu Semwal, Sebastian Selter, Yuliia Shemerliuk, Bernd Büchner, Saicharan Aswartham, Koushik Pal, Pradeep Kumar
Abstract: Within the Landau theoretical framework, the decreased entropy with decreasing the temperature is accompanied by the symmetry breaking and hence a corresponding phase transition. The broken symmetries leave its imprint on the underlying excitations and the same may be gauged using renormalization of these excitations. AgCrP2S6 provides a versatile playground to probe dynamics of the quasiparticle excitations as well as multiple phase transitions with lowering temperature linked with the polar, lattice and spin degrees of freedom. Here, we report an in-depth temperature- and polarization-dependent Raman scattering measurements on single crystals of quasi 2D zigzag antiferromagnet AgCrP2S6 along with the first principle based phonon calculations. We observed multiple phase transitions triggered by the short and long-range ordering of spins at ~ 90 K and 20 K, respectively; within the Cr sublattice where spins are arranged in a 1D chain, evident by the distinct anomalies in the phonon modes self-energy parameters as well as intensity. Contrary to the conventional belief, we uncovered potential quasi-antipolar ordering at ~ 200 K and with further lowering in temperature an antipolar ordering at ~ 140 K attributed to the Ag ions, which is conjectured to be forbidden owing to the heaviness of Ag ions. The quasi-antipolar and antipolar ordering is gauged via the distinct renormalization of the phonon parameters, which survives at all the temperatures. Additionally, large number of modes appears with decreasing the temperature, in the window of ~ 200-140 K, where antipolar ordering starts settling in. The emergence of large number of phonon modes below ~ 200 K, nearly double of those at room temperature, suggests the lowering of symmetry from high temperature C2h to the low temperature C2 or Cs and as a result doubling of the unit cell.

Title: Enhancement of d-wave Pairing in Strongly Correlated Altermagnet
Authors: Jianyu Li, Ji Liu, Xiaosen Yang, Ho-Kin Tang
Abstract: Altermagnetism, featuring momentum-dependent spin splitting without net magnetization, has attracted a growing interest for spintronics. We study a Fermi Hubbard model with altermagnetic order arising from the spin-anisotropic hopping near half-filling using constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo. Spin-dependent hopping breaks SU(2) symmetry and disrupts Fermi surface nesting, giving rise to an altermagnetic state with momentum-space spin splitting but no net magnetization. We find that increasing anisotropy suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and significantly enhances effective $d$-wave pairing correlations. Our results demonstrate a doping-free route to unconventional superconductivity mediated by short-range spin fluctuations in an altermagnetic background.

Title: Conservative Join with memory in token-based Brownian circuits and its thermodynamic cost
Authors: Yasuhiro Utsumi
Abstract: The token-based Brownian circuit harnesses the Brownian motion of particles for computation. The conservative join (CJoin) is a circuit element that synchronizes two Brownian particles, and its realization using repelling particles, such as magnetic skyrmions or electrons, is key to building the Brownian circuit. Here, a theoretical implementation of the CJoin using a simple quantum dot circuit is proposed, incorporating an internal state-a double quantum dot that functions as a one-bit memory, storing the direction of two-particle transfer. A periodic reset protocol is introduced, allowing the CJoin to emit particles in a specific direction. The stochastic thermodynamics under periodic resets identifies the thermodynamic cost as the work done for resets minus the entropy reduction due to resets, with its lower bound remaining within a few multiples of $k_{\rm B} T$ at temperature $T$. Applying the speed limit relation to a subsystem in bipartite dynamics, the number of emitted particles is shown to be relatively tightly bounded from above by an expression involving the subsystem's irreversible entropy production rate and dynamical activity rate.

Title: Intrinsic layer polarization and multi-flatband transport in non-centrosymmetric mixed-stacked multilayer graphene
Authors: Kai Liu, Yating Sha, Bo Yin, Shuhan Liu, Yulu Ren, Zhongxun Guo, Jingjing Gao, Ming Tian, Neng Wan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Bingbing Tong, Guangtong Liu, Li Lu, Yuanbo Zhang, Weidong Luo, Zhiwen Shi, Quansheng Wu, Guorui Chen
Abstract: Graphene multilayers exhibit electronic spectra that depend sensitively on both the number of layers and their stacking order. Beyond trilayer graphene, mixed stacking sequences (alternating Bernal and rhombohedral layers) give rise to multiple coexisting low-energy bands. Here we investigate ABCBC-stacked pentalayer graphene, a less-studied non-centrosymmetric mixed sequence. This stacking can be regarded as an ABC (rhombohedral) trilayer on top of an AB (Bernal) bilayer, so its low-energy band structure contains both a cubic band and a parabolic band that hybridize. In transport measurements, we observe an intrinsic band gap at charge neutrality whose magnitude changes asymmetrically under an applied perpendicular displacement field. This behavior reflects the spontaneous layer polarization inherent to the broken inversion symmetry and mirror symmetry. By tuning the displacement field and carrier density, we drive multiple Lifshitz transitions in the Fermi surface topology and realize Landau levels with different degeneracies arising from the multi-flatband system. Remarkably, a v = -6 quantum Hall state emerges at an exceptionally low magnetic field (~20 mT), indicating the interplay between spontaneous symmetry breaking and Berry curvatures. Our results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a tunable platform with various broken symmetries and multiple flatbands, suitable for exploring emergent correlated electronic states.

Title: Thermal and thermoelectric transport in monolayer h-NbN: Roles of four-phonon scattering and tensile strain
Authors: Himanshu Murari, Subhradip Ghosh, Mukul Kabir, Ashis Kundu
Abstract: Unlocking the thermal and thermoelectric potential of 2D materials, we explore the h-NbN monolayer, which lacks mirror symmetry and features a large acoustic-optical phonon gap and quadratic flexural mode. First-principles calculations and the Boltzmann transport formalism reveal a complex interplay of multi-phonon scattering processes, where flexural phonons and four-phonon interactions play a significant role in heat transport, primarily dominated by acoustic phonons. Notably, the four-phonon interactions are predominantly confined to acoustic phonons. Tensile strain preserves the underlying scattering mechanisms while reducing anharmonicity, consequently, the scattering rates, enhancing thermal conduction. Simultaneously, competing modifications in thermal and electrical transport shape the strain-dependent thermoelectric response, achieving a figure of merit approaching 1 at elevated temperatures, a testament to its thermoelectric promise. Our findings underscore the critical role of microscopic transport modeling in accurately capturing thermal and thermoelectric properties, paving the way for advanced applications of 2D materials.

Title: Voltage-tuned anomalous-metal to metal transition in hybrid Josephson junction arrays
Authors: S. Sasmal, M. Efthymiou-Tsironi, G. Nagda, E. Fugl, L. L. Olsen, F. Krizek, C. M. Marcus, S. Vaitiekėnas
Abstract: We report voltage-tuned phase transitions in arrays of hybrid semiconductor-superconductor islands arranged in a square lattice. A double-layer electrostatic gate geometry enables independent tuning of inter-island coupling and proximity-induced superconductivity. This design enables access to the superconductor-insulator, superconductor-metal, and metal-insulator transitions in a single device, revealing critical points and emergent intermediate phases. We find that the superconductor-insulator transition is interrupted by an anomalous metallic phase with saturating low-temperature resistivity. Across gate voltages, this regime extends over three orders of magnitude in resistivity and can be continuously tuned into the conventional metallic phase. The signature of the anomalous metallic phase is suppressed by magnetic frustration.

Title: Microscopic theory of electron quadrupling condensates
Authors: Albert Samoilenka, Egor Babaev
Abstract: A plethora of materials exhibit electron pairing, leading to the phenomenon of superconductivity. Recently, experiments found evidence consistent with the formation of more complex states characterized by order in four-electron composite objects, termed electron quadrupling or composite order. In the first part of the paper, we provide a general microscopic framework to describe these and the other four-fermion composite states. In the second part of the paper, we derive and solve a specific fermionic model in two and three dimensions that hosts time-reversal symmetry-breaking electron quadrupling order. The fermionic microscopic theory is used to estimate the specific heat and electron density of states.

Title: Reentrant Rigidity Transition in Planar Epithelia with Volume- and Area Elasticity
Authors: Tanmoy Sarkar, Matej Krajnc
Abstract: We recover a rigidity transition in 3D epithelial monolayers, described by cell Volume- and Area Elasticity (VAE). An in-plane isotropic strain drives a reentrant columnar-to-sqamous rigidity transition, with a critical point near the unit cell aspect ratio. In addition to the vanishing shear modulus, the phase diagram also features floppy states with zero in-plane bulk modulus and a discontinuous columnar-squamous transition, controlled by the lateral tension. Our results provide a 3D context to the rigidity transition of the well-studied 2D Area- and Perimeter-Elasticity (APE) model of epithelia, offering a resolution to a counterintuitive compression-induced tissue softening predicted by the 2D model.

Title: Vortex Mass in Superfluid Fermi Gases along the BEC--BCS Crossover
Authors: Lucas Levrouw, Hiromitsu Takeuchi, Jacques Tempere
Abstract: Vortex mass is a key concept in the study of superfluid dynamics, referring to the inertia of vortices in a superfluid, which affects their motion and behavior. Despite being an important quantity, the vortex mass has never been observed experimentally, and remains an unresolved issue in this field. As of now, a large body of research assumes that the vortex mass is a local parameter. In contrast, we present a calculation that suggests a logarithmic dependence on the system size, agreeing with some earlier predictions in the context of Bose gases. We analyze the problem using an effective field theory that describes ultracold atomic Fermi gases over the BEC--BCS crossover at both zero and nonzero temperatures. Our study reveals a strong dependence of the vortex mass on the scattering length; in particular, the vortex mass grows rapidly when moving towards the BCS side. Furthermore, we find that the system-size dependence of the vortex mass results in values an order of magnitude larger than those predicted by other models for realistic system sizes. This implies that the vortex mass could be observable in a wider parameter range than was previously expected. This is particularly relevant considering recent advances in experimental techniques that place the observation of vortex mass in superfluid Fermi gases within reach.

Title: Driven Critical Dynamics in Tricitical Point
Authors: Ting-Long Wang, Yi-Fan Jiang, Shuai Yin
Abstract: The conventional Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism, describing driven dynamics across critical points based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario (AIS), have attracted broad attentions. However, the driven dynamics in tricritical point with two independent relevant directions has not been adequately studied. Here, we employ time dependent variational principle to study the driven critical dynamics at a one-dimensional supersymmetric Ising tricritical point. For the relevant direction along the Ising critical line, the AIS apparently breaks down. Nevertheless, we find that the critical dynamics can still be described by the KZ scaling in which the driving rate has the dimension of $r=z+1/\nu_\mu$ with $z$ and $\nu_\mu$ being the dynamic exponent and correlation length exponent in this direction, respectively. For driven dynamics along other direction, the driving rate has the dimension $r=z+1/\nu_p$ with $\nu_p$ being the other correlation length exponent. Our work brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics near the tricritical point, which could be realized in programmable quantum processors in Rydberg atomic systems.

Title: Superconductivity and phase diagram in Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films
Authors: Bo Hao, Maosen Wang, Wenjie Sun, Yang Yang, Zhangwen Mao, Shengjun Yan, Haoying Sun, Hongyi Zhang, Lu Han, Zhengbin Gu, Jian Zhou, Dianxiang Ji, Yuefeng Nie
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated ambient pressure superconductivity in compressively strained La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films, yet the phase diagram of heterovalent doping$-$critical for advancing the field$-$remains unexplored. Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} > 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.

Title: Unconventional band splitting of CeSb in the devil's staircase transition
Authors: Tongrui Li, Zhanfeng Liu, Peng Li, Yuzhe Wang, Zhisheng Zhao, Shiwu Su, Zhicheng Jiang, Yuhao Hong, Hui Tian, Xin Zheng, Yi Liu, Yilin Wang, Zhengtai Liu, Dawei Shen, Zhe Sun, Yang Liu, Juan Jiang, Donglai Feng
Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and electronic band structure is a central theme in condensed matter physics. CeSb, with its complex devil's staircase antiferromagnetic transition, offers a unique opportunity to explore this interplay. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we investigate the electronic structure evolution across the devil's staircase transition. Upon entering the antiferromagnetic phase, we observe an intriguing band splitting of the electron pocket around the X point. The energy separation between the split bands changes abruptly with temperature, consistent with the characteristics of the first-order phase transition. However, their respective spectral weights behave gradually with temperature. Combined with our density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we suggest that this atypical behavior deviates from conventional magnetically induced band splitting and potentially arises from the intricate modulation of paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic layers within the devil's staircase transition. Our results provide insights into the complex relationship between electronic structure and magnetism in correlated electron systems.

Title: Emergence of the electronic states by quantum charge fluctuations in electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprates superconductors
Authors: Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Yudai Miyai, Yuki. Tsubota, Masashi Atira, Hitoshi Sato, Dongjoon Song, Kiyoshia Tanakae, Kenya Shimada, Shin-ichiro Ideta
Abstract: The origin of electron-boson interactions is a key to understanding the mechanism of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprates. While interactions with phonons and magnetic fluctuations are widely considered to mediate electron pairing in cuprates, the role of charge fluctuations, which is one of the fundamental degrees of freedom, remains unclear. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and angle-resolved inverse photoemission spectroscopy (AR-IPES) to investigate the electronic structure of the occupied and unoccupied states, respectively, in the electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. We found emergent spectral features in both the occupied (ARPES) and unoccupied states (AR-IPES), which are likely induced by charge fluctuations. The present study paves the way for a deeper understanding of the relationship between quantum charge fluctuations and superconductivity.

Title: Thermodynamic analysis of diverse percolation transitions
Authors: Seonghyeon Moon, Young Sul Cho
Abstract: This work extends the thermodynamic analysis of random bond percolation to explosive and hybrid percolation models. We show that this thermodynamic analysis is well applicable to both explosive and hybrid percolation models by using the critical exponents $\alpha$ and $\delta$ obtained from scaling relations with previously measured values of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ within the error range. As a result, Rushbrooke inequality holds as an equality, $\alpha + 2\beta + \gamma = 2$, in both explosive and hybrid percolation models, where $\alpha > 0$ leads to the divergence of specific heats at the critical points. Remarkably, entropy clearly reveals a continuous decrease even in a finite-sized explosive percolation model, unlike the order parameter. In contrast, entropy decreases discontinuously during a discontinuous transition in a hybrid percolation model, resembling the heat outflow during discontinuous transitions in thermal systems.

Title: Correlated Dirac semimetal states in nonsymmorphic MIrO$_3$ (M=Sr, Ba and Ca)
Authors: Zhi-Ming Yang, Huan Li
Abstract: Nonsymmorphic symmetries can give rise to Dirac semimetal (DSM) states. However, few studies have been conducted on DSMs in interacting systems. Here, we induce interacting DSM states in nonsymmorphic iridium oxides SrIrO$_3$, BaIrO$_3$ and CaIrO$_3$, and contend that the interaction of electron-electron correlations, strong spin-orbital coupling, and symmetry protection can drive robust and exotic DSM states. Based on the density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory (DFT + DMFT), with the Coulomb interaction parameters computed through doubly screened Coulomb correction approach, we discover that the Dirac fermions are constituted by the strongly spin-orbital coupled $J_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1/2$ states resulting from $t_{2g}$ orbits of Ir, with significant mass enhancement. Moreover, the nonsymmorphic symmetries induce topological surface bands and Fermi arcs on the (001) surface, which are well separated from bulk states. Our findings establish nonsymmorphic iridium oxides as correlated DSMs under strong electron-electron and spin-orbital interactions.

Title: A Deep Learning Potential for Accurate Shock Response Simulations in Tin
Authors: Yixin Chen, Xiaoyang Wang, Wanghui Li, Mohan Chen, Han Wang
Abstract: Tin (Sn) plays a crucial role in studying the dynamic mechanical responses of ductile metals under shock loading. Atomistic simulations serves to unveil the nano-scale mechanisms for critical behaviors of dynamic responses. However, existing empirical potentials for Sn often lack sufficient accuracy when applied in such simulation. Particularly, the solid-solid phase transition behavior of Sn poses significant challenges to the accuracy of interatomic potentials. To address these challenges, this study introduces a machine-learning potential model for Sn, specifically optimized for shock-response simulations. The model is trained using a dataset constructed through a concurrent learning framework and is designed for molecular simulations across thermodynamic conditions ranging from 0 to 100 GPa and 0 to 5000 K, encompassing both solid and liquid phases as well as structures with free surfaces. It accurately reproduces density functional theory (DFT)-derived basic properties, experimental melting curves, solid-solid phase boundaries, and shock Hugoniot results. This demonstrates the model's potential to bridge ab initio precision with large-scale dynamic simulations of Sn.

Title: Itinerant ferromagnetism in an SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model at finite temperature: A DMFT study
Authors: Juntaro Fujii, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga
Abstract: We investigate an SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model on a hypercubic lattice at finite temperatures, combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Taking strong correlations into account carefully, we find a ferromagnetically ordered state, in which one of the three components becomes dominant, when holes are doped away from one-third filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this ferromagnetically ordered phase undergoes a first-order transition to a paramagnetic state. We clarify the stability of the ferromagnetically ordered state against interaction strength, hole doping, and temperatures. The relevance of generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism is also addressed, by comparing the results on the Bethe lattice.

Title: Characterization of phospholipid-cholesterol bilayers as self-assembled amphiphile block polymers that contain headgroups
Authors: Xiaoyuan Wang, Fredric S. Cohen, Shixin Xu, Yongqiang Cai
Abstract: Cholesterol is known to modulate the structure and function of biological membranes. In this study, we use self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to investigate phospholipid/cholesterol bilayer membranes modeled with two types of diblock copolymers. These copolymer-based bilayers serve as biomimetic platforms with applications in areas such as drug delivery. Our simulations identify a minimum free energy configuration characterized by phospholipid tails tilted relative to the membrane normal. The model quantitatively captures the well-known area condensation effect as cholesterol concentration increases, along with membrane thickening and reduced tilt angle. Thermodynamically, we observe a linear dependence between cholesterol's chemical potential and its concentration within the 37-50% range, consistent with experimental results. Additionally, we analyze the effects of block copolymer length and headgroup interactions on bilayer structure. Interactions between phospholipid headgroups and the solvent emerge as the most influential. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding cholesterol's regulatory role in membrane structure and mechanics.

Title: Unifying Strain-driven and Pressure-driven Superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$: Suppressed charge/spin density waves and enhanced interlayer coupling
Authors: Xin-Wei Yi, Wei Li, Jing-Yang You, Bo Gu, Gang Su
Abstract: Recent strain-stabilized superconductivity at ambient pressure in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ films opens new avenues for nickelates research, in parallel with its pressure-induced counterpart. Using density functional theory calculations, we elucidate the critical factors bridging strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ by comprehensively analyzing structural, electronic, magnetic, and density wave characteristics. Consistent with recent scanning transmission electron microscopy observations, we find an $I4/mmm$ structural transition at $-0.9\%$ strain, preceding superconductivity onset. Electronic analysis shows compressive strain lowers Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbital energy levels, while interfacial Sr diffusion effectively reconstructs the $d_{z^2}$ pockets, quantitatively matching angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. The interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling $J_\perp$ under pressure or strain closely tracks experimental superconducting $T_c$ variation. The dome-shaped pressure dependence and monotonic strain dependence of $J_\perp$ mainly arise from modulations in the apical oxygen $p_z$ energy levels. Moreover, compressive strain suppresses both charge density waves (CDW) and spin density waves (SDW) instabilities analogous to pressure effects, with SDW vanishing concurrently with the structural transition and CDW disappearing at $\sim-3.3\%$ strain. Our results indicate that suppressed density waves and enhanced $J_\perp$ are crucial for both strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity. Accordingly, we propose several candidate substrates capable of achieving greater compressive strain, thereby potentially increasing $T_c$.

Abstract: Two-dimensional materials and van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures host many strongly correlated and topological quantum phases on the $\sim$ meV energy scale. Direct electrodynamical signatures of such states are thus expected to appear in the terahertz (THz) frequency range (1 THz $\sim$ 4 meV). Because the typical size of vdW heterostructures ($\sim$10 $\mu m$) is much smaller than the diffraction limit of THz light, probing THz optical conductivities necessitates the use of near-field optical probes. However, interpreting the response of such near-field probes is complicated by finite-size effects, the presence of electrostatic gates, and the influence of the probe itself on material dynamics -- all of which conspire to form polaritonic self-cavities, in which interactions between THz electromagnetic fields and material excitations form discretized standing waves. In this paper, we demonstrate the relevance of self-cavity effects in 2D materials and derive an analytical framework to resolve these effects using the emerging experimental technique of time-domain on-chip THz spectroscopy. We show that by pairing experiments with the analytical theory, it is possible to extract the THz conductivity and resolve collective mode dynamics far outside the light cone, with $\sim \mu m$ in-plane and $\sim nm$ out-of-plane resolution. This study lays the groundwork for studying quantum phases and cavity effects in vdW heterostructures and 2D quantum materials.

Title: Theory of charge-to-spin conversion under quantum confinement
Authors: Alfonso Maiellaro, Francesco Romeo, Mattia Trama, Irene Gaiardoni, Jacopo Settino, Claudio Guarcello, Nicolas Bergeal, Manuel Bibes, Roberta Citro
Abstract: The interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in low-dimensional systems is a cornerstone of modern spintronics, where achieving all-electrical control of spin currents is a major goal. Spin-orbit interactions provide a promising mechanism for such control, yet understanding how spin and charge transport emerge from microscopic principles remains a fundamental challenge. Here we develop a spin-dependent scattering matrix approach to describe spin and charge transport in a multiterminal system in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our framework generalizes the Büttiker formalism by offering explicit real-space expressions for spin and charge current densities, along with the corresponding linear response function. It simultaneously captures the effects of quantum confinement, the orbital response to external magnetic fields, and the intrinsic (geometric) properties of the electronic bands, offering a comprehensive description of the spin-charge interconversion mechanisms at play in a Hall bar, in agreement with experiments.

Title: Numerical Investigation on the Compressive Behavior of Hierarchical Granular Piles
Authors: Sota Arakawa, Mikito Furuichi, Daisuke Nishiura
Abstract: Hierarchical granular piles composed of aggregates are key structural features in both geoscience and planetary science, from fault gouge in seismic zones to the internal structures of comets. Although experimental studies have suggested a multi-step evolution in their packing structure, this hypothesis has lacked numerical validation. In this study, we performed large-scale numerical simulations using the discrete element method to investigate the compressive behavior of hierarchical granular piles. We successfully reproduced and confirmed a three-stage evolution process: (i) rearrangement of the aggregate packing structure, (ii) plastic deformation of small aggregates, and (iii) elastic deformation of constituent particles. Additionally, we developed a semi-analytical model for the compression curve, offering insights into the compressive stages and structural dynamics. Our findings have applications in modeling the internal density profiles of comets and in understanding the early thermal evolution of small icy bodies.

Title: Breaking Sensitivity Barriers in Luminescence Thermometry: Synergy Between Structural Phase Transition and Luminescence Thermal Quenching
Authors: M. Tahir Abbas, M. Szymczak, M. Drozd, D. Szymanski, A. Owczarek, A.Musialek, L. Marciniak
Abstract: One of the key parameters determining the performance of a luminescent thermometer is its relative sensitivity. In ratiometric luminescence thermometry, high relative sensitivity to temperature variations is typically achieved when the two monitored emission bands exhibit opposite thermal monotonicity. However, realizing a thermal enhancement in the luminescence intensity of one of the emission bands remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a novel approach that leverages the synergistic effect of two phenomena: (1) the high thermal sensitivity of Mn4+ ion luminescence, and (2) a thermally induced structural phase transition in LaGaO3, which facilitates the enhancement of the luminescence signal from Tb3+ ions in the high-temperature phase of the host material. This dual effect not only led to an increased maximum relative sensitivity but also extended the temperature range over which the sensitivity exceeded 1% K-1. The highest recorded sensitivity was 4.5 K-1 at 400 K. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, the luminescence of Mn4+ ions in the high-temperature phase of LaGaO3:Mn4+ was observed and reported here for the first time. The thermally induced modifications in the emission profile of LaGaO3:Mn4+,Tb3+ enabled the development of a quadruple ratiometric luminescence thermometer, with complementary operating ranges, offering enhanced versatility and accuracy across a broad temperature span.

Title: Mechanistic Insights into the Early Stages of Oxidation at Copper Terrace: The Role of O-O Repulsion and Substrate-mediated Effects
Authors: E V Charan Reddy, Abhijit Chatterjee
Abstract: Copper-based catalysts play a crucial role in industrial oxidation reactions. Although many theoretical studies consider copper to be metallic, it is well established that copper readily oxides at ambient conditions, forming a passivating oxide layer. Experimental investigations spanning two decades have shown that in addition to the anticipated step-oxide formation, oxide can directly form at the Cu(111) terrace. The atomistically-resolved mechanism for direct oxidation at flat terraces remains unknown. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the formation of subsurface oxide occurs through a coordinated mechanism that takes place in the presence of specific clusters of adsorbed oxygen atoms. Certain oxygen atoms in the cluster function like pincers to extract a copper atom from the surface layer and induce localized surface restructuring. This process creates open channels that allow an oxygen atom to diffuse into the subsurface layer. The subsurface oxide formation is barrierless. This implies that the Cu oxide surface is highly dynamic. At low O coverages, subsurface oxidation is unlikely via step oxide growth nor direct terrace oxidation as the subsurface oxygen is unstable. Substrate mediated O-Cu-O adsorbate interactions govern the oxide stability. These insights provide a foundation for developing a more accurate dynamic models for copper catalysis.

Title: Anomalous persistent current in a 1D dimerized ring with aperiodic site potential: Non-interacting and interacting cases
Authors: Souvik Roy, Santanu K. Maiti, David Laroze
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the magnetic response by examining flux-driven circular currents in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) tight-binding (TB) ring threaded by an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux, $\phi$. We consider both non-interacting and interacting electrons, where site energies are modulated by a slowly varying cosine form. Repulsive electron-electron interaction is incorporated through an on-site Hubbard term, and we analyze the system using the Hartree-Fock (HF) mean-field (MF) approximation. We discuss the characteristics of flux-driven circular currents to aperiodic potentials, dimerized hopping integrals, and Hubbard interactions. For the chosen aperiodic potential, both the strength and configuration play a crucial role, and we explore these aspects in depth. Interestingly, we observe a counterintuitive delocalizing effect as the aperiodic potential increases, unlike in conventional disordered rings. The effects of system size, filling factor, the presence of circular spin current, and the accuracy of MF results are also discussed. Finally, we provide a brief description of possible experimental realizations of our chosen quantum system. This investigation can be extended to explore additional properties in various loop substructures, promising further insights.

Title: Hydrogen Bond Topology Reveals Layering of LDL-like and HDL-like Water at its Liquid/Vapor Interface
Authors: Pal Jedlovszky, Christoph Dellago, Marcello Sega
Abstract: The discovery of high-density liquid (HDL) and low-density liquid (LDL) water has been a major success of molecular simulations, yet extending this analysis to interfacial water is challenging due to conventional order parameters assuming local homogeneity. This limitation previously prevented resolving the composition of the surface layer of the liquid/vapour interface. Here, we apply a recently introduced topological order parameter [R. Foffi and F. Sciortino, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 378-386 (2022)] to analyze the composition of the water/vapor interface across a broad temperature range. Our results reveal that LDL-like water dominates the outermost region at all temperatures, while HDL-like water accumulates beneath it, presenting a clear layering roughly below the temperature of maximum density. This structured stratification, previously inaccessible, highlights the power of the topological order parameter in resolving interfacial molecular heterogeneity and provides new insights into the structural properties of water at interfaces.

Title: Variability analysis in memristors based on electrodeposited prussian blue
Authors: L. B. Avila, A. Cantudo, M.A. Villena, D. Maldonado, F. Abreu Araujo, C. K. Müller, J. B. Roldán
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the variability and reliability of the resistive switching (RS) behavior in Prussian Blue (a mixed-valence iron(III/II) hexacyanoferrate compound) thin films, used as the active layer. These films are fabricated through a simple and scalable electrochemical process, and exhibit robust bipolar resistive switching, making them suitable both for neuromorphic computing applications and hardware cryptography. A detailed statistical evaluation was conducted over 100 consecutive switching cycles using multiple parameter extraction techniques to assess cycle-to-cycle (C2C) variability in key RS parameters, including set/reset voltages and corresponding currents. One and two-dimensional coefficients of variation (1DCV and 2DCV) were calculated to quantify variability and identify application potential. Results demonstrate moderate variability compatible with neuromorphic computing and cryptographic functionalities, including physical unclonable functions and true random number generation. These findings position Prussian Blue-based memristors as promising candidates for low-cost, stable, and multifunctional memory.

Title: Thermal transport mapping in twisted double bilayer graphene
Authors: Jean Spièce, Roop Kumar Mech, Alessandra Canetta, Rebeca Ribeiro-Palau, Oleg Kolosov, Pascal Gehring
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant interest due to their tunable physical properties when stacked into heterostructures. Twisting adjacent layers introduces moire patterns that strongly influence the material's electronic and thermal behavior. In twisted graphene systems, the twist angle critically alters phonon transport, leading to reduced thermal conductivity compared to Bernal-stacked configurations. However, experimental investigations into thermal transport in twisted structures remain limited. Here, we study the local thermal properties of twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) using Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM). We find a reduction in thermal resistance of 0.3 +/- 0.1 x 10^6 K W^-1 compared to untwisted bilayers, attributed to changes in both intrinsic thermal conductivity and the tip-sample interface. These results, supported by analytical modeling, provide new insight into thermal transport mechanisms in twisted 2D systems and offer a pathway toward thermal engineering in twistronic devices.

Title: Nanoindentation simulations for copper and tungsten with adaptive-precision potentials
Authors: David Immel, Matous Mrovec, Ralf Drautz, Godehard Sutmann
Abstract: We perform nanoindentation simulations for both the prototypical face-centered cubic metal copper and the body-centered cubic metal tungsten with a new adaptive-precision description of interaction potentials including different accuracy and computational costs: We combine both a computationally efficient embedded atom method (EAM) potential and a precise but computationally less efficient machine learning potential based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) into an adaptive-precision (AP) potential tailored for the nanoindentation. The numerically expensive ACE potential is employed selectively only in regions of the computational cell where large accuracy is required. The comparison with pure EAM and pure ACE simulations shows that for Cu, all potentials yield similar dislocation morphologies under the indenter with only small quantitative differences. In contrast, markedly different plasticity mechanisms are observed for W in simulations performed with the central-force EAM potential compared to results obtained using the ACE potential which is able to describe accurately the angular character of bonding in W due to its half-filled d-band. All ACE-specific mechanisms are reproduced in the AP nanoindentation simulations, however, with a significant speedup of 20-30 times compared to the pure ACE simulations. Hence, the AP potential overcomes the performance gap between the precise ACE and the fast EAM potential by combining the advantages of both potentials.

Title: Tricritical Kibble-Zurek Scaling in Rydberg Atom Ladders
Authors: Hanteng Wang, Xingyu Li, Chengshu Li
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism is being actively explored on quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we study the KZ scaling around tricritical phase transition points, with Rydberg atom ladders as a concrete incarnation. The criticality is of Ising and Potts type for two- and three-leg ladders, respectively. When slowly ramping across or near the tricritical point from the disordered phase to the ordered phase, we obtain universal power-law scaling in agreement with conventional KZ predictions. We study a "tangential" KZ ramping that both begins and ends in the disordered phase, a novel protocol enabled by the two-dimensional phase diagram. The tangential KZ directly reveals subleading critical exponents of the critical point. Finally, we explore the regime of intermediate-speed ramping and find a dynamical analog of the celebrated Zamolodchikov's c-theorem. Practically, our work provides an immediately relevant protocol for current experiments to pinpoint the elusive tricritical points. More broadly, tangential and intermediate-speed rampings go beyond the conventional KZ paradigm and introduce new insights into critical quantum dynamics.

Title: Ultrafast Laser Induces Macroscopic Symmetry-Breaking of Diamond Color Centers
Authors: Yang Gao, Qi-Zheng Ji, Chao-Bo Liu, Qi Xiao, Chao Lian
Abstract: We employ real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) to investigate the electron-phonon-spin correlated dynamics in negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV$^{-}$) and construct a comprehensive dynamical picture. Laser excitation promotes minority-spin electrons within 100~fs, establishing a three-fold rotation symmetry breaking (3RSB) charge ordering. Subsequently, ionic motion on the potential energy surface of the excited electrons generates two distinct dynamical modes: (1) symmetric oscillations of carbon-nitrogen bonds and (2) dynamic Jahn-Teller distortions (DJT) with 3RSB. These distortions induce nonlocal coherent phonons in the diamond lattice, which propagate with 3RSB at the sound velocity ($\sim$2~Å/fs). Furthermore, the NV$^{-}$ spin state remains preserved during photoexcitation but undergoes rapid reorientation within 100~fs via enhanced spin-orbit-phonon coupling. Our RT-TDDFT simulations provide direct time-resolved visualization of these processes, offering novel insights into the microscopic interplay of electrons, phonons, and spins in NV$^{-}$ centers. These results advance the fundamental understanding of dynamical mechanisms in solid-state quantum systems, with implications for optimizing NV$^{-}$-based quantum sensing technologies.

Title: Competing Magnetic States in the Candidate Altermagnet GdAlGe
Authors: Oleg E. Parfenov, Dmitry V. Averyanov, Ivan S. Sokolov, Alexey N. Mihalyuk, Ivan A. Yakovlev, Oleg A. Kondratev, Alexander N. Taldenkov, Andrey M. Tokmachev, Vyacheslav G. Storchak
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a newly discovered magnetic order, combines zero net magnetization with non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic bands. Its ability to utilize the advantages of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets is highly promising for spintronic applications. Currently, the merge of altermagnetism and weak ferromagnetism in a single material excites significant interest as it provides additional control mechanisms over material properties. However, the role of dimensionality in this interplay is yet to be explored. Here, we study magnetism and electron transport in epitaxial films of the candidate altermagnet GdAlGe ranging from bulklike to a single monolayer. The films exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and negative magnetoresistance. In contrast to altermagnetic GdAlSi, the candidate altermagnet GdAlGe demonstrates an admixture of the ferromagnetic state which contribution increases as the system approaches the 2D limit. The coexistence of the magnetic states induces technologically important intrinsic exchange bias. The present work underpins future studies and applications of nanoscale altermagnets.

Title: Phase transitions from linear to nonlinear information processing in neural networks
Authors: Masaya Matsumura, Taiki Haga
Abstract: We investigate a phase transition from linear to nonlinear information processing in echo state networks, a widely used framework in reservoir computing. The network consists of randomly connected recurrent nodes perturbed by a noise and the output is obtained through linear regression on the network states. By varying the standard deviation of the input weights, we systematically control the nonlinearity of the network. For small input standard deviations, the network operates in an approximately linear regime, resulting in limited information processing capacity. However, beyond a critical threshold, the capacity increases rapidly, and this increase becomes sharper as the network size grows. Our results indicate the presence of a discontinuous transition in the limit of infinitely many nodes. This transition is fundamentally different from the conventional order-to-chaos transition in neural networks, which typically leads to a loss of long-term predictability and a decline in the information processing capacity. Furthermore, we establish a scaling law relating the critical nonlinearity to the noise intensity, which implies that the critical nonlinearity vanishes in the absence of noise.

Title: Energy Dissipation in Cyclic Strain of Amorphous Solids
Authors: Itamar Procaccia, Tuhin Samanta
Abstract: The study of the response of amorphous materials to oscillatory strain is traditionally performed with many repeated cycles. We argue that it pays to consider carefully just one cycle (and may be a second), to reveal the rich physics that characterizes cyclic strain. The response can be conservative or dissipative, with a sharp transition between these options as a function of preparation parameters, accompanied by symmetry breaking and the onset of screening. We choose an example for which the mesoscopic theory can be solved exactly, and the microscopic physics can be revealed by numerical simulations. The mechanism of energy dissipation (when it exists) is explored in detail, shedding light on the reason why repeated cycles exhibit ever decreasing dissipation per cycle, which is often consistent with a universal law.

Title: Renormalization group analysis of a continuous model with self-organized criticality: Effects of randomly moving environment
Authors: N.V. Antonov, P.I. Kakin, N.M. Lebedev, A.Yu. Luchin
Abstract: We study a strongly anisotropic self-organized critical system coupled to an isotropic random fluid environment. The former is described by a continuous (coarse-grained) model due to Hwa and Kardar. The latter is modeled by the Navier--Stokes equation with a random stirring force of a rather general form that includes, in particular, the overall shaking of the system and a non-local part with power-law spectrum $\sim k^{4-d-y}$ that describes, in the limiting case $y \to 4$, a turbulent fluid. The full problem of the two coupled stochastic equations is represented as a field theoretic model which is shown to be multiplicatively renormalizable and logarithmic at $d=4$. Due to the interplay between isotropic and anisotropic interactions, the corresponding renormalization group (RG) equations reveal a rich pattern of possible infrared (large scales, long times) regimes of asymptotic behaviour of various Green's functions. The attractors of the RG equations in the five-dimensional space of coupling parameters include a two-dimensional surface of Gaussian (free) fixed points, a single fixed point that corresponds to the plain advection by the turbulent fluid (the Hwa--Kardar self-interaction is irrelevant) and a one-dimensional curve of fixed points that corresponds to the case where the Hwa--Kardar nonlinearity and the uniform stirring are simultaneously relevant. The character of attractiveness is determined by the exponent $y$ and the dimension of space $d$; the most interesting case $d=3$ and $y \to 4$ is described by the single fixed point. The corresponding critical dimensions of the frequency and the basic fields are found exactly.

Title: Imaging the Acceptor Wave Function Anisotropy in Silicon
Authors: Manuel Siegl, Julian Zanon, Joseph Sink, Adonai Rodrigues da Cruz, Holly Hedgeland, Neil J. Curson, Michael E. Flatté, Steven R. Schofield
Abstract: We present the first scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of hydrogenic acceptor wave functions in silicon. These acceptor states appear as square ring-like features in STM images and originate from near-surface defects introduced by high-energy bismuth implantation into a silicon (001) wafer. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy confirms the formation of a p-type surface. Effective-mass and tight-binding calculations provide an excellent description of the observed square ring-like features, confirming their acceptor character and attributing their symmetry to the light- and heavy-hole band degeneracy in silicon. Detailed understanding of the energetic and spatial properties of acceptor wave functions in silicon is essential for engineering large-scale acceptor-based quantum devices.

Title: Disorder-Driven Exceptional Points and Concurrent Topological Phase Transitions in Non-Hermitian Lattice
Authors: Xiaoyu Cheng, Tiantao Qu, Yaqing Yang, Lei Zhang, Jun Chen
Abstract: Exceptional point (EP) and topological phase transition (TPT) in non-Hermitian systems have recently garnered significant attention owing to their fundamental importance and potential applications in sensing and topological devices. Beyond the EP induced by non-reciprocal hopping, we show that random disorder can also drive the valence and conduction bands across EPs, even twice in the non-Hermitian regime. Remarkably, a TPT can occur concurrently with an EP as disorder strength increases. These disorder-driven EPs and concurrent TPTs are well captured by effective medium theory. The analysis reveals that their emergence results from the interplay between disorder-induced energy level renormalization and non-reciprocal hopping-induced inter-level coupling, which fundamentally restructures the spectral properties of the system. The phase diagram in the parameter space of non-reciprocal hopping and disorder strength identifies robust EP lines. Interestingly, two EP lines can emerge from the TPT point in the Hermitian limit. As non-reciprocal hopping increases, these lines split, with one aligning the TPT, leading to distinct disorder-induced EPs. Our results uncover a robust, disorder-driven mechanism for generating EPs and concurrent TPTs, offering a new direction for exploring non-Hermitian topological matter.

Title: Anomalous Temperature Dependence of Quantum-Geometric Superfluid Weight
Authors: Yuma Hirobe, Taisei Kitamura, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: The symmetry of Cooper pairs encodes key information about superconductivity and has been widely studied through the temperature dependence of the superfluid weight. However, in systems dominated by quantum geometry, conventional theories miss its essential properties. We study the temperature dependence of the quantum-geometric superfluid weight and classify the relationship to the superconducting symmetry and band structures. The obtained power laws are different from conventional behavior, and unconventional superconductivity in twisted multilayer graphene is discussed. Our findings provide insights into the superconducting symmetry and the pairing mechanism via quantum geometry.

Title: Electronic and optical and topological properties of defects in bismuthene
Authors: Gabriel Elyas Gama Araujo, Andreia Luisa da Rosa, Alexandre Cavalheiro Dias, Thomas Frauenheim
Abstract: In this work we use first principles density-functional theory and Bethe-Salpeter equation together with tight-binding based maximally localized wannier functions (MLWF-TB) to investigate the electronic, optical and topological properties of two-dimensional bismuth (bismuthene) containing vacancy defects. We demonstrate that these properties depends on the shape and size of the nanopores. Furthermore, \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations shows that all pores are thermally stable at room temperature. Finally, adsorption of gas phase small molecules indicates that these pores can serve as sensors, opening the path for further applications in gas separation and sensing.

Title: Quantifying dissipation in flocking dynamics: When tracking internal states matter
Authors: Karel Proesmans, Gianmaria Falasco, Atul Tanaji Mohite, Massimiliano Esposito, Étienne Fodor
Abstract: Aligning self-propelled particles undergo a nonequilibrium flocking transition from apolar to polar phases as their interactions become stronger. We propose a thermodynamically consistent lattice model, in which the internal state of the particles biases their diffusion, to capture such a transition. Changes of internal states and jumps between lattice sites obey local detailed balance with respect to the same interaction energy. We unveil a crossover between two regimes: for weak interactions, the dissipation is maximal, and partial inference (namely, based on discarding the dynamics of internal states) leads to a severe underestimation; for strong interactions, the dissipation is reduced, and partial inference captures most of the dissipation. Finally, we reveal that the macroscopic dissipation, evaluated at the hydrodynamic level, coincides with the microscopic dissipation upon coarse-graining. We argue that this correspondence stems from a generic mapping of active lattice models with local detailed balance into a specific class of non-ideal reaction-diffusion systems.

Title: Entropy production rate in thermodynamically consistent flocks
Authors: Tal Agranov, Robert L. Jack, Michael E. Cates, Étienne Fodor
Abstract: We study the entropy production rate (EPR) of aligning self-propelled particles which undergo a flocking transition towards a polarized collective motion. In our thermodynamically consistent lattice model, individual self-propulsion is the exclusive source of irreversibility. We derive the fluctuating hydrodynamics for large system sizes using a controlled coarse-graining: our procedure entails an exact correspondence between the EPR evaluated at the hydrodynamic and particle-based levels. We reveal that EPR is maximal when the system adopts a homogeneous configuration, either apolar or polar, and reduced in the non-homogeneous state where a polar band travels in a apolar background due to strong spatial EPR modulations. By analyzing the latter we also show that asymmetric energetic exchanges occur at the trailing and leading edges, which we map into a thermodynamic cycle in density-polarization space. Finally, we demonstrate that the regime of weak self-propulsion features a singular scaling of EPR, and a non-analyticity of the travelling band profiles.

Title: Lattice thermal conductivity of 16 elemental metals from molecular dynamics simulations with a unified neuroevolution potential
Authors: Shuo Cao, Ao Wang, Zheyong Fan, Hua Bao, Ping Qian, Ye Su, Yu Yan
Abstract: Metals play a crucial role in heat management in electronic devices, such as integrated circuits, making it vital to understand heat transport in elementary metals and alloys. In this work, we systematically study phonon thermal transport in 16 metals using the efficient homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (HNEMD) method and the recently developed unified neuroevolution potential version 1 (UNEP-v1) for 16 metals and their alloys. We compare our results with existing ones based on the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) approach and find that our HNEMD results align well with BTE results obtained by considering phonon-phonon scattering only. By contrast, HNEMD results based on the conventional embedded-atom method potential show less satisfactory agreement with BTE ones. Given the high accuracy of the UNEP-v1 model demonstrated in various metal alloys, we anticipate that the HNEMD method combined with the UNEP-v1 model will be a promising tool for exploring phonon thermal transport properties in complex systems such as high-entropy alloys.

Title: Quantum Kinetic Uncertainty Relations in Mesoscopic Conductors at Strong Coupling
Authors: Gianmichele Blasi, Ricard Ravell Rodríguez, Mykhailo Moskalets, Rosa López, Géraldine Haack
Abstract: Kinetic Uncertainty Relations (KURs) establish quantum transport precision limits by linking signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the system's dynamical activity, valid in the weak-coupling regime where particle-like transport dominates. At strong coupling, quantum coherence challenges the validity of KURs and questions the meaning of the concept of activity itself. Here, we introduce a generalized dynamical activity valid at arbitrary coupling and derive a steady-state quantum KUR (QKUR) expressed in terms of this generalized activity. Explicit expressions are obtained within Green's function and Landauer-Büttiker formalisms. This QKUR ensures that uncertainty relations are valid across all coupling strengths, offering a general framework for out-of-equilibrium quantum transport precision analysis. We illustrate these concepts for paradigmatic quantum-coherent mesoscopic devices: a single quantum channel pinched by a quantum point contact and open single- and double-quantum dot systems.

Title: Ab initio study of strain-driven vacancy clustering in aluminum
Authors: Sayan Bhowmik, Abhiraj Sharma, Andrew J. Medford, John E. Pask, Phanish Suryanarayana
Abstract: We present a first principles investigation of vacancy clustering in aluminum. Specifically, we perform Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations to study the influence of hydrostatic strains on clustering in tri-, quad-, and heptavacancies. We find that compressive strains are a key driving force for vacancy aggregation, particularly on the experimentally observed (111) plane. Notably, we find that the heptavacancy forms a prismatic dislocation loop on the (111) plane for hydrostatic compressive strains exceeding 5%, highlighting the critical role of such strains in prismatic dislocation loop nucleation in aluminum.

Title: A Family of Aperiodic Tilings with Tunable Quantum Geometric Tensor
Authors: Hector Roche Carrasco, Justin Schirmann, Aurelien Mordret, Adolfo G. Grushin
Abstract: The strict geometric rules that define aperiodic tilings lead to the unique spectral and transport properties of quasicrystals, but also limit our ability to design them. In this work, we explore the first continuously tunable family of two-dimensional aperiodic tilings in which the underlying real-space geometry becomes a control knob of the wave-function's quantum geometric tensor. The real-space geometry can be used to tune into topological phases occupying an expanded phase space compared to crystals, or into a disorder-driven topological Anderson insulator. The quantum metric can also be tuned continuously, opening new routes towards tunable single- and many-body physics in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems.

Title: Emergent High-Entropy Phases in Geometrically Frustrated Pyrochlore Magnets
Authors: Prakash Timsina, Andres Chappa, Deema Alyones, Igor Vasiliev, Ludi Miao
Abstract: Frustrated magnets provide a platform for exploring exotic phases beyond conventional ordering, with potential relevance to functional materials and information technologies. In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to map the thermodynamic phase diagram of pyrochlore iridates R2Ir2O7 (R = Dy, Ho) with three stable magnetic ground-state stable phases: frustrated spin-ice 2 in 2 out (2I2O) phase, frustrated fragmented 3 in 1 out/1 in 3 out (3I1O/1I3O) phase, and antiferromagnetic all in all out (AIAO) phase without frustration. We discovered two additional emergent metastable phases at finite temperatures, located between the boundaries separating those stable phases. These metastable phases exhibit high magnetic susceptibility and high entropy without long-range order. Their stabilization arises from entropic minimization of the free energy, where the entropy dominates energetic competition near phase boundaries at finite temperatures. Our results demonstrate a platform to engineer highly susceptible and degenerated states through frustration and thermal activation, offering a foundation for entropy-based design of metastable phases in correlated systems.

Title: Heterogeneous diffusion in an harmonic potential: the role of the interpretation
Authors: Adrian Pacheco-Pozo, Igor M. Sokolov, Ralf Metzler, Diego Krapf
Abstract: Diffusion in heterogeneous energy and diffusivity landscapes is widespread in biological systems. However, solving the Langevin equation in such environments introduces ambiguity due to the interpretation parameter $\alpha$, which depends on the underlying physics and can take values in the range $0<\alpha<1$. The typical interpretations are Itô ($\alpha=0$), Stratonovich ($\alpha=1/2$), and Hänggi-Klimontovich ($\alpha=1$). Here, we analyse the motion of a particle in an harmonic potential -- modelled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process -- with diffusivity that varies in space. Our focus is on two-phase systems with a discontinuity in environmental properties at $x=0$. We derive the probability density of the particle position for the process, and consider two paradigmatic situations. In the first one, the damping coefficient remains constant, and fluctuation-dissipation relations are not satisfied. In the second one, these relations are enforced, leading to a position-dependent damping coefficient. In both cases, we provide solutions as a function of the interpretation parameter $\alpha$, with particular attention to the Itô, Stratonovich, and Hänggi-Klimontovich interpretations, revealing fundamentally different behaviours, in particular with respect to an interface located at the potential minimum.

Title: Reflection phase shifts of bouncing Bogoliubov waves
Authors: Carsten Henkel
Abstract: The Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations are solved for an inhomogeneous condensate in the vicinity of a turning point, addressing the full continuous spectrum. A basis change in the space of the two Bogoliubov "particle" and "hole" amplitudes is introduced that decouples them approximately. We find a spatially extended mode that governs mainly excitations in the condensate phase, while another mode is localised to regions with density gradients. An analytical and numerical discussion of the phase shift is provided that incident matter waves suffer upon reflection at the turning point, forming standing waves. As an application, we compute eigenfrequencies in a gravitational trap, without recourse to the local density approximation. The non-condensate density at finite temperature and its quantum depletion are discussed in a companion paper.

Title: Optical signatures of bulk g-wave altermagnetism in MnTe
Authors: Luca Haag, Marius Weber, Kai Leckron, Libor Šmejkal, Jairo Sinova, Hans Christian Schneider
Abstract: In planar altermagnets, optical excitation by linearly polarized ultrashort pulses can induce spin polarizations in the electronic excited states in a controlled fashion, even though the material is magnetically compensated. Here, we theoretically analyze the response of the prototypical bulk g-wave altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe to polarized ultrashort pulses. By calculating the excited electron distributions based on ab-initio band structure data, we show how this excited electronic spin response in $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits different symmetries which are determined by the nodal planes intrinsic to the bulk g-wave altermagnet. We present a simple procedure to obtain the symmetry of the electronic spin response from the two-dimensional cuts through the three-dimensional band structure.

Abstract: Trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ has been recently found to exhibit superconductivity in its high-pressure phase, similar to the previously discovered bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but with a notably lower transition temperature. To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.

Title: Variational quantum simulation of a nonadditive relaxation dynamics in a qubit coupled to a finite-temperature bath
Authors: Lucas Q. Galvão, Clebson Cruz, Antonio Cesar do Prado Rosa Junior, Marcelo A. Moret
Abstract: In this paper, we present an application of the variational quantum simulation (VQS) framework to capture finite-temperature open-system dynamics on near-term quantum hardware. By embedding the generalized amplitude-damping channel into the VQS algorithm, we modeled the energy exchange with a thermal bath through its Lindblad representation and thereby simulated realistic dissipative effects. To explore a wide range of activation behaviors, we introduce a nonadditive relaxation-time model using a generalized form of the Arrhenius law, based on the phenomenological parameter q. We compare our method on a driven qubit subject to both static and composite time-dependent fields, comparing population evolution and trace distance errors against exact solutions. Our results demonstrate that (i) VQS accurately maps the effective nonunitary generator under generalized amplitude damping, (ii) smoother drive envelopes induced by nonaddtive parameters suppress high frequency components and yield lower simulation errors, and (iii) the variational manifold exhibits dynamical selectivity, maintaining mapping fidelity even as the exact solution's sensitivity to q increases.

Title: Understanding the Capabilities of Molecular Graph Neural Networks in Materials Science Through Multimodal Learning and Physical Context Encoding
Authors: Can Polat, Hasan Kurban, Erchin Serpedin, Mustafa Kurban
Abstract: Molecular graph neural networks (GNNs) often focus exclusively on XYZ-based geometric representations and thus overlook valuable chemical context available in public databases like PubChem. This work introduces a multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptors, such as IUPAC names, molecular formulas, physicochemical properties, and synonyms, alongside molecular graphs. A gated fusion mechanism balances geometric and textual features, allowing models to exploit complementary information. Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that adding textual data yields notable improvements for certain electronic properties, while gains remain limited for others. Furthermore, the GNN architectures display similar performance patterns (improving and deteriorating on analogous targets), suggesting they learn comparable representations rather than distinctly different physical insights.

Title: Poincaré on Gibbs and on Probability in Statistical Mechanics
Authors: Bruce D. Popp
Abstract: This paper reviews a paper from 1906 by J. Henri Poincaré on statistical mechanics with a background in his earlier work and notable connections to J. Willard Gibbs. Poincaré's paper presents important ideas that are still relevant for understanding the need for probability in statistical mechanics. Poincaré understands the foundations of statistical mechanics as a many-body problem in analytical mechanics (reflecting his 1890 monograph on The Three-Body Problem and the Equations of Dynamics) and possibly influenced by Gibbs independent development published in chapters in his 1902 book, Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics. This dynamical systems approach of Poincaré and Gibbs provides great flexibility including applications to many systems besides gasses. This foundation benefits from close connections to Poincaré's earlier work. Notably, Poincaré had shown (e.g. in his study of non-linear oscillators) that Hamiltonian dynamical systems display sensitivity to initial conditions separating stable and unstable trajectories. In the first context it precludes proving the stability of orbits in the solar system, here it compels the use of ensembles of systems for which the probability is ontic and frequentist and does not have an a priori value. Poincaré's key concepts relating to uncertain initial conditions, and fine- and coarse-grained entropy are presented for the readers' consideration. Poincaré and Gibbs clearly both wanted to say something about irreversibility, but came up short.

Title: Neural Thermodynamics I: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning
Authors: Liu Ziyin, Yizhou Xu, Isaac Chuang
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, explaining and understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.

Title: New Collective Modes in Weyl Superconductors
Authors: Mehran Z-Abyaneh
Abstract: Using the doubled representation of Dirac spinors, we write the Lagrangian of a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor in a covariant form . Then, based on an analogy with the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model and by employing the Fierz transformations, we demonstrate that new collective modes should exist in such a system, including a pseudo-scalar Nambu-Goldstone boson and its corresponding amplitude mode plus a vector and an axial-vector collective mode. It is also observed that the pseudo-scalar mode can become massive due to an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term in the Lagrangian.

Title: From Quantum Indistinguishability to Classical Distinguishability: Statistics and Measurement of Two-Particle Distributions
Authors: Won-Young Hwang, Kicheon Kang
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to probe the quantum statistics of two identical particles. The transition between the quantum and classical statistics of two identical particles is described by the particles having identical multiple internal energy levels. We show that effective distinguishability emerges as the thermal energy increases with respect to the energy level spacing, and the mesoscopic regime bridges quantum indistinguishability and classical distinguishability. A realistic experimental approach is proposed using a two-particle interferometer, where the particles reach statistical equilibrium before the two-particle distribution is measured. The unitarity of the scattering/separation process ensures the preservation of the equilibrium distribution and allows a direct measurement of the two-particle statistical distribution. Our results show the transition between quantum and classical behavior of the two-particle distribution, which can be directly probed by a realistic experiment.

Title: Josephson Junctions in the Age of Quantum Discovery
Authors: Hyunseong Kim, Gyunghyun Jang, Seungwon Jin, Dongbin Shin, Hyeon-Jin Shin, Jie Luo, Irfan Siddiqi, Yosep Kim, Hoon Hahn Yoon, Long B. Nguyen
Abstract: The unique combination of energy conservation and nonlinear behavior exhibited by Josephson junctions has driven transformative advances in modern quantum technologies based on superconducting circuits. These superconducting devices underpin essential developments across quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communication and open pathways to innovative applications in nonreciprocal electronics. These developments are enabled by recent breakthroughs in nanofabrication and characterization methodologies, substantially enhancing device performance and scalability. The resulting innovations reshape our understanding of quantum systems and enable practical applications. This perspective explores the foundational role of Josephson junctions research in propelling quantum technologies forward. We underscore the critical importance of synergistic progress in material science, device characterization, and nanofabrication to catalyze the next wave of breakthroughs and accelerate the transition from fundamental discoveries to industrial-scale quantum utilities. Drawing parallels with the transformative impact of transistor-based integrated circuits during the Information Age, we envision Josephson junction-based circuits as central to driving a similar revolution in the emerging Quantum Age.

Title: Discrete Time Crystals in the spin-s Central Spin Model
Authors: Hillol Biswas, Sayan Choudhury
Abstract: We propose periodic driving protocols to realize discrete time crystals (DTCs) in a spin-s central spin model. Interestingly, we identify parameter regimes, where eternal period-doubling and higher-order(HO)-DTCs can be realized, even for finite-sized systems. We have determined the dependence of the DTC order on the number of satellite spins and the central spin value, s. Intriguingly, we find that certain classes of HO-DTCs produce a series of maximally entangled Bell cat and super-cat states during their dynamical evolution. Finally, we demonstrate that the HO-DTCs can be employed for quantum-enhanced multiparameter sensing at the Heisenberg limit.

Title: Implicit bias produces neural scaling laws in learning curves, from perceptrons to deep networks
Authors: Francesco D'Amico, Dario Bocchi, Matteo Negri
Abstract: Scaling laws in deep learning - empirical power-law relationships linking model performance to resource growth - have emerged as simple yet striking regularities across architectures, datasets, and tasks. These laws are particularly impactful in guiding the design of state-of-the-art models, since they quantify the benefits of increasing data or model size, and hint at the foundations of interpretability in machine learning. However, most studies focus on asymptotic behavior at the end of training or on the optimal training time given the model size. In this work, we uncover a richer picture by analyzing the entire training dynamics through the lens of spectral complexity norms. We identify two novel dynamical scaling laws that govern how performance evolves during training. These laws together recover the well-known test error scaling at convergence, offering a mechanistic explanation of generalization emergence. Our findings are consistent across CNNs, ResNets, and Vision Transformers trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Furthermore, we provide analytical support using a solvable model: a single-layer perceptron trained with binary cross-entropy. In this setting, we show that the growth of spectral complexity driven by the implicit bias mirrors the generalization behavior observed at fixed norm, allowing us to connect the performance dynamics to classical learning rules in the perceptron.

Title: Accelerating Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design via Local Radial Basis Functions: Application to Soft Material Characterization
Authors: Tianyi Chu, Jonathan B. Estrada, Spencer H. Bryngelson
Abstract: We develop a computational approach that significantly improves the efficiency of Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) using local radial basis functions (RBFs). The presented RBF--BOED method uses the intrinsic ability of RBFs to handle scattered parameter points, a property that aligns naturally with the probabilistic sampling inherent in Bayesian methods. By constructing accurate deterministic surrogates from local neighborhood information, the method enables high-order approximations with reduced computational overhead. As a result, computing the expected information gain (EIG) requires evaluating only a small uniformly sampled subset of prior parameter values, greatly reducing the number of expensive forward-model simulations needed. For demonstration, we apply RBF--BOED to optimize a laser-induced cavitation (LIC) experimental setup, where forward simulations follow from inertial microcavitation rheometry (IMR) and characterize the viscoelastic properties of hydrogels. Two experimental design scenarios, single- and multi-constitutive-model problems, are explored. Results show that EIG estimates can be obtained at just 8% of the full computational cost in a five-model problem within a two-dimensional design space. This advance offers a scalable path toward optimal experimental design in soft and biological materials.

Title: Mixed Quantum-Classical Methods for Polaron Spectral Functions
Authors: Haimi Nguyen, Arkajit Mandal, Ankit Mahajan, David R. Reichman
Abstract: In this work, using two distinct semiclassical approaches, namely the mean-field Ehrenfest (MFE) method and the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH), we investigate the spectral function of a single charge interacting with phonons on a lattice. This quantity is relevant for the description of angle-resolved photoemission experiments. Focusing on the one-dimensional Holstein model, we compare the performance of these approaches across a range of coupling strengths and lattice sizes, exposing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. We demonstrate that these approaches can be efficiently applied with reasonable accuracy to ab initio polaron models. Our work provides a route to the calculation of spectral properties in realistic electron-phonon-coupled systems in a computationally inexpensive manner with encouraging accuracy.

Title: The Enduring Relevance of Semiempirical Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Jonathan E. Moussa
Abstract: The development of semiempirical models to simplify quantum mechanical descriptions of atomistic systems is a practice that started soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics and continues to the present day. There are now many methods for atomistic simulation with many software implementations and many users, on a scale large enough to be considered as a software market. Semiempirical models occupied a large share of this market in its early days, but the research activity in atomistic simulation has steadily polarized over the last three decades towards general-purpose but expensive ab initio quantum mechanics methods and fast but special-purpose molecular mechanics methods. I offer perspective on recent trends in atomistic simulation from the middle ground of semiempirical modeling, to learn from its past success and consider its possible paths to future growth. In particular, there is a lot of ongoing research activity in combining semiempirical quantum mechanics with machine learning models and some unrealized possibilities of tighter integration between ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanics with more flexible theoretical frameworks and more modular software components.

Title: Wannier Functions Dually Localized in Space and Energy
Authors: Aaron Mahler, Jacob Z. Williams, Neil Qiang Su, Weitao Yang
Abstract: The construction of Wannier functions from Bloch orbitals offers a unitary freedom that can be exploited to yield Wannier functions with advantageous properties. Minimizing the spatial variance is a well-known choice; another, previously proposed for Wannier functions constructed from the occupied Bloch manifold, minimizes a weighted sum of spatial and energy variance. Departing from all previous work, we extend dual localization to include both valence and conduction bands together. Near the Fermi energy, these dually localized Wannier functions yield frontier (bonding and antibonding) orbitals in bulk silicon and molecular ethylene, as well as $d$-orbital character in metallic copper. Because they are both localized and retain information about the orbital energy spectrum, dually localized Wannier functions are well suited to orbital-dependent methods that associate Wannier functions with specific energy ranges. They naturally induce fractional occupations, allowing for corrections to the DFA total energy.

Title: Unveiling the spontaneous conversion of layered MAX phases to 2D MXenes
Authors: Tao Hu, Shihao Zhu, Zhaojin Li, Da Li, Hongyang Liu, Chao Zhang, Xiaohui Wang
Abstract: Topochemically transforming layered non-van der Waals solid into two dimensional (2D) materials involves selective etching reactions with atomic precision. The element-specific, structure-sensitive etching at nanoscale urgently requires in-depth understanding. Here, by means of density functional theory calculations and a laboratory-made operando reaction monitoring platform, the mechanism of instantaneous transforming MAX phase into MXenes is unraveled. The overall etching kinetics exhibits a sigmoidal curve, following self-accelerating reaction character with a small activation energy of ca. 60 kJ/mol. Interestingly, this activation energy corresponds to the Al transport through Ti3C2 slits. Therefore the reaction of Al with hydrofluoric acid solution in the confined interlayer space is recognized as the rate-determining step. Last but not the least, we found that the match of A element and etchants to form stable products is critical for the etching reaction, and reaction energy derived from the thermodynamics provides an easy yet effective descriptor for screening efficient etchants.

Title: Ergodicity Breaking and Scaling Relations for Finite-Time First-Order Phase Transition
Authors: Yu-Xin Wu, Jin-Fu Chen, H. T. Quan
Abstract: Hysteresis and metastable states are typical features associated with ergodicity breaking in the first-order phase transition. We explore the scaling relations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics in finite-time first-order phase transitions. Using the Curie-Weiss model as an example, for large systems we find the excess work scales as $v^{2/3}$ when the magnetic field is quenched at a finite rate $v$ across the phase transition. We further reveal a crossover in the scaling of the excess work from $v^{2/3}$ to $v$ when downsizing the system. Our study elucidates the interplay between the finite-time dynamics and the finite-size effect, which leads to different scaling behaviors of the excess work with or without ergodicity breaking.

Title: Strong non-linear response of strange metals
Authors: Serhii Kryhin, Subir Sachdev, Pavel A. Volkov
Abstract: We show that nonlinear transport responses in strange metals are strong, larger by a factor of $E_F/T$ than in Fermi liquids. Within the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of a Fermi surface with a spatially random coupling to a critical scalar, the third order conductivity is found to diverge as $1/T$ at low $T$, indicating the existence of a voltage-temperature scaling regime in the conductance. Its frequency and orientation dependence contains information on relaxation times of heat and electron distribution deformations, providing a new set of tools to characterize strange metals.

Title: Boundary geometry controls a topological defect transition that determines lumen nucleation in embryonic development
Authors: Pamela C. Guruciaga, Takafumi Ichikawa, Steffen Plunder, Takashi Hiiragi, Anna Erzberger
Abstract: Topological defects determine the collective properties of anisotropic materials. How their configurations are controlled is not well understood however, especially in 3D. In living matter moreover, 2D defects have been linked to biological functions, but the role of 3D polar defects is unclear. Combining computational and experimental approaches, we investigate how confinement geometry controls surface-aligned polar fluids, and what biological role 3D polar defects play in tissues interacting with extracellular boundaries. We discover a charge-preserving transition between 3D defect configurations driven by boundary geometry and independent of material parameters, and show that defect positions predict the locations where fluid-filled lumina -- structures essential for development -- form within the confined polar tissue of the mouse embryo. Experimentally perturbing embryo shape beyond the transition point, we moreover create additional lumina at predicted defect locations. Our work reveals how boundary geometry controls polar defects, and how embryos use this mechanism for shape-dependent lumen formation. We expect this defect control principle to apply broadly to systems with orientational order.

Title: Large Thermopower with Sign-Alternating Quantum Oscillations in Insulating Monolayer WTe2

Abstract: The detection of Landau-level-like energy structures near the chemical potential of an insulator is essential to the search for a class of correlated electronic matter hosting charge-neutral fermions and Fermi surfaces, a long-proposed concept that remains elusive experimentally. Here we introduce and demonstrate that the magneto-thermoelectric response of a quantum insulator can reveal critical information not available via other approaches. We report the observation of large Seebeck response together with quantum oscillations (QOs) in the hole-doped insulating state of monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) in magnetic fields. The measured low temperature magneto-thermopower exceeds k_B/e by more than an order of magnitude, where k_B is the Boltzmann constant and e the elementary charge. This large thermopower is a characteristic of an insulating state, consistent with high resistivity. However, as the magnetic field is swept, QOs develop in the thermopower, which remarkably undergoes sign-changes that mimic the quantum characteristic of metals due to Landau quantization. The sign-change in the thermoelectric response directly implies the presence of a field-induced Landau-level-like structure at the chemical potential of the insulator. Neither the large thermopower nor the sign-changes can be induced by the metallic gate nearby. Our results demonstrate a new dilemma for investigating low energy excitations in correlated materials featuring mixed quantum characteristics of metals and insulators.

Title: On the Mathematical Foundation of a Decoupled Directional Distortional Hardening Model for Metal Plasticity in the Framework of Rational Thermodynamics
Authors: Md Mahmudur Rahman, Md Mahmudul Hasan Pathik, Nazrul Islam
Abstract: This study proposes a modification to the yield condition that addresses the mathematical constraints inherent in the Directional Distortional Hardening models developed by Feigenbaum and Dafalias. The modified model resolves both the mathematical inconsistency found in the complete model and the limitations of the r-model. In the complete model, inconsistency arises between the distortional term in the yield surface and the plastic part of the free energy in the absence of kinematic hardening. Additionally, the r-model fails to capture the flattening of the yield surface in the reverse loading direction due to the absence of a fourth-order anisotropic tensor structure in the distortional term. To address these issues, the proposed model introduces a decoupled distortional hardening term in the yield function. This modification enables the simultaneous representation of both flattening and sharpening of the yield surface, and permits isotropic hardening with distortion even without kinematic hardening. A consistent mathematical formulation based on rational mechanics and a corresponding numerical algorithm are also developed, establishing a foundation for future experimental investigations and model validation.

Abstract: This paper explores the potential for spin-triplet superconductivity in molecular beam epitaxy grown PbTe/SnTe semiconductor heterostructures. We present convincing evidence for spin-triplet pairing by soft point-contact spectroscopy experiments, using both spin-polarized and unpolarized electrons and additionally, by detailed analysis of the upper critical field, as inferred from the four probe resistance measurements. The experimental data are described in terms of the Anderson-Brinkman-Morel model of p-wave electron pairing. Our results confirm the predictions on strain-induced topological superconductivity by this http URL and L. Fu (Nature Physics, 10, 964, 2014).

Title: Intertwined superconductivity and orbital selectivity in a three-orbital Hubbard model for the iron pnictides
Authors: Vito Marino, Alberto Scazzola, Federico Becca, Massimo Capone, Luca F. Tocchio
Abstract: We study a three-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori model relevant for iron-based superconductors using variational wave functions explicitly including spatial correlations and electron pairing. We span the nonmagnetic sector from filling $n=4$, which is representative of undoped iron-based superconductors, to $n=3$, where a Mott insulating state with each orbital at half filling is found. In the strong-coupling regime, when the electron density is increased, we find a spontaneous differentiation between the occupation of $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, leading to an orbital-selective state with a nematic character that becomes stronger at increasing density. One of these orbitals stays half-filled for all densities while the other one hosts (together with the $d_{xy}$ orbital) the excess of electron density. Most importantly, in this regime long-range pairing correlations appear in the orbital with the largest occupation. Our results highlight a strong link between orbital-selective correlations, nematicity, and superconductivity, which requires the presence of a significant Hund's coupling.

Title: Single-Ion Spectroscopy of h-BN Point Defect Fluorescence in Liquid Environments
Authors: Yecun Wu, Kun Xu, Hori Pada Sarker, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Frank Abild-Pedersen, Arun Majumdar, Yi Cui, Yan-Kai Tzeng, Steven Chu
Abstract: Understanding the chemical state of individual ions in solutions is crucial for advancing knowledge of complex chemical systems. However, analyzing systems at the single-ion level in liquid environments remains a significant challenge. We present a strategy that leverages the optical emission properties of point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as sensitive ion detectors. The interaction of optically active h-BN defects with ions in solution leads to distinct spectral shifts, enabling precise visualization and analyzing of individual ions. Using Li+ ions in organic electrolytes as a model, we observed spectral shifts exceeding 10 nm upon ion addition. Application of an external electric field further enhanced these shifts to over 40 nm, enabling real-time monitoring of electrical field induced local perturbations of Li+ ions. Following this approach, we showed that each individual single point defect can be used to spectroscopically distinguish ions of varying charges (e.g., Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+) based on their local electric fields, each producing a distinct spectral shift. This platform allows direct visualization of ions and their chemical states in liquid environments, providing insights into subtle interfacial changes at the single-ion level, with measurable spectral shifts detectable at millisecond temporal resolution and at concentrations down to the millimolar range. This capability presents potential applications in various fields involving ions in liquids that include battery technology and environmental science.

Title: The mechanism of electrical conduction in glassy semiconductors
Authors: Arkady Kurnosov, Vassiliy Lubchenko
Abstract: We argue that the dominant charge carrier in glassy semiconducting alloys is a compound particle in the form of an electron or hole bound to an intimate pair of topological lattice defects; the particle is similar to the polaron solution of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian. The spatial component of the density of states for these special polarons is determined by the length scale of spatial modulation of electronegativity caused by a separate set of standalone topological defects. The latter length scale is fixed by the cooperativity size for structural relaxation; the size is largely independent of temperature in the glass but above melting, it decreases with temperature. Thus we predict that the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity should exhibit a jump in the slope near the glass transition; the size of the jump is predicted to increase with the fragility of the melt. The predicted values of the jump and of the conductivity itself are consistent with experiment.

Title: Active nematic pumps
Authors: Ignasi Vélez-Ceron, Rodrigo C.V. Coelho, Pau Guillamat, Marc Vergés-Vilarrubia, Margarida Telo da Gama, Francesc Sagués, Jordi Ignés-Mullol
Abstract: Microfluidics involves the manipulation of flows at the microscale, typically requiring external power sources to generate pressure gradients. Alternatively, harnessing flows from active fluids, which are usually chaotic, has been proposed as a paradigm for the development of micro-machines. Here, by combining experimental realizations and simulations, we demonstrate that the addition of triangular-shaped inclusions into an active nematic gel can locally break the fore-aft symmetry of active turbulence and stabilize flow fields with self-pumping capabilities. The proposed strategy has enabled us to generate wall-free and self-powered microfluidic systems capable of both cargo transport and mixing along with the downstream flow. We analyze the performance of these active pumps, both isolated and within cooperative ensembles in terms of their output velocity and hydrostatic pressure buildup. Finally, we demonstrate strategies to incorporate them into specifically designed microfluidic platforms to advantageously tailor the geometry of active flows. Our results reveal new possibilities for leveraging the self-organized mechanodynamics of active fluids.

Title: Characterization of higher-order topological superconductors using Bott indices
Authors: Xun-Jiang Luo, Jia-Zheng Li, Meng Xiao, Fengcheng Wu
Abstract: The abundance of bulk and boundary topologies in higher-order topological phases offer remarkable tunability and diversity to boundary states but also pose a challenge to their unified topological characterization. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to characterize time-reversal invariant topological superconductors hosting Majorana Kramers pairs (MKP) of corner states by using a series of spin Bott indices, which capture both bulk and boundary states topology. The developed invariants can characterize MKP in arbitrarily shaped systems and all distinct spatial distribution patterns of MKP. As an illustrative example, we apply our theory to analyze the Kane-Mele model with sublattice-dependent superconducting pairing potentials. In this representative model, both intrinsic and extrinsic higher-order topological superconductors can be realized and various patterns of MKP can be engineered through edge cleavage. Despite their high sensitivity to boundary terminations, MKP can be faithfully characterized by the proposed topological this http URL further demonstrate the characterization of higher-order topological superconductors in the BDI symmetry class using Bott indices without resolving the spin degree of freedom.

Title: Method of images for one-dimensional discrete random walk under a reflecting barrier
Authors: Kazuhiko Seki
Abstract: The transition probability for a one-dimensional discrete symmetric random walk under a reflecting barrier was once given by the method of images. [S. Chandrasekhar, Rev. Mod. Phys. 15, 1 (1943).] However, several inconsistencies have been reported when the method of images is applied in cases where a reflecting barrier is considered, even after the exact solution has been obtained. Here, we explicitly show that the method of images becomes applicable if the image position is shifted.

Title: Bethe-ansatz diagonalization of steady state of boundary driven integrable spin chains
Authors: Vladislav Popkov, Xin Zhang, Carlo Presilla, Tomaz Prosen
Abstract: We find that the density operator of non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of XXZ spin chain with strong ``sink and source" boundary dissipation, can be described in terms of quasiparticles, with renormalized -- dissipatively dressed -- dispersion relation. The spectrum of the NESS is then fully accounted for by Bethe ansatz equations for an associated coherent system. The dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, which strongly modifies the NESS spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model. In particular, this leads to a dissipation-assisted entropy reduction, due to the suppression -- in the NESS spectrum -- of plain wave-type Bethe states in favor of Bethe states localized at the boundaries.

Title: Thermodynamic and energetic constraints on transition probabilities of small-scale quantum systems
Authors: Ludovico Tesser, Matteo Acciai, Christian Spånslätt, Inès Safi, Janine Splettstoesser
Abstract: We study the transition probabilities of a two-point measurement on a quantum system, initially prepared in a thermal state. We find two independent constraints on the difference between transition probabilities when the system is prepared at different temperatures, which both turn out to be particularly restrictive when the measured quantum system is small. These bounds take the form of a thermodynamic and of an energetic constraint, as they are associated with the dissipated heat and with the absorbed energy required to increase or to reduce the temperature of the system. The derived constraints apply to arbitrary system Hamiltonians, including interactions or non-linear energy spectra. We show the relevance of these constraints for the special case where transitions are induced by energy or particle exchange in weakly coupled bipartite systems out of equilibrium. This example is of interest for a wide range of experimentally relevant systems, from molecular junctions to coupled cavities, and can be tested by, for instance, measuring the out-of-equilibrium tunneling current and its noise.

Title: Intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene
Authors: Yang-Zhi Chou, Jihang Zhu, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We study the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, which has been discovered experimentally in Han $et$ $al$ arXiv:2408.15233. We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of \textit{Fermi surface nesting}, we show that superconductivity can emerge near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the $p+ip$, $h+ih$, and the nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in {a narrow stripe shape of superconducting region}, consistent with experimental findings. We point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation with a dominant $p+ip$ pairing. The possibility of realizing intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in other rhombohedral graphene systems is also discussed.

Title: Tracing Ion Migration in Halide Perovskites with Machine Learned Force Fields
Authors: Viren Tyagi, Mike Pols, Geert Brocks, Shuxia Tao
Abstract: Halide perovskite optoelectronic devices suffer from chemical degradation and current-voltage hysteresis induced by migration of highly mobile charged defects. Atomic scale molecular dynamics simulations can capture the motion of these ionic defects, but classical force fields are too inflexible to describe their dynamical charge states. Using CsPbI3 as a case study, we train machine learned force fields from density functional theory calculations and study the diffusion of charged halide interstitial and vacancy defects in bulk CsPbI3. We find that negative iodide interstitials and positive iodide vacancies, the most stable charge states for their respective defect type, migrate at similar rates at room temperature. Neutral interstitials are faster, but neutral vacancies are one order of magnitude slower. Oppositely charged interstitials and vacancies, as they can occur in device operation or reverse bias conditions, are significantly slower and can be considered relatively immobile.

Abstract: Resetting has been shown to reduce the completion time for a stochastic process, such as the first passage time for a diffusive searcher to find a target. The time between two consecutive resetting events is drawn from a waiting time distribution $\psi(t)$, which defines the resetting protocol. Previously, it has been shown that deterministic resetting process with a constant time period, referred to as sharp restart, can minimize the mean first passage time to a fixed target. Here we consider the more realistic problem of a target positioned at a random distance $R$ from the resetting site, selected from a given target distribution $P_T(R)$. We introduce the notion of a conjugate target distribution to a given waiting time distribution. The conjugate target distribution, $P_T^*(R)$, is that $P_T(R)$ for which $\psi(t)$ extremizes the mean time to locate the target. In the case of diffusion we derive an explicit expression for $P^*_T(R)$ conjugate to a given $\psi(t)$ which holds in arbitrary spatial dimension. Our results show that stochastic resetting prevails over sharp restart for target distributions with exponential or heavier tails.

Title: Systematic analysis of critical exponents in continuous dynamical phase transitions of weak noise theories
Authors: Timo Schorlepp, Ohad Shpielberg
Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions are nonequilibrium counterparts of thermodynamic phase transitions and share many similarities with their equilibrium analogs. In continuous phase transitions, critical exponents play a key role in characterizing the physics near criticality. This study aims to systematically analyze the set of possible critical exponents in weak noise statistical field theories in 1+1 dimensions, focusing on cases with a single fluctuating field. To achieve this, we develop and apply the Gaussian fluctuation method, avoiding reliance on constructing a Landau theory based on system symmetries. Our analysis reveals that the critical exponents can be categorized into a limited set of distinct cases, suggesting a constrained universality in weak noise-induced dynamical phase transitions. We illustrate our findings in two examples: short-time large deviations of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the weakly asymmetric exclusion process on a ring within the framework of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.

Title: Open questions for strongly interacting Fermi gases with zero-range interactions
Authors: Yvan Castin (LKB (Lhomond))
Abstract: We review some unresolved theoretical issues in three-dimensional two-component Fermi gases, drawing on recent experiments on cold atoms in immaterial traps close to a magnetic Feshbach resonance. We distinguish successively (i) the open questions arising in the few-body problem with Wigner-Bethe-Peierls contact interactions - essentially the stability of the gas with respect to the Efimov effect and the calculation of the cluster (or virial) coefficients, (ii) those arising in the effective low-energy theory of Landau and Khalatnikov quantum hydrodynamics - essentially the damping of phonon modes and the coherence time of the condensate of pairs, and finally (iii) questions requiring a complete, microscopic solution of the many-body problem, such as the specific properties of the acoustic excitation branch (Goldstone) of the condensate of pairs, or its collective excitation branch (Higgs) in the broken-pair continuum.

Title: Ordered states in AB bilayer graphene in SU(4)-symmetric model
Authors: A.V. Rozhkov, A.O. Sboychakov, A.L. Rakhmanov
Abstract: We apply SU(4)-symmetric model to examine possible ordered states in AB stacked bilayer graphene (AB-BLG). The Hamiltonian of the system possesses this symmetry under certain assumptions. In such a model the multicomponent order parameter can be presented as a $4\times4$ matrix $\hat{Q}$. Using a mean field approximation, we derive a self-consistency equation for $\hat{Q}$. Among possible solutions of the obtained equation there are anomalous quantum Hall states, spin, charge, spin-valley density waves, inter-layer excitonic phases and their combinations. We argue that the proposed approach is a useful tool for classification of the ordered states in AB-BLG. The ordered states of the SU(4)-symmetric model demonstrate extensive degeneracies. The degeneracies can be removed by taking into account the neglected non-SU(4)-symmetric terms, disorder, substrate, as well as other perturbations. The ordered states have varying sensitivity to these factors. This suggests that, for AB-BLG, a ground state ordering type is a non-universal property, susceptible to particulars of extrinsic conditions.

Title: Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings
Authors: Juan C. Petit, Saswati Ganguly, Matthias Sperl
Abstract: We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same distance from jamming density, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.

Title: Spin-dependent photovoltage in graphene/MoS2-based field-effect transistors

Abstract: It has recently been shown that Terahertz sensors can effectively detect the spin resonances of Dirac fermions in graphene. The associated photovoltaic measurement technique allows for the investigation of the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in graphene as well as its topological properties from microwave to Terahertz frequencies. In this work, using graphene/MoS2-based Field-Effect Transistors, we observed a magnetic resonance photovoltage signal in the Gigahertz range that is independent of the gate bias. The dispersion of the associated spin-flip transitions remains intriguingly unaffected by the MoS2 layer. In parallel, the spin-related signal consistently appears as a drop in photovoltage, regardless of the signal's polarity or origin, whether it arises from plasma wave rectification or thermoelectric effects. This behavior is interpreted as a decrease in the system's spin polarization due to spin-dependent recombination or scattering of photocarriers. Understanding the various photovoltaic signals in highly sensitive Gigahertz/Terahertz sensors paves the way for exploring spin-dependent mechanisms in two-dimensional quantum materials, influenced by proximity effects such as spin-orbit coupling, topology, and magnetism.

Title: Fermi surface and pseudogap in highly doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$

Abstract: The fate of the Fermi surface in bulk electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ remains elusive, as does the origin and extension of its pseudogap phase. Here, we use high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$IrO$_{4}$ up to $x=0.2$, a factor of two higher than in previous work. We find that the antinodal pseudogap persists up to the highest doping level, and thus beyond the sharp increase in Hall carrier density to $\simeq 1+x$ recently observed above $x^{*}=0.16$ [Y.-T. Hsu et al., Nature Physics 20, 1593 (2024)]. This suggests that doped iridates host a unique phase of matter in which a large Hall density coexists with an anisotropic pseudogap, breaking up the Fermi surface into disconnected arcs. The temperature boundary of the pseudogap is $T^{*}\simeq 200$ K for $x=0.2$, comparable to cuprates and to the energy scale of short range antiferromagnetic correlations in cuprates and iridates.

Title: Phase Diagram of the Easy-Axis Triangular-Lattice $J_1\!-\!J_2$ Model
Authors: Cesar A. Gallegos, Shengtao Jiang, Steven R. White, A. L. Chernyshev
Abstract: The phase diagram of the $S\!=\!1/2$ easy-axis triangular-lattice $J_1\!-\!J_2$ model is investigated using the density-matrix renormalization group and analytical insights. We find a significant spin-liquid region extending from the Heisenberg limit and residing between the Y phase-known as the magnetic analogue of the "supersolid"-and collinear stripe phase. The order parameters of the supersolid are analyzed and an understanding of its lack of ferromagnetic moment is suggested.

Title: Observation of Brownian Motion of a Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Xiao-Qiong Wang, Rui-Lang Zeng, Zi-Yao Zhang, Chushun Tian, Shizhong Zhang, Andreas Hemmerich, Zhi-Fang Xu
Abstract: We report on the experimental observation of classical Brownian motion in momentum space by a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of Rubidium atoms prepared in a hexagonal optical lattice. Upon suddenly increasing the effective atomic mass, the BEC as a whole behaves as a classical rigid body with its center-of-mass receiving random momentum kicks by a Langevin force arising from atom loss and interactions with the surrounding thermal cloud. Physically, this amounts to selective heating of the BEC center-of-mass degree of freedom by a sudden quench, while with regard to the relative coordinates, the BEC is stablized by repulsive atomic interactions, and its internal dynamics is suppressed by forced evaporative cooling induced by atom loss. A phenomenological theory is developed that well explains the experimental data quantitatively.

Title: Boundary anomaly detection in two-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological phases
Authors: Ke Ding, Hao-Ran Zhang, Bai-Ting Liu, Shuo Yang
Abstract: We generalize the topological response theory to detect the boundary anomalies of linear subsystem symmetries. This approach allows us to distinguish different subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases and uncover new ones. We focus on the cases where the mixed anomaly exists within the adjacent subsystems. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the power of this method by identifying strong and weak $Z_2^\tau\times Z_2^\sigma$ SSPT phases in a tunable tensor network state. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic $Z_2$ SSPT phase characterized by its degenerate entanglement spectrum. Furthermore, we extend the anomaly indicator to mixed-state density matrices and show that quantum anomalies of subsystem symmetry can persist under both uniform and alternating disorders. This finding establishes a connection between boundary quantum anomalies in pure and mixed states. Our work provides a numerical method to detect quantum anomalies of subsystem symmetries, offering new insights into the study of topological quantum phases.

Title: Heat Transport in Ionic Liquids
Authors: Cillian Cockrell, Aleksandra Dragović
Abstract: Heat transfer in liquids is a very challenging problem as it combines the competing effect of high frequency oscillations, which dominate liquid heat capacity, and diffusive motion, which enables transport macroscopic flow. This issue is compounded by the relatively junior state of dynamical theories of liquid thermodynamics. Nevertheless, molten salts are playing an increasingly important role in industrial and energy applications and there is a pressing need to understand the mechanisms behind their irreversible transport processes. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the heat transport of three different molten salts: LiCl, KCl, and the eutectic point of their mixture. While all simulations consider the properties of the liquid within the frame of its centre of mass, we calculate different susceptibilities which implicitly include and explicitly exclude the heat carried by partial mass currents within this frame. We find that, while the heat advected by partial mass currents in the mixture increases with increasing temperature, the heat transferred by collective vibrational motion (phonons) decreases with increasing temperature. This causes a maximum in the heat conductance with temperature in the mixtures only - in pure salts each contribution decreases monotonically with temperature. We attribute this anomaly to the extra freedom afforded to ionic motion in mixtures - in pure salts the motion of cations and anions is bound due to conservation of linear momentum. In mixtures, a coherent but diffusive collective motion is enabled by the release of Li ions from this condition by the introduction of a third species. We tentatively ascribe this coherent collective motion to the ``diffusive" phonons that have been used to explain a similar anomaly in the thermal conductivity of solids.

Title: First-principles theory of nonlinear long-range electron-phonon interaction
Authors: Matthew Houtput, Luigi Ranalli, Carla Verdi, Serghei Klimin, Stefano Ragni, Cesare Franchini, Jacques Tempere
Abstract: Describing electron-phonon interactions in a solid requires knowledge of the electron-phonon matrix elements in the Hamiltonian. State-of-the-art first-principles calculations for the electron-phonon interaction are limited to the 1-electron-1-phonon matrix element, which is suitable for harmonic materials. However, there is no first-principles theory for 1-electron-2-phonon interactions, which occur in anharmonic materials with significant electron-phonon interaction such as halide perovskites and quantum paraelectrics. Here, we derive an analytical expression for the long-range part of the 1-electron-2-phonon matrix element, written in terms of microscopic quantities that can be calculated from first principles. We show that the long-range 1-electron-2-phonon interaction is described by the derivative of the phonon dynamical matrix with respect to an external electric field. We calculate the quasiparticle energy of a large polaron including 1-electron-2-phonon interaction, and show that it can be written in terms of a 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function $\mathcal{T}_{\alpha \beta}(\omega)$. We demonstrate how to calculate this spectral function and its temperature dependence for the benchmark materials LiF and KTaO$_3$, where it turns out that the effect is very small. The first-principles framework developed in this article is general, paving the way for future calculations of 1-electron-2-phonon interactions in materials where the effect may be larger.

Title: Exponential suppression of the topological gap in self-consistent intrinsic Majorana nanowires
Authors: Francisco Lobo, Elsa Prada, Pablo San-Jose
Abstract: Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave gap is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeema field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.

Title: Dynamical quantum typicality: Simple method for investigating transport properties applied to the Holstein model
Authors: Petar Mitrić
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of the Holstein model using the numerically exact quantum typicality (QT) approach. Roughly speaking, QT exploits the fact that even a single, randomly chosen pure state can effectively represent the full statistical ensemble in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. This allows us to compute frequency-dependent mobilities, representative of the thermodynamic limit, that are well-converged with respect to all numerical parameters. Our results are compared against other numerically exact methods, and used to analyze the contribution of vertex corrections to frequency-dependent mobility. The promising accuracy and efficiency of the QT approach suggest its applicability to a broader class of Hamiltonians.

Title: Trypanosoma brucei moving in microchannels and through constrictions
Authors: Zihan Tan, Julian I. U. Peters, Holger Stark
Abstract: Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a single-celled parasite and natural microswimmer, is responsible for fatal sleeping sickness in infected mammals, including humans. Understanding how T. brucei interacts with fluid environments and navigates through confining spaces is crucial not only for medical and clinical applications but also for a fundamental understanding of how life organizes in a confined microscopic world. Using a hybrid multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD)--molecular dynamics (MD) approach, we present our investigations on the locomotion of an in silico T. brucei in three types of fluid environments: bulk fluid, straight cylindrical microchannels, and microchannels with constrictions. We observe that the helical swimming trajectory of the in silico T. brucei becomes rectified in straight cylindrical channels compared to bulk fluid. The swimming speed for different channel widths is governed by the diameter of the helical trajectory. The speed first slightly increases as the channel narrows and then decreases when the helix diameter is compressed. An optimal swimming speed is achieved, when the channel width is approximately twice the bulk helix diameter. It results from an interplay of the trypanosome's hydrodynamic interactions with the cylindrical channel walls and the high deformability of the parasite. In microchannels with constrictions, the motions of the anterior and posterior ends, the end-to-end distance, and the log-rolling motion of the cell body are characterized and show salient differences compared to the straight-channel case. Depending on the constriction length and width, we observe characteristic slip, stuck, and stuck-slip motions of the model T. brucei within the constriction. Our findings may provide some mechanical insights into how T. brucei moves through blood vessels and tissues, and across the blood-brain barrier.

Title: Systematic Construction of Interfaces and Anomalous Boundaries for Fermionic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases
Authors: Kevin Loo, Qing-Rui Wang
Abstract: We use the pullback trivialization technique to systematically construct gapped interfaces and anomalous boundaries for fermionic symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) states by extending their symmetry group $G_f = \mathbb{Z}_2^f \times_{\omega_2} G$ to larger groups. These FSPT states may involve decoration layers of both Majorana chains and complex fermions. We derive general consistency formulas explicitly for (2+1)D and (3+1)D systems, where nontrivial twists arise from fermionic symmetric local unitaries or "gauge transformations" that ensure coboundaries vanish at the cochain level. Additionally, we present explicit example for a (3+1)D FSPT of symmetry group $G_f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_4$ with Majorana chain decorations.

Title: Proof of absence of local conserved quantities in two- and higher-dimensional quantum Ising models
Authors: Yuuya Chiba
Abstract: We prove that the Ising models with transverse and longitudinal fields on the hypercubic lattices with dimensions higher than one have no local conserved quantities other than the Hamiltonian. This holds for any value of the longitudinal field, including zero, as far as the transverse field and the Ising interactions are nonzero. The conserved quantity considered here is ``local'' in a very weak sense: it can be written as a linear combination of operators whose side lengths of the supports in one direction do not exceed half the system size, while the side lengths in the other directions are arbitrary. We also prove that the above result holds even in the ladder system. Our results extend the recently developed technique of the proof of absence of local conserved quantities in one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions and to the ladder.

Title: Effective Lagrangian for the macroscopic motion of Weyl fermions in $^3$He-A
Authors: M. Selch, M. A. Zubkov
Abstract: We consider macroscopic motion of $^3$He-A in global thermodynamic equilibrium within the context of the Zubarev statistical operator method. We formulate the corresponding effective theory in the language of the functional integral. The effective Lagrangian comprising macroscopic motion of fermionic excitations is calculated explicitly for the emergent relativistic fermions of the superfluid $^3$He-A-phase in the non-trivial bosonic background due to a space and time dependent matrix-valued vierbein featuring nonzero torsion as well as the Nieh-Yan anomaly. The matrix-valued vierbein formulation comprises an additional two dimensional internal spin space which may be replaced by one featuring a fermionic theory with a real valued vierbein, two Abelian gauge fields and a spin connection mixing the Dirac and internal spin spaces. As an application of the developed theory we consider macroscopic rotation around the axis of the pure integer mass vortices. The corresponding thermodynamical quantities of the normal component are analysed.

Title: Giant Nonvolatile Multistate Resistance with Fully Magnetically Controlled van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions
Authors: Zhi Yan, Xujin Zhang, Jianhua Xiao, Cheng Fang, Xiaohong Xu
Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching in electrically controlled van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) causes atomic migration, compromising device stability and fatigue resistance. Here we propose a fully magnetically controlled vdW-MFTJ based on a \(\mathrm{CrBr_3/MnPSe_3/CrBr_3}\) vertical heterostructure, which achieves ferroelectric polarization reversal without relying on atomic migration driven by inversion symmetry breaking. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.

Title: Elliptical stability of hopfions in bulk helimagnets
Authors: Konstantin L. Metlov
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional topological solitons with non-zero Hopf index ${\cal H}$ in the vector field of material's local magnetization. In this Letter elliptical stability of hopfions with ${\cal H}=1$ in a classical helimagnet is studied on the basis of a variational model. It is shown that, depending on their internal structure (vortex and antivortex tubes ordering), the hopfions can either be stable in a bulk magnet or unstable with respect to elongation along their central axis. It is found that the energy of stable hopfions is always below the energy of the $2\pi$-skyrmion lattice in the same material, suggesting the possibility to use $2\pi$-skyrmions as a precursor for hopfion nucleation. Stability diagram for hopfions on the magnetic anisotropy-field phase diagram is computed numerically. Explicit analytical expressions for some of its critical lines are derived.

Title: Simulations of Three-dimensional Nematic Guidance of Microswimmers
Authors: Zeyang Mou, Yuan Li, Zhihong You, Rui Zhang
Abstract: It has been shown that an anisotropic liquid crystalline (LC) environment can be used to guide the self-propulsion dynamics of dispersed microswimmers, such as bacteria. This type of composite system is named "living nematic" (LN). In the dilute limit, bacteria are found to mainly follow the local director field. Beyond the dilute limit, however, they exhibit novel dynamical behaviors, from swirling around a spiral +1 defect pattern to forming undulating waves, and to active turbulence. Our current knowledge of how these different behaviors emerge at different population densities remains limited. Here we develop a hybrid method to simulate the dynamics of microswimmers dispersed in a nematic LC. Specifically, we model the microswimmers using active Brownian dynamics method, which is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of nematic LCs to describe the evolution of the flow field and the LC structure. Our method is validated by comparing to existing quasi-two-dimensional (2D) experiments, including undulated swirling around a spiral pattern and stabilized undulated jets on a periodic C-pattern. We further extend our method to three-dimensional (3D) systems by examining loop-defect dynamics. We find that the morphodynamics and destiny of a loop defect not only depend on the activity (self-propulsion velocity), effective size, and the initial distribution of the swimmers, but also rely on its winding profile. Specifically, +1/2 wedge and radial twist winding can dictate the dynamics of loop defects. By varying the characteristic reversal time, we predict that microswimmers not necessarily accumulate in splay regions. Taken together, our hybrid method provides a faithful tool to explain and guide the experiments of LNs in both 2D and 3D, sheds light on the interplay between microswimmer distribution and defect dynamics, and unravels the design principles of using LCs to control active matter.

Title: Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices
Authors: Ling-Na Wu, Xikun Li, Nathan Goldman, Botao Wang
Abstract: Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.

Title: Orientation-dependent transport in junctions formed by $d$-wave altermagnets and $d$-wave superconductors
Authors: Wenjun Zhao, Yuri Fukaya, Pablo Burset, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Bo Lu
Abstract: We investigate de Gennes-Saint-James states and Josephson effect in hybrid junctions based on $d$-wave altermagnet and $d$-wave superconductor. Even though these states are associated to long junctions, we find that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-altermagnet in a normal metal/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor junction forms de Gennes-Saint-James states in a short junction due to an enhanced mismatch between electron and hole wave vectors. As a result, the zero-bias conductance peak vanishes and pronounced resonance spikes emerge in the subgap conductance spectra. By contrast, the $d_{xy}$-altermagnet only features de Gennes-Saint-James states in the long junction. Moreover, the well-known features such as V-shape conductance for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairings and zero-biased conductance peak for $d_{xy}$ pairings are not affected by the strength of $d_{xy}$-altermagnetism in the short junction. We also study the Josephson current-phase relation $I(\varphi)$ of $d$-wave superconductor/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrids, where $\varphi$ is the macroscopic phase difference between two $d$-wave superconductors. In symmetric junctions, we obtain anomalous current phase relation such as a $0$-$\pi$ transition by changing either the orientation or the magnitude of the altermagnetic order parameter and dominant higher Josephson harmonics. Interestingly, we find the first-order Josephson coupling in an asymmetric $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-superconductor/altermagnet/$d_{xy}$-superconductor junction when the symmetry of altermagnetic order parameter is neither $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- nor $d_{xy}$-wave. We present the symmetry analysis and conclude that the anomalous orientation-dependent current-phase relations are ascribed to the peculiar feature of the altermagnetic spin-splitting field.

Title: Ab initio modeling of nonequilibrium dynamics in superconducting detectors and qubits
Authors: Alejandro Simon, Reed Foster, Mihir Sahoo, James Shi, Emma Batson, Francesca Incalza, Matteo Castellani, Owen Medeiros, Christoph Heil, Karl K. Berggren
Abstract: Nonequilibrium quasiparticle (QP) and phonon dynamics are central to the operation of superconducting devices. Superconducting detectors, such as the superconducting nanowire single-photon detector, perform best when a large QP population is generated in response to small perturbations. Conversely, for superconducting qubits and topologically protected Majorana fermions, even relatively small QP densities can lead to significant performance degradation, and thus, ideal materials are less susceptible to QP poisoning. However, existing models of these devices lack a rigorous description of the QP and phonon dynamics, relying on approximations and phenomenology. In this article, we combine kinetic equations with density functional theory to model the nonequilibrium dynamics of a superconducting film ab initio. To demonstrate the universality of our model, we illustrate two examples: (1) we develop a model for the detection of single photons in superconducting nanowires, and (2) we calculate the energy-relaxation rate of a transmon qubit due to the presence of excess QPs. Our examples demonstrate from first principles that NbN is well-suited for single-photon detection and that Ta transmon qubits possess reduced sensitivity to QP poisoning relative to other materials, which is likely in part responsible for their longer coherence times. In contrast to previous models, our ab initio approach makes these predictions without experimental input and thus can be used to accelerate progress in device development. Moreover, by considering the full-bandwidth electron-phonon coupling, our approach can incorporate strong-coupling effects. Our methods effectively integrate ab initio materials modeling with nonequilibrium theory of superconductivity to perform practical modeling of superconducting devices, providing a comprehensive approach that connects fundamental theory with device applications.

Title: Dimer problem on a spherical surface
Authors: A. Tononi, D. S. Petrov, M. Lewenstein
Abstract: We solve the problem of a dimer moving on a spherical surface and find that its binding energy and wave function are sensitive to the total angular momentum. The dimer gets squeezed in the direction orthogonal to the center-of-mass motion and can qualitatively change its geometry from two-dimensional to one-dimensional. These results suggest that combining the curved geometry with finite angular momentum may give rise to qualitatively new many-body phenomena in ultracold shell-shaped gases.

Title: Filtering Spin and Orbital Moment in Centrosymmetric Systems
Authors: Luciano Jacopo DOnofrio, Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Wojciech Brzezicki, Adam Klosinski, Federico Mazzola, Carmine Ortix, Mario Cuoco
Abstract: The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.

Title: High-pressure floating zone crystal growth of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$
Authors: S. J. Gomez Alvarado, Y. Pang, P. A. Barrera, D. Rout, C. Robison, Z. Porter, H. Z. Porter, E. A. Lawrence, E. N. Bassey, S. D. Wilson
Abstract: Here we demonstrate the floating zone crystal growth of the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Historically, the growth of iridates from a ternary melt has been precluded by the extreme vapor pressure of the metal oxide species and the difficulty of maintaining the correct oxidation state of Ir at high temperatures. Here, we show that the application of a high-pressure oxygen growth environment stabilizes the Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ phase, leading to the first demonstration of cm$^{3}$-scale crystals. In contrast to the conventional SrCl$_2$ flux growth method, where poor control over disorder leads to strong sample dependence, the high-pressure floating zone growth enables active control over the homogeneity of the melt. Crystals grown via this technique possess qualitatively similar properties to those grown via flux, with a relatively sharp onset of antiferromagnetic order observed in temperature-dependent magnetization. Further, we demonstrate that by tuning the mixing rate of the melt, we are able to grow natively hole-doped Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-y}$O$_4$, which exhibits a strongly modified magnetic and electronic response.

Title: Additional jamming transition in 2D bidisperse granular packings
Authors: Juan C. Petit, Matthias Sperl
Abstract: We present a jamming diagram for 2D bidisperse granular systems, capturing two distinct jamming transitions. The first occurs as large particles form a jammed structure, while the second, emerging at a critical small-particle concentration, $X_{\mathrm{S}}^{*} \approx 0.21$, and size ratio, $\delta^{*} \approx 0.25$, involves small particles jamming into the voids of the existing large-particle structure upon further compression. Below this threshold, small particles fill voids within the large-particle network, increasing packing density. Beyond this point, excess small particles disrupt efficient packing, resulting in looser structures. \jp{These results, consistent with previous 3D studies, demonstrate that the second transition occurs at a well-defined point in the $(X_{\mathrm{S}}, \delta)$ plane, independent of dimensionality, likely driven by the geometric saturation of available space around particles, void closure, and structural arrangement.

Title: Ancilla theory of twisted bilayer graphene I: topological Mott localization and pseudogap metal in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Jing-Yu Zhao, Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang
Abstract: The recent experimental studies of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) raise a fundamental question: how do we understand Mott localization in a topological band? In this work, we offer a new perspective of Mott physics, which can be generalized to TBG directly in momentum space. In our theory, the Mott gap is understood as from an exciton-like hybridization $\Phi(\mathbf k) c^\dagger(\mathbf k)\psi(\mathbf k)$ between the physical electron $c$ and an ancilla fermion $\psi$. In the conventional Mott insulator of trivial band, the hybridization is $s$-wave with $\Phi(\mathbf k)=\frac{U}{2}$, where $U$ is the on-site Hubbard interaction. On the other hand, the band topology in TBG enforces a topological Mott hybridization with $\Phi(\mathbf k)\sim k_x \pm i k_y$ in a small region around $\mathbf{k}=0$. We dub this new Mott state as topological Mott localization because of the $p\pm ip$ order parameter analogous to the topological superconductor. At $\nu=0$, we find a topological Mott semimetal with a low energy effective theory resembling that of the untwisted bilayer graphene. For $\nu=\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we show transitions from correlated insulators to Mott semimetals at smaller $U$. In the most intriguing density region $\nu=-2-x$, we propose a symmetric pseudogap metal at small $x$, which hosts a small Fermi surface and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. Interestingly, the quasiparticle is primarily formed by ancilla fermion, which we interpret as a composite fermion formed by a hole bound to a particle-hole pair. Our theory offers a unified language to describe the Mott localization in both trivial and topological bands in momentum space, and we anticipate applications in other moiré systems with topological Wannier obstruction, such as the twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayer.

Title: Machine-Learning Force Fields Reveal Shallow Electronic States on Dynamic Halide Perovskite Surfaces
Authors: Frederico P. Delgado, Frederico Simões, Leeor Kronik, Waldemar Kaiser, David A. Egger
Abstract: The spectacular performance of halide perovskites in optoelectronic devices is rooted in their tolerance to defects. Previous studies showed that defects in these materials generate shallow electronic states. However, how these shallow states persist amid the pronounced atomic dynamics on halide perovskite surfaces remains unknown. This work reveals that electronic states at surfaces of prototypical CsPbBr$_3$ are energetically distributed at room temperature akin to well-passivated inorganic semiconductors, even when covalent bonds remain cleaved and undercoordinated. Specifically, a striking tendency for shallow surface states is found with approximately 70% of surface-state energies appearing within 0.2 eV or ${\approx}8k_\text{B}T$ from the valence-band edge. While these findings do not rule out occurrence of deep traps per se, they show that even when surface states appear deeper in the gap, they are not energetically isolated and are less likely to act as traps. We achieve this result by accelerating first-principles calculations via machine learning and show that the unique atomic dynamics in these materials render the formation of deep electronic states at their surfaces unlikely. These findings reveal the microscopic mechanism behind the low density of deep states at dynamic halide perovskite surfaces, which is key to their device performance.

Title: Magnon damping and mode softening in quantum double-exchange ferromagnets
Authors: A. Moreo, E. Dagotto, G. Alvarez, T. Tohyama, M. Mierzejewski, J. Herbrych
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic excitations and electronic properties of fully quantum double-exchange ferromagnets, i.e., systems where ferromagnetic ordering emerges from the competition between spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom, but without the canonical approximation of using classical localized spins. Specifically, we investigate spin excitations within the Kondo lattice-like model, as well as a two-orbital Hubbard Hamiltonian in proximity to the orbital-selective Mott phase. Computational analysis of the magnon dispersion, damping, and spectral weight within these models reveals unexpected phenomena, such as magnon mode softening and the anomalous decoherence of magnetic excitations as observed in earlier experimental efforts, but explained here without the use of the phononic degrees of freedom. We show that these effects are intrinsically linked to incoherent spectral features near the Fermi level, which arise due to the quantum nature of the local (on-site) triplets. This incoherent spectrum leads to a Stoner-like continuum on which spin excitations scatter, governing magnon lifetime and strongly influencing the dynamical spin structure factor. Our study explores the transition from coherent to incoherent magnon spectra by varying the electron density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the localized spin mitigates decoherence by suppressing the incoherent spectral contributions near the Fermi level. We also discuss the effective $J_1$-$J_2$ spin Hamiltonian, which can accurately describe the large doping region characterized by the magnon-mode softening. Finally, we show that this behavior is also present in multiorbital models with partially filled orbitals, namely, in systems without localized spin moments, provided that the model is in a strong coupling regime.

Title: A Physics-Based Circuit Model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions
Authors: Steven Louis, Hannah Bradley, Artem Litvinenko, Vasyl Tyberkevych
Abstract: This work presents an equivalent circuit model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) that accurately captures their magnetization dynamics and electrical behavior. Implemented in LTspice, the model is validated against direct numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. It effectively simulates essential spintronic phenomena, including ferromagnetic resonance, field- and spin-torque-induced switching, and spin-torque-induced oscillations. Simulation results demonstrate strong agreement between LTspice and LLGS solutions, confirming the model accuracy and utility for efficient circuit-level analysis of spintronic devices. The ability to incorporate time-dependent magnetic fields and voltage inputs makes the proposed model suitable for diverse applications such as neuromorphic computing, microwave signal processing, and spintronic memory technologies. By providing a computationally efficient yet physically accurate circuit representation, this work enables seamless integration of MTJs into larger electronic systems, potentially accelerating the development of advanced spintronic circuit architectures.

Title: Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor artificial graphene
Authors: Gökhan Öztarhan, Paweł Potasz, A. D. Güçlü
Abstract: We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene with realistic Coulomb interaction using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the generalized Hubbard model. We analyze models of armchair hexagonal geometries nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling. This form of itinerant magnetism predicted rigorously for Hubbard model remained unascertained in large scale realistic systems. We demonstrate that Coulomb scattering terms play a crucial role in stabilizing Nagaoka ferromagnetism, enabling the observation of the phase transition for system parameters near $U/t \approx 60$.

Title: A silicon spin vacuum: isotopically enriched $^{28}$silicon-on-insulator and $^{28}$silicon from ultra-high fluence ion implantation
Authors: Shao Qi Lim, Brett C. Johnson, Sergey Rubanov, Nico Klingner, Bin Gong, Alexander M. Jakob, Danielle Holmes, David N. Jamieson, Jim S. Williams, Jeffrey C. McCallum
Abstract: Isotopically enriched silicon (Si) can greatly enhance qubit coherence times by minimizing naturally occurring $^{29}$Si which has a non-zero nuclear spin. Ultra-high fluence $^{28}$Si ion implantation of bulk natural Si substrates was recently demonstrated as an attractive technique to ultra-high $^{28}$Si isotopic purity. In this work, we apply this $^{28}$Si enrichment process to produce $^{28}$Si and $^{28}$Si-on-insulator (SOI) samples. Experimentally, we produced a $^{28}$Si sample on natural Si substrate with $^{29}$Si depleted to 7~ppm (limited by measurement noise floor), that is at least 100 nm thick. This is achieved with an ion energy that results in a sputter yield of less than one and an ultra-high ion fluence, as supported by our improved computational model that is based on fitting a large number of experiments. Further, our model predicts the $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si depletion in our sample to be less than 1~ppm. In the case of SOI, ion implantation conditions are found to be more stringent than those of bulk natural Si in terms of minimizing threading dislocations upon subsequent solid phase epitaxy annealing. Finally, we do not observe open volume defects in our $^{28}$SOI and $^{28}$Si samples after SPE annealing (620°C, 10 minutes).

Title: Identifying Instabilities with Quantum Geometry in Flat Band Systems
Authors: Jia-Xin Zhang, Wen O. Wang, Leon Balents, Lucile Savary
Abstract: The absence of a well-defined Fermi surface in flat-band systems challenges the conventional understanding of instabilities toward Landau order based on nesting. We investigate the existence of an intrinsic nesting structure encoded in the band geometry (i.e. the wavefunctions of the flat band(s)), which leads to a maximal susceptibility at the mean-field level and thus determines the instability towards ordered phases. More generally, we show that for a given band structure and observable, we can define two vector fields: one which corresponds to the Bloch vector of the projection operator onto the manifold of flat bands, and another which is "dressed" by the observable. The overlap between the two vector fields, possibly shifted by a momentum vector $\boldsymbol{Q}$, fully determines the mean field susceptibility of the corresponding order parameter. When the overlap is maximized, so is the susceptibility, and this geometrically corresponds to "perfect nesting" of the band structure. In that case, we show that the correlation length of this order parameter, even for $\boldsymbol{Q}\neq \boldsymbol{0}$, is entirely characterized by a generalized quantum metric in an intuitive manner, and is therefore lower-bounded in topologically non-trivial bands. As an example, we demonstrate hidden nesting for staggered antiferromagnetic spin order in an exactly flat-band model, which is notably different from the general intuition that flat bands are closely associated with ferromagnetism. We check the actual emergence of this long-range order using the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Additionally, we demonstrate that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like state (pairing with non-zero center of mass momentum) can arise in flat bands upon breaking time-reversal symmetry, even if Zeeman splitting is absent.

Title: Finite-$q$ antiferrotoroidal and ferritoroidal order in a distorted kagome structure
Authors: Akimitsu Kirikoshi, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: A highly geometrically frustrated lattice structure such as a distorted kagome (or quasikagome) structure enriches physical phenomena through coupling with the electronic structure, topology, and magnetism. Recently, it has been reported that an intermetallic HoAgGe exhibits two distinct magnetic structures with the finite magnetic vector $q=(1/3,1/3,0)$: One is the partially ordered state in the intermediate-temperature region, and the other is the kagome spin ice state in the lowest-temperature region. We theoretically elucidate that the former is characterized by antiferrotoroidal ordering, while the latter is characterized by ferritoroidal ordering based on the multipole representation theory, which provides an opposite interpretation to previous studies. We also show how antiferrotoroidal and ferritoroidal orderings are microscopically formed by quantifying the magnetic toroidal moment activated in a multiorbital system. As a result, we find that the degree of distortion for the kagome structure plays a significant role in determining the nature of antiferrotoroidal and ferritoroidal orderings, which brings about the crossover between the antiferro-type and the ferri-type distributions of the magnetic toroidal dipole. We confirm such a tendency by evaluating the linear magnetoelectric effect. Our analysis can be applied irrespective of lattice structures and magnetic vectors without annoying the cluster origin.

Title: Topological phases of coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires
Authors: Anas Abdelwahab
Abstract: The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. They reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires with strong wire-wire coupling away from the gapless regions.

Title: Discrete Time Crystal in quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
Authors: Aarya Bothra, Arti Garg
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTC) have emerged as a significant phase of matter for out-of-equilibrium many-body systems. We study how long-range interactions and disorder contribute to the stability of the DTC phase. Generally, a stable DTC phase is believed to be realized in disordered systems with short-range interactions. In this work, we study periodically driven quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model of Ising spin-glass in which all spins are randomly coupled. We investigate the possibilities of DTC phase in the SK model within three different driving protocols and found that the quantum SK model exhibits a robust DTC phase despite the long-range nature of interactions. The DTC phase in quantum SK model persists for a larger range of parameters if the $XY$ coupling or a transverse field is also random. This suggests that disorder in the $XY$ coupling or transverse field is also crucial for stabilising a broad DTC phase, despite the SK model's random couplings. Our analysis shows that the stability of the DTC phase is determined by the non-ergodic nature of the eigenstates of the quantum SK model, with the DTC order-parameter closely following the Shannon entropy of eigenstates. We compare the periodically driven SK model to alternative models of long-range interactions with uniform coefficients and found that the DTC phase is absent in these models for most of the driving protocols.

Title: Universal scaling law for quantum droplet formation
Authors: Ian G. Moss
Abstract: Given the right set of circumstances, ultracold quantum gases are able to change character and condense into a liquid state of quantum droplets. The size distribution of the droplets is determined dynamically in the condensation process. A semi-quantitative argument is presented which suggests that, at zero temperature, a multiple droplet system has is a preferred scale $\propto v^{-1/3}$, where $v$ is the rate of change of parameters at the time of droplet formation. Numerical simulations of two dimensional systems strongly support a power law $v^{-d}$, with an exponent $d\in(0.327,0.375)$.

Title: Accurate Prediction of Sequential Tensor Properties Using Equivariant Graph Neural Network
Authors: Ting-Wei Hsu, Zhenyao Fang, Arun Bansil, Qimin Yan
Abstract: Optical spectra serve as a powerful tool for probing the interactions between materials and light, unveiling complex electronic structures such as flat bands and nontrivial topological features. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of photonic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where understanding the electronic structure directly impacts device performance. Moreover, in anisotropic bulk materials, the optical responses are direction-dependent, and predicting those response tensors still remains computationally demanding due to its inherent complexity and the constraint from crystal symmetry. To address this challenge, we introduce the sequential tensorial properties equivariant neural network (StepENN), a graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full optical tensors across different photon frequencies. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components and anisotropic sequential tensor components into l=0 and l=2 spherical tensor components, StepENN ensures symmetry-aware sequential tensor predictions that are consistent with the inherent symmetry constraints of crystal systems. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors for 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed from first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 24.216 millifarads per meter (mF/m) on the predicted tensorial spectra with 85.7% of its predictions exhibiting less than 10% relative error, demonstrating its potential for deriving other spectrum-related properties, such as optical conductivity. This framework opens new avenues for the data-driven design of materials with engineered anisotropic optical responses, accelerating material advances in optoelectronic applications.

Title: Spontaneous Enhancement of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction via Field-Cooling-Induced Interface Engineering in 2D van der Waals Ferromagnetic ternary Tellurides
Authors: Shian Xia, Yan Luo, Iftikhar Ahmed Malik, Xinyi Zhou, Keying Han, Yue Sun, Haoyun Lin, Hanqing Shi, Yingchun Cheng, Vanessa Li Zhang, Yi Du, Sheng Liu, Chao Zhu, Ting Yu
Abstract: The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets has opened new avenues for exploring topological spin textures and their applications in next-generation spintronics. Among these materials, Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT) emerges as a model system due to its room-temperature skyrmion phases, which are stabilized by strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). However, the atomistic origins of DMI in centrosymmetric vdW lattices remain elusive. Here, we report a spontaneous DMI enhancement mechanism driven by FC in FGaT and its analog Fe3GeTe2 (FGeT). Combining Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we have observed the irreversible precipitation of FeTe2 in annealed FGaT. The resulting FeTe2/FGaT heterostructure is considered to break the symmetry and significantly enhance the DMI. Furthermore, similar phenomenon has been observed in the family ferromagnetic material FGeT as well. Additionally, the precipitation of FeTe2 varies significantly with different thicknesses of FGaT, aligning closely with the reported behavior of skyrmions. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms behind the origin of the DMI in ternary tellurides, paving the way for advanced spintronic applications.

Title: Plastic deformation as a phase transition: a combinatorial model of plastic flow in copper single crystals
Authors: Afonso D. M. Barroso, Elijah Borodin, Andrey P. Jivkov
Abstract: Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge and both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The phases represent arrangements of the plastic slip network with different combinations of collinear, coplanar, non-collinear and non-coplanar active slip systems. Furthermore, some of these phases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like activation of secondary slip systems, strain localisation and fracture or amorphisation. The first-order transitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the second-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field coupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other statistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental observations.

Title: Strain-Gradient and Curvature-Induced Changes in Domain Morphology of BaTiO3 Nanorods: Experimental and Theoretical Studies
Authors: Olha A. Kovalenko, Eugene A. Eliseev, Yuriy O. Zagorodniy, Srečo Davor Škapin, Marjeta Maček Kržmanc, Lesya Demchenko, Valentyn V. Laguta, Zdravko Kutnjak, Dean R. Evans, Anna N. Morozovska
Abstract: We investigate the impact of OH- ions incorporation on the lattice strain and spontaneous polarization of BaTiO3 nanorods synthesized under different conditions. It was confirmed that the lattice strain depends directly on Ba supersaturation, with higher supersaturation leading to an increase in the lattice strain. However, it was shown that crystal growth and observed lattice distortion are not primarily influenced by external strain; rather, OH- ions incorporation plays a key role in generating internal chemical strains and driving these processes. By using the less reactive TiO2 precursor instead of TiOCl2 and controlling Ba supersaturation, the slower nucleation rate enables more effective regulation of OH- ions incorporation and crystal growth. This in turn effects both particle size and lattice distortion, leading to c/a ratio of 1.013 - 1.014. The incorporation of OH- ions induces lattice elongation along the c-axis, contributing to anisotropic growth, increasing of the rod diameter and their growth-induced bending. However, the possibility of the curvature-induced changes in domain morphology of BaTiO3 nanorods remains almost unexplored. To study the possibility, we perform analytical calculations and finite element modeling, which provide insights into the curvature-induced changes in the strain-gradient, polarization distribution, and domain morphology in BaTiO3 nanorods. Theoretical results reveal the appearance of the domain stripes in BaTiO3 nanorod when the curvature exceeds a critical angle. The physical origin of the domain stripes emergence is the tendency to minimize its elastic energy of the nanorod by the domain splitting. These findings suggest that BaTiO3 nanorods, with curvature-controllable amount of domain stripes, could serve as flexible race-track memory elements for flexo-tronics and domain-wall electronics.

Title: Microscopic description of the liquid-gas coexistence curve for Morse fluids in the immediate vicinity of the critical point
Authors: I.V. Pylyuk, M.P. Kozlovskii, R.V. Romanik
Abstract: The present work is aimed at investigating the behavior of Morse fluids in the immediate vicinity of the critical point within the framework of a cell model. This region is of both fundamental and practical importance, yet presents analytical challenges due to the significant influence of order parameter fluctuations. An analytical procedure is developed to construct the upper part of the liquid-gas coexistence curve and calculate its diameter, incorporating the non-Gaussian (quartic) distribution of fluctuations. An explicit expression is derived for the temperature-dependent analytical term appearing in the expression for the rectilinear diameter. The numerical evaluation of the relevant quantities is carried out using Morse potential parameters representative of sodium. The coexistence curve is constructed both with and without the inclusion of the analytical temperature-dependent term in the calculation. A specific condition is identified under which the agreement between the presented binodal branches and Monte Carlo simulation data from other study, extrapolated to the immediate vicinity of the critical point, is improved. It is shown that better agreement is achieved when the analytical term is included in the calculation of the liquid branch and omitted in the gas branch. The proposed analytical approach may provide useful insight for the theoretical study of critical phenomena in more complex fluid systems.

Title: Hall effects in Carroll dynamics
Authors: L.Marsot, P.-M. Zhang, M. Chernodub, P.A. Horvathy
Abstract: ``Do Carroll particles move?'' The answer depends on the characteristics of the particle such as its mass, spin, electric charge, and magnetic moment. A massive Carroll particle (closely related to fractons) does not move; its immobility follows from Carroll boost symmetry which implies dipole conservation, but not conversely. A massless Carroll particle may propagate by following the Hall law, consistently with the partial breaking of the Carroll boost symmetry. The framework is extended to Carroll field theory. In $d=2$ space dimensions, the Carroll group has a two-fold central extension which allows us to generalize the dynamics to massive and massless particles, including anyons. The anyonic spin and magnetic moment combine with the doubly-extended structure parameterized by two Casimir invariants interpreted as intrinsic magnetization and non-commutativity parameter. The extended Carroll particle subjected to an electromagnetic background field moves following a generalized Hall law which includes a Zeeman force. This theory is illustrated by massless, uncharged anyons with doubly-centrally extended structure we call exotic photons, which move on the horizon of a Black Hole, giving rise to an anyonic spin-Hall Effect.

Title: Post-COVID Inflation & the Monetary Policy Dilemma: An Agent-Based Scenario Analysis
Authors: Max Sina Knicker, Karl Naumann-Woleske, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: The economic shocks that followed the COVID-19 pandemic have brought to light the difficulty, both for academics and policy makers, of describing and predicting the dynamics of inflation. This paper offers an alternative modelling approach. We study the 2020-2023 period within the well-studied Mark-0 Agent-Based Model, in which economic agents act and react according to plausible behavioural rules. We include a mechanism through which trust of economic agents in the Central Bank can de-anchor. We investigate the influence of regulatory policies on inflationary dynamics resulting from three exogenous shocks, calibrated on those that followed the COVID-19 pandemic: a production/consumption shock due to COVID-related lockdowns, a supply-chain shock, and an energy price shock exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By exploring the impact of these shocks under different assumptions about monetary policy efficacy and transmission channels, we review various explanations for the resurgence of inflation in the United States, including demand-pull, cost-push, and profit-driven factors. Our main results are four-fold: (i) without appropriate fiscal policy, the shocked economy can take years to recover, or even tip over into a deep recession; {(ii) the success of monetary policy in curbing inflation is primarily due to expectation anchoring, rather than to the direct economic impact of interest rate hikes; (iii) however, strong inflation anchoring is detrimental to consumption and unemployment, leading to a narrow window of ``optimal'' policy responses due to the trade-off between inflation and unemployment;} (iv) the two most sensitive model parameters are those describing wage and price indexation. The results of our study have implications for Central Bank decision-making, and offers an easy-to-use tool that may help anticipate the consequences of different monetary and fiscal policies.

Title: Generalized $α$-Observational Entropy
Authors: Shivam Sinha, Nripendra Majumbdar, S. Aravinda
Abstract: Traditional measures of entropy, like the Von Neumann entropy, while fundamental in quantum information theory, are insufficient when interpreted as thermodynamic entropy due to their invariance under unitary transformations, which contradicts observed entropy increases in isolated systems. Recognizing this limitations of existing measures for thermodynamic entropy, recent research has focused on observational entropy (OE) as a promising alternative, offering practical applicability and theoretical insights. In this work, we extend the scope of observational entropy by generalizing it to a parameterized version called $\alpha$-Observational entropy ($\alpha$-OE). $\alpha$-OE is expressed in terms of the Petz-Rényi relative entropy between the states on which a quantum-to-classical channel is applied. The $\alpha$-OE reduces to OE under $\alpha\rightarrow 1$. We prove various properties of the $\alpha$-OE, which are the generalization of the properties of OE, including the monotonically increasing of $\alpha$-OE as a function of refinement of coarse-graining. We further explore the role of $\alpha$-OE in thermodynamic contexts, particularly for the entropy production in open and closed quantum systems and its relation with the Helmholtz free energy.

Title: Investigations of optical aberration on quantum diamond microscopy toward high spatial resolution and sensitivity
Authors: Shunsuke Nishimura, Moeta Tsukamoto, Kento Sasaki, Kensuke Kobayashi
Abstract: Quantum diamond microscopy (QDM), which employs nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles, is a promising approach to quantitatively imaging magnetic fields with both high resolution that approaches the diffraction limit and a wide field of view. The commonly adopted setups of QDM capture the photoluminescence through transparent diamonds, which inevitably entail aberrations -- optical errors that degrade the optical resolution and contrast of the obtainable image. In this study, we delve into the impact of optical aberrations, focusing on their dependence on diamond thickness. We first introduce a rigorous model [Richards et al., Braat et al.] of diffraction that incorporates aberrations, producing the NV center optical image. We confirm that this model accurately reproduces the confocal images of single NV centers obtained at various depths in diamonds. Extending this model to a wide-field microscope, we find that the model also accurately reproduces the USAF 1951 resolution test chart obtained through diamonds of various thicknesses. Based on these investigations, we quantitatively assess the consequent resolution constraints and propose thinning the diamond as a viable solution. We present a robust method to quantitatively ascertain resolution in optical systems influenced by aberrations caused by ray transmission through diamonds. For instance, for a typical microscope with an objective lens of NA = 0.7, the diffraction limit is achievable through diamonds that are 30 $\mu$m thick, and a resolution of 1 $\mu$m is obtained through diamonds that are 100 $\mu$m thick. Those results opens up avenues for enhanced performance in QDM. The Julia package used to calculate the vectorial PSFs is available at ${\texttt this http URL}$.

Title: Edge states for tight-binding operators with soft walls
Authors: Camilo Gómez Araya, David Gontier, Hanne Van Den Bosch
Abstract: We study one- and two-dimensional periodic tight-binding models under the presence of a potential that grows to infinity in one direction, hence preventing the particles to escape in this direction (the soft wall). We prove that a spectral flow appears in these corresponding edge models, as the wall is shifted. We identity this flow as a number of Bloch bands, and provide a lower bound for the number of edge states appearing in such models.

Title: Schrödinger symmetry: a historical review
Authors: Christian Duval, Malte Henkel, Peter Horvathy, Shain Rouhani, Pengming Zhang
Abstract: This paper reviews the history of the conformal extension of Galilean symmetry, now called Schrödinger symmetry. In the physics literature, its discovery is commonly attributed to Jackiw, Niederer and Hagen (1972). However, Schrödinger symmetry has a much older ancestry: the associated conserved quantities were known to Jacobi in 1842/43 and its euclidean counterpart was discovered by Sophus Lie in 1881 in his studies of the heat equation. A convenient way to study Schrödinger symmetry is provided by a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type "Bargmann" framework, first proposed by Eisenhart (1929), but then forgotten and re-discovered by Duval {\it et al.} only in 1984. Representations of Schrödinger symmetry differ by the value $z=2$ of the dynamical exponent from the value $z=1$ found in representations of relativistic conformal invariance. For generic values of $z$, whole families of new algebras exist, which for $z=2/\ell$ include the $\ell$-conformal galilean algebras. We also review the non-relativistic limit of conformal algebras and that this limit leads to the $1$-conformal galilean algebra and not to the Schrödinger algebra. The latter can be recovered in the Bargmann framework through reduction. A distinctive feature of Galilean and Schrödinger symmetries are the Bargmann super-selection rules, algebraically related to a central extension. An empirical consequence of this was known as "mass conservation" already to Lavoisier. As an illustration of these concepts, some applications to physical ageing in simple model systems are reviewed.

Title: Gaussian Universality in Neural Network Dynamics with Generalized Structured Input Distributions
Authors: Jaeyong Bae, Hawoong Jeong
Abstract: Bridging the gap between the practical performance of deep learning and its theoretical foundations often involves analyzing neural networks through stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Expanding on previous research that focused on modeling structured inputs under a simple Gaussian setting, we analyze the behavior of a deep learning system trained on inputs modeled as Gaussian mixtures to better simulate more general structured inputs. Through empirical analysis and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate that under certain standardization schemes, the deep learning model converges toward Gaussian setting behavior, even when the input data follow more complex or real-world distributions. This finding exhibits a form of universality in which diverse structured distributions yield results consistent with Gaussian assumptions, which can support the theoretical understanding of deep learning models.

Title: Quantum Algorithms for Inverse Participation Ratio Estimation in multi-qubit and multi-qudit systems
Authors: Yingjian Liu, Piotr Sierant, Paolo Stornati, Maciej Lewenstein, Marcin Płodzień
Abstract: Inverse Participation Ratios (IPRs) and the related Participation Entropies quantify the spread of a quantum state over a selected basis of the Hilbert space, offering insights into the equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of the system. In this work, we propose three quantum algorithms to estimate IPRs on multi-qubit and multi-qudit quantum devices. The first algorithm allows for the estimation of IPRs in the computational basis by single-qubit measurements, while the second one enables measurement of IPR in the eigenbasis of a selected Hamiltonian, without the knowledge about the eigenstates of the system. Next, we provide an algorithm for IPR in the computational basis for a multi-qudit system. We discuss resources required by the algorithms and benchmark them by investigating the one-axis twisting protocol, the thermalization in a deformed PXP model, and the ground state of a spin-$1$ AKLT chain in a transverse field.

Abstract: Low-loss deposited dielectrics are beneficial for the advancement of superconducting integrated circuits for astronomy. In the microwave band ($\mathrm{\sim}$1$\unicode{x2013}$10 GHz) the cryogenic and low-power dielectric loss is dominated by two-level systems. However, the origin of the loss in the millimeter-submillimeter band ($\mathrm{\sim}$0.1$\unicode{x2013}$1 THz) is not understood. We measured the loss of hydrogenated amorphous SiC (a-SiC:H) films in the 0.27$\unicode{x2013}$100 THz range using superconducting microstrip resonators and Fourier-transform spectroscopy. The agreement between the loss data and a Maxwell-Helmholtz-Drude dispersion model suggests that vibrational modes above 10 THz dominate the loss in the a-SiC:H above 200 GHz.

Title: Autonomous Stabilization of Floquet States Using Static Dissipation
Authors: Martin Ritter, David M. Long, Qianao Yue, Anushya Chandran, Alicia J. Kollár
Abstract: Floquet engineering, in which the properties of a quantum system are modified through the application of strong periodic drives, is an indispensable tool in atomic and condensed matter systems. However, it is inevitably limited by intrinsic heating processes. We describe a simple autonomous scheme, which exploits a static coupling between the driven system and a lossy auxiliary, to cool large classes of Floquet systems into desired states. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the stabilization of a chosen quasienergy state in a strongly modulated transmon qubit coupled to an auxiliary microwave cavity with fixed frequency and photon loss. The scheme naturally extends to Floquet systems with multiple degrees of freedom. As an example, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological photon pumping in a driven cavity-QED system numerically. The coupling to the auxiliary cavity increases the average photon current and the fidelity of non-classical states, such as high photon number Fock states, that can be prepared in the system cavity.

Title: Terahertz chiral photonic-crystal cavities for Dirac gap engineering in graphene
Authors: Fuyang Tay, Stephen Sanders, Andrey Baydin, Zhigang Song, Davis M. Welakuh, Alessandro Alabastri, Vasil Rokaj, Ceren B. Dag, Junichiro Kono
Abstract: Strong coupling between matter and vacuum electromagnetic fields in a cavity can induce novel quantum phases in thermal equilibrium via symmetry breaking. Particularly intriguing is the coupling with circularly polarized cavity fields, which can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and lead to topological bands. This has spurred significant interest in developing chiral cavities that feature broken TRS, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a design for high-quality-factor THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) that achieves broken TRS using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. We incorporate ab initio density functional theory calculations into the derived microscopic model, allowing a realistic estimate of the vacuum-induced gap in graphene when coupled to our chiral cavity. Our calculations show an enhancement in the light-matter interaction due to Dirac nodes and predict an energy gap on the order of 1 meV. The THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken TRS.

Title: Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries
Authors: Barak Gabai, Victor Gorbenko, Jiaxin Qiao, Bernardo Zan, Aleksandr Zhabin
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.

Title: Bethe Ansatz, Quantum Circuits, and the F-basis
Authors: Roberto Ruiz, Alejandro Sopena, Esperanza López, Germán Sierra, Balázs Pozsgay
Abstract: The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.

Title: Exploring dynamical quantum phase transition from pure states to mixed states through extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models
Authors: Kaiyuan Cao, Tianren Zhang, Xiangping Jiang, Jian Wang
Abstract: We investigate dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in both pure and mixed states within the extended SSH model framework, focusing on the SSH-3 and SSH-4 variants, which differ in symmetry properties. The SSH-3 model, characterized by a chiral-like point symmetry rather than true chiral symmetry, supports robust localized edge states tied to its topological nature. Our results show that for pure states, DQPTs occur after quenches crossing the topological transition, even when the energy band gap remains open. For mixed states, DQPT behavior aligns with pure states at low temperatures but undergoes significant changes at higher temperatures, including the emergence of multiple critical times. In contrast, the SSH-4 model, which possesses chiral symmetry, features four distinct energy spectrum configurations. We find that pure-state DQPTs arise only when the quench starts from a gapless initial state and crosses the critical topological point. At finite temperature, mixed-state DQPTs persist at low temperatures only if the corresponding pure-state quench induces DQPTs, but they disappear at elevated temperatures. These findings elucidate the interplay between symmetry, topology, and temperature in governing DQPTs within generalized SSH models.

Title: Evaluating many-body stabilizer Rényi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic
Authors: Yi-Ming Ding, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo method for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling \emph{reduced Pauli strings} within a \emph{reduced configuration space}, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. We first isolate the free energy part in $2$-SRE, which is a trivial term. Notably, at quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the \emph{characteristic function} contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, analyzing the volume-law correction to SRE reveals a discontinuity tied to criticalities, suggesting that it is more informative than the full-state magic. For conformal critical points, we claim it could reflect nonlocal magic residing in correlations. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.

Title: The Effect of Optimal Self-Distillation in Noisy Gaussian Mixture Model
Authors: Kaito Takanami, Takashi Takahashi, Ayaka Sakata
Abstract: Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model improves itself using its own predictions, has attracted attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD with a linear classifier for binary classification on noisy Gaussian mixture data. For the analysis, we employ the replica method from statistical physics. Our findings reveal that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also identify two practical heuristics to enhance SD: early stopping that limits the number of stages, which is broadly effective, and bias parameter fixing, which helps under label imbalance. To empirically validate our theoretical findings derived from our toy model, we conduct additional experiments on CIFAR-10 classification using pretrained ResNet backbone. These results provide both theoretical and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.

Title: A strong-driving toolkit for topological Floquet energy pumps with superconducting circuits
Authors: Martin Ritter, David M. Long, Qianao Yue, Maya Amouzegar, Anushya Chandran, Alicia J. Kollár
Abstract: Topological Floquet energy pumps -- which use periodic driving to create a topologically protected quantized energy current -- have been proposed and studied theoretically, but have never been observed directly. Previous work proposed that such a pump could be realized with a strongly-driven superconducting qubit coupled to a cavity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy of energy scales and drive frequencies can be realized using a transmon qubit. We develop an experimental toolkit to realize the adiabatic driving field required for energy pumping using coordinated frequency modulation of the transmon and amplitude modulation of an applied resonant microwave drive. With this toolkit, we measure adiabatic evolution of the qubit under the applied field for times comparable to $T_1$, which far exceed the bare qubit dephasing time. This result paves the way for direct experimental observation of topological energy pumping.

Title: Determination of Mid-Infrared Refractive Indices of Superconducting Thin Films Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Authors: Dip Joti Paul, Tony X. Zhou, Karl K. Berggren
Abstract: In this work, we present a technique to determine the mid-infrared refractive indices of thin superconducting films using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In particular, we performed FTIR transmission and reflection measurements on 10-nm-thick NbN and 15-nm-thick MoSi films in the wavelength range of 2.5 to 25 $\mu$m, corresponding to frequencies of 12-120 THz or photon energies of 50-500 meV. To extract the mid-infrared refractive indices of these thin films, we used the Drude-Lorentz oscillator model to represent their dielectric functions and implemented an optimization algorithm to fit the oscillator parameters by minimizing the error between the measured and simulated FTIR spectra. We performed Monte Carlo simulations in the optimization routine to estimate error ranges in the extracted refractive indices resulting from multiple sources of measurement uncertainty. To evaluate the consistency of the extracted dielectric functions, we compared the refractive indices extrapolated from these dielectric functions in the UV to near-infrared wavelengths with the values separately measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry. We validated the applicability of the extracted mid-infrared refractive indices of NbN and MoSi at temperatures below their critical temperatures by comparing them with the Mattis-Bardeen model. This FTIR-based refractive index measurement approach can be extended to measure the refractive indices of thin films at wavelengths beyond 25 $\mu$m, which will be useful for designing highly efficient photon detectors and photonic devices with enhanced optical absorption in the mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.

Title: Eigenstate thermalization in spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems with SU(2) symmetry
Authors: Rohit Patil, Marcos Rigol
Abstract: We study the diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of observables in the eigenstates of the extended spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain, which exhibits the non-Abelian SU(2) symmetry. We explore integrable and nonintegrable regimes, and consider observables that preserve the SU(2) symmetry of the Hamiltonian as well as observables that break it. We study in detail the low-frequency behavior of the off-diagonal matrix elements at and away from integrability. In the nonintegrable regime, we test the non-Abelian eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, paying special attention to the effect of the spin, which is the distinctive conserved quantity introduced by the SU(2) symmetry.

Title: Generalized toric codes on twisted tori for quantum error correction
Authors: Zijian Liang, Ke Liu, Hao Song, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gröbner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \leq 400$, yielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$, $[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, \leq 22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the $[[360, 12, \leq 24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.

Title: Exponential quantum speedups in quantum chemistry with linear depth
Authors: Oskar Leimkuhler, K. Birgitta Whaley
Abstract: We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and generalized unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations, for which computing the off-diagonal matrix elements is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete for any polynomial depth. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.

Title: Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries
Authors: Zijian Liang, Jens Niklas Eberhardt, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: We construct high-performance planar quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes with open boundaries, demonstrating substantially improved resource efficiency compared to the surface code. We present planar code families with logical dimensions ranging from $k=6$ to $k=13$ (e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[173, 8, 9]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$), all using local stabilizers of weight 6 or lower. These codes achieve an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) that is an order of magnitude greater than that of the surface code. They can be interpreted as planar bivariate bicycle codes, adapted from the original design based on a torus that is challenging to implement physically. Our construction method, which combines boundary anyon condensation with a novel ``lattice grafting'' optimization, circumvents this difficulty and produces codes featuring only local low-weight stabilizers suitable for 2D planar hardware architectures. Furthermore, we observe fractal logical operators in the form of Sierpinski triangles, with the code distances scaling proportionally to the area of the truncated fractal in finite systems. We anticipate that our codes and construction methods offer a promising pathway toward realizing near-term fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Title: Temperature-Dependent Emission Polarization in GaN Defect-Based Quantum Emitters
Authors: Yifei Geng
Abstract: GaN defect-based quantum emitters show significant potential for quantum information technologies, yet their intrinsic nature is not fully understood. In this work, we present results on the temperature-dependent emission polarization of GaN defect single-photon emitters integrated with solid immersion lenses. The photoluminescence (PL) remains linearly polarized over the temperature range of 10K to 300K, with a slight rotation in the polarization direction observed at intermediate temperatures. Possible mechanisms underlying this behavior are analyzed, and a roadmap for future research is outlined.

Title: Discrete Spatial Diffusion: Intensity-Preserving Diffusion Modeling
Authors: Javier E. Santos, Agnese Marcato, Roman Colman, Nicholas Lubbers, Yen Ting Lin
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality images. However, these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces, diffusing independently across pixels and color channels. As a result, they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications involving inherently discrete quantities-such as particle counts or material units-that are constrained by strict conservation laws like mass conservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving particle counts in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve particle conservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across standard image benchmarks, while exactly conditioning total image intensity. We validate DSD on two challenging scientific applications: porous rock microstructures and lithium-ion battery electrodes, demonstrating its ability to generate structurally realistic samples under strict mass conservation constraints, with quantitative evaluation using state-of-the-art metrics for transport and electrochemical performance.

Title: Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes
Authors: G.E. Volovik
Abstract: In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.
