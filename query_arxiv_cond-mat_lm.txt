Title: Magnetic Phase Control of a Thick SNS Weak Link: Proposed experimental scheme
Authors: Aleksey Turchanov
Abstract: In contrast to the extensive literature on thin tunnel junctions and traditional SQUID geometries, there is almost no quantitative experimental data on magnetic control of the Josephson phase in thick SNS weak links. The standard view is that in such compact structures without macroscopic loops the local magnetic coupling to the phase is negligibly small, which in practice forces one to use bulky SQUID devices for phase control. We show that this view is overly restrictive. We consider a thick SNS bridge with an on-chip microcoil placed directly above it, which controls the Josephson phase via strong phase-flux coupling enhanced near the Josephson plasma resonance. In the proposed configuration realistic thick SNS weak links, with normal-layer thickness d of order xi, can achieve phase-flux efficiencies of order 30-60 percent of an ideal dc SQUID. Within a standard RSJ/RCSJ model and linear circuit theory we show that this unexpectedly strong coupling arises from the combination of a large kinetic inductance of the thick SNS bridge and resonant amplification of about 15-35 dB, rather than from any exotic microphysics. The proposed experiment, a comparative analysis of Shapiro steps driven by a direct RF signal and by the magnetic field of the same microcoil, provides a direct and quantitative method to measure the phase-flux response of a thick SNS junction. If confirmed experimentally, such structures may become compact phase elements capable of locally controlling the Josephson phase without a macroscopic loop and enabling dense, locally addressable phase control in superconducting quantum circuits.

Authors: E.V. Vasinovich, V.A. Ulitko, A.S. Moskvin
Abstract: This work presents the modeling of the magnetic 3d sublattice in mixed orthoferrites-orthochromites YFe1-xCrxO3 using classical Monte Carlo methods. It is shown that, when taking into account the competition of the Dzyaloshinskii vectors in the mixed compositions, magnetic moment compensations are observed, as well as angular magnetic configurations corresponding to the spin reorientation.

Title: Environment-matrix-product operator for boundary-free large-scale quantum many-body simulations
Authors: Souta Shimozono, Chisa Hotta
Abstract: We propose an alternative to the infinite density-matrix renormalization approach for accessing quantum many-body states within a finite-size calculation that faithfully mimics the thermodynamic limit. Our method constructs environment matrix product operators (MPOs) representing the Hamiltonian of semi-infinite regions surrounding the target system. Starting from the finite-size ground-state MPS, we contract its Hamiltonian representation to generate effective environment MPOs, which are then attached to a renewed finite system in a recursive manner. This iterative embedding drives the system toward a bulk-like state with negligible finite-size effects. The scheme requires no assumption of homogeneity and achieves unprecedentedly long real-time dynamics free from boundary reflections.

Title: Is disorder a friend or a foe to melting of Wigner-Mott insulators?
Authors: Mohammed Hammam, Cyprian Lewandowski, Vladimir Dobrosavljevic, Sandeep Joy
Abstract: Wigner crystals are extremely fragile, which is shown to result from very strong geometric frustration germane to long-range Coulomb interactions. Physically, this is manifested by a very small characteristic energy scale for shear density fluctuations, which are gapless excitations in a translationally invariant system. The presence of disorder, however, breaks translational invariance, thus suppressing gapless excitations and pushing them to higher density. We illustrate this general principle by explicit microscopic model calculations, showing that this mechanism very effectively stabilizes disordered Wigner lattices to much higher temperatures and densities than in the clean limit. On the other hand, we argue that in two dimensions disorder significantly ``smears" the melting transition, producing spatial coexistence of solid-like and liquid-like regions -- just as recently observed in STM experiments. Our results paint a new physical picture for melting of Wigner-Mott solids in two dimensions, corresponding to a Mott-Hubbard model with spatially varying local electronic bandwidth.

Title: Vortex leapfrogging and superfluid dissipation mechanisms in a fluid of light
Authors: Myrann Baker-Rasooli, Nathan du Toit, Nicolas Pavloff, Quentin Glorieux
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of vortex leapfrogging in a two-dimensional fluid of light. By imprinting two vortex-antivortex pairs and tracking their real-time evolution through phase-resolved imaging, we observe a dynamics that is accurately described by a point-vortex model with an outward background flow. By precisely controlling the initial vortex separation, we identify configurations in which leapfrogging breaks down and determine the corresponding dissipation mechanisms. The first originates from phase-slip events occurring at large injected velocities. The second arises when the injection of multi-charged vortices leads to the formation of a dispersive shock wave which acts as a continuous source of phase slippage. These mechanisms advance our understanding of vortex dynamics and dissipation in superfluids.

Title: Quantum Geometry Driven Crystallization: A Neural-Network Variational Monte Carlo Study
Authors: Agnes Valenti, Yaar Vituri, Yubo Yang, Daniel E. Parker, Tomohiro Soejima, Junkai Dong, Miguel A. Morales, Ashvin Vishwanath, Erez Berg, Shiwei Zhang
Abstract: Wigner crystals are a paradigmatic form of interaction driven electronic order. A key open question is how Berry curvature and, more generally, quantum geometry reshape crystallization. The discovery of two-dimensional materials with relatively flat bands and pronounced Berry curvature has added fresh urgency to this question. Recent mean-field studies have proposed a topological variant of the Wigner crystal, the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), with non-zero Chern number. However it remains unclear whether the AHC survives beyond the mean-field approximation. Here, we map out the ground-state phase diagram of the $\lambda$-jellium model - a simple model whose interaction strength and Berry curvature are independently tunable - using state-of-the-art neural-network variational Monte Carlo. The AHC is found to remain stable against quantum fluctuations. Surprisingly, quantum geometric effects are found to dramatically enhance crystallization. Both the AHC and the standard Wigner Crystal are stabilized at densities up to an order of magnitude above the critical density in the absence of quantum geometry, yet still significantly below the threshold predicted by mean-field theory. These striking results highlight the rich interplay between quantum fluctuations, quantum geometry, and crystallization, providing concrete guidance for experiments and enabling future explorations of fractionalized crystals and chiral superconductors.

Title: Minimal Models of Entropic Order
Authors: Xiaoyang Huang, Zohar Komargodski, Andrew Lucas, Fedor K. Popov, Tin Sulejmanpasic
Abstract: Due to entropic effects, it is possible that generic high-energy states of a quantum or classical system are ordered. This leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking at arbitrarily high temperatures. We present minimal models of entropic order that arise from very simple interactions. Our main examples are the Arithmetic Ising Model (AIM) and its quantum analogue, where usual Ising spins are replaced by non-negative integers. Using a large-flavor expansion together with numerical simulations, we find that the high-temperature phase is ordered in the classical and quantum models. We also introduce classical gas models whose interactions drive the system to a crystal at high temperatures.

Title: Free fermionic and parafermionic multispin quantum chains with non-homogeneous interacting ranges
Authors: Francisco C. Alcaraz
Abstract: A large family of multispin interacting one-dimensional quantum spin models with $Z(N)$ symmetry and a free-particle eigenspectra are known in the literature. They are free-fermionic ($N=2$) and free-parafermionic ($N\geq 2$) quantum chains. The essential ingredient that implies the free-particle spectra is the fact that these Hamiltonians are expressed in terms of generators of a $Z(N)$ exchange algebra. In all these known quantum chains the number of spins in all the multispin interactions (range of interactions) is the same and therefore, the models have homogeneous interacting range. In this paper we extend the $Z(N)$ exchange algebra, by introducing new models with a free-particle spectra, where the interaction ranges of the multispin interactions are not uniform anymore and depends on the lattice sites (non-homogeneous interacting range). We obtain the general conditions that the site-dependent ranges of the multispin interactions have to satisfy to ensure a free-particle spectra. Several simple examples are introduced. We study in detail the critical properties in the case where the range of interactions of the even (odd) sites are constant. The dynamical critical exponent is evaluated in several cases.

Title: Magnetic properties of the Fe$_5$SiB$_2$-Fe$_5$PB$_2$ system
Authors: Daniel Hedlund, Johan Cedervall, Alexander Edström, Mirosław Werwinski, Sofia Kontos Olle Eriksson, Ján Rusz, Peter Svedlindh, Martin Sahlberg, Klas Gunnarsson
Abstract: The magnetic properties of the compound Fe$_5$Si$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$B$_2$ have been studied, with a focus on the Curie temperature $T_\textrm{C}$, saturation magnetization $M_\textrm{S}$, and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Field and temperature dependent magnetization measurements were used to determine $T_\textrm{C}\left(x\right)$ and $M_\textrm{S}\left(x\right)$. The saturation magnetization at 10 K (300 K) is found to monotonically decrease from $1.11~\mathrm{MA/m}$ ($1.03~\mathrm{MA/m}$) to $0.97~\mathrm{MA/m}$ ($0.87~\mathrm{MA/m}$), as $x$ increases from zero to one. The Curie temperature is determined to be 810 K and 615 K in Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ and Fe$_5$PB$_2$, respectively. The highest $T_\textrm{C}$ is observed for $x=0.1$, while it decreases monotonically for larger $x$. The Curie temperatures have also been theoretically determined to be 700 K and 660 K for Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ and Fe$_5$PB$_2$, respectively, using a combination of density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The magnitude of the effective magnetocrystalline anisotropy was extracted using the law of approach to saturation, revealing an increase with increasing phosphorus concentration. Low--field magnetization vs. temperature results for $x = 0, 0.1, 0.2$ indicate that there is a transition from easy--axis to easy--plane anisotropy with decreasing temperature.

Title: Effect of superconductivity on non-uniform magnetization in dirty SF junctions
Authors: A. V. Levin, P. M. Ostrovsky
Abstract: We study proximity effect in a tunnel junction between a bulk superconductor and a thin disordered ferromagnetic layer on its surface. Cooper pairs penetrating from the superconductor into the ferromagnet tend to destabilize its uniform magnetic order. The competition of this effect and the intrinsic magnetic stiffness of the ferromagnet leads to a second order phase transition between uniform and non-uniform magnetic states. Using the quasiclassical Usadel equation, we derive the Landau functional for this transition and construct the complete phase diagram of the effect. We identify a special point of "resonance" at which the characteristic energy scale of the proximity effect equals the exchange field of the ferromagnet. At this point, the uniform magnetic state is unstable even in the limit of large stiffness. We further explore the parameter regime far beyond the transition and determine the properties of the resulting strongly non-uniform magnetic state.

Title: Chirality-induced magnetoresistance in hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite semiconductors

Abstract: The combination of semiconducting properties and synthetically tunable chirality in chiral metal halide semiconductors (CMHS) offer a compelling platform for room temperature control over electronic spin properties, leveraging effects such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) for the development of new opto-spintronic functionalities. We report room-temperature CISS-induced magnetoresistance (CISS-MR) exceeding 100% for spin valves in a configuration consisting of a ferromagnet (FM), tunneling barrier, and CMHS. The high CISS-MR is attributed to interfacial spin-selective tunneling barrier induced by the chirality, which can produce current dissymmetry factors that surpass the limit imposed by the Jullière model governed by the intrinsic spin polarization of the adjacent FM contact. The CISS-MR exhibits a strong dependence on the CMHS composition, revealing a structure-property relationship between CISS and structural chirality. The observed exceptionally large tunneling MR response differentiates from a subtle anisotropic MR arising from the proximity effect at the FM/CMHS interface in the absence of a tunneling barrier. Our study provides insights into charge-to-spin interconversion in chiral semiconductors, offering materials design principles to control and enhance CISS response and utilize it in functional platforms.

Title: Emergent memory in cell-like active systems
Authors: Marc Besse, Raphaël Voituriez
Abstract: Active systems across scales, ranging from molecular machines to human crowds, are usually modeled as assemblies of self-propelled particles driven by internally generated forces. However, these models often assume memoryless dynamics and no coupling of internal active forces to the environment. Here, guided by the example of living cells, which have recently been shown to display multi-timescale memory effects, we introduce a general theoretical framework that goes beyond this paradigm by incorporating internal state dynamics and environmental sensing into active particle models. We show that when the self-propulsion of an agent depends on internal variables with their own complex dynamics - modulated by local environmental cues - environmental memory spontaneously emerges and gives rise to new classes of behaviours. These include memory-induced responses, adaptable localization in complex landscapes, suppression of motility-induced phase separation, and enhanced jamming transitions. Our results demonstrate how minimal information processing capabilities, intrinsic to non-equilibrium agents with internal states like living cells, can profoundly influence both individual and collective behaviours. This framework bridges cell-scale activity and large-scale intelligent motion in cell assemblies, and opens the way to the quantitative analysis and design of systems ranging from synthetic colloids to biological collectives and robotic swarms.

Title: A unified model for lunderdoped and overdoped cuprate superconductors based on a spinodal transition
Authors: Hercules H. Santana, E. V. L. de Mello
Abstract: Many years of intense research on cuprate superconductors have led to several discoveries, such as the pseudogap and charge density waves (CDW), yet a complete theory is still lacking. By analyzing some experiments and performing calculations, we provide a full interpretation of their properties; from the undoped insulator to the overdoped metallic compounds. The variation of the anomalous Hall coefficient ($R_{\rm H}(T)$) with temperature at half-filling ($n = 1$) and, combinations of undoped ($p = 0$) insulators and metallic films, which, among other things, are indicative of a thermodynamic transition. On the overdoped side, recent experiments near the superconducting-to-metal transition detecting superconducting puddles and a considerable degree of charge disorder, suggest that a similar thermodynamic transition operates at all doping levels. We propose a spinodal or charge-separation transition starting near the pseudogap temperature $T^*(p)$, which among other things generates the CDW domains with a typical double-well Landau free-energy functional. Thus, from the half-filled to the overdoped region, the free energy forms an array of wells with $n = 1$ {\it static} holes. With doping, {\it mobile} holes tend to occupy these wells with alternating high and low densities, generating the CDW pattern. The confined holes in small regions develop local superconducting amplitudes, giving rise to a mesoscopic granular superconductor. Similar to the XY model, the grains develop correlation effects mediated by Josephson coupling, which is proportional to the local superfluid density. This approach yields a unified theory of cuprate superconductors.

Title: Control of the effective value of the critical current of the RF SQUID by the high-frequency electromagnetic field
Authors: V. I. Shnyrkov, V. Yu. Lyakhno, O. A. Kalenyuk, D. G. Mindich, O. O. Leha, A. P. Shapovalov
Abstract: An analysis of the influence of the high-frequency electromagnetic field on the amplitude-frequency and signal characteristics of RF SQUID and experimental verification are carried out. At low parameter , the RF SQUID behavior is well described analytically by the theoretical model. In experiment, basic operation scheme is used in which the interferometer is inductively connected to a resonant tank circuit driven by RF current at a frequency close to the resonance frequency of the tank. It is shown that parameter , which distinguishes between hysteretic and non-hysteretic regimes, can be effectively adjusted to a desired value by applying the high-frequency field of a certain amplitude and frequency much higher than tank resonant frequency. A significant increase in the conversion factor and sensitivity of the RF SQUID during this adjustment is discussed.

Title: Predicting interstitial elements in Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys
Authors: Aomin Huang, Siya Zhu, Calvin Belcher, Ryker Rigsby, Diran Apelian, Raymundo Arróyave, Enrique J. Lavernia
Abstract: Refractory complex concentrated alloys, composed of multiple principal refractory elements, are promising candidates for high-temperature structural applications due to their exceptional thermal stability and high melting points. However, their mechanical performance is often compromised by interstitial impurities, particularly oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, which segregate to grain boundaries and promote embrittlement. In this study, we investigate the solubility and thermodynamic behavior of oxygen interstitials in a model NbTiHfTa RCCA system. We synthesized NbTiHfTa alloys with varying oxygen contents via plasma arc melting and characterized their phase evolution and microstructure using XRD, SEM, and TEM. Complementary computational modeling was performed using machine-learning interatomic potentials integrated with Monte Carlo simulations to probe oxygen interactions at the atomic scale. Our results reveal a solubility limit for oxygen between 0.8 and 1.0 atomic percentage, beyond which HfO2 formation is energetically favorable. This combined experimental-computational framework provides a predictive approach for managing interstitial behavior in RCCAs, enabling improved alloy design strategies for enhanced mechanical performance.

Title: Bayesian Co-Navigation of a Computational Physical Model and AFM Experiment to Autonomously Survey a Combinatorial Materials Library
Authors: Boris N. Slautin, Kamyar Barakati, Yu Liu, Reece Emery, Philip Rack, Sergei V. Kalinin
Abstract: Building autonomous experiment workflows requires transcending beyond the data-driven surrogate models to incorporate and dynamically refine physical theory during exploration. Here we demonstrate the first fully automated experimental realization of Bayesian co-navigation - a framework in which an autonomous agent simultaneously runs a physical experiment and a computationally expensive physical model. Using an automated AFM platform coupled to a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model of thin-film growth, the system infers a set of effective bond energies for the (CrTaWV)x-Mo(1-x) pseudo-binary combinatorial library, progressively adjusting the kMC parameters to decrease the epistemic disparity between simulation and experiment. This real-time theoretical refinement enables the kMC model to capture the behavior of the specific materials system and reveals the mechanistic role of hetero-bonding in governing surface diffusion. Together, these results establish co-navigation as a general strategy for tightly integrating physical models with autonomous experimental platforms to produce interpretable and continually self-correcting theoretical modelling of complex materials systems.

Title: Moire-Engineered Ferroelectric Transistors for Nearly Trap-free, Low-Power and Non-Volatile 2D Electronics
Authors: Arup Singha, Shaili Sett, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Arindam Ghosh, Rahul Debnath
Abstract: Long-range moire patterns in twisted WSe2 enable a built-in, moire-length-scale ferroelectric polarization that can be directly harnessed in electronic devices. Such a built-in ferroic landscape offers a compelling means to enable ultralow-voltage and non-volatile electronic functionality in two-dimensional materials; however, achieving stable polarization control without charge trapping has remained a persistent challenge. Here, we demonstrate a moire-engineered ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) utilizing twisted WSe2 bilayers that leverages atomically clean van der Waals interfaces to achieve efficient polarization-channel coupling and trap-suppressed, ultralow-voltage operation (subthreshold swing of 64 mV per decade). The device exhibits a stable non-volatile memory window of 0.10 V and high mobility, exceeding the performance of previously reported two-dimensional FeFET and matching that of advanced silicon-based devices. In addition, capacitance-voltage spectroscopy, corroborated by self-consistent Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire modeling, indicates ultrafast ferroelectric switching (~0.5 microseconds). These results establish moire-engineered ferroelectricity as a practical and scalable route toward ultraclean, low-power, and non-volatile 2D electronics, bridging atomistic lattice engineering with functional device architectures for next-generation memory and logic technologies.

Title: Self-consistent solution of Eliashberg equations for metal hydride superconductors
Authors: Tomas J. Escamilla, Chumin Wang
Abstract: In recent years, the quest for high critical-temperature superconductors has increasingly focused on metal and molecular hydrides, which have demonstrated potential for superconductivity at or near room temperature under extremely high pressures. Such hydrides were first proposed by N. W. Ashcroft in 1968, because hydrogen-rich materials possess elevated vibrational frequencies due to the low atomic mass of hydrogen. This article presents a self-consistent solution to the Eliashberg equations for analysing superconductivity in hydrides, contrasting with the commonly used McMillan-Allen-Dynes parameterized formula. We also analyse effects of the electron-phonon spectral function and the broadening parameters arising from phonon lifetime and sample imperfections on the superconducting critical temperature. Finally, both theoretical approaches are applied to a typical metal hydride superconductor, and the reliability of self-consistent solutions is validated against the experimentally measured critical temperature.

Title: Enhancing Hole Mobility in Monolayer $WSe_{2}$ p-FETs via Process-Induced Compression
Authors: He Lin Zhao, Sheikh Mohd Ta-Seen Afrid, Dongyoung Yoon, Zachary Martin, Zakaria Islam, Sihan Chen, Yue Zhang, Pinshane Y. Huang, Shaloo Rakheja, Arend M. van der Zande
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between strain, interfacial mechanics, and electrical performance is critical for designing beyond silicon electronics based on hetero-integrated 2D materials. Through combined experiment and simulation, we demonstrated and analyzed the enhancement of hole mobility in p-type monolayer $WSe_{2}$ field effect transistors (FETs) under biaxial compression. We tracked FET performance versus strain by incrementing compressive strain to $WSe_{2}$ channels via sequential AlOx deposition and performing intermediate photoluminescence and transport measurements. The hole mobility factor increased at a rate of 340 $\pm$ 95 %/%$\epsilon$, and the on-current factor increased at a rate of 460 $\pm$ 340 %/%$\epsilon$. Simulation revealed that the enhancement under compression arises primarily from a reduction in inter-valley scattering between the $\Gamma$--K valence bands, and the rate is robust against variations in carrier density, impurity density, or dielectric environment. These findings show that compressive strain is a powerful technique for enhancing performance in 2D p-FETs and that it is multiplicative with defect and doping engineering.

Title: Device/circuit simulations of silicon spin qubits based on a gate-all-around transistor
Authors: Tetsufumi Tanamoto, Keiji Ono
Abstract: We theoretically investigated the readout process of a spin--qubit structure based on a gate-all-around (GAA) transistor. Our study focuses on a logical qubit composed of two physical qubits. Different spin configurations result in different charge distributions, which subsequently influence the electrostatic effects on the GAA transistor. Consequently, the current flowing through the GAA transistor depends on the qubit's state. We calculated the current-voltage characteristics of the three-dimensional configurations of the qubit and GAA structures, using technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations. Moreover, we performed circuit simulations using the Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) to investigate whether a readout circuit made from complementary metal--oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors can amplify the weak signals generated by the qubits. Our findings indicate that, by dynamically controlling the applied voltage within a properly designed circuit, the readout can be detected effectively based on a conventional sense amplifier.

Title: Anisotropic nonrelativistic charge-to-spin conversion in altermagnets
Authors: Mingbo Dou, Xianjie Wang, L. L. Tao
Abstract: The charge-to-spin conversion provides an efficient way to manipulate the magnetization by electrical means. In this work, we report on a study on the anisotropic nonrelativistic charge-to-spin conversion response to the current direction in altermagnets. Based on the general group-theoretical analysis, we derive analytical formulas for the anisotropic conversion ratio and identify its maximum value. We then exemplify those phenomena in representative altermagnets based on the density functional theory calculations. The highly anisotropic charge-to-spin conversion efficiency, varying from zero to several tens of percent, was demonstrated. Our work shines more light on the exploration of the nonrelativistic generation of spin currents in altermagnets.

Title: Nonreciprocal dynamics with weak noise: aperiodic "Escher cycles" and their quasipotential landscape
Authors: Janik Schüttler, Robert L. Jack, Michael E. Cates
Abstract: We present an explicit construction of the Freidlin-Wentzell quasipotential of a stochastic system with two degrees of freedom and nonreciprocal interactions. This model undergoes noise-induced transitions between four metastable attractors, forming recurrent but aperiodic ``Escher cycles,'' similar to the cyclic nucleation dynamics observed in the nonreciprocal Ising model. We calculate the quasipotential analytically to first order in nonreciprocality. We characterise it along a one-dimensional reaction coordinate that connects the attractors, and we also obtain the full two-dimensional landscape, at leading order in perturbation theory. The resulting landscapes feature flat regions and extended plateaus, together with non-differentiable switching lines. These singular structures arise from two geometric mechanisms: the handover of dominance between competing transition paths, and the competition between basins of attraction. The system provides a rare case where the geometry of nonequilibrium rare events can be fully resolved, and a simple analytically tractable example of a quasipotential in more than one coordinate that captures a rich set of nonequilibrium features.

Title: Dynamics of Quantum Chiral Solitons
Authors: Leandro M. Chinellato, Oleg A. Starykh, Cristian D. Batista
Abstract: We introduce a non-perturbative framework for quantizing chiral solitons in interacting quantum spin chains. This approach provides a direct lattice extension of the well-established $S$-duality between the sine-Gordon and Thirring models, thereby bridging the gap between continuum dualities and their lattice counterparts. By constructing the quantum chiral-soliton operators explicitly, we show how their unconventional dynamics appear in the excitation spectrum and correlation functions across the full Brillouin zone. A key result is that the dominant soliton tunneling amplitude alternates in sign, $\operatorname{sgn}(t_{1+}) = (-1)^{2S+1}$, sharply distinguishing half-odd-integer from integer spin chains. We further identify characteristic signatures of these chiral excitations in the dynamical spin structure factor, demonstrating their visibility in inelastic neutron scattering. Our results open a route to experimentally probing non-perturbative features of dual quantum field theories in condensed-matter settings.

Title: Direct Generation of an Array with 78400 Optical Tweezers Using a Single Metasurface
Authors: Yuqing Wang, Yuxuan Liao, Tao Zhang, Ye Tian, Yujia Wu, Wenjun Zhang, Wei Zhang, Yidong Huang, Hui Zhai, Wenlan Chen, Xue Feng, Zhongchi Zhang
Abstract: Scalability remains a major challenge in building practical fault-tolerant quantum computers. Currently, the largest number of qubits achieved across leading quantum platforms ranges from hundreds to thousands. In atom arrays, scalability is primarily constrained by the capacity to generate large numbers of optical tweezers, and conventional techniques using acousto-optic deflectors or spatial light modulators struggle to produce arrays much beyond $\sim 10,000$ tweezers. Moreover, these methods require additional microscope objectives to focus the light into micrometer-sized spots, which further complicates system integration and scalability. Here, we demonstrate the experimental generation of an optical tweezer array containing $280\times 280$ spots using a metasurface, nearly an order of magnitude more than most existing systems. The metasurface leverages a large number of subwavelength phase-control pixels to engineer the wavefront of the incident light, enabling both large-scale tweezer generation and direct focusing into micron-scale spots without the need for a microscope. This result shifts the scalability bottleneck for atom arrays from the tweezer generation hardware to the available laser power. Furthermore, the array shows excellent intensity uniformity exceeding $90\%$, making it suitable for homogeneous single-atom loading and paving the way for trapping arrays of more than $10,000$ atoms in the near future.

Title: Field manipulation of Weyl modes in an ideal Dirac semimetal
Authors: Jingyuan Zhong, Jianfeng Wang, Ming Yang, Jie Liu, Zhizhen Ren, Anping Huang, Zhixiang Shi, Zengwei Zhu, Yan Shi, Weichang Hao, Jincheng Zhuang, Yi Du
Abstract: The emergent Weyl modes with the broken time-reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry provide large Berry curvature and chirality to carriers, offering the realistic platforms to explore topology of electrons in three-dimensional systems. However, the reversal transition between different types of Weyl modes in a single material, which is of particular interest in the fundamental research in Weyl physics and potential application in spintronics, is scarcely achieved due to restriction of inborn symmetry in crystals. Here, by tuning the direction and strength of magnetic field in an ideal Dirac semimetal, Bi4(Br0.27I0.73)4, we report the realization of multiple Weyl modes, including gapped Weyl mode, Weyl nodal ring, and coupled Weyl mode by the magnetoresistivity measurements and electronic structure calculations. Specifically, under a magnetic field with broken mirror symmetry, anomalous Hall effect with step feature results from the large Berry curvature for the gapped Weyl mode. A prominent negative magnetoresistivity is observed at low magnetic field with preserved mirror symmetry and disappears at high magnetic field, which is correlated to the chiral anomaly and its annihilation of Weyl nodal ring, respectively. Our findings reveal distinct Weyl modes under the intertwined crystal symmetry and time-reversal breaking, laying the foundation of manipulating multiple Weyl modes in chiral spintronic network.

Title: Coalescence of multiple topological orders in quasi-one-dimensional bismuth halide chains

Abstract: Topology is being widely adopted to understand and to categorize quantum matter in modern physics. The nexus of topology orders, which engenders distinct quantum phases with benefits to both fundamental research and practical applications for future quantum devices, can be driven by topological phase transition through modulating intrinsic or extrinsic ordering parameters. The conjoined topology, however, is still elusive in experiments due to the lack of suitable material platforms. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations to investigate the doping-driven band structure evolution of a quasi-one-dimensional material system, bismuth halide, which contains rare multiple band inversions in two time-reversal-invariant momenta. According to the unique bulk-boundary correspondence in topological matter, we unveil a composite topological phase, the coexistence of a strong topological phase and a high-order topological phase, evoked by the band inversion associated with topological phase transition in this system. Moreover, we reveal multiple-stage topological phase transitions by varying the halide element ratio: from high-order topology to weak topology, the unusual dual topology, and trivial/weak topology subsequently. Our results not only realize an ideal material platform with composite topology, but also provide an insightful pathway to establish abundant topological phases in the framework of band inversion theory.

Title: Finite-Temperature $\textit{ab initio}$ Structural Optimization of the Bilayer Nickelate Superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Ryoma Asai, Ryotaro Arita, Takumi Chida, Ryota Masuki, Kazuhiko Kuroki, Terumasa Tadano
Abstract: We develop a first-principles framework for finite-temperature structural optimization that incorporates vibrational contributions to the free energy through anharmonic phonon theory. We extend and further improve the efficiency of the recent approach, enabling its application to systems in which the size of the primitive cell changes across structural phase transitions. Applying this framework to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we establish its pressure-temperature phase diagram and find that the slope of the phase boundary between the high-symmetry and low-symmetry phases is negative, with a magnitude of approximately -60 K / GPa. The present results provide a theoretical foundation for discussing how changes in crystal symmetry influence the emergence of superconductivity.

Title: A Transcorrelated Wave-Function Framework for Solids: An Application to Bulk and Defected Silicon
Authors: Kristoffer Simula, Johannes Hauskrecht, Evelin Martine Corvid Christlmaier, Pablo Lopez-Rios, Daniel Kats, Denis Usvyat, Ali Alavi
Abstract: Accurate wave-function descriptions of pristine and defected solids remain challenging due to the simultaneous presence of finite-size, basis-set, and correlation errors. While embedding techniques alleviate finite-size effects and correlated wave-function approaches systematically improve correlation, basis-set incompleteness continues to limit practical accuracy. Here we present a study of transcorrelated (TC) many-body wave-function methods on properties of solid state systems. We augment the existing xTC theory to periodic systems, and establish an unified transcorrelated embedding framework that integrates periodic TC theory with fragment-based correlated solvers. Using silicon as a test case, we validate the method against coupled-cluster, FCIQMC, and diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks for bulk. Then we apply TC embedding to calculation of formation energies of two silicon self-interstitials. The TC Hamiltonian yields rapid basis convergence and quantitatively reliable defect formation energies at the triple-$\zeta$ level, substantially reducing the basis-set bottleneck for wave-function treatments of crystalline defects.

Abstract: Bismuth vanadate (BiVO$_4$) is a key photocatalyst for solar fuel applications, yet fundamental questions remain regarding the nature of photogenerated polaronic states and the lattice dynamics that govern its light-to-chemical pathways. Here, we use femtosecond optical pump-X-ray probe measurements to track the photoinduced electronic and structural dynamics in BiVO$_4$ across multiple length and time scales. Transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy captures sub-picosecond electron localization within VO$_4$ tetrahedra, consistent with small polaron formation, whereas time-resolved X-ray diffraction reveals a slower, multi-picosecond lattice reorganization into a hidden photoexcited state that is structurally distinct from both the monoclinic ground state and the high-temperature tetragonal phase. Supported by density functional theory, we show that hole-lattice interactions dynamically reduce the ground state monoclinic distortion, stabilizing the hidden state. Our results demonstrate that electron- and hole-lattice coupling jointly shape the excited state landscape, with implications for carrier transport, interfacial energetics, and light-to-chemical energy conversion pathways.

Title: Forces at the scale of the cell
Authors: K. Vijay Kumar, Mandar M. Inamdar, Pramod A. Pullarkat, Gautam I. Menon
Abstract: The importance of molecular-scale forces in sculpting biological form and function has been acknowledged for more than a century. Accounting for forces in biology is a problem that lies at the intersection of soft condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, computer simulations and novel experimental methodologies, all adapted to a cellular context. This review surveys how forces arise within the cell. We provide a summary of the relevant background in basic biophysics, of soft-matter systems in and out of thermodynamic equilibrium, and of various force measurement methods in biology. We then show how these ideas can be incorporated into a description of cell-scale processes where forces are involved. Our examples include polymerization forces, motion of molecular motors, the properties of the actomyosin cortex, the mechanics of cell division, and shape changes in tissues. We show how new conceptual frameworks are required for understanding the consequences of cell-scale forces for biological function. We emphasize active matter descriptions, methodological tools that provide ways of incorporating non-equilibrium effects in a systematic manner into conceptual as well as quantitative descriptions. Understanding the functions of cells will necessarily require integrating the role of physical forces with the assimilation and processing of information. This integration is likely to have been a significant driver of evolutionary change.

Title: Halogen Chains with One-Dimensional Semi-Metallic Electronic Structure and Peierls Physics in Polymorphs of Na4X5 (X = I, Br, Cl) Compounds

Abstract: Since the pioneering works of Peierls, one-dimensional materials have attracted great attention. Still, the synthesis of truly monoatomic chains remains elusive. In this study, we explore a novel path of experimental synthesis of monoatomic one-dimensional chains by their chemical stabilization in ionic compounds. We demonstrate that in synthesized at high pressure sodium halides Na4X5 (X = I, Br, Cl) with hP18 Ga4Ti5-type structures, transfer of valence electrons from cations to anions leads to the formation of halogen chains connected with other atoms only by ionic interaction and having one-dimensional electronic structure. The Peierls physics in the systems is confirmed by theoretical calculations, newly synthesized incommensurately modulated i-hP18-Na4X5 (X = I, Br, Cl) compounds, as well as by the discovered hP36 phases of Na4Cl5 and Na4Br5.

Title: Structural and Thermal Stability of B4C/Ru Multilayers with Carbon Barrier Layers
Authors: A.V. Bugaev, S.S. Sakhonenkov, A.U. Gaisin, R.A. Shaposhnikov, V.N. Polkovnikov, E.O. Filatovaa
Abstract: The chemical interaction between Mo and Ru layers in multilayer structures depending on the thickness ratio ($\Gamma$) was carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray reflectometry (XRR). The results showed significant interaction of materials inside multilayer structures with the formation of ruthenium borides, with an increase in the B4C layer thickness (a decrease in the $\Gamma$ parameter) leading to the formation of ruthenium borides of different stoichiometry. The introduction of a carbon barrier layer at the Ru-on-B4C interface resulted in significant suppression of ruthenium boride formation. The thermal stability of the B4C/Ru system was also studied upon annealing at 400$^{\circ}$C for 1 hour before and after the introduction of the carbon barrier layer. It was shown that the introduction of a carbon barrier layer at the Ru-on-B4C interface increases the thermal stability of the system, which makes this system more suitable for use in optical systems exposed to long-term radiation. The obtained results are important for the development of highly efficient multilayer mirrors used in EUV lithography and X-ray optics.

Title: Topological spin-up triplet excitonic condensation in two-dimensional electron-hole systems
Authors: Van-Nham Phan
Abstract: We investigate topological spin-up triplet excitonic condensation and its competition with other stabilities in a two-dimensional interacting electron-hole system taking into account Rashba spin-orbit coupling and external magnetic fields. Using an unrestricted Hartree-Fock approach, we self-consistently evaluate spin-selective excitonic condensate order parameters and the Chern number. The ground state phase diagram in the dependence on magnetic field and Coulomb interaction shows a spin-up triplet excitonic condensate (EC) with a nonzero Chern number, emerging uniquely away from the topologically trivial singlet and spin-down triplet EC regions. Strong spin-polarized triplet excitonic fluctuations preceding the condensation are further revealed through the signatures of the dynamical excitonic susceptibility spectra. Our results establish a class of topological quantum phases driven by excitonic coherence and suggest a realistic pathway to its realization in a distorted Janus monolayer of transition metal dichalcogenides or some twisted van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Disorder-mediated linear and nonlinear magnetotransport in the charge-density-wave material ${\rm Ta_2NiSe_7 }$
Authors: Xiaodong Sun, Jiabin Qiao, Yuanzhe Li, Wanli He, Jiali Chen, Jinjin Liu, Yuxiang Chen, Yuchen Ma, Meiling Jin, Jianlin Luo, Jie Chen, Wei Wu, Zhiwei Wang, Wei Jiang, Xiang Li, Yugui Yao
Abstract: We report disorder-mediated first-order linear and higher-order nonlinear (magneto-)transport of Ta$_2$NiSe$_7$ (TNS) in the charge-density-wave (CDW) regime. CDW transition temperature ($T_{CDW}$) and carrier density are proportional and inversely proportional to residual resistance ratio of samples, respectively. Such relation helps to understand the unique CDW order therein. High-$T_{CDW}$ TNS exhibits negative first-harmonic magnetoresistance (MR$^{1\omega}$) under a magnetic field ($B$) parallel to the direction of alternating current ($I^{\omega}$), which may arise from the anomalous velocity induced by the Berry curvature of three-dimensional topological bands near the Fermi level. As $T_{CDW}$ drops, a positive-to-negative MR$^{1\omega}$ transition is observed with decreasing perpendicular $B$, which is likely due to the contribution of Zeeman effect on current pathways in the disordered system. Moreover, interestingly, the second-harmonic nonlinear signals are suppressed, while the third-harmonic signals are significant and sensitive to both $B$ and $T_{CDW}$. Such observations, together with scaling analysis, suggest the quantum geometry quadrupole at play and the modulation of disorder on third-order nonlinearity. Our results pave an avenue for tailoring distinct-order magnetoresistive phases in disordered topological materials.

Title: Chiral-phonon generation of orbital currents in light transition metals

Abstract: Orbital angular momentum offers a new channel for information transport in a vast set of materials. Its coherent generation and detection remain, however, largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that chiral surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generate sizable orbital currents in light-metal/ferromagnet bilayers through both the acoustic orbital Hall effect and acoustic orbital pumping. Using symmetry analysis of SAW-driven voltages, we disentangle vorticity-sensitive orbital currents arising from lattice rotation in the non-magnetic layer from angular-momentum pumping from the ferromagnet. Strong signals are observed only in nickel/chromium and nickel/titanium, while nickel/aluminum and all cobalt-based bilayers show negligible responses, revealing the critical roles of orbital Hall conductivity, phonon-orbital coupling, and interfacial orbital transparency. Comparison with spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and second-harmonic measurements -- where electrically driven orbital angular momentum are weaker -- demonstrates that phonon excitation generates orbital currents more efficiently. These results establish chiral SAWs as an effective route for orbitronic functionality and open pathways toward phonon-controlled orbital magnetism.

Title: An extended low-frequency noise compact model for single-layer graphene FETs including correlated mobility fluctuations effect
Authors: Nikolaos Mavredakis, Anibal Pacheco-Sanchez, David Jimenez
Abstract: Correlated mobility fluctuations are considered in the physics-based carrier number fluctuation deltaN low-frequency noise (LFN) compact model of single-layer graphene field effect transistors (GFET) in the present study. Trapped charge density and Coulomb scattering coefficient deltaN LFN parameters are obtained after applying a parameter extraction methodology, adapted from conventional silicon technologies, to the linear ambipolar regions of GFETs. Appropriate adjustments are considered in the method according to GFETs physical characteristics. Afterwards, Hooge mobility as well as series resistance fluctuations LFN parameters can be extracted. The updated LFN model is validated with experimental data from various long and short-channel GFETs at an extended range of gate and drain bias conditions.

Title: Rheological Parameter Identification in Granular Materials Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks
Authors: Barbara Baldoni, Mickaël Delcey, Yoann Cheny, Adrien Gans, Mathieu Jenny, Sébastien Kiesgen de Richter
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising tool for fluid dynamics, particularly for flow reconstruction and parameter identification. In the context of granular media, accurately estimating rheological parameters remains a major challenge, as it typically requires complex and costly experimental setups. In this work, we propose a PINN-based approach to identify key rheological parameters of granular materials using a simple experiment: the granular column collapse. A proof of concept is presented using synthetic data, where the PINN is trained to infer the flow fields while simultaneously recovering the rheological parameters. Beyond parameter identification, the method also enables reconstruction of the pressure field, which is difficult to access experimentally. The results highlight the potential of PINNs for data-driven rheometry of granular materials and open perspectives for future applications with real experimental data.

Title: Sub-diffraction-resolved spatial distribution of emitting excitons in STM-induced luminescence of 2D semiconductors via Richardson-Lucy deconvolution
Authors: Elysé Laurent, Ricardo Javier Peña Román, Sarah Miller, Aditi Raman Moghe, Etienne Lorchat, Séverine Le Moal, Elizabeth Boer-Duchemin, Luiz Fernando Zagonel, Stéphane Berciaud, Eric Le Moal
Abstract: Using scanning tunneling microscopy-induced luminescence (STML), the optical properties of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors may be investigated at the nanoscale. This is possible because the tunneling current under the tip is an extremely localized electrical excitation source. However, in most STML applications, the spatial distribution of the emission relative to the excitation point is unresolved. Yet this distribution contains key information about how the interaction of excitons with injected charge carriers affects the luminescence of these materials, and about exciton transport. Resolving this spatial distribution at the nanoscale is relevant both for a fundamental understanding of exciton physics and for device applications; yet it remains a significant challenge. In this work, we resolve the spatial distribution of the emission beyond the diffraction limit of light by deconvolving real-space optical microscopy images of the STML using an iterative algorithm, i.e., Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution. To showcase this technique, we apply it to the STML of monolayer tungsten diselenide ($\mathrm{WSe_2}$) and tungsten disulfide ($\mathrm{WS_2}$). Thus, we highlight hitherto ignored or misunderstood aspects of STML on 2D semiconductors related to exciton and charge carrier transport, namely the dependence of the spatial distribution of emission on the tunnel current setpoint and the origin of the emission from hot spots located micrometers from the excitation source.

Title: Many interacting particles in solution. I. Screening-ranged expansions of electrostatic potential and energy
Authors: Sergii V. Siryk, Walter Rocchia
Abstract: We present an analytical many-body formalism for systems of spherical particles carrying arbitrary free charge distributions and interacting in a polarizable electrolyte solution, that we model within the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann framework. Building on the detailed spectral analysis of the associated nonstandard Neumann--Poincaré-type operators developed in our companion study~\cite{supplem_pre_math}, we construct exact explicit expansions of the electrostatic potential and energy in ascending orders of Debye screening thereby obtaining systematic "screening-ranged" series for potentials and energies. These screening-ranged expansions provide a unified and tractable description of many-body electrostatics. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by showing how it generalizes and improves upon both classical and modern methods, enabling rigorous treatment of heterogeneously charged systems (such as Janus particles) and accurate modeling of higher-order phenomena (such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, like-charge attraction) as well as yielding many-body generalizations to analytical explicit results previously known only in the two-body setting.

Title: Decay of spin helices in XXZ quantum spin chains with single-ion anisotropy
Authors: Florian Lange, Frank Göhmann, Gerhard Wellein, Holger Fehske
Abstract: Long-lived spin-helix states facilitate the study of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum magnets. We consider the decay of transverse spin-helices in antiferromagnetic spin-$S$ XXZ chains with single-ion anisostropy. The spin-helix decay is observable in the time evolution of the local magnetization that we calculate numerically for the system in the thermodynamic limit using infinite time-evolving block decimation simulations. Although the single-ion anisotropy prevents helix states from being eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, they still can be long-lived for appropriately chosen wave numbers. In case of an easy-axis exchange anisotropy the single-ion anisotropy may even stabilize the helices. Within a spin-wave approximation, we obtain a condition giving an estimate for the most stable wave number $Q$ that agrees qualitatively with our numerical results.

Title: The unexpected dewetting during growth of silicene flakes with dendritic pyramids
Authors: Kejian Wang, Mathieu Abel, Filippo Fabbri, Mathieu Koudia (IM2NP), Adrien Michon, Adam Hassan Denawi, Holger Vach, Isabelle Berbezier, Jean-Noël Aqua (SU, INSP)
Abstract: Silicene growth on graphene has emerged as a novel method for fabricating silicon-based van der Waals heterostructures. However, the silicene flakes produced in this manner are the result of an exotic growth mode characterized by metastable nanostructures with varying degrees of deviation from equilibrium, with large two-dimensional flakes surrounded by a rim that coexist with small 3D islands, and, at large deposits, thick dendritic pyramids separated by a denuded zone. In order to rationalize and control this growth, a model is derived that revisits the dewetting thermodynamics and considers generally ignored adsorption and step-edge energies. The model is investigated using kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations and mean-field rate equations, and implemented by close inspection of microscopy images. This model perfectly reproduces the experimental outcomes, unveiling an anomalous growth mode, and provides guidelines on experimental conditions for high-quality silicene growth.

Title: Modeling the Effects of Slip, Twinning, and Notch on the Deformation of Single-Crystal Austenitic Manganese Steel
Authors: Saketh Virupakshi, Xinzhu Zheng, Karol Frydrych, Ibrahim Karaman, Ankit Srivastava, Katarzyna Kowalczyk-Gajewska
Abstract: The objective of this work is to deconvolute the interaction of slip, twinning, and notch on the deformation response of an austenitic manganese (Hadfield) steel using detailed finite element simulations. The simulations employ a rate-dependent crystal plasticity constitutive model that incorporates both slip and twinning deformation mechanisms. The model accounts for the spatially non-uniform appearance of new twin-related orientations, hardening due to slip--twin interactions, and modified properties of the twinned crystal. Limited experiments on single-crystal dog-bone and single-edge notch specimens, with two crystal orientations, are also conducted to aid the simulation. Several features of the experimental observations are accurately captured in the simulations. For example, simulations accurately capture distinct stress--strain responses associated with different crystallographic orientations, including variations in initial hardening behavior followed by either decreasing or increasing hardening depending on the dominant deformation mechanisms. The simulation also captures the observed orientation-dependent asymmetric deformation of the notch in single-edge notch specimens. Additionally, by selectively activating deformation mechanisms, the role of twinning is isolated and its influence on both global and local response is clearly demonstrated. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of how deformation mode interactions and local geometry (i.e., notch) influence the response of these materials.

Title: Synthesis, Growth Mechanism, and Photocatalytic Properties of Metallic-Bi/Bi13S18Br2 Nano-Bell Heterostructures
Authors: Anna Cabona, Stefano Toso, Andrea Griesi, Martina Rizzo, Michele Ferri, Pascal Rusch, Giorgio Divitini, Julia Perez-Prieto, Raquel E. Galian, Ilka Kriegel, Liberato Manna
Abstract: We report the synthesis of bell-shaped Bi/Bi13S18Br2 metal/semiconductor heterostructures as a photocatalyst based on non-toxic and Earth-abundant elements. Their unique morphology arises from a multi-step growth process, involving 1) the nucleation of Bi13S18Br2 nanorods, 2) the reduction of a metallic-Bi domain on their surface induced by N,N-didodecylmethylamine, and 3) the heterostructure accretion by a localized reaction at the Bi/Bi13S18Br2 interface promoted by Ostwald ripening. These heterostructures display remarkable stability in polar solvents, remaining almost unaffected by prolonged exposure to isopropanol and water, and exhibit high photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of organic dyes (i.e., Rhodamine-B and Methylene Blue) under visible-light irradiation, with good recyclability. Additionally, preliminary tests demonstrate CO2 reduction capabilities, which make them promising for both the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and photo-electro CO2 conversion. The straightforward synthesis process and the use of non-toxic and earth-abundant elements offers significant potential for sustainable energy conversion technologies.

Title: Benchmarking First-Principles Approaches for Extracting Magnetic Exchange Interactions
Authors: Nafise Rezaei, Artem R. Oganov, Ali Ghojavand, Milorad V. Milošević, Mojtaba Alaei
Abstract: Magnetic exchange interactions govern the macroscopic magnetic behavior of solids and underpin both fundamental spin phenomena and emerging technologies. The accurate and efficient determination of these interactions is therefore critical for predictive modeling of magnetic materials. Here we present a systematic first-principles comparison of three widely used approaches-the Least-Squares Total Energy (LSTE), the Four-State Total Energy (FSTE), and the Green's function-based Liechtenstein \textit{et al.} (LKAG) methods-applied to thirteen antiferromagnetic compounds. We introduce an framework for identifying the minimal supercells required for an accurate exchange parameter extraction in the FSTE method, significantly reducing computational cost while preserving precision. Our results show that LSTE and FSTE yield nearly identical exchange parameters, whereas the LKAG method reproduces the dominant exchange interactions but exhibits quantitative deviations. A detailed analysis of computational efficiency versus accuracy reveals that the LSTE scheme offers the most favorable balance, establishing a general, reproducible, and scalable workflow for Heisenberg mapping, while the FSTE approach remains the most straightforward for extracting specific exchange interactions.

Title: Core@Shell AgBr@CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals as Precursors to Hollow Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocubes
Authors: Zhanzhao Li, Yurii P. Ivanov, Anna Cabona, Andrea Fratelli, Stefano Toso, Saptarshi Chakraborty, Giorgio Divitini, Ilka Kriegel, Sergio Brovelli, Liberato Manna
Abstract: We report the synthesis of colloidal core@shell AgBr@CsPbBr3 nanocubes by a one-pot approach, where the nucleation and growth of AgBr nanocrystals occurs rapidly after the injection of chemical precursors. This is immediately followed by the overgrowth of CsPbBr3, delivering AgBr@CsPbBr3 nanocubes of several tens of nanometers in size, with the volume of the AgBr core being only a small fraction of the overall nanocrystal volume. The formation of a core@shell geometry is facilitated by the epitaxial compatibility between AgBr and CsPbBr3 along multiple crystallographic directions. Exchange with Cl- ions leads to Ag@CsPbCl3 nanocubes, whereas exchange with I- ions leads to hollow CsPbI3 nanocubes, due to selective etching of the AgBr (or Ag) core region by the I- ions diffusing in the nanocubes. These hollow CsPbI3 nanocubes can then be converted into hollow CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 nanocubes by halide exchange. The optical emission properties of the hollow CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) nanocubes are in line with those expected from large, non-hollow halide perovskite nanocrystals, indicating that the small hollow region in the cubes has no major influence on their optical properties.

Title: Exogenous Metal Cations in the Synthesis of CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals and their Interplay with Tertiary Amines
Authors: Zhanzhao Li, Luca Goldoni, Ye Wu, Muhammad Imran, Yurii P. Ivanov, Giorgio Divitini, Juliette Zito, Iyyappa Rajan Panneerselvam, Dmitry Baranov, Ivan Infante, Luca De Trizio, Liberato Manna
Abstract: Current syntheses of CsPbBr3 halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) rely on over-stoichiometric amounts of Pb2+ precursors, resulting in unreacted lead ions at the end of the process. In our synthesis scheme of CsPbBr3 NCs we replaced excess Pb2+ with different exogenous metal cations (M) and investigated their effect on the synthesis products. These cations can be divided into two groups: group 1 delivers monodisperse CsPbBr3 cubes capped with oleate species (as for the case when Pb2+ is used in excess) and with photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 90% with some cations (for example with M= In3+); group 2 yields irregularly shaped CsPbBr3 NCs with broad size distributions. In both cases, the addition of a tertiary ammonium cation (didodecylmethyl ammonium, DDMA+) during the synthesis, after the nucleation of the NCs, reshapes the NCs to monodisperse truncated cubes. Such NCs feature a mixed oleate/DDMA+ surface termination with PLQY values up to 90%. For group 1 cations, this happens only if the ammonium cation is directly added as a salt (DDMA-Br) while for group 2 cations this happens even if the corresponding tertiary amine (DDMA) is added, instead of DDMA-Br. This is attributed to the fact that only group 2 cations can facilitate the protonation of DDMA by the excess oleic acid present in the reaction environment. In all cases studied, the incorporation of M cations is marginal and the reshaping of the NCs is only transient: if the reactions are run for a long time the truncated cubes evolve to cubes.

Title: Single-Particle X-ray Scattering Reveals a High Local Supersaturation of Precursors as the Origin of CoO Assembly Formation

Abstract: Single-particle small-angle X-ray scattering (SP-SAXS) enables quantitative morphological analysis by recording diffraction snapshots from isolated particles using X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses. Unlike conventional X-ray techniques, which average over the entire illuminated sample volume, SP-SAXS resolves low-contrast, less abundant, or transient species within heterogeneous particle populations that would otherwise remain hidden. Here, we apply SP-SAXS to investigate the solvothermal formation of CoO nanocrystal assemblies from a Co(acac)$_3$ precursor in benzyl alcohol. The single-particle data reveal amorphous, uniform-density Co(acac)$_2$ spheres as transient intermediates that directly crystallize into cavernous CoO nanocrystal assemblies, which explains why CoO forms as hierarchical aggregates rather than as isolated nanocrystals. These results demonstrate that SP-SAXS provides a powerful framework for disentangling morphological heterogeneity in nanoparticle formation processes.

Authors: Michał J. Winiarski, Dominik Walczak, Szymon Królak, Duygu Yazici, Robert J. Cava, Tomasz Klimczuk
Abstract: We report the synthesis and physical properties of a polycrystalline, hexagonal boride YRu$_3$B$_2$. Our resistivity and heat capacity measurements indicate that YRu$_3$B$_2$ is a weakly coupled superconductor, with critical temperature $T_c$ = 0.63 K and upper critical field $\mu_0 H_{c2}$ (0)=0.11 T. Density functional theory calculations, together with chemical-bonding analysis, reveal that the electronic states at and near the Fermi energy level are dominated by the Ru kagome sublattice.

Title: Effect of thermal fluctuations on topological crossover in the chiral d+id superconducting phase
Authors: A.G. Groshev, A.K. Arzhnikov
Abstract: The effect of thermal fluctuations on the temperature dependence of the topological index C1 of the chiral d+id superconducting phase of a two-dimensional single-band model on a triangular lattice is investigated. Thermal fluctuations are taken into account within the framework of the self-consistent functional-integral theory. It is established that when the nodal points are located far inside (outside) the Fermi contour of the normal phase, thermal fluctuations expand the relative temperature ranges in which the values of the topological index are close to integer values C1=4(-2). This expansion depends both on the value of the topological index and on the magnitude of the effective attraction between the electrons. However, as the nodal points approach the Fermi contour, topological crossovers to new C1 values are observed, which can persist over a wide temperature range. The nature and degree of influence of thermal fluctuations on these crossovers are established. It is assumed that the observed effects may also manifest in the edge state behavior of a similar system with open boundaries.

Title: Supercritical-subcritical correspondence, asymmetric effects and antisymmetric corrections near a critical point
Authors: Xinyang Li, Yuliang Jin
Abstract: The second-order phase transitions in the Ising model and liquid-gas systems share a universality class and critical exponents, despite the absence of $Z_2$ symmetry in the liquid-gas Hamiltonian. This discrepancy highlights a central puzzle in critical phenomena: what is the influence of asymmetry on scaling laws? For over a century, this question has been explored through examining violations of the empirical ``rectilinear diameter law'' for the subcritical coexistence curve, where asymmetry could generate singular corrections. Here, we extend this investigation to the supercritical regime. We propose a supercritical-subcritical correspondence, drawing a formal analogy between the subcritical coexistence curve and recently defined supercritical boundary lines ($L^\pm$ lines). Our theory predicts that the linear mixing of physical fields - a hallmark of asymmetric systems - produces universal scaling corrections, with antisymmetric coefficients, in these supercritical loci. We verify these predictions using liquid-gas data from the NIST database and a model liquid-liquid transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same asymmetric scaling framework governs the behavior of higher-order cumulants in the order parameter distribution.

Title: Microwave Signature of the Emerging Abrikosov Lattice Above $H_{c2}$
Authors: Hang Zhou, Zhanghai Chen, A. A. Varlamov, Andreas Glatz, Yuriy Yerin
Abstract: The emergence of the Abrikosov lattice in the normal phase of type-II superconducting films when the magnetic field approaches the critical field $H_{c2}$ from above was predicted in Ref.~\cite{GVV2011}. In the quantum fluctuation regime \cite{GL2001} it is characterized by the formation of relatively large (with sizes of order $\xi_{\mathrm{QF}} \sim \xi_{\mathrm{BCS}}\sqrt{H_{c2}/(H-H_{c2})}$) ``long lived'' (lifetime of order $\tau_{\mathrm{QF}} \sim \hbar \Delta^{-1} H_{c2}/(H-H_{c2})$) clusters of rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs - signatures of developing Abrikosov vortices. We demonstrate that these fluctuation-induced vortex clusters, previously considered unobservable due to their ultrafast dynamics and weak (only logarithmically singular) contribution to the dc-conductivity, can in fact be detected through their distinct electromagnetic signature. By analyzing the high-frequency electromagnetic response of these rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs above the second critical field in superconducting film, we predict a pronounced and measurable enhancement in the imaginary part of the ac-conductivity arising directly from quantum fluctuations. This enhancement is expected to occur at characteristic frequencies $\omega_{QF} \sim \hbar^{-1}\Delta(H-H_{c2})/H_{c2}$, which are well below the superconducting threshold at $2\hbar^{-1}\Delta $, where a similar increase in imaginary conductivity occurs in the superconducting phase. For niobium, a prototypical type II superconductor, $\omega_{QF}$ lies in the experimentally accessible microwave range, making the effect directly testable with modern microwave spectroscopy.

Title: MBE obtained n-CdO:Eu p-Si heterojunctions - electron beam induced profiling, electrical and structural properties
Authors: E Przezdziecka, I Perlikowski, S Chusnutdinow, A Wierzbicka, A Adhikari, M Stachowicz, R Jakiela, E Zielony, P Wojnar, A Kozanecki
Abstract: The present investigation reports on the fabrication and characterization of heterojunctions based on in situ Eu doped CdO layers, which were deposited on p-type silicon using the plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA MBE) method. The structural and optical properties of the cadmium oxide (CdO) films were investigated using X ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The CdO Eu films are polycrystalline. The electrical properties of the p n heterojunction composed of transparent n CdO Eu and p Si semiconductors were investigated by current voltage and electron beam-induced current (EBIC) measurements. Current voltage measurements demonstrate good junction characteristics with a rectifying ratio of 20 . EBIC measurements allowed us to calculate the diffusion length of minority carriers and the precise location of the depleted area at the CdO and Si interfaces.

Title: Anisotropic transport in ballistic bilayer graphene cavities
Authors: Florian Schoeppl, Alina Mrenca-Kolasinska, Ming-Hao Liu, Korbinian Schwarzmaier, Klaus Richter, Angelika Knothe
Abstract: Closing the gap between ray tracing simulations and experimentally observed electron jetting in bilayer graphene (BLG), we study all-electronic, gate-defined BLG cavities using tight-binding simulations and semiclassical equations of motion. Such cavities offer a rich playground to investigate anisotropic electron transport due to the trigonally warped Fermi surfaces. In this work, we achieve two things: First, we verify the existence of triangular modes (as predicted by classical ray tracing calculations) in the quantum solutions of closed circular BLG cavities. Then, we explore signatures of said triangular modes in transport through open BLG cavities connected to leads. We show that the triangular symmetry translates into anisotropic transport and present an optimal setup for experimental detection of the triangular modes as well as for controlled modulation of transport in preferred directions.

Title: Nonequilibrium Photocarrier and Phonon Dynamics from First Principles: a Unified Treatment of Carrier-Carrier, Carrier-Phonon, and Phonon-Phonon Scattering
Authors: Stefano Mocatti, Giovanni Marini, Giulio Volpato, Pierluigi Cudazzo, Matteo Calandra
Abstract: We develop a first-principles many-body framework to describe the dynamics of photocarriers and phonons in semiconductors following ultrafast excitation. Our approach incorporates explicit ab initio light-matter coupling and first-principles collision integrals for carrier-carrier, carrier-phonon, and phonon-phonon scattering. It also yields time-dependent quasiparticle and phonon frequency renormalizations, along with light-induced coherent atomic motion. The equations of motion are solved in a maximally localized Wannier basis, ensuring gauge-consistent scattering integrals and ultradense momentum sampling, thereby enabling direct comparison with pump-probe experiments. The method can be coupled to constrained density-functional theory to access light-induced structural phase transitions at longer times after the light pulse. We showcase the capabilities and predictive power of this framework on MoS$_2$ and h-BN monolayers. For MoS$_2$, we resolve photoinduced renormalizations of electronic and lattice properties, ultrafast carrier relaxation, hot-phonon dynamics, and displacive coherent atomic motion. Including carrier-carrier scattering is crucial to obtain realistic photocarrier equilibration times, while omitting phonon-phonon scattering leads to incorrect long-time lattice thermalization and a factor of two larger A$_{1g}$ coherent phonon damping time. For h-BN, we quantify photoinduced changes in the electronic, optical, and lattice responses in quasi-equilibrium, demonstrating a fluence-dependent enhancement of screening and melting of excitonic features.

Title: Operator Lanczos Approach enabling Neural Quantum States as Real-Frequency Impurity Solvers
Authors: Jonas B. Rigo, Markus Schmitt
Abstract: To understand the intricate exchange between electrons of different bands in strongly correlated materials, it is essential to treat multi-orbital models accurately. For this purpose, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) provides an established framework, whose scope crucially hinges on the availability of efficient quantum impurity solvers. Here we present a real-frequency impurity solver based on neural quantum states (NQS) combined with an operator-Lanczos construction. NQS are an asymptotically unbiased variational ground-state ansatz that employs neural networks to capture long-range correlations on complicated graph structures. We leverage this ability to solve multi-orbital impurity problems using a systematically improvable Segmented Commutator Operator-Lanczos (SCOL) construction. Our benchmarks on both the single-orbital Anderson model and the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori impurity Hamiltonian reveal excellent ground-state precision and the capacity to accurately resolve zero temperature spectral functions and self-energies. These results open avenues for extending DMFT to more challenging problems.

Title: Surface-modes mediated long-range radiative heat transfer through a plasmonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain
Authors: A. Naeimi, F. Herz, S.-A. Biehs
Abstract: We study the radiative heat transfer through a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain of plasmonic InSb nanoparticles in close vicinity of an InSb substrate. We show how the frequency bands of the in- plane and out-of-plane modes in the chain are deformed by the coupling to the surface waves in the InSb substrate by considering different carrier concentrations. By calculating the Zak phase we show that also in the presence of the substrate there is a topological phase transition and that topologically protected edge modes emerge for finite chains. Finally, we demonstrate the long-range heat transport along the chain due to the coupling to the surface waves of the sample. We find an enhanced heat transfer in the topological non-trivial phase compared to the trivial phase due to the contribution of the edge modes.

Title: Observation of Raman anomaly and characterization of magnetic phases in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$
Authors: Sreelakshmi M. Nair, Aabhaas Vineet Mallik, R. S. Patel
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ has garnered significant interest due to its high Curie temperature (T$_C$), large saturation magnetization, and complex magnetic behavior arising, in part, from multiple inequivalent iron sites and vacancies. While several aspects of its complex magnetic and structural characteristics have been examined through careful experiments and first principles studies, much of it remains debatable. In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive temperature-dependent Raman spectrum for bulk Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ and in the process reveal an interesting peak shift anomaly at 150 K. We discuss the possible relationship of this Raman anomaly with the anomalous lattice expansion reported earlier for this material at around 110 K. The impact of the anomalous lattice expansion on the magnetic anisotropy in this van der Waals material is also revealed by an isothermal magnetization analysis. These findings will prove crucial for the use of Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ in high-performance spintronic devices.

Title: Engineering Topological Bands in Strained Covalent Organic Frameworks
Authors: Rebecca Peake, Zoé Truyens, Jan Mol, Christian B Nielsen, David Beljonne, David Cornil, Owen Benton
Abstract: The tunability of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) opens opportunities to engineer topological electronic phases, including topological insulators (TIs) and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs)--materials that host in-gap states localized at their edges, hinges, or corners. Here we explore how chemically feasible perturbations can drive triazine-based COFs (CTFs) into topological regimes. Using a tight-binding model on the Honeycomb lattice inspired by the frontier electronic states of CTFs, we show that introducing an effective uniaxial strain--implemented as a modulation of electron hopping on a subset of bonds--can generate a series of distinct topological band structures. This effect can be realized in practice through chemical substitution of linkers along the strained bonds. First-principles calculations demonstrate that replacing biphenyl with pyrene linkers drives a CTF to the brink of a HOTI phase, suggesting a viable route toward topological band-structure engineering in COFs.

Title: Many interacting particles in solution. II. Screening-ranged expansion of electrostatic forces
Authors: Sergii V. Siryk, Walter Rocchia
Abstract: We present a fully analytical integration of the Maxwell stress tensor and derive exact relations for interparticle forces in systems of multiple dielectric spheres immersed in a polarizable ionic solvent, within the framework of the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann theory. Building upon the screening-ranged (in ascending orders of Debye screening) expansions of the potentials developed and rigorously analyzed in the accompanying works \cite{supplem_pre,supplem_pre_math,supplem_prl}, we construct exact screening-ranged many-body expansions for electrostatic forces in explicit analytical form. These results establish a rigorous foundation for evaluating screened electrostatic interactions in complex particle systems and provide direct analytical connections to, and systematic improvements upon, various earlier approximate or limited-case formulations available in the literature, both at zero and finite ionic strength.

Title: Many interacting particles in solution. III. Spectral analysis of the associated Neumann--Poincaré-type operators
Authors: Sergii V. Siryk, Walter Rocchia
Abstract: The interaction of particles in an electrolytic medium can be calculated by solving the Poisson equation inside the solutes and the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation in the solvent, with suitable boundary conditions at the interfaces. Analytical approaches often expand the potentials in spherical harmonics, relating interior and exterior coefficients and eliminating some coefficients in favor of others, but a rigorous spectral analysis of the corresponding formulations is still lacking. Here, we introduce composite many-body Neumann--Poincaré-type operators and prove that they are compact with spectral radii strictly less than one. These results provide the foundation for systematic screening-ranged expansions, in powers of the Debye screening parameters, of electrostatic potentials, interaction energies, and forces, and establish the analytical framework for the accompanying works~\cite{supplem_prl,supplem_pre,supplem_pre_force}.

Title: Calibration of a DEM contact model for wet industrial granular materials
Authors: Sahar Pourandi, P. Christian van der Sande, Igor A. Ostanin, Thomas Weinhart
Abstract: This study presents and calibrates a Discrete Element Method (DEM) contact model for wet granular materials in the pendular regime. The model extends a previously calibrated dry contact formulation by incorporating liquid bridges that generate capillary adhesion between particles, while liquid migration is represented through evolving bridge volumes. Two reactor-grade polypropylene powders with different particle size distributions, bulk densities, and surface morphologies are investigated, resulting in distinct wetting behavior. A schematic framework is introduced to relate increasing liquid content to the transition from dry to wet contacts using two key parameters: the minimum liquid film volume and the maximum liquid bridge volume. These parameters are calibrated using dynamic angle of repose measurements from rotating drum experiments. The calibrated model reproduces the experimental flow behavior of both powders: full agreement is obtained for the coarser, more porous powder across all liquid contents, while for the finer, denser powder, agreement is achieved at low to moderate liquid contents. At higher liquid contents, discrepancies arise due to agglomeration effects amplified by particle scaling. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic angle of repose as a calibration target and highlight the limitations of particle scaling for strongly cohesive wet granular systems. The proposed framework provides a practical basis for DEM-based modeling of wet powder flow in industrial processes.

Title: Order parameter for non-mean-field spin glasses
Authors: Michele Castellana
Abstract: We propose a novel renormalization group (RG) method for non mean-field models of spin glasses, which leads to the emergence of a novel order parameter. Unlike previous approaches where the RG procedure is based on a priori notions on the system, our analysis follows a minimality principle, where no a priori assumption is made. We apply our approach to a spin-glass model built on a hierarchical lattice. In the RG decimation procedure, a novel order parameter spontaneously emerges from the system symmetries, and self-similarity features of the RG transformation only. This order parameter is the projection of the spin configurations on the ground state of the system. Kadanoff's majority rule for ferromagnetic systems is replaced by a more complex scheme, which involves such novel order parameter. The ground state thus acts as a pattern which translates spin configurations from one length scale to another. The rescaling RG procedure is based on a minimal, information-theory approach and, combined with the decimation, it yields a complete RG transformation. Below the upper critical dimension, the predictions for the critical exponent $\nu$, which describes the critical divergence of the correlation length, are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations from both this and previous studies. Overall, this study opens new avenues in the understanding of the critical ordering of realistic spin glasses, and it can be applied to spin-glass models on a cubic lattice and nearest-neighbor couplings which directly model spin-glass materials, such as AuFe, CuMn and other magnetic alloys.

Title: Diffusion and relaxation of topological excitations in layered spin liquids
Authors: Aprem P. Joy, Roman Lange, Achim Rosch
Abstract: Relaxation processes in topological phases such as quantum spin liquids are controlled by the dynamics and interaction of fractionalized excitations. In layered materials hosting two-dimensional topological phases, elementary quasiparticles can diffuse freely within the layer, whereas only pairs (or more) can hop between layers - a fundamental consequence of topological order. Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity. A uniform excitation density created on the surface of a sample spreads subdiffusively into the bulk with a mean depth $\bar z$ scaling as $\sim t^{1/3}$ when annihilation processes are absent. The propagation becomes logarithmic, $\bar z \sim \log t$, when pair-annihilation is allowed. Furthermore, pair-diffusion between layers leads to a new decay law for the total density, $n(t) \sim (\log^2 t)/t$ - slower than in a purely $2d$ system. We discuss possible experimental implications for pump-probe experiments in samples of finite width.

Title: Computational Screening and Discovery of Silver-Indium Halide Double Salts
Authors: Christos Tyrpenou, G. Krishnamurthy Grandhi, Paola Vivo, Mikaël Kepenekian, George Volonakis
Abstract: Perovskite-inspired materials have emerged as promising candidates for both outdoor and indoor photovoltaic applications owing to their favorable optoelectronic properties and reduced toxicity. Here, we employ the experimentally realized AgBiI$_4$ double salt as a structural prototype and replace Bi$^{3+}$ with In$^{3+}$ to design a novel lead-free halide compound, AgInI$_4$. First-principles calculations predict that AgInI$_4$ is both chemically and dynamically stable, exhibiting a direct band gap of 1.72 eV, comparable to its bismuth analogue. However, its predicted photovoltaic performance, evaluated using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency metric, is lower under both solar and LED illumination. This reduction arises primarily from symmetry-forbidden optical transitions and the absence of Bi-derived 6s$^2$ lone-pair states at the valence band maximum. High-throughput screening of the Ag-In-I ternary phase-space reveals several more stable and metastable compounds that fall into two structural families: tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated, with characteristic band gaps near 3.0 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. Despite multiple synthetic attempts, the predicted AgInI$_4$ phase could not be experimentally realized, underscoring the challenges of stabilizing indium-based halide double salts. While these materials are unlikely to serve as efficient photovoltaic absorbers, their tunable band gaps and stability make them promising candidates for charge transport and other optoelectronic applications.

Title: Disentangling the unusual magnetic anisotropy of the near-room-temperature ferromagnet Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$
Authors: Riju Pal, Joyal J. Abraham, Alexander Mistonov, Swarnamayee Mishra, Nina Stilkerich, Suchanda Mondal, Prabhat Mandal, Atindra Nath Pal, Jochen Geck, Bernd Büchner, Vladislav Kataev, Alexey Alfonsov
Abstract: In the quest for two-dimensional conducting materials with high ferromagnetic ordering temperature the new family of the layered Fe$_{n}$GeTe$_{2}$ compounds, especially the near-room-temperature ferromagnet Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$, receives a significant attention. Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$ features a peculiar spin reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR} \sim 110$ K suggesting a non-trivial temperature evolution of the magnetic anisotropy (MA) - one of the main contributors to the stabilization of the magnetic order in the low-D systems. An electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopic study reported here provides quantitative insights into the unusual magnetic anisotropy of Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$. At high temperatures the total MA is mostly given by the demagnetization effect with a small contribution of the counteracting intrinsic magnetic anisotropy of an easy-axis type, whose growth below a characteristic temperature $T_{\rm shape} \sim 150$ K renders the sample seemingly isotropic at $T_\mathrm{SR}$. Below one further temperature $T_{\rm d} \sim 50$ K the intrinsic MA becomes even more complex. Importantly, all the characteristic temperatures found in the ESR experiment match those observed in transport measurements, suggesting an inherent coupling between magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom in Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$. This finding together with the observed signatures of the intrinsic two-dimensionality should facilitate optimization routes for the use of Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$ in the magneto-electronic devices, potentially even in the monolayer limit.

Title: Fluctuation-Induced Supersolidity at the Superfluid-Solid Interface
Authors: Baptiste Coquinot, Ragheed Alhyder, Alberto Cappellaro, Mikhail Lemeshko
Abstract: Supersolidity, combining superfluid and crystalline orders, has been realized in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates by tuning interatomic interactions. Here we show that supersolidity can also emerge from mode coupling at a superfluid-solid interface, without modifying bulk interactions and for a broad class of superfluids. Using an analytical and numerical treatment of the coupled superfluid and phonon fields, we derive the criterion for a density-modulation instability driven by interfacial coupling and dependent on dimensionality. In superfluid helium, the instability first appears at the roton mode, while in a Bose-Einstein condensate with contact interactions it occurs at the lowest accessible wave vector set by the system size. Beyond the threshold, the ground state acquires an interfacial density modulation while the bulk remains superfluid, forming a hybrid superfluid-supersolid phase. Our results identify interfacial mode coupling as a promising route to supersolidity, enabling the simultaneous exploitation of interfacial supersolid and bulk superfluid quantum properties.

Title: Two-phase hydrodynamic model of active colloid motion
Authors: A. Kiverin, S. Luguev, I. Yakovenko
Abstract: The paper presents a two-phase hydrodynamic model for the numerical simulation of collective motion in a thin layer of active colloids containing spherical microswimmers. The model accounts for three fundamental mechanisms governing the dynamics of the active colloid: the random motion of the microswimmers, their mutual collisions, and their interaction with the surrounding fluid phase. The accurate resolution of the characteristic time scales associated with each mechanism is crucial for reproducing the different dynamic modes. The model reproduces two primary modes of motion: Brownian and collective, as well as the transition between them. It is demonstrated that hydrodynamic interactions begin to play a significant role when the microswimmer velocity exceeds a critical threshold. At this point, the kinetic energy transferred to the fluid phase is sufficient to generate a noticeable feedback effect on the swimmers' motion. Conversely, a further increase in microswimmers' velocity enhances the role of collisions, causing the system to revert from a collective mode back to a Brownian-like state. A similar transition occurs at higher volume fractions of microswimmers within the colloid.

Title: Spontaneous Ratchet Currents and Transition Dynamics in Active Wetting
Authors: Noah Grodzinski, Robert L. Jack, Michael E. Cates
Abstract: Self-propelled particles accumulate on repulsive barriers in so-called active wetting, but the relationship between this process and equilibrium wetting remains unclear. Using an exact (noiseless) hydrodynamic framework for an active lattice gas, we show, using a slit geometry with periodic boundary conditions, that active matter exhibits both fully- and partially-wet states, with a critical wetting transition between them. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking ratchet current in the partially wet state, leading to departure of the bulk densities from their binodal values and the emergence of a novel dynamical pathway for the full-to-partial wetting transition. We elucidate this modified dynamical pathway using a minimal model. The results, while establishing a direct connection between active and equilibrium wetting, also identify the nonequilibrium consequences of activity.

Title: Triangular $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg Antiferromagnet in a Magnetic Field
Authors: Thomas Bader, Shi Feng, Sasank Budaraju, Federico Becca, Johannes Knolle, Frank Pollmann
Abstract: The behavior of the paradigmatic $J_1-J_2$ triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a magnetic field remains unsettled despite decades of study. We map out the phase diagram using three complementary approaches, including self-consistent nonlinear spin-wave theory, density-matrix renormalization group, and variational Monte Carlo. This combined analysis resolves the competition among different field-induced magnetic orders and magnetization plateaux across the classically frustrated parameter range. In particular, there is a finite range in the parameter regime around $J_2/J_1=\frac{1}{8}$ in which i) upon the application of the external field, the gapless quantum spin liquid acquires a finite density of monopoles, and ii) by further increasing the field, two plateaux are clearly obtained at $m=\frac{1}{3}$ and $m=\frac{1}{2}$. We discuss the experimental importance of the consecutive magnetization plateaux transitions as a signature of an underlying quantum spin-liquid phase.

Title: Molybdenum Disulfide Bilayers Hybridized with Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanosheets for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
Authors: Bruno Ferreira Brischi, Gabriela Frajtag, João Pedro da Silva Mariano, Laís Fernanda Medeiros Ruela, Gustavo Duarte Verçosa, Camila Desiderio Fernandes, Murilo Santhiago, Letícia Mariê Minatogau Ferro, Leandro Merces
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets have attracted attention as a promising and cost-effective alternative catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, their aggregation and poor conductivity limit their catalytic activity. Consequently, researchers are exploring ways to improve the conductivity and density of electroactive edges of MoS2 through hybridization with akin advanced 2D materials. Here, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets are added to a liquid-phase-exfoliated MoS2 dispersion to create drop-casting hybrid MoS2@rGO electrodes for HER. The findings reveal the formation of ~1.1 nm-thick MoS2 bilayers, with the catalytic performance of MoS2@rGO dependent on the degree of graphene oxide reduction. The rGO moderate reduction prevents the MoS2 bilayers from restacking, improves conductivity, retains oxygenated groups that enhance interlayer spacing, and exposes more electroactive edges. When hybridized with rGO crafted at optimal reduction time, the hybrid system eclipses the efficiency of pristine MoS2 bilayers by attaining the lowest overpotential (~70 mV) and the lowest Tafel slope (~46 mV dec-1). This shows that MoS2 bilayers hybridized with rGO offer a promising method to outperform the electrocatalytic efficiency of MoS2-based electrodes. These findings expand opportunities for future strain engineering, defect engineering, and high-end twist-angle assemblies for hybrid systems combining MoS2 bilayers and rGO.

Title: Dominant Excitonic Superconductivity in a Three-component Hubbard Chain
Authors: Sheng Chen, Qiao Yang, Wéi Wú, Fadi Sun
Abstract: Understanding superconductivity emerging from repulsive fermions remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics. In this paper, we investigate the pairing tendencies in a one-dimensional, three component repulsive Hubbard model, using the density matrix renormalization group method. At half-filling, the system exhibits density wave ground state due to strong Hubbard repulsions. Upon doping, we find that Cooper pairs can emerge, whose fluctuations predominate the long-range physics in the system across a wide parameter range. The effective attractions between Cooper pairs are mediated by the particle-hole fluctuations in the third non-pairing component, resembling an excitonic mechanism of superconductivity. The coexistence of multiple density waves and superconductivity at different fermion fillings is explored. We also present an analytical study of the pairing mechanism in both weak and strong coupling limits. Our results provide a new perspective for understanding and exploring unconventional superconductivities in strongly correlated fermionic systems.

Title: Commissioning of an experiment for thermodynamic and spectroscopic studies of hydrogen isotopologues at cryogenic conditions

Abstract: To study thermodynamic properties and dynamic phase space behavior of hydrogen isotopologues (Q$_2$) at cryogenic temperatures and at high density, the Tritium Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy 2 (T$_2$ApIR) experiment has been set up and commissioned at Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK). In the frame of the experiment, Q$_2$ behavior in different phases, ortho/para states, temperatures (10 K - 300 K) and pressures (up to 2.5 bar a) will be investigated with optical methods, infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The facility consists of a fully tritium compatible cryostat, which includes an optical cell, ortho/para converter and windows for optical and spectroscopic studies. The cryostat can be cooled below the H$_2$ triple point by a two-stage cryocooler and contains openings in the cryogenic shielding for the optical access. The challenge of combining these scientific requirements in a design with high amounts of tritium (14 g), in a limited space, all while maintaining the TLK safety philosophy was solved by the presented design. The experiment is ready to be fully integrated into the TLK closed loop tritium infrastructure. This contribution reports a comprehensive overview of the commissioning phase of the experimental facility and the results of the first commissioning experiments, including cryogenic performance tests, commissioning experiments with non-radioactive gases, and tests of the analytical instruments.

Title: Langevin equation with potential of mean force: The case of anchored bath
Authors: Alex V. Plyukhin
Abstract: The potential of mean force (PMF) is an effective average potential acting on an open system, renormalized due to the interaction with the surrounding thermal bath. The PMF is defined for an equilibrium ensemble, and generally it is not clear how to use it when the system is out of equilibrium and described by a (generalized) Langevin equation. We study a model where the system is a single particle (so there are no complications related to internal forces) and a non-trivial PMF is due to the presence of on-site (anchor) potentials applied to the bath particles. We found that the PMF does not merely replace the external potential, but also makes the dissipation kernel and statistical properties of noise dependent on the system's position. That dependence is determined by the internal bath and system-bath interactions and is a priori unknown. Therefore, in the general case the Langevin equation with the PMF is not closed and thus inoperable. However, for systems with linear forces the aforementioned dependence on the system's position may be canceled. As an example, we consider a model where the bath is formed by the Klein-Gordon chain, i. e. a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials. In that case, the generalized Langevin equation has the standard form with an external potential replaced by a quadratic PMF.

Title: An accurate alternative to hybrid functionals for germanium: DFT+$α$
Authors: Abdulgaffar Abdurrazaq, Ruggero Lot, Antoine Jay, Gabriela Herrero-Saboya, Nicolas Richard, Layla Martin-Samos, Anne Hémeryck, Stefano de Gironcoli
Abstract: The accuracy of bulk property predictions in density functional theory (DFT) calculations depends on the choice of exchange-correlation functional. While the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional systematically overestimates lattice parameters and strongly underestimates electronic band gaps, hybrid functionals such as Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) offer better overall agreement across a broad range of materials. Using germanium as a critical test case, we challenge the ability of both functionals to capture semiconductor properties. Although HSE improves PBE's gap error, it fails to reproduce germanium's correct $\Gamma$-L indirect and $\Gamma$-$\Gamma$ band gaps simultaneously. Noting that the PBE underestimated energy separation between the 4p valence-band maximum and 4s conduction-band minimum causes unphysical $sp$ mixing, we propose DFT+$\alpha$, a semi-empirical correction scheme applied selectively to 4s-like orbitals. For germanium, DFT+$\alpha$ restores the proper ordering and orbital character of the band edges and yields accurate lattice constant, bulk modulus, elastic constants and phonon frequencies at a fraction of hybrid-functional computational cost.

Title: Low Energy Excitations of a 1D Fermi Gas with Attractive Interactions
Authors: Aashish Kafle, Ruwan Senaratne, Danyel Cavazos-Cavazos, Hai-Ying Cui, Thierry Giamarchi, Han Pu, Xi-Wen Guan, Randall G. Hulet
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of a two-component repulsive Fermi gas confined to one dimension are linear dispersing spin- and charge-density waves whose respective propagation velocities depend on the strength and sign of their interaction. Quasi-1D fermions with attractive interaction realize the Luther-Emery liquid, which exhibits a rich array of phenomena, many of which are qualitatively different from those exhibited by their repulsive counterpart. We use a Feshbach resonance to access attractive interactions with $^6$Li atoms. We measured the spin and charge dynamic structure factors using Bragg spectroscopy and find that, contrary to repulsive interactions, the spin wave propagates faster than the charge density wave, thus producing an inversion of the classic spin-charge separation. We also find that a small spin polarization strongly suppresses the spin gap in the measured Bragg spectra. Evidence for pairing are a reduction in spin correlations with increasing attraction and RF spectra consistent with an atom/molecule mixture.

Title: Low Resistance Non-Alloyed Ohmic Contacts to High Al Composition n-type AlGaN
Authors: Joseph E. Dill, Xianzhi Wei, Changkai Yu, Akhansha Arvind, Shivali Agrawal, Debaditya Bhattacharya, Keisuke Shinohara, Debdeep Jena, Huili Grace Xing
Abstract: Ohmic contacts to high (>70\%) Al content n-type Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor layers in nitride electronic and photonic devices are typically fabricated by a lift-off process and high temperature ($>700^\circ$C) thermal alloying. These conditions often result in significant structural deformations of the fabricated structures and impose a harsh thermal budget on all other aspects of the device. Here, we report the fabrication of \textit{non-alloyed} \textit{as-deposited} ohmic contacts to 71\% n+AlGaN ($E_\text{g}\sim5.4$~eV) with a free carrier concentration of roughly $7\times 10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ and a resistivity of 4 - 5.5 m$\Omega$cm (among the lowest reported for Al$_{0.71}$Ga$_{0.29}$N) with linear $I-V$ characteristics and a contact resistivity of $\rho_\text{c}=(4.4\pm1.0)\times10^{-4}$~$\Omega$cm$^2$ (measured at zero voltage). Contacts with this quality are formed by two separate fabrication schemes: (i) metal-first patterning, and (ii) lift-off with an oxygen asher descum prior to metal deposition. Given the low threading dislocation density in the single-crystal AlN substrate used for epitaxy, the smooth morphology of the contacted epitaxial surface, and the non-alloyed nature of the contacts, this contact resistivity is attributed purely to thermionic field emission through the metal-semiconductor junction. Contact resistivity extraction at low current injection enables us to model these results using a thermionic field-emission model of contact resistivity, yielding a barrier height for Ti/Al$_{0.71}$Ga$_{0.29}$N of $(0.81\pm0.02)$ eV.

Title: Non-linear transport in multifold semimetals
Authors: Andrea Kouta Dagnino, Xiaoxiong Liu, Titus Neupert
Abstract: Transport measurements are a powerful way to probe the electronic structure of quantum materials, but the information they contain is often convoluted. Yet, in particular for simple low-energy fermiologies, and by combining linear and non-linear responses, definite conclusion can be drawn -- such as, for instance, in the case of the circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. Here, we derive the complete DC intrinsic transport response functions up to third order in the applied electric field within Boltzmann theory that hold combined information about quantum geometry and band dispersion. We discuss the responses for multifold fermions at high-symmetry momenta in time-reversal symmetric crystals as well as their reduction by symmetry constraints. We exemplify in detail the cases of space group 213 and space group 199, which realize different multifold fermions, and show under which conditions these low-energy excitations can be differentially addressed through their bulk nonlinear responses, enabling nonlinear valley-tronics.

Title: A Unified Symmetry Classification of Magnetic Orders via Spin Space Groups: Prediction of Coplanar Even-Wave Phases
Authors: Ziyin Song, Ziyue Qi, Chen Fang, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng
Abstract: Spin space groups (SSGs) impose fundamentally different constraints on magnetic configurations in real and reciprocal spaces. As a consequence, the correspondence between real-space and momentum-space spin arrangements is far richer than traditionally assumed. Building on the complete enumeration of SSGs, we develop a systematic, symmetry-based framework that classifies all possible spin arrangements allowed by these groups. This unified approach naturally incorporates conventional magnetic orders, altermagnetism, and p-wave magnetism as distinct symmetry classes. Crucially, our classification predicts a variety of novel magnetic phases, highlighted by the discovery of the coplanar even-wave magnet: a state that is non-collinear in real space but hosts a collinear even-wave spin polarization in k-space. Analysis of a minimal model reveals that this phase is characterized by non-quantized spin polarization and exhibits a novel mechanism for symmetry-enforced zero polarization on non-degenerate bands. Extending the framework from bulk crystals to layer SSGs appropriate for two-dimensional systems, we further predict layered counterparts and provide symmetry guidelines for designing bilayer coplanar p-wave and even-wave magnets. We further validate this finding through first-principles calculations and propose CoCrO4 as a promising candidate for its experimental realization, thereby demonstrating the completeness and predictive power of the SSG-based classification of magnetic orders.

Title: Concentrated Monte Carlo sampling for local observables in quantum spin chains
Authors: Wenxuan Zhang, Dingzu Wang, Dario Poletti
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods are widely used to estimate observables in many-body quantum systems. However, conventional sampling schemes often require a large number of samples to achieve sufficient accuracy. In this work we propose the concentrated Monte Carlo sampling approach, which builds on the idea that in systems with only short range correlations, to obtain accurate expectation values for local observables, one would favor detailed information in the surroundings of this observable compared to far away from it. In this approach we consider all possible configurations in the surroundings of a local observable, and unique samples from the remaining of the setup drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We have tested the performance of this approach for ground states of the spin-1/2 tilted Ising model in different phases, and also for thermal states in the a spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model. Our results demonstrate that CMCS yields higher accuracy for local observables in short-range correlated states while requiring substantially fewer samples, showcasing in which regimes one can obtain acceleration for the evaluation of expectation values.

Title: The effects of H blistering and ELMs on the thermal fatigue cracking of W by strikepoint sweeping
Authors: J. Hargreaves, J. Vernimmen, J. Scholten, T.W Morgan
Abstract: Cyclic thermal loads imposed on a W divertor by strikepoint sweeping may induce low-cycle thermal fatigue cracking of its plasma-facing surfaces. This cracking may be accelerated by plasma-material interactions such as H implantation, blistering, fuzz and void formation. Fatigue cracking may also synergise with ELM cracking. To explore these novel forms of environmentally assisted fatigue, FEA modelling was used to design a uniaxial fatigue experiment for Magnum-PSI that represents strikepoint sweeping at 1 Hz across a 100 mm span of a divertor target. Magnum-PSI was used to combine cyclic thermal loading of W with H implantation and two forms of ELM like pre-cracking. Quantitative SEM analysis of fatigue-cracked W revealed that H implantation significantly delayed crack initiation, with preimplanted targets requiring 450-600 cycles before failure compared to 150 cycles for non-implanted samples. This was attributed to hydrogen-induced dislocation pinning, which produces a case-hardening effect that inhibits persistent slip band formation. ELM-like pre-cracking combined with strikepoint sweeping was found to give rise to localised melting and the formation of 30 micromete diameter droplets, caused by thermal isolation of W regions by fatigue cracks. The implications for the fatigue lifetime of tokamak divertors are also discussed.

Title: Coherence-limited digital control of a superconducting qubit using a Josephson pulse generator at 3 K
Authors: M. A. Castellanos-Beltran, A. J. Sirois, L. Howe, D. I. Olaya, J. Biesecker, S. P. Benz, P. F. Hopkins
Abstract: Compared to traditional semiconductor control electronics (TSCE) located at room temperature, cryogenic single flux quantum (SFQ) electronics can provide qubit measurement and control alternatives that address critical issues related to scalability of cryogenic quantum processors. Single-qubit control and readout have been demonstrated recently using SFQ circuits coupled to superconducting qubits. Experiments where the SFQ electronics are co-located with the qubit have suffered from excess decoherence and loss due to quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit. A previous experiment by our group showed that moving the control electronics to the 3 K stage of the dilution refrigerator avoided this source of decoherence in a high-coherence 3D transmon geometry. In this paper, we also generate the pulses at the 3 K stage but have optimized the qubit design and control lines for scalable 2D transmon devices. We directly compare the qubit lifetime $T_1$, coherence time $T_2^*$ and gate fidelity when the qubit is controlled by the Josephson pulse generator (JPG) circuit versus the TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations for $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, and agreement to within 10% for randomized benchmarking. We also performed interleaved randomized benchmarking on individual JPG gates demonstrating an average error per gate of $0.46$% showing good agreement with what is expected based on the qubit coherence and higher-state leakage. These results are an order of magnitude improvement in gate fidelity over our previous work and demonstrate that a Josephson microwave source operated at 3 K is a promising component for scalable qubit control.

Title: Entanglement Through Topological Defects: Reconciling Theory with Numerics
Authors: Christian Northe, Paolo Rossi
Abstract: Present theoretical predictions for the entanglement entropy through topological defects are vi- olated by numerical simulations. In order to resolve this, we introduce a paradigm shift in the preparation of reduced density matrices in the presence of topological defects, and emphasize the role of defect networks with which they can be dressed. We consider the cases of grouplike and du- ality defects in detail for the Ising model, and match all numerically found entanglement entropies. Since our construction functions at the level of reduced density matrices, it accounts for topological defects beyond the entanglement entropy to other entanglement measures.

Title: F2: Offline Reinforcement Learning for Hamiltonian Simulation via Free-Fermionic Subroutine Compilation
Authors: Ethan Decker, Christopher Watson, Junyu Zhou, Yuhao Liu, Chenxu Liu, Ang Li, Gushu Li, Samuel Stein
Abstract: Compiling shallow and accurate quantum circuits for Hamiltonian simulation remains challenging due to hardware constraints and the combinatorial complexity of minimizing gate count and circuit depth. Existing optimization method pipelines rely on hand-engineered classical heuristics, which cannot learn input-dependent structure and therefore miss substantial opportunities for circuit reduction. We introduce \textbf{F2}, an offline reinforcement learning framework that exploits free-fermionic structure to efficiently compile Trotter-based Hamiltonian simulation circuits. F2 provides (i) a reinforcement-learning environment over classically simulatable free-fermionic subroutines, (ii) architectural and objective-level inductive biases that stabilize long-horizon value learning, and (iii) a reversible synthetic-trajectory generation mechanism that consistently yields abundant, guaranteed-successful offline data. Across benchmarks spanning lattice models, protein fragments, and crystalline materials (12-222 qubits), F2 reduces gate count by 47\% and depth by 38\% on average relative to strong baselines (Qiskit, Cirq/OpenFermion) while maintaining average errors of $10^{-7}$. These results show that aligning deep reinforcement learning with the algebraic structure of quantum dynamics enables substantial improvements in circuit synthesis, suggesting a promising direction for scalable, learning-based quantum compilation

Title: Coherent and compact van der Waals transmon qubits
Authors: Jesse Balgley, Jinho Park, Xuanjing Chu, Jiru Liu, Madisen Holbrook, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Archana Kamal, Leonardo Ranzani, Martin V. Gustafsson, James Hone, Kin Chung Fong
Abstract: State-of-the-art superconducting qubits rely on a limited set of thin-film materials. Expanding their materials palette can improve performance, extend operating regimes, and introduce new functionalities, but conventional thin-film fabrication hinders systematic exploration of new material combinations. Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a highly modular crystalline platform that facilitates such exploration while enabling gate-tunability, higher-temperature operation, and compact qubit geometries. Yet it remains unknown whether a fully vdW superconducting qubit can support quantum coherence and what mechanisms dominate loss at both low and elevated temperatures in such a device. Here we demonstrate quantum-coherent merged-element transmons made entirely from vdW Josephson junctions. These first-generation, fully crystalline qubits achieve microsecond lifetimes in an ultra-compact footprint without external shunt capacitors. Energy relaxation measurements, together with microwave characterization of vdW capacitors, point to dielectric loss as the dominant relaxation channel up to hundreds of millikelvin. These results establish vdW materials as a viable platform for compact superconducting quantum devices.

Title: Understanding the temperature response of biological systems: From empirical fits to mechanistic frameworks
Authors: Simen Jacobs, Julian Voits, Nikita Frolov, Ulrich S. Schwarz, Lendert Gelens
Abstract: Virtually every biological rate changes with temperature, but the mechanisms underlying these responses differ between different processes. Here, we bring together the main theoretical approaches used to describe temperature-rate relationships, ranging from empirical curve shapes to reaction-level kinetics and network-based dynamical frameworks. These models highlight how temperature influences not only the speed of elementary reactions, but also the behavior that emerges when many reactions interact through regulation, feedback, or stochastic transitions. By outlining the assumptions and implications of each perspective, we aim to clarify how different modeling strategies connect molecular processes to physiological temperature response curves and to point toward integrative frameworks that can better explain the diversity of biological thermal responses.

Title: Missing Wedge Inpainting and Joint Alignment in Electron Tomography through Implicit Neural Representations
Authors: Cedric Lim, Corneel Casert, Arthur R. C. McCray, Serin Lee, Andrew Barnum, Jennifer Dionne, Colin Ophus
Abstract: Electron tomography is a powerful tool for understanding the morphology of materials in three dimensions, but conventional reconstruction algorithms typically suffer from missing-wedge artifacts and data misalignment imposed by experimental constraints. Recently proposed supervised machine-learning-enabled reconstruction methods to address these challenges rely on training data and are therefore difficult to generalize across materials systems. We propose a fully self-supervised implicit neural representation (INR) approach using a neural network as a regularizer. Our approach enables fast inline alignment through pose optimization, missing wedge inpainting, and denoising of low dose datasets via model regularization using only a single dataset. We apply our method to simulated and experimental data and show that it produces high-quality tomograms from diverse and information limited datasets. Our results show that INR-based self-supervised reconstructions offer high fidelity reconstructions with minimal user input and preprocessing, and can be readily applied to a wide variety of materials samples and experimental parameters.

Title: Integrating Coarse-Grained Simulations and Deep Learning to Unveil Entropy-Driven dsRNA Unwinding by DDX3X
Authors: Kang Wang, Chun-Lai Ren, Yu-Qiang Ma
Abstract: DEAD-box RNA helicases (DDXs) are essential RNA metabolism regulators that typically unwind dsRNA in an ATP-dependent manner. However, recent studies show some DDXs can also unwind dsRNA without ATP, a phenomenon that remains poorly understood. Here, we developed HelixTriad coarse-grained RNA model, incorporating Watson-Crick base pairing, base stacking, and electrostatics within a three-bead-per-nucleotide scheme to accurately reproduce experimental RNA melting curves. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that weak, specific DDX3X-dsRNA interactions drive stochastic strand separation without ATP. Free energy analysis revealed that successful unwinding via high-entropy, stand-displacing intermediates. Furthermore, we introduced Entropy-Unet, a deep learning framework for entropy prediction, which corroborated theoretical estimates and uncovered a hierarchical pattern of entropy contributions. Together, our findings suggest that ATP-independent dsRNA unwinding by DDXs is predominantly entropy-driven, offering new mechanistic insights into RNA helicases versatility.

Title: Dielectric permittivity tensor dynamics of in-plane hyperbolic van der Waals MoOCl2 and emergent chiral photonic applications
Authors: Artsruni Margaryan, Maksim Sargsyan, Meri Hayrapetyan, David Karakhanyan, Kostya S. Novoselov, Davit A. Ghazaryan
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) crystals offer unique opportunities for modern nanophotonic applications owing to their intrinsic anisotropic nature. While most of them exhibit uniaxial anisotropy arising from weak out-of-plane vdW interaction, some of their representative families also exhibit an in-plane biaxial anisotropy. Among the latter, outstand vdW oxochlorides with in-plane axes of a different physical character (metallic or dielectric). Here, we present an accurate dynamics of dielectric permittivity tensor components of vdW MoOCl2 in the ultraviolet (UV) to visible (Vis) spectral region partly covering near-infrared (NIR). Addressing its enormously anisotropic optical constants, we focus on another hyperbolicity window of vdW MoOCl2 emerging in the UV spectral region that may potentially unlock rich light-matter interaction effects. Furthermore, we propose an approach towards designing nanoscale handedness preserved Vis light circular polarizers based on twisted helical vdW MoOCl2 heterostructures. Our findings display that vdW MoOCl2 provides a highly promising platform not only for hyperbolic, but also for chiral nanophotonic applications.

Title: Transition in elastic Dean flow: the centre-mode versus hoop-stress pathways
Authors: P. S. D. Surya Phani Tej, Ganesh Subramanian, V. Shankar
Abstract: We analyse the stability of viscoelastic Dean flow (flow of an elastic fluid through a curved two-dimensional channel, driven by an azimuthal pressure gradient) in the absence of fluid inertia. This configuration is well known to exhibit a hoop-stress-driven `purely elastic' instability (referred to henceforth as the hoop-stress mode -- `HSM') on account of the base-flow streamline curvature. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the existence and importance of a distinct elastic instability in this flow configuration, which is not driven by hoop-stresses, but instead is a continuation of a novel `centre-mode' (CM) instability recently identified in rectilinear shear flows. We use both the Oldroyd-B and FENE-P models to map out parameter regimes in the $W\!i$--$\epsilon$--$\beta$ space where the aforementioned instabilities are present. Here, $W\!i$ is a suitably defined Weissenberg number that characterizes fluid elasticity, $\beta$ is the ratio of solvent to total solution viscosity, and $\epsilon$ is the ratio of the gap (channel) width to the radius of curvature. For FENE-P model, decreasing the finite extensibility parameter $L$ has opposing effects on the HSM and CM instabilities -- stabilising the former, but destabilising the latter. In the dilute solution regime ($\beta > 0.95$), and for realistic values of $L \sim O(100)$, corresponding to polymer molecular weights of $O(10^{5-6})$g/mol, the CM remains the most unstable mode for $\epsilon \leq 0.25$, rendering it potentially relevant to the onset of elastic turbulence in the flow of such polymer solutions through curved channels.

Title: Higher Josephson harmonics in a tunable double-junction transmon qubit

Abstract: Tunable Josephson harmonics open up for new qubit design. We demonstrate a superconducting circuit element with a tunnel junction in series with a SQUID loop, yielding a highly magnetic-flux tunable harmonic content of the Josephson potential. We analyze spectroscopy of the first four qubit transitions with a circuit model which includes the internal mode, revealing a second harmonic up to $\sim10\%$ of the fundamental harmonic. Interestingly, a sweet spot where the dispersive shift vanishes is achieved by balancing the dispersive couplings to the internal and qubit modes. The highly tunable set-up provides a route toward protected qubits, and customizable nonlinear microwave devices.

Title: Data-Efficient Learning of Anomalous Diffusion with Wavelet Representations: Enabling Direct Learning from Experimental Trajectories
Authors: Gongyi Wang, Yu Zhang, Zihan Huang
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a versatile tool for analyzing anomalous diffusion trajectories, yet most existing pipelines are trained on large collections of simulated data. In contrast, experimental trajectories, such as those from single-particle tracking (SPT), are typically scarce and may differ substantially from the idealized models used for simulation, leading to degradation or even breakdown of performance when ML methods are applied to real data. To address this mismatch, we introduce a wavelet-based representation of anomalous diffusion that enables data-efficient learning directly from experimental recordings. This representation is constructed by applying six complementary wavelet families to each trajectory and combining the resulting wavelet modulus scalograms. We first evaluate the wavelet representation on simulated trajectories from the andi-datasets benchmark, where it clearly outperforms both feature-based and trajectory-based methods with as few as 1000 training trajectories and still retains an advantage on large training sets. We then use this representation to learn directly from experimental SPT trajectories of fluorescent beads diffusing in F-actin networks, where the wavelet representation remains superior to existing alternatives for both diffusion-exponent regression and mesh-size classification. In particular, when predicting the diffusion exponents of experimental trajectories, a model trained on 1200 experimental tracks using the wavelet representation achieves significantly lower errors than state-of-the-art deep learning models trained purely on $10^6$ simulated trajectories. We associate this data efficiency with the emergence of distinct scale fingerprints disentangling underlying diffusion mechanisms in the wavelet spectra.

Title: Stretching and breaking of particles in compressible random flows
Authors: Dipankar Roy, Marco Martins Afonso, Jason R. Picardo, Dario Vincenzi
Abstract: A key feature of turbulent suspensions that involve floating particles on the surface or inertial particles in the bulk is the compressibility of the effective particle-phase velocity field. Little, however, is known about the effects of small-scale flow compressibility on the stretching and breaking of particles. Here, we gain insight into the nature of these effects by studying the deformation of tiny particles in model fluctuating flows. We consider a generic particle with extensional dynamics that are governed by a vector model, which accounts for elasticity, internal viscosity, and non-affine deformation. Applying the dynamical systems approach of Balkovsky, Fouxon & Lebedev (2000), we first obtain general results for the stationary statistics of particle extension in compressible chaotic flows. We then specialize to a time-decorrelated Gaussian random flow and derive an exact solution for the Batchelor regime of the compressible Kraichnan model. We also perform numerical simulations for a time-correlated renewing flow. While straining is suppressed on the average in compressible flows, our results show that large deviations of the strain rate strongly stretch particles and give rise to a power-law distribution of extensions. Extreme straining events are particularly important for stiff particles and, in the examples considered here, give rise to a counter-intuitive effect: stiff particles stretch more and break faster in flows of increasing compressibility. Highly-elastic particles, whose deformation is dictated by the mean straining, stretch less and break slower. Though based on specific random flows, our work shows how compressibility can affect the extensional dynamics of particles by altering the fluctuations of the strain rate, including its large deviations.

Title: Spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single-cavity spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Kashif Ammar Yasir, Gao Xianlong
Abstract: Topological photonic phases are typically identified through band reconstruction, steady-state transmission, or real-space imaging of edge modes. In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.

Title: Geometry-driven transitions in sparse long-range spin models with cold atoms
Authors: Alex Gunning, Aydin Deger, Sridevi Kuriyattil, Andrew J. Daley
Abstract: We explore the influence of geometry in the critical behavior of sparse long-range spin models. We examine a model with interactions that can be continuously tuned to induce distinct changes in the metric, topology, and dimensionality of the coupling graph. This underlying geometry acts as the driver of criticality, with structural changes in the graph coinciding with and dictating the phase boundaries. We further discuss how this framework connects naturally to realizations in tweezer arrays with Rydberg excitations. In certain cases, the effective geometry can be incorporated in the layout of atoms in tweezers to realize phase transitions that preserve universal features, simplifying their implementation in near-term experiments.

Title: Reducing dislocation defect levels via sub-melt nanosecond pulsed-laser induced densification of diamond
Authors: Adam H. Khan, Tae Sung Kim, Gabe Guss, Ted A. Laurence, Sonny S. Ly, Thejaswi U. Tumkur, Afaq H. Piracha
Abstract: Dislocations and polishing-induced defect networks in synthetic diamond generate local strain fields that broaden Raman features and limit optical, thermal, and electronic performance. Sub-melt laser annealing has emerged as a route to repair near-surface defects without graphitization, yet quantitative evidence of densification, defect depletion, and property recovery remains limited. Here, we show that nanosecond pulsed-laser annealing (PLA) can relax dislocation-associated strain in single-crystal CVD diamond by compacting and reorganizing the damaged near-surface region. Single- and two-pulse PLA were applied, and structural evolution was quantified using co-registered ISO 25178 white-light interferometry, depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy, and cross-sectional STEM with geometric phase analysis (GPA). Across a 5x6 grid(n = 30), responsive regions show large reductions in local slope (Sdq 45-65%), developed area (Sdr 60-90%), height spread (Sp, Sz 30-65%), void volume (Vv 57-60%), and roughness amplitude (Sa, Sq 48-57%), consistent with densification of ~4-6.5 nm. Raman profiling reveals narrowing of the diamond line and improved spectral uniformity to depths of ~2-3 {\mu}m, indicating relaxation of dislocation-mediated strain beyond the compaction layer. STEM-GPA strain maps confirm smoother strain fields, reduced hotspots, and redistribution of localized strain concentrations after PLA. These results show that sub-melt PLA reduces dislocation-driven strain by compacting surface-connected free volume and reorganizing defect networks. The approach provides a scalable path to upgrade industrial-grade diamond including homoepitaxial, heteroepitaxial, and polycrystalline CVD to low-defect, device-ready surfaces relevant to high-power electronics, photonics, and quantum substrates.

Title: Non-abelian quantum double models from iterated gauging
Authors: David Blanik, José Garre-Rubio
Abstract: We reconstruct all (2+1)D quantum double models of finite groups from their boundary symmetries through the repeated application of a gauging procedure, extending the existing construction for abelian groups. We employ the recently proposed categorical gauging framework, based on matrix product operators (MPOs), to derive the appropriate gauging procedure for the $\mathsf{Rep}\, G$ symmetries appearing in our construction and give an explicit description of the dual emergent $G$ symmetry, which is our main technical contribution. Furthermore, we relate the possible gapped boundaries of the quantum double models to the quantum phases of the one-dimensional input state to the iterated gauging procedure. Finally, we propose a gauging procedure for 1-form $\mathsf{Rep}\, G$ symmetries on a two-dimensional lattice and use it to extend our results to the construction of (3+1)D quantum doubles models through the iterative gauging of (2+1)-dimensional symmetries.

Title: Floquet Topological Frequency-Converting Amplifier
Authors: Adrian Parra-Rodriguez, Miguel Clavero-Rubio, Philippe Gigon, Tomás Ramos, Álvaro Gómez-León, Diego Porras
Abstract: We introduce a driven-dissipative Floquet model in which a single harmonic oscillator with modulated frequency and decay realizes a non-Hermitian synthetic lattice with an effective electric field gradient in frequency space. Using the Floquet-Green's function and its doubled-space representation, we identify a topological regime that supports directional amplification and frequency conversion, accurately captured by a local winding number. The underlying mode structure is well described by a Jackiw-Rebbi-like continuum theory with Dirac cones and solitonic zero modes in synthetic frequency. Our results establish a simple and experimentally feasible route to non-Hermitian topological amplification, naturally implementable in current quantum technologies such as superconducting circuits.

Title: A microstructural rheological model for transient creep in polycrystalline ice
Authors: Alex J. Vargas, Ranjiangshang Ran, Justin C. Burton
Abstract: The slow creep of glacial ice plays a key role in sea-level rise, yet its transient deformation remains poorly understood. Glen's flow law, where strain rate is simply a function of stress, cannot predict the time-dependent creep behavior observed in experiments. Here we present a physics-based rheological model that captures all three regimes of transient creep in polycrystalline ice. The key components of the model are a series of Kelvin-Voigt mechanical elements that produce a power-law (Andrade) creep, and a single viscous element with microstructure and stress dependence that represents reorientation in the polycrystalline grains. The interplay between these components produces a minimum in the strain rate at approximately 1% strain, which is a universal but unexplained feature reported in experiments. Due to its transient nature, the model exhibits fractional power-law exponents in the stress dependence of the strain rate minimum, which has been conventionally interpreted as independent physical processes. Taken together, we provide a compact, mechanistic framework for transient ice rheology that generalizes to other polycrystalline materials and can be integrated into constitutive laws for ice-sheet models.

Title: The Ideal Glass and the Ideal Disk Packing in Two Dimensions
Authors: Viola Bolton-Lum, R. Cameron Dennis, Peter Morse, Eric Corwin
Abstract: The ideal glass, a disordered system of particles with zero configurational entropy, cannot be realized through thermal processes. Nevertheless, we present a method for constructing ideal jammed packings of soft spheres, and thus the zero temperature ideal glass, in two dimensions. In line with the predicted properties, these critically jammed packings have high bulk and shear moduli as well as an anomalously high density. While the absence of pressure scaling in the shear moduli of crystalline materials is often attributed to the ordered nature of the particles, we show for the first time that disordered ideal packings also have this feature. We also find that the density of states avoids the low frequency power law scaling famously found in most amorphous materials, these configurations display hyperuniformity, and they melt at unusually high temperatures as compared to conventional packings. In addition to resolving a long-standing mystery, this methodology represents a valuable shortcut in the generation of well-equilibrated glassy systems. The creation of such an ideal packing makes possible a complete exploration and explanation of two dimensional jammed and glassy systems.

Title: Deep generative modelling of canonical ensemble with differentiable thermal properties
Authors: Shuo-Hui Li, Yao-Wen Zhang, Ding Pan
Abstract: It is a long-standing challenge to accurately and efficiently compute thermodynamic quantities of many-body systems at thermal equilibrium. The conventional methods, e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo, require many steps to equilibrate. The recently developed deep learning methods can perform direct sampling, but only work at a single trained temperature point and risk biased sampling. Here, we propose a variational method for canonical ensembles with differentiable temperature, which gives thermodynamic quantities as continuous functions of temperature akin to an analytical solution. The proposed method is a general framework that works with any tractable density generative model. At optimal, the model is theoretically guaranteed to be the unbiased Boltzmann distribution. We validated our method by calculating phase transitions in the Ising and XY models, demonstrating that our direct-sampling simulations are as accurate as Markov chain Monte Carlo, but more efficient. Moreover, our differentiable free energy aligns closely with the exact one to the second-order derivative, indicating that the variational model captures the subtle thermal transitions at the phase transitions. This functional dependence on external parameters is a fundamental advancement in combining the exceptional fitting ability of deep learning with rigorous physical analysis.

Title: Explosive neural networks via higher-order interactions in curved statistical manifolds
Authors: Miguel Aguilera, Pablo A. Morales, Fernando E. Rosas, Hideaki Shimazaki
Abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, we introduce curved neural networks as a class of models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing higher-order phenomena in complex networks.

Title: Topological magnonic dislocations modes
Authors: Carlos Saji, Nicolas Vidal-Silva, Alvaro S. Nunez, Roberto E. Troncoso
Abstract: Spin fluctuations in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnets in the presence of crystalline lattice dislocations are investigated. We show the existence of topologically protected non-propagative modes that localize at dislocations. These in-gap states, coined as {\it magnonic dislocation modes}, are characterized by the $Z_2$ topological invariant that derives from parity symmetry broken induced by sublattice magnetic anisotropy. We uncover that bulk topology existing in the perfect crystal is robust under the influence of lattice defects, which is monitored by the real-space Bott index. It is also revealed that the topology of {magnonic dislocation modes} remains unaffected when bulk topology becomes trivial and is remarkably resilient against magnetic disorder. Our findings point to the intriguing relationship between topological lattice defects and the spectrum of topological spin excitations.

Title: VO2 films grown on TiO2 sub-layer: influence of thickness on structural, electrical and optical properties
Authors: M. E. Kutepov, V. E. Kaydashev, D.V. Stryukov, A.S. Konstantinov, A.V. Nikolskiy, A.T. Kozakov, A.D. Morozov, I. K. Domaratskiy, S.S. Zhukov, E. M. Kaidashev
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide with metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) that is triggered by heat, current or light is a promising material for modern active THz/mid-IR metasurfaces and all-optical big data processing systems. Multilayer VO2-based active metasurfaces are urgently needed however several important issues related to VO2 properties in VO2/TiO2/Al2O3 films should be thoroughly examined first. We study electrical, optical and structural properties of VO2 films as well as their composition and switching characteristics as function of the VO2 layer thickness in VO2/TiO2 composites. XRD analysis revealed an epitaxial growth of films with deformation of the monoclinic VO2 lattice to hexagonal symmetry. Reduced VO2 layer thickness from 170 nm to 20 nm results in increased phase transition temperature while the width of the resistance versus temperature hysteresis loop R(T) remains constant at ~6C for all VO2 thicknesses in the range of 20-170 nm. The resistance alteration ratio is reduced from 4.2e3 to 2.7e2 in thinner films. Raman spectra reveal a significant shift of VO2 lattice vibration modes for films thinner than 30 nm claiming a great structural strain whereas modes position for thicker VO2 layers are similar to those in bulk structure. Composition of VO2 films has revealed only a minor alteration of VO2/V2O5 phases ratio from 1.6 to 1.8 when the film thickness has been increased from 20 nm to 50 nm. Investigation of surface elemental composition and valence states of VO2 films revealed that VO2/V2O5 ratio remains practically unchanged with thickness reduction. The study of electrical MIT dynamics revealed the switching time of a 50 nm VO2 film to be as low as 800 ns.

Title: Universal criterion for selective outcomes under stochastic resetting
Authors: Suvam Pal, Leonardo Dagdug, Dibakar Ghosh, Denis Boyer, Arnab Pal
Abstract: Resetting plays a pivotal role in optimizing the completion time of complex first passage processes with single or multiple outcomes/exit possibilities. While it is well established that the coefficient of variation -- a statistical dispersion defined as a ratio of the fluctuations over the mean of the first passage time -- must be larger than unity for resetting to be beneficial for any outcome averaged over all the possibilities, the same can not be said while conditioned on a particular outcome. The purpose of this letter is to derive a universal condition which reveals that two statistical metric -- the mean and coefficient of variation of the conditional times -- come together to determine when resetting can expedite the completion of a selective outcome, and furthermore can govern the biasing between preferential and non-preferential outcomes. The universality of this result is demonstrated for a one dimensional diffusion process subjected to resetting with two absorbing boundaries.

Title: Triangular lattice models of the Kalmeyer-Laughlin spin liquid from coupled wires
Authors: Tingyu Gao, Niklas Tausendpfund, Erik L. Weerda, Jan Naumann, Matteo Rizzi, David F. Mross
Abstract: Chiral spin liquids (CSLs) are exotic phases of interacting spins in two dimensions, characterized by long-range entanglement and fractional excitations. We construct a local Hamiltonian on the triangular lattice that stabilizes the Kalmeyer-Laughlin CSL without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach employs coupled-wire constructions and introduces a lattice duality to construct a solvable chiral sliding Luttinger liquid, which is driven toward the CSL phase by generic perturbations. By combining symmetry analysis and bosonization, we make sharp predictions for the ground states on quasi-one-dimensional cylinders and tori, which exhibit a fourfold periodicity in the circumference. Extensive tensor network simulations demonstrating ground-state degeneracies, fractional quasiparticles, nonvanishing long-range order parameters, and entanglement signatures confirm the emergence of the CSL in the lattice Hamiltonian.

Title: Unravelling magnetic vortex-like excitations through rapid thermal quenching in low - carbon steel
Authors: P. C. Mahato, Suprotim Saha, Ritesh Kumar, D. Banik, K. Mondal, Shyam Kumar Choudhary, Ashish Garg, S. S. Banerjee
Abstract: Steel, traditionally valued for its structural strength, emerges in this study as a remarkable material for exploring novel magnetic phenomena. We investigate how common processing techniques-thermal treatments and mechanical strain-significantly affect the magnetic properties of low-carbon steels (0.05 percent by weight). Our findings show that slow annealing enlarges the grain size, enhancing magnetic susceptibility, while rapid quenching reduces grain size, resulting in a decreased magnetic response. Quenching low-carbon steel produces significant increase in the fraction of high-angle grain boundaries and a rapid spatial variation of local magnetic anisotropy between grains, a feature which is unachievable with mechanical straining even up to the material's ultimate tensile strength. Tensile-straining of low-carbon steel enhances magnetic susceptibility through altered magnetic anisotropy, contrary to the observed decrease of susceptibility in quenched low-carbon steel. Magnetic force microscopy and micromagnetic modelling of our data reveal that, the reduced magnetic susceptibility in quenched steel is a result of the presence of intriguing magnetic excitations akin to magnetic vortices. These localized structures act as strong magnetic domain wall pinning centres, causing the observed decrease in magnetic susceptibility in these quenched low-carbon steels. Beyond its established structural utility, low-carbon steel combines mechanical stability with favourable magnetic properties, positioning it as a strong platform for magnetic device applications.

Title: An empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics for simulating and predicting microstructure evolution in materials
Authors: Liang Wan, Qingsong Mei, Haowen Liu, Huafeng Zhang, Jun-Ping Du, Shigenobu Ogata, Wen Tong Geng
Abstract: Despite its widespread use in materials science, conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are severely constrained by timescale limitations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an empirical formulation of accelerated MD method, adapted from a collective-variable-based extended system dynamics framework. While this framework is originally developed for efficient free energy sampling and reaction pathway determination of specific rare events in condensed matter, we have modified it to enable accelerated MD simulation and prediction of microstructure evolution of materials across a broad range of scenarios. In essence, the nearest neighbor off-centering absolute displacement (NNOAD), which quantifies the deviation of an atom from the geometric center of its nearest neighbors in materials, is introduced. We propose that the collection of NNOADs of all atoms can serve as a generalized reaction coordinate for various structural transitions in materials. The NNOAD of each atom, represented by its three components, is coupled with three additional dynamic variables assigned to the atom. Time evolution of the additional dynamic variables follows Langevin equation, while Nosé-Hoover dynamics is employed to thermostat the system. Through careful analysis and benchmark simulations, we established appropriate parameter ranges for the equations in our method. Application of this method to several test cases demonstrates its capability to accelerate MD simulations by several orders of magnitude while maintaining kinetic consistency and good accuracy in predicting long timescale microstructure evolutions of materials. We also provide some preliminary thoughts on theoretical justification of the method, offering insights into its underlying principles.

Title: An anisotropic functional for two-dimensional material systems
Authors: Michael Lorke
Abstract: Density function theory is the workhorse of modern electronic structure theory. However, its accuracy in practical calculations is limited by the choice of the exchange-correlation potential. In this respect, 2D materials pose a special challenge, as all 2D materials and their heterostructures have a crucial similarity. The underlying atomic structures are strongly spatially inhomogeneous, implying that current exchange-correlation functionals, that in almost all cases are isotropic, are ill-prepared for an accurate description. We present an anisotropic screened-exchange potential, that remedies this problem and reproduces the band-gap of 2D materials as well as the piecewise linearity of the total energy with fractional occupation number.

Title: Diagrammatics of free energies with fixed variance for high-dimensional data
Authors: Tobias Kühn
Abstract: Systems with many interacting stochastic constituents are fully characterized by their free energy. Computing this quantity is therefore the objective of various approaches, notably perturbative expansions, which are applied in problems ranging from high-dimensional statistics to complex systems. However, a lot of these techniques are complicated to apply in practice because they lack a sufficient organization of the terms of the perturbative series. In this manuscript, we tackle this problem by using Feynman diagrams, extending a framework introduced earlier to the case of free energies at fixed variances. This diagrammatics do not require the theory to expand around to be Gaussian, which allows its application to the free energy of a spin system studied to derive message-passing algorithms by Maillard et al. 2019. We complete their perturbative derivation of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive resummations to estimate the entropies of poorly sampled systems requiring only limited statistics and we revisit earlier approaches to compute the free energy of the Ising model, revealing new insights due to the extension of our framework to the free energy at fixed variances. We expect our approach to be particularly useful for problems of high-dimensional statistics, like matrix factorization, and the study of complex networks.

Title: Fermi liquid theory of $d$-wave altermagnets: demon modes and Fano-demon states
Authors: Habib Rostami, Johannes Hofmann
Abstract: We develop a Fermi liquid theory of $d$-wave altermagnets and apply it to describe their collective excitation spectrum. We predict that in addition to a conventional undamped plasmon mode, where both spin components oscillate in phase, there is an acoustic plasmon (or {\em demon}) mode with out-of-phase spin dynamics. By analyzing the dynamical structure factor, we reveal a strong dependence of the demon's frequency and spectral weight both on the Landau parameters and on the direction of propagation. Notably, as a function of the propagation angle, we show that the acoustic mode evolves from a {\em hidden state}, which has zero spectral weight in the density excitation spectrum, to a weakly damped propagating demon mode and then (below a critical interaction parameter) to a {\em Fano-demon mixed state}, which is marked by a strong hybridization with particle-hole excitations and a corresponding asymmetric line shape in the structure factor. Our Letter paves the way for applications of altermagnetic materials in optospintronics by harnessing collective electron spin oscillations beyond traditional magnon spin waves.

Title: Localized Triplons and Site Stuffing in the Quantum Dimer Magnet BiYbGeO$_5$
Authors: Rachit Kapoor, J. Ramirez Diaz, D. Yahne, V.O. Garlea, G. Hester
Abstract: Thermodynamic and muon spin-relaxation measurements have recently highlighted BiYbGeO$_5$ as a new example of a rare-earth-based quantum dimer magnet with isolated Yb$^{3+}$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dimers. However, direct spectroscopic evidence of the triplet excitations and measurements of the structural disorder are lacking. In this work, polycrystalline BiYbGeO$_5$ was synthesized using conventional high-temperature solid-state methods and investigated via high-resolution neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering. Diffraction measurements down to 58 mK reveal no signatures of magnetic order and indicate that nearly 20\% of Yb$^{3+}$ sites are replaced by non-magnetic Bi$^{3+}$, introducing significant structural disorder. Inelastic neutron scattering shows dispersionless triplon excitations, consistent with localized, non-interacting spin dimers. Fits to the triplet excitation spectrum identify an XXZ-type anisotropic exchange with $J_{XX}$ = 0.11(2) meV and $J_Z = 0.15(1)$ meV. These findings establish BiYbGeO$_5$ as a structurally disordered but magnetically well-isolated quantum dimer system, providing a model platform for studying the resilience of entangled spin states to site dilution.

Title: Exactly solvable spin liquids in Kitaev bilayers and moiré superlattices
Authors: Ivan Dutta, Anamitra Mukherjee, Onur Erten, Kush Saha
Abstract: Building on the recent advancements on moiré superlattices, we propose an exactly solvable model with Kitaev-type interactions on a bilayer honeycomb lattice for both AA stacking and moiré superlattices. Using Monte Carlo simulations and variational analysis, we uncover a rich variety of phases where the intra and interlayer $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes (visons) are arranged in a periodic fashion in the ground state, tuned by interlayer coupling and out-of-plane external magnetic field. We further extend our model to moiré superlattices at various commensurate twist angles around two distinct twist centers represented by $C_{3z}$ and $C_{6z}$ of the honeycomb lattice. Our simulations reveal generalized arrangements of plaquette values that correlate with the AA or AB stacking regions across the moiré unit cell. Moreover, we find that, depending on the twist angle, twist center and interlayer coupling, moiré superlattices exhibit to a variety of gapped and gapless spin liquid phases and can also host corner and edge modes. Our results highlight the rich physics in bilayer and twisted bilayer models of exactly solvable quantum spin liquids.

Title: A molecule with half-Möbius topology
Authors: Igor Roncevic, Fabian Paschke, Yueze Gao, Leonard-Alexander Lieske, Lene A. Gödde, Stefano Barison, Samuele Piccinelli, Alberto Baiardi, Ivano Tavernelli, Jascha Repp, Florian Albrecht, Harry L. Anderson, Leo Gross
Abstract: Stereoisomers of C$_{13}$Cl$_2$ exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation on NaCl surfaces. We resolved the enantiomeric geometries of the closed-shell singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped their helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. A ${\pi}$-orbital basis of the helical, non-planar singlets that twists by 90° in one circulation is consistent with a half-Möbius topology. In such a topology, the ${\pi}$-orbital basis changes sign with respect to two circumnavigations and is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations. A quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition could be interpreted as carrying a Berry phase of ${\pi}$/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-Möbius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet state. Multireference calculations, including large-scale sample-based ab initio calculations executed on quantum hardware, reveal that the switching is associated with a helical pseudo Jahn-Teller effect.

Title: Partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem from statistical mechanics and chaotic mapping
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora, Marco Cedeno
Abstract: We introduce a partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem (which is the prototype of undecidable problems in combinatorics and statistical physics) by constructing a suitable mapping from tilings of finite squares of different sizes. Such mapping depends on the initial family of Wang tiles (the alphabet) with which one would like to tile the plane. This allows to define effective entropy and temperature associated to the alphabet (together with the corresponding partition function). We identify a subclass of good alphabets by observing that when the entropy and temperature of a given alphabet are well-behaved in the thermodynamical sense then such alphabet is a good candidate to tile the infinite two-dimensional plane. Our proposal is tested successfully with the known available good alphabets (which produce periodic tilings, aperiodic but self-similar tilings as well as tilings which are neither periodic nor self-similar). Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient is able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from alphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior. The transition from good to bad behavior is related to a transition from non-chaotic to chaotic regime in discrete dynamical systems of logistic type.

Title: Physical Constraints on the Rhythmicity of the Biological Clock
Authors: YeongKyu Lee, Changbong Hyeon
Abstract: Circadian rhythms in living organisms are temporal orders emerging from biochemical circuits driven out of equilibrium. Here, we study how the rhythmicity of KaiABC clock is generated from the underlying circuit. The phase diagram in terms of KaiC and KaiA concentrations reveals a narrowly bounded oscillatory phase. As dictated by the cost-precision trade-offs of the thermodynamic uncertainty relations, the presence of intrinsic noise, amplified in small systems, demands higher energy cost to achieve greater rhythmic precision. The cost-minimizing condition giving rise to $\sim$21-hr rhythm is identified close enough to entrain the system to 24-hr environmental signals. An optimal level of intrinsic noise can induce oscillations beyond the Hopf bifurcation, effectively expanding the oscillatory phase. Our study clarifies how the physical factors, such as energy cost, stochastic noise, and regulatory mechanism, contribute to the operation of biological clocks.

Title: Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks
Authors: F. Gallavotti, A. Zaccone
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.

Title: A Non-Local Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries
Authors: Xiao Han, Axel van de Walle
Abstract: We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a non-local functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while avoiding an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.

Title: Automated Construction of Artificial Lattice Structures with Designer Electronic States
Authors: Ganesh Narasimha, Mykola Telychko, Wooin Yang, Arthur P. Baddorf, P. Ganesh, An-Ping Li, Rama Vasudevan
Abstract: Manipulating matter with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) enables creation of atomically defined artificial structures that host designer quantum states. However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction. Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial lattices with desired electronic properties. Using our approach, we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial graphene lattice and confirm the existence of characteristic Dirac point in its electronic structure. Further challenges to RL-based structural assembly scalability are discussed.

Abstract: We show that, after suitably adjusting a uniform transverse magnetic field, the generic inhomogeneous open XX spin chain has a two-fold degeneracy, and an exact $su(2)$ symmetry whose "inhomogeneous" nonlocal generators depend on coefficients that can be explicitly computed for models associated with discrete orthogonal polynomials.

Title: Cation accumulation drives the preferential partitioning of DNA in an aqueous two-phase system
Authors: Hiroki Sakuta, Yuki Akamine, Akari Kamo, Hao Gong, Norikazu Ichihashi, Arash Nikoubashman, Miho Yanagisawa
Abstract: Mixtures of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran (Dex) represent a widely used class of aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS), with applications ranging from the purification of various biomolecules such as nucleic acids to the synthesis of protocells. A key feature underlying these applications is the selective accumulation of biomolecules within Dex-rich droplets in an aqueous PEG phase, but the physical origin of this partitioning remains unclear. Entropic interactions were long assumed to be the primary driving force; however, our systematic experiments using DNA of different lengths indicate that entropy alone cannot fully explain the observed behavior. We identify an additional and previously underappreciated contribution from electrostatic interactions: Dex carries a slightly more negative charge than PEG, which drives preferential cation accumulation in the Dex-rich phase. These counterions facilitate the selective partitioning of DNA inside the Dex-rich droplets. This mechanism explains the dependency of DNA uptake in Dex-rich droplets on polymer length and salt concentration. Our findings establish that Donnan-type ion partitioning plays a crucial role in the localization of long nucleic acids in Dex-rich droplets, offering a unified explanation for this long-standing phenomenon. They lay the foundation for designing ATPS-based systems and help elucidate the physicochemical principles of biomolecular partition upon phase separation in cells.

Title: Exact heat flux formula and its spectral decomposition in molecular dynamics for arbitrary many-body potentials
Authors: Markos Poulos, Donatas Surblys, Konstantinos Termentzidis
Abstract: In this study we have derived an exact framework for the calculation of the heat flux and its spectral decomposition in Molecular Dynamics (MD) for arbitrary many-body potentials. This work addresses several lacks and limitations of previous approaches and allows for the accurate computational study of thermal properties in a wide variety of many-body systems with MD. We have tested our modifications with Green-Kubo (GK) and Non-Equilibrium MD (NEMD) simulations for various 2D and 3D material systems using the Tersoff and Stillinger-Weber potentials as examples. The spectral decomposition of the heat current was also calculated for monolayer graphene (1LG) and MoS2 , for different system lengths. Our results show that the heat current calculated by our method is consistently in agreement with the thermostat current in NEMD, while previous implementations can estimate quite poorly the thermal conductivity both under GK and NEMD simulations, and both for 2D and 3D materials. The decomposition of the heat current also sheds light on the contribution of different phonon modes to thermal conductivity and its dependence on length. Our methodology is implemented in the widely used LAMMPS code specifically for the Tersoff and SW potentials, and it is readily applicable to the vast majority of many-body MD potentials.

Title: Thermodynamics of proton insertion across the perovskite-brownmillerite transition in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ
Authors: Armand J. Lannerd, Nathan J. Szymanski, Christopher J. Bartel
Abstract: La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$CoO3-$\delta$ is a promising off-stoichiometric metal oxide that undergoes a topotactic perovskite ($\delta$ = 0) to brownmillerite ($\delta$ = 0.5) transition under electrochemical and thermochemical stimuli, with concomitant variations in its electrical, magnetic, thermal, and optical properties. Recent studies on thin-film cycling in electrochemical devices show incomplete reversibility of this transition, with significant acid-etching serving as a degradation mechanism. While earlier investigations examined the protonation of brownmillerite SrCoO2.5, the thermodynamics of protonation across the perovskite-to-brownmillerite transition remain poorly understood. In this work, we combine density functional theory calculations with predictions from universal machine-learning interatomic potentials to elucidate the energetics and implications of protonation across the transition for La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$. These calculations reveal negative hydrogen insertion energies and strong competition with oxygen vacancy formation across the transition for a wide range of conditions. The extent of protonation is primarily limited by the availability of Co 3d states to accommodate reduction by inserted hydrogen. Although hydrogen insertion is often thermodynamically favorable within a defect picture, a convex hull analysis of the resulting HyLa0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$ phases reveals them to be unstable against decomposition into hydroxides among other products. This instability increases with hydrogen content and provides a thermodynamic basis for the acid-etching observed during electrochemical cycling. This work advances the fundamental understanding of protonation in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$ and contextualizes experimental observations of related materials in the presence of moisture or H2.

Title: Subdimensional entanglement entropy: from geometric-topological response to entanglement-induced mixed-state landscape
Authors: Meng-Yuan Li, Peng Ye
Abstract: A growing body of examples reveals that topology and geometry are deeply intertwined in shaping universal properties of quantum matter, as seen in fracton orders with size-dependent topological ground-state degeneracy and in cluster states with spurious topological entanglement entropy. We introduce the \textit{subdimensional entanglement entropy} (SEE), defined on \textit{subdimensional entanglement subsystems} (SESs) embedded in the bulk, as a direct probe of this intertwinement. By virtually tuning SES dimension, geometry and topology, the subleading components of SEE show sharply distinct geometric and topological responses in cluster states, $\mathbb{Z}_q$ topological orders, and fracton orders. Further viewing the SES reduced density matrix as a mixed state on the SES manifold, we establish an exact correspondence between stabilizers and mixed-state symmetries, distinguishing \textit{strong} from \textit{weak} classes. Nontrivial SEE enforces weak symmetries to act as \textit{transparent patch operators} of strong ones, together forming \textit{transparent composite symmetries} that are robust against finite depth quantum circuits. Due to the presence of transparent patch operators, each $D$-dimensional SES holographically encodes a $(D+1)$-dimensional topological order. Thus, SEE simultaneously accesses various forefront directions, providing a unified and versatile nexus linking phenomena previously regarded as distinct.

Title: Simplifying Generation of Special Quasirandom Structures with ATAT Using Interactive Online Interface - SimplySQS
Authors: Miroslav Lebeda, Jan Drahokoupil, Petr Vlčák, Šimon Svoboda, Axel van de Walle
Abstract: The special quasirandom structure (SQS) method is a widely used approach for modeling random alloys with periodic boundary conditions. Among available implementations, the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) mcsqs module remains one of the most established tools for SQS generation. However, its command-line operation and input file preparation often present a steep learning curve, particularly for students and researchers without programming experience. To lower these barriers, we have developed SimplySQS (this http URL), an online, browser-based interactive interface that automates the preparation, execution, and analysis of ATAT mcsqs outputs. SimplySQS allows users to upload or import structures from databases (MP, AFLOW, COD), configure compositions and supercells via guided forms, automatically generate ATAT input and batch scripts, and visualize results such as convergence behavior, correlation functions, and radial distribution functions. The best SQS outputs can be exported in standard formats (POSCAR, CIF, LMP, XYZ). By simplifying setup and minimizing file-handling errors, SimplySQS broadens access to ATAT mcsqs, making SQS generation more approachable for beginners while streamlining workflows for experienced users. The workflow is illustrated on the perovskite series Pb1-xSrxTiO3 (PSTO, including PbTiO3 (PTO) and SrTiO3 (STO)), where an all-in-one batch script generated with SimplySQS was used to obtain SQSs across the composition range. The resulting structures were subsequently optimized using the MACE MATPES-r2SCAN-0 universal machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) to predict evolution of lattice parameters. The MLIP accurately reproduced the cubic-to-tetragonal transition near x = 0.5, with lattice parameters deviating by less than 1 % in the cubic (x > 0.5) and 3 % in the tetragonal (x < 0.5) regions.

Title: Phase transitions in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice
Authors: Jie Qiao, Shu-Hao Zhang, Jing-Bo Qin, Xiao-Long Zhao, Qiang Cheng
Abstract: The nature of the intermediate ground-state phase in the spin-1/2 frustrated square lattice model has long been debated. Using cluster density matrix embedding theory, we investigate the phase diagram of this model. The Neel phase is directly identified for J2<0.45 and the collinear phase for J2>0.65 based on the ground state. Although no direct evidence of an internal phase transition is found within the intermediate phase from the ground state, analysis of the first excited state wave function reveals a continuous quantum phase transition in this region, with a critical point at J2=0.55. This critical point divides the intermediate phase into PVBS and CVBS.

Niedzielski, Kyle Serniak, Mollie E. Schwartz, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Philip Kim, Riccardo Comin, Jeffrey A. Grover, Terry P. Orlando, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, William D. Oliver
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) superconductors remain superconducting down to the monolayer limit, enabling the exploration of emergent physical phenomena and functionality driven by reduced dimensionality. Here, we report the characterization of the kinetic inductance of atomically thin NbSe$_2$, a two-dimensional van der Waals superconductor, using superconducting coplanar waveguides and microwave measurement techniques familiar to circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The kinetic inductance scales inversely with the number of NbSe$_2$ layers, reaching 1.2 nH/$\Box$ in the monolayer limit. Furthermore, the measured kinetic inductance exhibits a thickness-dependent crossover from clean- to dirty-limit behavior, with enhanced dirty-limit contributions emerging in the ultra-thin regime. These effects are likely driven by increased surface scattering, multi-band superconductivity, and geometric confinement. Additionally, the self-Kerr nonlinearity of the NbSe$_2$ films ranges from $K/2\pi$ = -0.008 to -14.7 Hz/photon, indicating its strong potential in applications requiring compact, nearly linear, high-inductance superconducting quantum devices and detectors. The fabrication and characterization techniques demonstrated here are extensible to the investigation of other two-dimensional superconductors.

Title: A Functional Field Theorem: An Explicit Proof of Axioms and Equations for Applying iSAFT in Polymer Field Theory
Authors: Maximo T. Estrada
Abstract: Our work establishes the mathematical equivalence between polymer Self Consistent Field Theory and interfacial SAFT based classical Density Functional Theory by providing an explicit proof that SCFT is the mean field (MF) or saddle point limit of a Legendre dual formulation of iSAFT CDFT. The polymer CDFT ideal chain term is the Legendre conjugate of the single chain generating functional built from standard SCFT propagators, so the Legendre transform converts the iSAFT CDFT Euler Lagrange equations into SCFT fixed point relations. Within this Functional Field Theory, Wertheim TPT1 association free energy can be incorporated into the excess functional, with the mass action variables providing additive SCFT fields yet leaving the propagators unchanged. Linearization about the MF solution produces a reversible mapping for fluctuation corrections, suggesting a universal response that couples the single chain correlation kernel to the iSAFT direct correlation operator, allowing the inclusion of short range structure and association cooperatively beyond mean field. Long range interactions map similarly, showing how functional derivatives can yield SCFT field contributions, while second derivatives yield the long range blocks of the iSAFT correlation operator, providing a unified treatment of polymers. Mathematically, this framework aims to clarify that SCFT and polymer DFT solvers share similar diffusion based propagators, and how iSAFT hard sphere, attraction, and association modules contribute additional field and hessian terms. Specifically, this work provides a Legendre duality proof that places SAFT CDFTs and SCFT on the same MF foundation, and a reversible theoretical framework that transfers iSAFT correlation information into SCFT, enabling modular, quantitative modeling of associating, structured polymer systems.

Title: Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Supersonic Topological Gas Dynamics
Authors: Magnus F Ivarsen
Abstract: To explain how dissipative active turbulence sustains inertial cascades, we construct a chiral model mapping overdamped agents to supersonic topological gas dynamics. Here, Mach cones function as acoustic horizons, shielding defect cores from the sound radiation of shallow water flows. We show that disorder activates a topological heat pump driving an inverse cascade toward a negative-temperature Onsager dipole, unless arrested into a vortex glass by insufficient dispersion. This mapping identifies a universality class unifying active swarms with the statistical mechanics of classical inviscid fluids.

Title: Collective cluster nucleation dynamics in 2D Ising quantum magnets
Authors: Philip Osterholz, Fabio Bensch, Shuanghong Tang, Silpa Baburaj Sheela, Igor Lesanovsky, Christian Groß
Abstract: Strongly interacting many-body systems often show collective properties that are non-trivially related to the microscopic degrees of freedom. Collectivity is responsible for intriguing ground state properties, for example, in superconductors. However, collective effects may also govern the non-equilibrium response of quantum systems, not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum field theories modeling the properties of our universe. Understanding emergent collective dynamics from first principles, in particular in non-perturbative regimes, is therefore one of the central challenges in quantum many-body physics. Here we report on the observation of collective cluster nucleation in 2D quantum Ising systems realized in an atomic Rydberg array. We observe a confined regime in which the steady-state cluster size is energy-dependent and a deconfined regime characterized by kinetically constrained dynamics of cluster nucleation. Our results mark a qualitative leap for quantum simulations with Rydberg arrays and shed light on highly collective non-equilibrium processes in one of the most important textbook models of condensed matter physics with relevance from quantum magnets and the kinetics of glass formers to cosmology.

Title: Robust, fast, and efficient formation of stable tetratomic molecules from ultracold atoms via generalized stimulated Raman exact passage
Authors: Jia-Hui Zhang, Wen-Yuan Wang, Fu-Quan Dou
Abstract: The study of the conversion of ultracold atoms into molecules has long remained a hot topic in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. However, most prior research has focused on diatomic molecules, with relatively scarce exploration of polyatomic molecules. Here we propose a two-step strategy for the formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules. We first suggest a generalized nonlinear stimulated Raman exact passage (STIREP) technique for the coherent conversion of ultracold atoms to tetratomic molecules, which is subsequently followed by a chainwise-STIREP technique to transfer the resulting molecules into a sufficiently stable ground state. Through systematic numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed two-step strategy holds great potential for the robust, fast, and efficient formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules.

Title: Interplay between Superconductivity and Altermagnetism in Disordered Materials and Heterostructures
Authors: Rodrigo de las Heras, Tim Kokkeler, Stefan Ilić, Ilya V. Tokatly, F. Sebastian Bergeret
Abstract: We study the interplay between superconductivity and altermagnetism in disordered systems using recently derived quantum kinetic transport equations. Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$\pi$ transitions.

Title: A Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Glass-Forming Ability in Ternary Alloy Systems
Authors: Fatemeh Mahmoudi
Abstract: Predicting the glass-forming ability (GFA) of chemical compositions remains a fundamental challenge in materials science, especially for oxide glasses with broad compositional diversity. Traditional empirical and thermodynamic approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear factors governing vitrification. In this study, we applied two ensemble machine learning algorithms-Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)-to the glass_ternary_hipt dataset to predict the GFA of ternary oxide glasses directly from composition-derived descriptors. Both models achieved excellent predictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.92, MAE < 0.04), confirming that GFA is learnable from compositional features alone. Feature importance analysis revealed that electronegativity variance, atomic size mismatch, and valence electron descriptors are the most influential factors, while cohesive energy and ionic radius provided secondary contributions. These chemically interpretable features align with established theories of glass formation, thereby bridging predictive performance with physical understanding. The novelty of this work lies in systematically extending ML-based predictive modeling to ternary oxide glasses, a class less studied compared to metallic and binary systems. Our results demonstrate that ensemble learning not only enables accurate GFA prediction but also provides actionable insights for designing new glass compositions with enhanced stability.

Title: Interplay of Ferromagnetic and Antiferromagnetic Interactions in Epitaxial Co$_3$ZnN
Authors: Sita Dugu, Sharad Mahatara, Corlyn E Regier, James R Neilson, Stephan Lany, Rebecca W. Smaha, Sage R Bauers
Abstract: Antiperovskite nitrides with the general formula M$_3$N have attracted significant attention due to their tunable electronic and magnetic properties. Among them are many cobalt-based compounds predicted to exhibit high thermodynamic stability and intriguing magnetic behavior. Here, we report the synthesis and magnetic characterization of epitaxial Co$_3$ZnN thin films grown by radio frequency sputtering on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and MgO substrates. X-ray diffraction confirms phase-pure (00l)-oriented films with cube-on-cube epitaxy on STO, with a c-lattice parameter of 3.752 angstroms. Magnetic measurements reveal clear hysteresis at 2 K with a coercive field of ~ 0.12 T and a small net moment of 0.11 ${\mu}_B$/f.u., suggesting either a canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic (FiM) configuration. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements show a transition near 25 K, with strong AFM interactions (Curie-Weiss $\Theta$ = -80.6 K) at high temperatures and short-range ferromagnetic correlations ($\Theta$ = +9.7 K) emerging near the transition. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo simulations indicate a ferromagnetic (FM) ground state, with the FM-AFM energy difference decreasing systematically with increasing supercell size, consistent with competition between FM and AFM/FiM interactions. These results highlight Co$_3$ZnN as a magnetically complex antiperovskite nitride with competing exchange interactions.

Abstract: Axial phonons possessing nonzero angular momentum and resulting magnetic moment can couple to magnetic order. The rich magnetic structures enable phonon angular momentum (PAM) to acquire momentum-space textures analogous to electronic spin structures. However, a systematic framework for classifying these textures, especially their potential higher-order multipolar patterns, has remained elusive. Here, by employing magnetic point group analysis, we develop a complete classification of phonons in collinear magnets, spanning ferro-, antiferro-, and alter-magnets. Our theory distinguishes four fundamental types of magnetic phonons based on symmetry and PAM wave-pattern parity. Strikingly, we reveal a full sequence of axial phonons exhibiting higher-order-wave (from $p$- to $j$-wave) PAM patterns covering both odd and even parities, which we term alteraxial phonons. Our high-throughput calculations predict hundreds of magnetic candidates hosting such alteraxial phonons. Our work establishes a symmetry-guided design principle for axial phonons and related phenomena in magnetic materials.

Title: Performance Benchmarking of Tensor Trains for accelerated Quantum-Inspired Homogenization on TPU, GPU and CPU architectures
Authors: Sascha H. Hauck, Matthias Kabel, Nicolas R. Gauger
Abstract: Recent advances in high-resolution CT-imaging technology are creating a new class of ultra-high resolved micro-structural datasets that challenge the limits of traditional homogenization approaches. While state-of-the-art FFT-based homogenization techniques remain effective for moderate datasets, their memory footprint and computational cost grow rapidly with increasing resolution, making them increasingly inefficient for industrial-scale problems. To address these challenges, the recently developed Superfast-Fourier Transform (SFFT)-based homogenization algorithm leverages the memory-efficient low-rank representations of Tensor Trains (TTs), which reduce the storage and computational requirements of large-scale homogenization problems. Developed for CPU usage, SFFT-based Homogenization efficiently handles high-resolution datasets, assuming the underlying data is well-behaved. In this work, we investigate the performance of fundamental TT operations on modern hardware accelerators using the JAX framework. This benchmarking study, comparing CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, evaluates execution times and computational efficiency. Building on these insights, we adapt the SFFT-based homogenization algorithm for usage on accelerators, achieving speed-ups of up to 10x relative to the CPU implementation, thus paving the road for the treatment of previously infeasible dataset sizes. Our results show that GPUs and TPUs achieve comparable performance in realistic scenarios, despite the relative immaturity of the TPU ecosystem, demonstrating the potential of both architectures to accelerate quantum-inspired techniques for industrial-scale simulations, particularly for homogenization problems.

Title: Correlation length in random MPS and PEPS
Authors: Cécilia Lancien, David Pérez-García
Abstract: Tensor network states are used extensively as a mathematically convenient description of physically relevant states of many-body quantum systems. Those built on regular lattices, i.e. matrix product states (MPS) in dimension 1 and projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in dimension 2 or higher, are of particular interest in condensed matter physics. The general goal of this work is to characterize which features of MPS and PEPS are generic and which are, on the contrary, exceptional. This problem can be rephrased as follows: given an MPS or PEPS sampled at random, what are the features that it displays with either high or low probability? One property which we are particularly interested in is that of having either rapidly decaying or long-range correlations. In a nutshell, our main result is that translation-invariant MPS and PEPS typically exhibit exponential decay of correlations at a high rate. We have two distinct ways of getting to this conclusion, depending on the dimensional regime under consideration. Both yield intermediate results which are of independent interest, namely: the parent Hamiltonian and the transfer operator of such MPS and PEPS typically have a large spectral gap. In all these statements, our aim is to get a quantitative estimate of the considered quantity (generic correlation length or spectral gap), which has the best possible dependency on the physical and bond dimensions of the random MPS or PEPS.

Title: Formal Integration of Electron Scattering Processes via Separation of Dynamical and Geometric Contributions
Authors: Lorenzo Bagnasacco, Fabio Taddei, Vittorio Giovannetti
Abstract: By decoupling the geometric from the dynamical contributions in the scattering processes, we develop a method to compute the scattering matrix of electrons in a one-dimensional coherent conductor connected to two electrodes. In particular, we demonstrate that, in the high-energy regime, the transmission matrix converges to the Berry operator of the system. We showcase the method through several examples featuring different in-plane magnetic field profiles. Notably, our results reveal the possibility of achieving near-perfect spin-flip transmission, highlighting potential applications in spintronics.

Title: Interplay of entanglement structures and stabilizer entropy in spin models
Authors: Michele Viscardi, Marcello Dalmonte, Alioscia Hamma, Emanuele Tirrito
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer Rényi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.

Title: Modelling Lateral Spread in Wire Flat Rolling
Authors: Mozhdeh Erfanian, Carl D. Slater, Edward James Brambley
Abstract: A mathematical model for wire rolling is developed, focusing on predicting the lateral spread. This provides, for the first time, an analytic model of lateral spread without any fitting parameters. The model is derived directly from the governing equations, assuming a rigid, perfectly plastic material and exploiting the thinness of the wire (in thickness and width) relative to the roller size. Results are compared against experiments performed on stainless steel wire using 100mm diameter rolls, demonstrating accurate predictions of lateral spread across a wide range of wire diameters (2.96mm-7.96mm) and reduction ratios (20%-60%), all without the need for fitting parameters. Since the model requires only seconds to compute, the model's valid range is explored for varying roll diameter, wire diameter, and reduction ratio, and their effects on the resulting lateral spread characterized. The model can serve as a robust tool for validating FE results, guiding process design, and laying the foundation for future improved models. Matlab code to evaluate the model is provided in the supplementary material.

Title: Quantum Glassiness From Efficient Learning
Authors: Eric R. Anschuetz
Abstract: We show a relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We use the existence of efficient, local learning algorithms for energy estimation -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- to prove that finding near-ground states of disordered quantum systems exhibiting a certain topological property is impossible in the average case for Lipschitz quantum algorithms. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including time-$T$ Lindbladian dynamics from an arbitrary initial state, time-$T$ quantum annealing, phase estimation to $T$ bits of precision, and depth-$T$ variational quantum algorithms, whenever $T$ is less than some universal constant times the logarithm of the system size. To achieve this, we introduce a generalization of the overlap gap property (OGP) for quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). We prove that preparing low-energy states of systems which exhibit the QOGP is intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations of their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.

Title: Inference of a time delay in stochastic systems
Authors: Robin A. Kopp, Sabine H. L. Klapp, Deepak Gupta
Abstract: Time delay is ubiquitous in many experimental and real-world situations. It is often unclear whether time delay plays a significant role in observed phenomena, and if it does, how long the time lag really is. This would be invaluable knowledge when analyzing and modeling such systems. Hitherto, no universal method is available by which the time delay can be inferred. To address this problem, we propose and demonstrate two different methods to infer time delay in overdamped Langevin systems with delayed feedback. In the first part, we focus on the power spectral density based on the positional data and use a characteristic signature of the time delay to infer the delay time. In limiting cases, we establish a direct relation of the observations made for nonlinear time-delayed feedback forces to analytical results obtained for the linear system. In other situations despite the absence of this direct relation, the characteristic signature remains and can be exploited by a semiautomatic method to infer the delay time. Furthermore, it may not always desirable or possible to observe a system for a long time to infer dependencies and parameters. Thus, in the second part, we propose for the first time a probing method combined with a neural network to infer the delay time, which requires only short observation time series. These proposed methods for inferring time delays in stochastic systems may prove to be valuable tools for gaining deeper insight into the role of delay across a wide range of applications -- from the behavior of individual colloidal particles under feedback control to emergent collective phenomena such as flocking and swarming.

Title: Massive Dirac states bound to vortices by a boson-fermion interaction
Authors: Ethan P. Honda
Abstract: Results are presented from numerical simulations of the flat-space nonlinear Maxwell-Klein-Gordon-Dirac equations. The introduction of a boson-fermion interaction allows a scalar vortex to act as a harmonic trap that can confine massive Dirac bound states. A parametric analysis is performed to understand the range of boson-fermion coupling strengths, Ginzburg-Landau parameters, and fermion effective masses that support the existence of bound state solutions; results are shown to be comparable to quasiparticle bound states in gapped Dirac materials. Solutions are time-evolved and are observed to be stable until the fermion field {\psi} becomes large enough to collapse the spontaneously broken vacuum of the condensate. Head-on scattering simulations are performed, and traditional vortex right-angle scattering is shown to break down with increased fermion field strength. For sufficiently large {\psi} and low velocity, the collision of two m = 1 vortices results in a pseudostable m= 2 bound state that eventually becomes unstable and decays back into two m= 1 vortices. For large {\psi} and collision velocity, vortex scattering is observed to produce nontopological (zero winding number) scalar bound states that are ejected from the collision. The scalar bubbles contain coherent fermion bound states in their interiors and interpolate between the spontaneously broken vacuum of the bulk and the modified vacuum induced by the boson-fermion interaction.

Title: Soft x-ray ptychography with SOPHIE: Guide and instrumentation
Authors: Tim A. Butcher, Simone Finizio, Lars Heller, Nicholas W. Phillips, Blagoj Sarafimov, Carlos A. F. Vaz, Armin Kleibert, Benjamin Watts, Mirko Holler, Jörg Raabe
Abstract: Soft x-ray ptychography is becoming a key synchrotron microscopy technique in the fields of condensed matter physics, chemistry, and environmental and life sciences. Its attractiveness across broad disciplinary fields is owed to the favorable combination of high spatial resolution and strong contrast mechanisms. The SOft X-ray Ptychography Highly Integrated Endstation (SOPHIE) at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) was developed to accommodate soft x-ray ptychography experiments requiring high spatial resolution, in addition to high chemical and ferroic sensitivities. An introduction to soft x-ray ptychography with SOPHIE aimed at prospective users is provided. Furthermore, an overview of the instrumentation of SOPHIE is given along with an example of the imaging capabilities, which demonstrate the achievement of a sub-10 nm spatial resolution at a photon energy of 706 eV.

Title: Adiabatic Electron Transfer in the Barrierless and Marcus-Inverted Regimes
Authors: Ethan Abraham
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.

Title: Swarming Lattice in the Frustrated Vicsek-Kuramoto Model
Authors: Yichen Lu, Yingshan Guo, Yiyi Zhang, Tong Zhu, Zhigang Zheng
Abstract: We introduce a frustration parameter $\alpha$ into the Vicsek-Kuramoto model of self-propelled particles. While the system exhibits conventional synchronized states, such as global phase synchronization and swarming, for low frustration ($\alpha < \pi/2$), beyond the critical point $\alpha = \pi/2$, a Hopf-Turing bifurcation drives a transition to a resting hexagonal lattice, accompanied by spatiotemporal patterns such as vortex lattices and dual-cluster lattices with oscillatory unit-cell motions. Lattice dominance is governed by coupling strength and interaction radius, with a clear parametric boundary balancing pattern periodicity and particle dynamics. Our results demonstrate that purely orientational interactions are sufficient to form symmetric lattices, challenging the necessity of spatial forces and illuminating the mechanisms driving lattice formation in active matter systems.

Title: Exponentially Slow Mixing of the Low Temperature SK Model
Authors: Mark Sellke
Abstract: We give a short proof that low-temperature dynamics for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model have mixing time exponential in the system size, based on the recently proved existence of gapped spin configurations by (Minzer-Sah-Sawhney 2023, Dandi-Gamarnik-Zdeborová 2023). This result is in contrast with a well established physics prediction which posits a stretched exponential mixing time of order $e^{N^{1/3 \pm o(1)}}$. Our proof clarifies that this prediction cannot apply to mixing from worst case initial conditions, but should presumably be understood to concern dynamics from a suitably random initialization.

Title: Granite sliding on granite: friction, wear rates, surface topography, and the scale-dependence of rate-state effects
Authors: Sergey V. Sukhomlinov, Martin H. Müser, B.N.J. Persson
Abstract: We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects - central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40°C and 20°C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600°C. The overall correspondence between experiments, simulations, theory, and field observations indicates that our model system captures essential aspects of rock friction.

Title: Quench dynamics of the quantum XXZ chain with staggered interactions: Exact results and simulations on digital quantum computers
Authors: Ching-Tai Huang, Yu-Cheng Lin, Ferenc Igloi
Abstract: We investigate quench dynamics in the quantum $S=1/2$ XXZ antiferromagnetic chain with staggered and anisotropic interactions in the flat-band limit. Our quench protocol interchanges the odd- and even-bond strengths of a fully dimerized chain, enabling us to derive exact time-dependent states for arbitrary even system sizes by working in the Bell basis. We obtain closed-form, size-independent expressions for the von Neumann and second-order Rényi entanglement entropies. We further calculate exact Loschmidt echoes and the corresponding return rate functions across various anisotropies and system sizes, and identify Loschmidt zeros in finite chains. Our analysis reveals the precise conditions on the anisotropy parameter that govern the periodicity of the dynamical observables. In addition to the analytic study, we perform two types of numerical experiments on IBM-Q quantum devices. First, we use the Hadamard test to estimate the Bell-basis expansion coefficients and reconstruct the dynamical states, achieving accurate entanglement entropies and the Loschmidt echo for small systems. Second, we implement Trotter-error-free time-evolution circuits combined with randomized Pauli measurements. Post-processing via statistical correlations and classical shadows yields reliable estimates of the second-order Rényi entanglement entropy and the Loschmidt echo, showing satisfactory agreement with exact results.

Title: Quantum Correlation Assisted Cooling of Microwave Cavities Below the Ambient Temperature
Authors: Daryoosh Vashaee, Jahanfar Abouie
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for cooling a microwave cavity mode using a Poisson stream of internally correlated pairs of two-level systems and analyze its performance under realistic dissipation. Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes. The two-atom configuration thus realizes a genuine quantum-enhanced cooling mechanism absent in the single-atom case. We further outline an experimental implementation using two superconducting qubits repeatedly prepared, coupled, and reset inside a 3D cavity. Realistic reset and flux-tuning protocols support MHz-rate interaction cycles, enabling engineered reservoirs to impose cavity temperatures of 50-120 mK even when the cryostat is at ~1 K, offering a pathway to autonomous, on-chip refrigeration of microwave modes in scalable quantum hardware.

Title: Absence of charged pion condensation in a magnetic field with parallel rotation
Authors: Puyuan Bai, Lianyi He
Abstract: We investigate the critical temperature of a relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate of charged bosons driven by rotation in a parallel magnetic field [Y. Liu and I. Zahed, Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 032001 (2018)]. For non-interacting bosons, the critical temperature can only be determined for a system with fixed angular momentum. We find that the critical temperature of the non-interacting system vanishes due to the fact that the system is quasi-one-dimensional, indicating that non-interacting bosons cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. For interacting bosons, we investigate a system with quartic self-interaction. We show that the order parameter vanishes and the off-diagonal long-range order is absent at any nonzero temperature because of the quasi-one-dimensional feature, in accordance with the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem.
