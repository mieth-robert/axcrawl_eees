Title: Influence of Humidity on the Resistive Switching of Hexagonal Boron Nitride-Based Memristors
Authors: Lukas Völkel, Rana Walied Ahmad, Alana Bestaeva, Dennis Braun, Sofía Cruces, Jimin Lee, Sergej Pasko, Simonas Krotkus, Michael Heuken, Stephan Menzel, Max C. Lemme
Abstract: Two-dimensional material-based memristors have recently gained attention as components of future neuromorphic computing concepts. However, their surrounding atmosphere can influence their behavior. In this work, we investigate the resistive switching behavior of hexagonal boron nitride-based memristors with active nickel electrodes under vacuum conditions. Our cells exhibit repeatable, bipolar, nonvolatile switching under voltage stress after initial forming, with a switching window > 10${^3}$ under ambient conditions. However, in a vacuum, the forming is suppressed, and hence, no switching is observed. Compact model simulations can reproduce the set kinetics of our cells under ambient conditions and predict highly suppressed resistive switching in a water-deficient environment, supporting the experimental results. Our findings have important implications for the application of h-BN-based memristors with electrochemically active electrodes since semiconductor chips are typically processed under high vacuum conditions and encapsulated to protect them from atmospheric influences.

Title: Optical coherence and hyperfine structure of the 7F0-5D0 transition in EuCaWO4
Authors: Xiantong An, Weiye Sun, Zhehao Xu, Wanting Xiao, Miaomiao Ren, Mucheng Guo, Shuping Liu, Fudong Wang, Manjin Zhong
Abstract: Rare-earth ions doped in crystals with low nuclear-spin densities are highly promising candidates for quantum technology applications. In this study, we investigated the spectroscopic properties of the 7F0 - 5 D0 optical and the hyperfine transitions of Eu3+ ions in a CaWO4 crystal, where the nuclear spin arises solely from the 183W isotope, with a natural abundance of 14%. At a temperature of 3 K, we experimentally identified four distinct crystal field environments for Eu3+ ions in a 0.1 at.% Eu3+ doped CaWO4 crystal. The optical coherence properties of Eu3+ ions in these environments were characterized. Additionally, we resolved the hyperfine structures in the 7F0 ground state and 5D0 excited state, and determined the 7F0 ground state lifetimes using spectral hole-burning techniques. These findings highlight the significant potential of Eu3+:CaWO4 for optical quantum memory applications.

Title: Separate surface and bulk topological Anderson localization transitions in disordered axion insulators
Authors: Cormac Grindall, Alexander C. Tyner, Ang-Kun Wu, Taylor L. Hughes, J. H. Pixley
Abstract: In topological phases of matter for which the bulk and boundary support distinct electronic gaps, there exists the possibility of decoupled mobility gaps in the presence of disorder. This is in analogy with the well-studied problem of realizing separate or concomitant bulk-boundary criticality in conventional Landau theory. Using a three-dimensional axion insulator having clean, gapped surfaces with $e^2/2h$ quantized Hall conductance, we show the bulk and surface mobility gap evolve differently in the presence of disorder. The decoupling of the bulk and surface topology yields a regime that realizes a two-dimensional, unquantized anomalous Hall metal in the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), which shares some spectral and response properties akin to the surface states of a conventional three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator. The generality of these results as well as extensions to other insulators and superconductors is discussed.

Title: Two Channel Kondo behavior in the quantum XX chain with a boundary defect
Authors: Yicheng Tang, Pradip Kattel, J.H. Pixley, Natan Andrei
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary defect in the single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum $XX$ chain exhibits two-channel Kondo physics. Due to the presence of the defect, the edge spin fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions, out of which one decouples, and one is overscreened by the free fermion in bulk, leading to non-trivial boundary behavior characteristic of the two-channel Kondo model. When the ratio of boundary to bulk coupling exceeds a critical value of $\sqrt{2}$, a massive boundary-bound mode is exponentially localized near the impurity site for strong impurity coupling. This leads to unusual behavior in physical quantities, such as the $g$-function not being monotonic. We compute the $g-$function of the impurity from both thermodynamic and entanglement entropy calculations and show that it takes a non-integer value of $\sqrt{2}$ just as in the two-channel Kondo problem.

Title: The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions
Authors: Subir Sachdev
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The FL*-FL quantum phase transition, and the influence of spatial disorder, is described by an analysis inspired by the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This theory successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations. The crossovers connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions are also discussed.

Title: Quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with trivial band topology
Authors: Wojciech J. Jankowski, Robert-Jan Slager, Gunnar F. Lange
Abstract: We derive quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with spin-topology characterized by a single $\mathbb{Z}$-index protected by a spin gap. Our bounds provide geometric conditions on the spin topology, distinct from the known quantum geometric bounds associated with Wilson loops and nontrivial band topologies. As a result, we obtain stricter bounds in time-reversal symmetric systems with a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and also bounds in systems with a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, where quantum metric should be otherwise unbounded. We benchmark these findings with first-principles calculations in elemental Bismuth realizing higher even nontrivial spin-Chern numbers. Moreover, we connect these bounds to optical responses, demonstrating that spin-resolved quantum geometry can be observed experimentally. Finally, we connect spin-bounds to quantum Fisher information and Cramér-Rao bounds which are central to quantum metrology, showing that the elemental Bi and other spin-topological phases hold promises for topological free fermion quantum sensors.

Title: Critical gate distance for Wigner crystallization in the two-dimensional electron gas
Authors: Agnes Valenti, Vladimir Calvera, Yubo Yang, Miguel A. Morales, Steven A. Kivelson, Ilya Esterlis, Shiwei Zhang
Abstract: We report on the properties of the two-dimensional electron gas in a dual-gate geometry, using quantum Monte Carlo methods to obtain aspects of the phase diagram as a function of electron density and gate distance. We identify the critical gate distance below which the Wigner crystal phase disappears. For larger gate distances, the system undergoes a re-entrant transition from crystal to liquid at sufficiently low density. We also present preliminary evidence for a fully polarized ferromagnetic liquid state at low electron density and intermediate gate distances. The quantum Monte Carlo results are compared with simpler approximate methods, which are shown to be semi-quantitatively reliable for determining key features of the phase diagram. These methods are then used to obtain the phase boundary between the Wigner crystal and liquid in the single-gate geometry.

Title: Crosstalk analysis in single hole-spin qubits within highly anisotropic g-tensors
Authors: Yaser Hajati, Irina Heinz, Guido Burkard
Abstract: Spin qubits based on valence band hole states are highly promising for quantum information processing due to their strong spin-orbit coupling and ultrafast operation speed. As these systems scale up, achieving high-fidelity single-qubit operations becomes essential. However, mitigating crosstalk effects from neighboring qubits in larger arrays, particularly for anisotropic qubits with strong spin-orbit coupling, presents a significant challenge. We investigate the impact of crosstalk on qubit fidelities during single-qubit operations and derive an analytical equation that serves as a synchronization condition to eliminate crosstalk in anisotropic media. Our analysis proposes optimized driving field conditions that can robustly synchronize Rabi oscillations and minimize crosstalk, showing a strong dependence on qubit anisotropy and the orientation of the external magnetic field. Taking experimental data into our analysis, we identify a set of parameter values that enable nearly crosstalk-free single-qubit gates, thereby paving the way for scalable quantum computing architectures.

Title: Microrheological model for Kelvin-Voigt materials with micro-heterogeneities
Authors: T. N. Azevedo, K. M. Oliveira, H. P. Maia, A. V. N. C. Teixeira, L. G. Rizzi
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the Kelvin-Voigt model in order to include and characterize heterogeneities in viscoelastic semisolid materials. By considering a microrheological approach, we present analytical expressions for the mean square displacement and for the time-dependent diffusion coefficient of probe particles immersed in a viscoelastic material described by this model. Besides validating our theoretical approach through Brownian dynamics simulations, we show how the model can be used to describe experimental data obtained for polyacrylamide and laponite gels.

Title: Electrically tunable Floquet Weyl photon emission from Dirac semimetal Cd3As2
Authors: Sobhan Subhra Mishra, Thomas CaiWei Tan, Manoj Gupta, Faxian Xiu, Ranjan Singh
Abstract: The ability to optically engineer the Dirac band and electrically control the Fermi level in two-dimensional (2D) Dirac systems, such as graphene, has significantly advanced quantum technologies. However, similar tunability has remained elusive in three-dimensional Dirac systems. In this work, we demonstrate both optical and electrical tunability of the band structure in the 3D Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Photoexcitation with circularly polarized light breaks time-reversal symmetry, lifting the degeneracy at Dirac points to transform the material into a Floquet Weyl semimetal with chiral Weyl nodes. This transition induces nonzero Berry curvature, giving rise to helicity-dependent transverse anomalous photocurrents, detectable through terahertz emission at normal incidence. Furthermore, applying an external electric field displaces the Fermi level away from the Dirac point, enlarging the Dirac cone projection leading to a reduced density of states of Fermi arcs. As a result, we achieve precise electrical control over Floquet band engineering, resulting in a large modulation of THz emission. Moreover, at oblique incidence, the circular photon-drag effect induces helicity-dependent longitudinal photocurrents. Simultaneous generation and manipulation of both longitudinal and transverse photocurrents enable precise control of the helicity of emitted THz pulses. These results pave the way for electric field-controlled Floquet Weyl THz sources, offering significant potential for applications in quantum computing and low-power electronics.

Title: Nanostructured superlattices as a probe of fermiology in Weyl-semimetal NbP
Authors: Nathan C. Drucker, Federico Balduini, Jules Schadt, Lorenzo Rocchino, Tathagata Paul, Vicky Hasse, Claudia Felser, Cezar B. Zota, Bernd Gotsmann
Abstract: When a charged particle is subject to both a periodic potential and magnetic field, oscillations in its conductivity occur when the field-induced cyclotron radius is commensurate with the period of the potential. This effect has been observed in two-dimensional systems including electron gases and graphene, and is related to the Hofstadter spectrum of magnetic minibands. Here we show that commensuration oscillations also can arise in the ballistic transport regime of a nanostructured 3D material, with the Weyl semimetal NbP. These oscillations encode information about the quasiparticles at the Fermi-surface, including their momentum, charge, mass, and rotational symmetry. In particular, we use the magnetic field and temperature dependence of the commensuration oscillations to extract the Fermi-momenta and quasiparticle mass, in good agreement with Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the engineered superlattice symmetry and resistivity response based on the symmetry of the Fermi surface and charge of the quasiparticles. These results demonstrate how nanopatterned superlattices can be used to characterize a 3D materials' fermiology, and also point towards new ways of engineering quantum transport in these systems.

Title: Reentrant localization transition in a dimerized quasiperiodic dipolar chain
Authors: Thomas F. Allard, Guillaume Weick
Abstract: Reentrant localization transitions, that is, the transitions of a portion of the eigenspectrum from localized to critical and then again to localized as the disorder strength is increased, have been recently unveiled in various quasiperiodic models. However, how these transitions may extend to systems with long-range coupling and dissipation remains elusive. Here we investigate the fate of such a phenomenon in a dimerized quasiperiodic chain of dipolar emitters with all-to-all coupling. Through an extensive study of the spectral properties of our model, we demonstrate that such anomalous transitions survive to all-to-all couplings when considering a staggered quasiperiodic modulation of the spacings between the emitters. Transport simulations through a driven-dissipative open quantum system approach complete our study and reveal the effects of emitter losses on the reentrant localization transition.

Title: Analytical dispersion relation for forward volume spin waves in ferrimagnets near the angular momentum compensation condition
Authors: Luis Sánchez-Tejerina, David Osuna Ruiz, Víctor Raposo, Eduardo Martínez, Luis López Díaz, Óscar Alejos
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic magnonics has become the focus of intense scientific research because of the advantages of these materials compared to ferromagnets. However, ferrimagnetic materials have received much less attention despite exhibiting similar dynamical features at the angular momentum compensation point. In this paper, we present analytical expressions describing the dispersion relation of forward volume spin waves in ferrimagnetic materials near the angular momentum compensation point. Besides, we benchmark the derived dispersion relations with full micromagnetic simulations showing a complete agreement between both approaches. This work predicts two different branches for forward volume spin waves in ferrimagnetic materials merging into a single branch at the angular momentum compensation point. Our results can assist in the design of magnonic devices built on ferrimagnetic materials.

Title: Anti-thixotropic dynamics in attractive colloidal dispersions: a shear restructuring driven by elastic stresses
Authors: Julien Bauland, Gauthier Legrand, Sébastien Manneville, Thibaut Divoux, Arnaud Poulesquen, Thomas Gibaud
Abstract: Due to rich rheological properties, dispersions of attractive colloidal particles are ubiquitous in industries. Specifically, upon experiencing a sudden reduction in shear rate, these dispersions may exhibit transient behaviors such as thixotropy-where viscosity increases over time-and anti-thixotropy, characterized by an initial viscosity decrease before reaching a steady state. While thixotropy has been described as a competition between structure buildup and disruption, the mechanisms of anti-thixotropy remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the anti-thixotropic dynamics of carbon black particles dispersed in oil-a system known for exhibiting anti-thixotropy-through flow step-down experiments. Using a multi-technique approach combining rheology with velocimetry and structural characterizations, we show that viscosity decrease results from a decrease in wall slip concomitant to shear-induced structural rearrangements, indicating a transition from a dynamical network of fractal clusters into a network of loosely connected dense agglomerates. Additionally, after a characteristic anti-thixotropic time $\tau$, a steady flow is reached. This time $\tau$ diverges with increasing shear rate at a critical value corresponding to a Mason number of one, indicating that anti-thixotropy occurs only when colloidal attraction outweighs viscous forces. More precisely, we show that the structural rearrangement underpinning the viscosity decrease is mediated by elastic stresses $\sigma_e$, such that $\tau \propto \sigma_e^{-3}$. Finally, on long time scales, the steady state is linked to a microstructure with nearly zero yield stress, indicating a loss of flow memory. These findings provide a mechanism for anti-thixotropy and suggest pathways for controlling viscosity and yield stress in attractive colloidal dispersions.

Title: How to properly measure the fracture properties of brittle materials using molecular simulations? Application to mode I and mode III in silica glass
Authors: Felix Weber, Maxime Vassaux, Lukas Laubert, Sebastian Pfaller
Abstract: The fundamental understanding of the root causes of failure requires information on atomic-scale processes. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to provide these insights while maintaining chemical specificity. However, the boundary conditions that can be applied in MD fracture simulations are limited to the linear-elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) far-field solution, posing restrictions in simulating bending or shearing deformations commonly applied in classical experimental setups. This has to date prevented the accurate and precise prediction of key fracture quantities such as critical stress intensity factors. To overcome these limitations, we here apply the domain-decomposition Capriccio method to couple atomistic MD samples representing silica glass synthesized at various quenching rates with the finite element (FE) method and perform both mode I (tension, three- and four-point bending) and mode III simulations at different loading rates. We investigate multiple criteria to best identify the onset of crack propagation based on the virial stress, the number of pair interactions, the kinetic energy/temperature, the crack velocity, and the crack opening displacement. Based on this, we propose a novel protocol that allows us to determine the fracture toughness of silica glass under mode I and III conditions from atomistic data with increased fidelity, with our results being in good agreement with experimental data and predictions from LEFM. Overall, our contribution demonstrates how coupled FE-MD simulations enable chemically specific quantitative predictions of the fracture behavior of amorphous materials under arbitrary mechanical loading conditions.

Title: Exploring the defect landscape and dopability of chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS3
Authors: Rushik Desai (1), Shubhanshu Agarwal (2), Kiruba Catherine Vincent (2), Alejandro Strachan (1), Rakesh Agrawal (2), Arun Mannodi-Kanakkithodi (1) ((1) School of Materials Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA (2) School of Chemical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA)
Abstract: BaZrS3 is a chalcogenide perovskite that has shown great promise as a photovoltaic absorber over the last few years. Despite its impressive electronic and optical properties, native point defects and impurities could impose significant limitations on the photovoltaic performance of BaZrS3. Such defects may form spontaneously, create deep levels that act as traps for carriers, and influence the device performance by changing the concentrations of electrons and holes. On the other hand, functional dopants that dominate over native defects can help tune the nature of conductivity in BaZrS3. In this work, we applied first principles computations to comprehensively investigate the defect landscape of BaZrS3, including all intrinsic defects and select impurities and dopants. BaZrS3 intrinsically exhibits n-type equilibrium conductivity under Zr-rich and Zr-poor conditions, as determined by low energy vacancy and interstitial defects. O and H impurities create relatively low energy neutral and donor-type defects. La and Nb are calculated to be stable donor-type defects, which will make BaZrS3 even more n-type, whereas As and O form amphoteric defects, which generally show higher formation energies than native defects. This work highlights the difficulty of tuning the electrical properties of BaZrS3 via doping, especially making it more p-type. However, it points to some possible avenues to inform our future work.

Title: Landau-level composition of bound exciton states in magnetic field
Authors: Dinh Van Tuan, Hanan Dery
Abstract: We present a theory that studies the state composition of a bound exciton in magnetic field. Using a basis set made of products of free electron and hole wavefunctions in Landau gauge, we derive a secular equation which shows the relation between Landau levels (LLs) of the electron and hole when a bound exciton is formed. Focusing on excitons in the light cone, we establish a scattering selection rule for the interaction of an electron in LL $n_\text{e}$ with a hole in LL $n_\text{h}$. We solve the resulting secular equation and identify a simple pairing law, $n_\text{e} = n_\text{h} + l$, which informs us on the construction of a bound exciton state with magnetic quantum number $l$, and on the interaction of the exciton magnetic moment with magnetic field. We obtain good agreement between theory results and recent measurements of the diamagnetic shifts of exciton states in WSe$_2$ monolayers.

Title: Adhesion and Reconstruction of Graphene/Hexagonal Boron Nitride Heterostructures: A Quantum Monte Carlo Study
Authors: Marcin Szyniszewski, Elaheh Mostaani, Angelika Knothe, Vladimir Enaldiev, Andrea C. Ferrari, Vladimir I. Fal'ko, Neil D. Drummond
Abstract: We investigate interlayer adhesion and relaxation at interfaces between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers in van der Waals heterostructures. The adhesion potential between graphene and hBN is calculated as a function of local lattice offset using diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods, which provide an accurate treatment of van der Waals interactions. Combining the adhesion potential with elasticity theory, we determine the relaxed structures of graphene and hBN layers at interfaces, finding no metastable structures. The adhesion potential is well described by simple Lennard-Jones pair potentials that we parameterize using our quantum Monte Carlo data. Encapsulation of graphene between near-aligned crystals of hBN gives rise to a moiré pattern whose period is determined by the misalignment angle between the hBN crystals superimposed over the moiré superlattice previously studied in graphene on an hBN substrate. We model minibands in such supermoiré superlattices and find them to be sensitive to a 180$^\circ$ rotation of one of the encapsulating hBN crystals. We find that monolayer and bilayer graphene placed on a bulk hBN substrate and bulk hBN/graphene/bulk hBN systems do not relax to adopt a common lattice constant. The energetic balance is much closer for free-standing monolayer graphene/hBN bilayers and hBN/graphene/hBN trilayers. The layers in an alternating stack of graphene and hBN are predicted to strain to adopt a common lattice constant and hence we obtain a new, stable three-dimensional crystal with a unique electronic structure.

Title: Microscopic Theory of Polaron-Polariton Dispersion and Propagation
Authors: Logan Blackham, Arshath Manjalingal, Saeed R. Koshkaki, Arkajit Mandal
Abstract: We develop an analytical microscopic theory to describe the polaron-polariton dispersion, formed by hybridizing excitons, photons, and phonons, and their coherent dynamics inside optical cavities. Starting from a microscopic light-matter Hamiltonian, we derive a simple analytical model by pursuing a non-perturbative treatment of the phonon and photon couplings to excitons. Within our theoretical framework, the phonons are treated as classical fields that are then quantized via the Floquet formalism. We show that, to a good approximation, the entire polaron-polariton system can be described using a band picture despite the phonons breaking translational symmetry. Our theory also sheds light on the long-lived coherent ballistic motion of exciton-polaritons with high excitonic character that propagate with group velocities lower than is expected from pure exciton-polariton bands, offering a microscopic explanation for these puzzling experimental observations.

Title: Pair Wavefunction Symmetry in UTe2 from Zero-Energy Surface State Visualization
Authors: Qiangqiang Gu, Shuqiu Wang, Joseph P. Carroll, Kuanysh Zhussupbekov, Christopher Broyles, Sheng Ran, Nicholas P. Butch, Shanta Saha, Johnpierre Paglione, Xiaolong Liu, J.C. Séamus Davis, Dung-Hai Lee
Abstract: Although nodal spin-triplet topological superconductivity appears probable in UTe2, its superconductive order-parameter {\Delta}_k remains unestablished. In theory, a distinctive identifier would be the existence of a superconductive topological surface band (TSB), which could facilitate zero-energy Andreev tunneling to an s-wave superconductor, and also distinguish a chiral from non-chiral {\Delta}_k via enhanced s-wave proximity. Here we employ s-wave superconductive scan-tips and detect intense zero-energy Andreev conductance at the UTe2 (0-11) termination surface. Imaging reveals sub-gap quasiparticle scattering interference signatures with a-axis orientation. The observed zero-energy Andreev peak splitting with enhanced s-wave proximity, signifies that {\Delta}_k of UTe2 is a non-chiral state: B1u, B2u or B3u. However, if the quasiparticle scattering along the a-axis is internodal, then a non-chiral B3u state is the most consistent for UTe2.

Title: Induced Interactions and Bipolarons in Spin-Orbit Coupled Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Zhe Yang, Shanshan Ding, Qizhong Zhu
Abstract: Impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can interact indirectly through the exchange of Bogoliubov excitations. These impurities, which form dressed quasiparticles known as Bose polarons due to their interaction with the BEC, can pair up to form a bound state called bipolarons, via an induced interaction. Previous studies on induced interactions have primarily focused on cases with an isotropic excitation spectrum. In this work, we investigate the properties of induced interactions and bipolarons mediated by anisotropic Bogoliubov excitations using field theory. Taking a BEC with spin-orbit coupling as an example, we show that the induced interaction becomes anisotropic. Notably, a double-minima feature appears in the induced interaction in momentum space due to the exchange of roton excitations. Additionally, we calculate the binding energy and wave functions of these bipolarons induced by anisotropic interactions. Unlike previously studied bipolarons formed through the exchange of isotropic phonon excitations, we identify a new type of bipolarons whose wave functions feature a double-peak structure under strong impurity-boson interactions. Our work extends the theory of induced interactions from isotropic to anisotropic systems, and reveals the novel features in both the induced interactions and bipolarons arising from BEC with an unconventional excitation spectrum.

Title: Correlation between ferroelectricity and torsional motion of acetyl groups in tris(4-acetylphenyl)amine observed by muon spin relaxation
Authors: J. G. Nakamura, M. Hiraishi, H. Okabe, A. Koda, R. Kumai, F. L. Pratt, R. Kadono
Abstract: It is demonstrated by muon spin relaxation and resonance experiments that the switchable spontaneous polarization of the organic ferroelectric compound tris(4-acetylphenyl)amine (TAPA) is governed by the local molecular dynamics of the acetyl group. The implanted muon forms paramagnetic states which exhibit longitudinal spin relaxation due to the fluctuation of hyperfine fields exerted from unpaired electrons. The first-principle density functional theory calculations indicate that these states are muonated radicals localized at the phenyl group and on the carbon/oxygen of the acetyl group, thereby suggesting that the spin relaxation is dominated by the random torsional motion of acetyl group around the CC bond to the phenyl group. The stepwise change in the relative yield of radicals at $T_0\approx 350$ K and the gradual increase in the spin relaxation rate with temperature ($T$) indicate that the torsional motion is significantly enhanced by thermal excitation above $T_0$. This occurs concomitantly with the strong enhancement in the atomic displacement parameter of oxygen in the acetyl group (which is non-linear in $T$), indicating that it is the local molecular motion of the acetyl groups that drives the structural transition.

Title: Small hole polarons in yellow phase $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$
Authors: Yun Liu
Abstract: A heterophase containing both the optically active $\alpha$-CsPbI$_3$ and non-active $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$ has been demonstrated as an efficient white light emitter. This has challenged the conventional perspective that non-active phases of perovskites are undesirable in any perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. To understand the role that the yellow phase $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$ plays in the light emission process, we performed a systematic computational study on its electronic and optical properties, which are relatively unexplored in the literature. Using the Fröhlich model we showed that the electron and hole both exhibit moderate coupling to longitudinal optical phonons. Explicit density functional theory calculations show that small hole polarons exist with a formation energy of -96 meV, corresponding to the contraction of the Pb-I bonds within a [PbI$_6$] octahedra and wavefunction localization. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the small hole polaron is stable against thermal disorder, and exhibit periodic localization and delocalization behavior similar to carrier hopping with a characteristic lifetime of 0.3 ps. Our results might have elucidated the role that $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$ play in the self-trapped emission in perovskite-based white light emitting diodes by supporting the presence of a localized small hole polaron.

Title: Unconventional Superconducting Phase Diagram of Monolayer WTe2

Abstract: The existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) and fluctuations around it are believed to be important for understanding the phase diagram in unconventional superconductors such as cuprates, iron pnictides, and heavy fermion superconductors. However, the QCP is usually buried deep within the superconducting dome and is difficult to investigate. The connection between quantum critical fluctuations and superconductivity remains an outstanding problem in condensed matter. Here combining both electrical transport and Nernst experiments, we explicitly demonstrate the onset of superconductivity at an unconventional QCP in gate-tuned monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2), with features incompatible with the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) scenario. The results lead to a novel superconducting phase diagram that is distinguished from other known superconductors. Two distinct gate-tuned quantum phase transitions are observed at the ends of the superconducting dome. We find that quantum fluctuations around the QCP of the underdoped regime are essential for understanding how the monolayer superconductivity is established. The unconventional phase diagram we report here illustrates a previously unknown relation between superconductivity and QCP.

Title: Spin frustration and unconventional spin twisting state in van der Waals ferromagnet/antiferromagnet heterostructures

Abstract: Atomically flat surfaces of van der Waals (vdW) materials pave an avenue for addressing a long-standing fundamental issue of how a perfectly compensated antiferromagnet (AFM) surface frustrates a ferromagnetic (FM) overlayer in FM/AFM heterostructures. By revealing the AFM and FM spin structures separately in vdW Fe5GeTe2/NiPS3 heterostructures, we find that C-type in-plane AFM NiPS3 develops three equivalent AFM domains which are robust against external magnetic field and magnetic coupling with Fe5GeTe2. Consequently, spin frustration at the Fe5GeTe2/NiPS3 interface was shown to develop a perpendicular Fe5GeTe2 magnetization in the interfacial region that switches separately from the bulk of the Fe5GeTe2 magnetizations. In particular, we discover an unconventional spin twisting state that the Fe5GeTe2 spins twist from perpendicular direction near the interface to in-plane direction away from the interface in Fe5GeTe2/NiPS3. Our finding of the twisting spin texture is a unique property of spin frustration in van der Waals magnetic heterostructures.

Title: Strongly Repulsive 1D Gases at Higher Branches: Spin-Charge Correlation and Coupled Spin-Chain Model
Authors: Yu Chen, Xiaoling Cui
Abstract: We investigate the higher repulsive branches of one-dimensional (1D) bosonic and fermionic quantum gases beyond the super-Tonks-Girardeau regime, utilizing the Bethe-Ansatz method and exact diagonalization of small trapped clusters. In contrast to the well-studied lowest branches that are characterized by spin-charge separation, we demonstrate the emergence of strong spin-charge correlation in all higher branches with hard-core interactions. This manifests in distinct quasi-momentum distributions and energy spectra for bosons and spin-1/2 fermions, despite their fermionization. Furthermore, trapped fermions in higher branches exhibit novel spin textures, intricately linked to charge excitations, necessitating a coupled multi-chain description beyond single effective spin-chain models. Our findings unveil a rich interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in highly excited 1D systems, opening avenues for exploring novel quantum phenomena beyond the conventional paradigm of low-lying states.

Title: Systematic investigation of dynamic nuclear polarization with boron vacancy in hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Yuki Nakamura, Shunsuke Nishimura, Takuya Iwasaki, Shu Nakaharai, Shinichi Ogawa, Yukinori Morita, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kento Sasaki, Kensuke Kobayashi
Abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) using the boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has gained increasing attention. Understanding this DNP requires systematically investigating the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra and developing a model that quantitatively describes its behavior. Here, we measure the ODMR spectra of $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ in $\mathrm{h}^{10}\mathrm{B}^{15}\mathrm{N}$ over a wide magnetic field range, including the ground state level anti-crossing (GSLAC), and compare them with the results of the Lindblad-based simulation that considers a single electron spin and three neighboring $^{15}\mathrm{N}$ nuclear spins. Our simulation successfully reproduces the experimental spectra, including the vicinity of GSLAC. It can explain the overall behavior of the magnetic field dependence of the nuclear spin polarization estimated using the Lorentzian fitting of the spectra. Despite such qualitative agreement, we also demonstrate that the fitting methods cannot give accurate polarizations. Finally, we discuss that symmetry-induced mechanisms of $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ limit the maximum polarization. Our study is an essential step toward a quantitative understanding of DNP using defects in hBN and its quantum applications.

Title: Decomposition of entropy production for free-energy generation in a non-equilibrium dot with multiple electron states
Authors: Chloe Salhani, Kensaku Chida, Takase Shimizu, Toshiaki Hayashi, Katsuhiko Nishiguchi
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the decomposition of entropy production during free-energy generation in a nanometer-scale dot transitioning to a non-equilibrium steady state via single-electron counting statistics. An alternating-current signal driving a reservoir that injects multiple electrons into the dot makes it non-equilibrium, leading to free-energy generation, heat dissipation, and Shannon-entropy production. By analyzing the time-domain probability distributions of multiple electron states of the dot, we quantitatively decompose the heat dissipation into housekeeping and excess heats, revealing the correlation between the free energy and the decomposed components of heat dissipation. This correlation suggests that the ratio of the generated free energy to the work applied to the dot, can potentially reach 0.5 under far-from-equilibrium conditions induced by a large signal, while an efficiency of 0.25 was experimentally achieved. Our results, providing the theoretical and experimental efficiencies from the relation between decomposed heat dissipation and free-energy generation, promise to connect non-equilibrium thermodynamics perspectives to electronic devices.

Title: Laser patterning of the room temperature van der Waals ferromagnet 1$T$-CrTe$_2$

Abstract: Lamellar crystalline materials, whose layers are bond by van der Waals forces, can be stacked to form ultrathin artificial heterostructures, and in particular vertical magnetic junctions when some of the stacked materials are (ferro)magnetic. Here, using the room temperature van der Waals ferromagnet 1$T$-CrTe$_2$, we report a method for patterning lateral magnetic junctions. Exploiting the heat-induced phase transformation of the material into Cr$_x$Te$_y$ compounds ($x/y>1/2$), we use local laser heating to imprint patterns at the micron-scale. Optimizing laser heat dissipation, we further demonstrate the crucial role of the substrate to control the phase transformation. If plain, unstructured poorly heat-conducting substrates allow for direct writing of magnetic patterns, structured $h$-BN layers can serve as heat stencils to draw potentially thinner patterns. Besides, $h$-BN encapsulation turns out to be heat-protective (in addition from protecting against oxidation as it is generally used for), allowing the demonstration of room temperature ferromagnetism in $<$7~nm-thick 1$T$-CrTe$_2$.

Title: Quantum Geometric Origin of Strain-Tunable Giant Second-Harmonic Generation in Bi$_2$O$_2$X (X=S, Se, Te)
Authors: Zhefeng Lou, Zhihao Gong, Ziye Zhu, Wenbin Li, Xiao Lin, Hua Wang
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with giant nonlinear optical (NLO) responses are essential for the development of advanced on-chip NLO devices. Using first-principles calculations, we predict a remarkable strain-induced enhancement of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in the high-performance 2D semiconductors Bi$_2$O$_2$X (X = S, Se, Te). The SHG susceptibilities of Bi$_2$O$_2$X under strain are on the order of 1~nm/V, rivalling the highest values reported among 2D materials. This giant SHG response originates from gauge-invariant geometric quantities, including the quantum metric, shift vector, and triple phase product. The strain also induces a bandgap variation in Bi$_2$O$_2$X. Intriguingly, in Bi$_2$O$_2$Te, strain-induced bandgap tuning drives a transition from a semiconductor to a half-metal, and ultimately to a polar metal. Our findings present a unique platform that combines strain-tunable bandgap engineering with exceptional NLO properties, while also highlighting the crucial role of quantum geometry in enhancing SHG.

Title: Networks of neural networks: more is different
Authors: Elena Agliari, Andrea Alessandrelli, Adriano Barra, Martino Salomone Centonze, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: The common thread behind the recent Nobel Prize in Physics to John Hopfield and those conferred to Giorgio Parisi in 2021 and Philip Anderson in 1977 is disorder. Quoting Philip Anderson: "more is different". This principle has been extensively demonstrated in magnetic systems and spin glasses, and, in this work, we test its validity on Hopfield neural networks to show how an assembly of these models displays emergent capabilities that are not present at a single network level. Such an assembly is designed as a layered associative Hebbian network that, beyond accomplishing standard pattern recognition, spontaneously performs also pattern disentanglement. Namely, when inputted with a composite signal -- e.g., a musical chord -- it can return the single constituting elements -- e.g., the notes making up the chord. Here, restricting to notes coded as Rademacher vectors and chords that are their mixtures (i.e., spurious states), we use tools borrowed from statistical mechanics of disordered systems to investigate this task, obtaining the conditions over the model control-parameters such that pattern disentanglement is successfully executed.

Title: Anisotropic galvanomagnetic effects in single-crystal Fe(001) films elucidated by a phenomenological theory
Authors: Haoran Chen, Zhen Cheng, Yizi Feng, Hongyue Xu, Tong Wu, Chuanhang Chen, Yue Chen, Zhe Yuan, Yizheng Wu
Abstract: Utilizing the phenomenological theory based on crystal symmetry operation, we have established the complete angular dependencies of the galvanomagnetic effects, encompassing both anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and the planar Hall effect (PHE), for the ferromagnetic films with C4v symmetry. These dependencies were experimentally confirmed via comprehensive angular-mapping of AMR and PHE in single-crystal Fe(001) films at room temperature. We demonstrated that the intrinsic magnetization-induced effects are independent of the field strength by carefully separating the field-induced and magnetization-induced galvanomagnetic effects. Our theoretical and experimental findings highlight the absence of in-plane four-fold angular dependence in PHE, a feature prohibited by the Onsager relation in systems with C4 symmetry. This study affirms that the universal angular dependencies of AMR and PHE in single crystals can be accurately predicted by the conventional phenomenological theory.

Title: Anomalous Landau levels and quantum oscillation in rotation-invariant insulators
Authors: Jianlong Fu, Chun Yu Weng, Hoi Chun Po
Abstract: Landau levels in certain models are known to protrude into the zero-field energy gap. These are known as anomalous Landau levels (ALLs). We study whether ALLs can lead to in-gap quantum oscillation in the absence of a zero-field Fermi surface. Focusing on two-dimensional multi-band low-energy models of electrons with continuous rotation symmetry, we show that an effective-band description, akin to the semiclassical treatment of Landau level problems in metals, can be used to predict the Landau level spectrum, including possible ALLs. This description then predicts quantum oscillation for certain insulating models, which we demonstrate through numerical calculations.

Title: Reversal of Spin-torque Polarity with Inverting Current Vorticity in Composition-graded Layer at the Ti/W Interface
Authors: Hayato Nakayama, Taisuke Horaguchi, Jun Uzuhashi, Cong He, Hiroaki Sukegawa, Tadakatsu Ohkubo, Seiji Mitani, Kazuto Yamanoi, Yukio Nozaki
Abstract: While compositional gradient-induced spin-current generation has been explored, its microscopic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, the contribution of polarity of compositional gradient on spin-current generation is explored. A nanoscale compositional gradient, formed by in-situ atomic diffusion of ultrathin Ti and W layers, is introduced between 10-nm-thick W and Ti layers. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance in ferromagnetic Ni95Cu5 deposited on this gradient reveals that a moderate compositional gradient suppresses negative spin torque from the spin Hall effect in W. In contrast, reversing the Ti/W stacking order, which inverts the gradient, suppresses positive spin torque from the orbital Hall effect in Ti. These findings suggest that the sign of spin torque is governed by the polarity of compositional gradient, providing a novel strategy for efficient spin-torque generation without relying on materials with strong spin or orbital Hall effect.

Title: Theoretical study of the impact of carrier density screening on Urbach tail energies and optical polarization in (Al,Ga)N quantum well systems
Authors: Robert Finn, Michael O'Donovan, Thomas Koprucki, Stefan Schulz
Abstract: Aluminium Gallium Nitride ((Al,Ga)N) presents an ideal platform for designing ultra-violet (UV) light emitters across the entire UV spectral range. However, in the deep-UV spectral range (<280 nm) these emitters exhibit very low quantum efficiencies, which in part is linked to the light polarization characteristics of (Al,Ga)N quantum wells (QWs). In this study we provide insight into the degree of optical polarization of (Al,Ga)N QW systems operating across the UV-C spectral range by means of an atomistic, multi-band electronic structure model. Our model not only captures the difference in valence band ordering in AlN and GaN, it accounts also for alloy disorder induced band mixing effects originating from random alloy fluctuations in (Al,Ga)N QWs. The latter aspect is not captured in widely employed continuum based models. The impact of alloy disorder on the electronic structure is studied in terms of Urbach tail energies, which reflect the broadening of the valence band density of states due to carrier localization effects. We find that especially in wider wells, Urbach tail energies are reduced with increasing carrier densities in the well, highlighting that alloy disorder induced carrier localization effects in (Al,Ga)N QWs are also tightly linked to electrostatic built-in fields. Our calculations show that for QWs designed to emit at the longer wavelength end of the UV-C spectrum, carrier density and well width are of secondary importance for their light emission properties, meaning that one observes mainly transverse electrical polarization. However, for (Al,Ga)N QWs with high Al contents, we find that both well width and carrier density will impact the degree of optical polarization. Our calculations suggest that wider wells will increase the degree of optical polarization and may therefore be a viable option to improve the light extraction efficiency in deep UV light emitters.

Title: Original Ultra-hard Orthorhombic Carbon allotropes C8 with lonsdaleite-type lon topology: Crystallographic and DFT investigations
Authors: Samir F Matar
Abstract: The lon topology inherent to lonsdaleite C4 hexagonal diamond is shown to characterize three original carbon allotropes C8 in the orthorhombic system with irregular orientations of the C4 tetrahedra. The octacarbon stoichiometries were devised from crystal structure engineering and identified close to lonsdaleite from density functional theory (DFT) based calculations of ground state structures and energy derived physical properties. Characterized with high densities, the three allotropes are identified with ultra hard with hardness magnitudes close and superior to lonsdaleite. Dynamically, all three allotropes were found stable with positive frequencies revealed from their phonons band structures with specific heat CV = f(T) calculated curves close to diamond experimental values from literature.

Title: Multi-types of Instability Process of Periodic Orbits in Nonlinear Chains
Authors: Weicheng Fu, Zhen Wang, Yong Zhang, Hong Zhao
Abstract: Nonlinear normal modes are periodic orbits that survive in nonlinear many-body Hamiltonian systems, and their instability plays a key role in the system's relaxation dynamics. We investigate here the instability of the $\pi/3$-mode in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-$\alpha$ chain with fixed boundary conditions. We find that three types of bifurcations -- period-doubling, tangent, and Hopf bifurcations -- coexist in this system, each driving instability at specific reduced wave-number $\tilde{k}$. Our analysis reveals a universal scaling law for the instability time $\mathcal{T} \propto (\lambda - \lambda_{\rm c})^{-1/2}$, independent of bifurcation types and models, where the critical perturbation strength $\lambda_{\rm c}$ depends on $\tilde{k}$ via $\lambda_{\rm c} \propto (\tilde{k} - \tilde{k}_{\rm c})$, with $\tilde{k}_{\rm c}$ varying across bifurcations. We also observe a double instability phenomenon for certain system sizes. These results provide new insights into the relaxation and thermalization dynamics in many-body systems, with broad implications for nonlinear and non-equilibrium statistical physics.

Title: Quantum fluctuations can enhance or reduce positional uncertainty at finite temperature
Authors: Harukuni Ikeda
Abstract: The uncertainty principle guarantees a non-zero value for the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle > 0$, even without thermal fluctuations. This implies that quantum fluctuations inherently enhance positional uncertainty at zero temperature. A natural question then arises: what happens at finite temperatures, where the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations may give rise to complex and intriguing behaviors? To address this question, we systematically investigate the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$, of a particle in equilibrium confined within a nonlinear potential of the form $V(x) \propto x^a$, where $a = 2, 4, 6, \dots$ represents an even exponent. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ in equilibrium as a function of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\Lambda$. Interestingly, for large values of $a$, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$: it initially decreases with increasing $\Lambda$ at small $\Lambda$ but increases at larger $\Lambda$. To further understand this behavior, we employ a semiclassical approximation, which reveals that quantum fluctuations can reduce positional uncertainty for small $\Lambda$ when the nonlinearity of the potential is sufficiently strong. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this result for many-body phenomena driven by strong nonlinear interactions, such as glass transitions, where the transition densities exhibit a similar non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$.

Title: Active chiral rotors: hydrodynamics and chemotaxis
Authors: R. Maity, Snigdha Thakur, P. S. Burada
Abstract: An active chiral rotor is a spherical object that can generate chiral flows in a fluid by rotating about an axis. For example, if the flow around the upper hemisphere of the chiral rotor is in a clockwise direction, then the flow in the lower hemisphere is in the anti-clockwise direction, and vice versa. In this paper, we aim to study the combined behaviour of hydrodynamically interacting chiral rotors in the presence of an external chemical gradient. While a single isolated rotor is stationary in a fluid, a pair of rotors can move in linear or circular paths as they hydrodynamically interact with each other. It is observed that the emergent linear or circular trajectories depend on the type of rotors and the orientation of their rotation axes. The dynamics of the rotors are altered in a more complex environment, such as in an external chemical field. Interestingly, we observe two types of motion: chemotaxis and anti-chemotaxis. While in the anti-chemotaxis case, both rotors are driving away from the target, in the chemotaxis case, one of the rotors successfully reaches the chemical target. This study helps to understand the collective behavior of self-propelled microorganisms and artificial swimmers.

Title: Two-dimensional spectroscopy of bosonic collective excitations in disordered many-body systems
Authors: Alex Gómez Salvador, Ivan Morera, Marios H. Michael, Pavel E. Dolgirev, Danica Pavicevic, Albert Liu, Andrea Cavalleri, Eugene Demler
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical approach for computing and analyzing two-dimensional spectroscopy of bosonic collective excitations in disordered many-body systems. Specifically, we employ the Keldysh formalism to derive the nonlinear response and obtain two-dimensional spectroscopy maps with particular emphasis on the rephasing sector, which allows to disentangle different sources of broadening. Our many-body approach successfully distinguishes elastic and inelastic scattering mechanisms contributing to the excitation linewidth. Additionally, using a non-perturbative conserving approach, we demonstrate that the echo peak exhibits a universal asymmetric shape in the sole presence of static disorder, a feature that remains robust against quantum fluctuations. This is in stark contrast to the standard theory based on isolated two-level systems, which fails to account for the dispersive nature of excitations and the interactions between different momentum components.

Title: Ultra-strong coupling of two ferromagnets via Meissner currents
Authors: V. M. Gordeeva, G. A. Bobkov, A. M. Bobkov, I. V. Bobkova, Tao Yu
Abstract: In this work, we study the magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet trilayer sandwiched between two superconductors (S/F/I/F/S heterostructure). It is well-known that a conceptually similar S/F/S system is a platform for implementing ultra-strong magnon-photon coupling. Here, we demonstrate that in such S/F/I/F/S heterostructure, ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling also appears. The strength of this interaction is many times greater than the strength of the usual dipole-dipole interaction. It is mediated via Meissner currents excited in the superconductor layers by the magnon stray fields. The strength of the magnon-magnon coupling is anisotropic, and its anisotropy is opposite to the anisotropy of the magnon-photon coupling, which allows them to be separated. Both couplings become much stronger when the temperature drops below the critical temperature of the superconductor layers. It enables the implementation of an efficient tuning of the wavenumber in the S/F/I/F/S heterostructures controlled by temperature in a wide range of frequencies. Overall, the rich and tunable spectrum of S/F/I/F/S multilayers opens broad prospects for their application in magnonics.

Title: Bi-self-trapping of excitons via the long-living phonon mode and their superfluorescent markers
Authors: Vladimir Al. Osipov
Abstract: Understanding the origin of the system response offers guidance for designing single-component material devices with required properties. A notable phenomenon of room-temperature superfluorescence recently observed in hybrid perovskites at high concentrations of excitations lacks of comprehensive theoretical framework. Addressing this gap necessitates a discussion grounded in non-linear and multiparticle theories. In this study, we offer the two-step mechanism: formation of two self-trapped excitons entangled via the same long-living phonon mode, and their rearrangement into a superradiating mirror symmetric configuration. Based on the semiclassical equations of motion we examine the criteria for the high-temperature self-trapping and bi-self trapping of excitons. Our findings indicate that the self-trapped excitons are described by the stable phase-locked steadystate solution of the equations of motion, and at elevated exciton concentrations, they compete with the bi-self-trapped excitons. The latter is described by the Dicke model and is thus responsible for the generation of the superfluorescent spectral peak. The obtained theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the experimental observation.

Title: Unconventional resistive switching in dense Ag-based nanowire networks with brain-inspired perspectives
Authors: Juan I. Diaz Schneider, Cynthia P. Quinteros, Eduardo D. Martínez, Pablo E. Levy
Abstract: We report an unconventional resistive switching effect on high-density self-assembled Ag-nanowire networks tailored by a fuse-like operation. We propose a mechanism to rationalize the observed phenomenology by analyzing the electrical signatures before and after such a fusing. The explanation allows reconciling the results obtained in similar systems early adopted as transparent electrodes and the more recent attempts to use this type of substrate for in-materia computational operations. In addition to the usual analog nature of the available resistance states and the ability to tune internal weights, we show that these networks' sparsity and non-linear behavior are also attributes. Thus, the formerly exhibited nanowires' abilities to code synaptic behavior are complemented by neuronal features upon properly tuning the network density and the applied electrical protocol.

Title: Machine-learning semi-local exchange-correlation functionals for Kohn-Sham density functional theory of the Hubbard model
Authors: Eoghan Cronin, Rajarshi Tiwari, Stefano Sanvito
Abstract: The Hubbard model provides a test bed to investigate the complex behaviour arising from electron-electron interaction in strongly-correlated systems and naturally emerges as the foundation model for lattice density functional theory (DFT). Similarly to conventional DFT, lattice DFT computes the ground-state energy of a given Hubbard model, by minimising a universal energy functional of the on-site occupations. Here we use machine learning to construct a class of scalable `semi-local' exchange-correlation functionals with an arbitrary degree of non-locality for the one-dimensional spinfull Hubbard model. Then, by functional derivative we construct an associated Kohn-Sham potential, that is used to solve the associated Kohn-Sham equations. After having investigated how the accuracy of the semi-local approximation depends on the degree of non-locality, we use our Kohn-Sham scheme to compute the polarizability of linear chains, either homogeneous or disordered, approaching the thermodynamic limit. approaching the thermodynamic limit.

Title: The spin-orbital Kitaev model: from kagome spin ice to classical fractons
Authors: Weslei B. Fontana, Fabrizio G. Oliviero, Rodrigo G. Pereira, Willian M. H. Natori
Abstract: We study an exactly solvable spin-orbital model that can be regarded as a classical analogue of the celebrated Kitaev honeycomb model and describes interactions between Rydberg atoms on the ruby lattice. We leverage its local and nonlocal symmetries to determine the exact partition function and the static structure factor. A mapping between $S=3/2$ models on the honeycomb lattice and kagome spin Hamiltonians allows us to interpret the thermodynamic properties in terms of a classical kagome spin ice. Partially lifting the symmetries associated with line operators, we obtain a model characterized by immobile excitations, called classical fractons, and a ground state degeneracy that increases exponentially with the length of the system. We formulate a continuum theory that reveals the underlying gauge structure and conserved charges. Extensions of our theory to other lattices and higher-spin systems are suggested.

Title: Universality of the complete-graph Potts model with $0< q \leq 2$
Authors: Zirui Peng, Sheng Fang, Hao Hu, Youjin Deng
Abstract: Universality is a fundamental concept in modern physics. For the $q$-state Potts model, the critical exponents are merely determined by the order-parameter symmetry $S_q$, spatial dimensionality and interaction range, independent of microscopic details. In a simplest and mean-field treatment--i.e., the Potts model on complete graph (CG), the phase transition is further established to be of percolation universality for the range of $0 < q <2$. By simulating the CG Potts model in the random-cluster representation, we numerically demonstrate such a hyper-universality that the critical exponents are the same for $0< q <2$ and, moreover, the Ising system ($q = 2$) exhibits a variety of critical geometric properties in percolation universality. On the other hand, many other universal properties in the finite-size scaling (FSS) theory, including Binder-like ratios and distribution function of the order parameter, are observed to be $q$-dependent. Our finding provides valuable insights for the study of critical phenomena in finite spatial dimensions, particularly when the FSS theory is utilized.

Title: A sturdy spin-momentum locking in a chiral organic superconductor
Authors: Takuro Sato, Hiroshi Goto, Hiroshi M. Yamamoto
Abstract: Among noncentrosymmetric structures, chirality has recently been recognized as a novel source of asymmetrical charge/spin transports as exemplified by electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (EMChA) and chirality-induced spin selectivity. Although similar bulk-charge rectification and Rashba-Edelstein effect in polar systems are quantitively reproducible by theory based on the electronic band structures, the relevance of band parameters in chiral effects remains elusive. Here, by working with a chiral organic superconductor, we experimentally demonstrate a gigantic EMChA and large superconducting diode effect, both of which are difficult to be explained solely by its band parameters. A two-critical-current signature and an enhanced critical field suggested triplet-mixed Cooper pairs with anomalously enhanced spin-orbit coupling above atomic limit. Our results clearly highlight a unique spin-momentum locking with large stiffness beyond the expectation, suggesting an unknown driving force for spin polarization inherent to chirality.

Title: The Effect of the Non-Abelian Quantum Metric on Superfluidity
Authors: Kai Chen, Bishnu Karki, Pavan Hosur
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor, which encodes the full geometric information of quantum states in projective Hilbert space, plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. In this work, we examine the effect of the non-Abelian quantum metric -- the real part of the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor -- on the superfluid weight in time-reversal symmetric systems. For conventional $s$-wave pairing, we demonstrate that the superfluid weight includes a contribution proportional to the trace of the non-Abelian quantum metric. Notably, this contribution remains significant even when the total Chern number of a set of degenerate bands is zero and can exceed the conventional contribution, as confirmed using lattice models. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations for MoS$_2$ and TiSe$_2$ further corroborate these findings, revealing that the non-Abelian quantum metric accounts for up to 20% of the superfluid weight in MoS$_2$ and 50% in TiSe$_2$. Our results provide new insights into the nontrivial relationship between the geometric properties of quantum states and superconductivity, opening avenues for further exploration in topological and superconducting materials.

Title: Glassforming liquid crystalline equimolar mixtures of MHPOBC and fluorinated compounds -- structural, optical, and dielectric properties
Authors: Aleksandra Deptuch, Anna Paliga, Anna Drzewicz, Michał Czerwiński, Ewa Juszyńska-Gałązka
Abstract: Three liquid crystalline equimolar mixtures are formulated, each containing the MHPOBC compound and the homolog from the 3FmHPhF6 series with m = 4, 5 or 6. The properties of the mixtures are investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electro-optic measurements, and UV-Vis-NIR and dielectric spectroscopies. In all mixtures, the smectic A*, smectic C*, and smectic C$_A$* phases are observed. Each mixture can be supercooled and forms the glass of smectic C$_A$* at 225-238 K. The glass transition temperature decreases with the increasing C$_m$H$_{2m}$ chain length in the 3FmHPhF6 molecule. The tilt angle in the smectic C$_A$* phase reaches 36.5-37.5°. The selective reflection of light in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges is observed, with a strong dependence of the reflected light's wavenumber on temperature.

Title: Emergent collective behavior of cohesive, aligning particles
Authors: Jeanine Shea, Holger Stark
Abstract: Collective behavior is all around us, from flocks of birds to schools of fish. These systems are immensely complex, which makes it pertinent to study their behavior through minimal models. We introduce such a minimal model for cohesive and aligning self-propelled particles in which group cohesion is established through additive, non-reciprocal torques. These torques cause constituents to effectively turn towards one another. We additionally incorporate an alignment torque, which competes with the cohesive torque in the same spatial range. By changing the strength and range of these torque interactions, we uncover six states which we distinguish via their static and dynamic properties: a disperse state, a multiple worm state, a line state, a persistent worm state, a rotary worm state, and an aster state. Their occurrence strongly depends on initial conditions and stochasticity, so the model exhibits multistabilities. A number of the states exhibit collective dynamics which are reminiscent of those seen in nature.

Title: Probing quantum many-body dynamics using subsystem Loschmidt echos
Authors: Simon Karch, Souvik Bandyopadhyay, Zheng-Hang Sun, Alexander Impertro, SeungJung Huh, Irene Prieto Rodríguez, Julian F. Wienand, Wolfgang Ketterle, Markus Heyl, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Immanuel Bloch, Monika Aidelsburger
Abstract: The Loschmidt echo - the probability of a quantum many-body system to return to its initial state following a dynamical evolution - generally contains key information about a quantum system, relevant across various scientific fields including quantum chaos, quantum many-body physics, or high-energy physics. However, it is typically exponentially small in system size, posing an outstanding challenge for experiments. Here, we experimentally investigate the subsystem Loschmidt echo, a quasi-local observable that captures key features of the Loschmidt echo while being readily accessible experimentally. Utilizing quantum gas microscopy, we study its short- and long-time dynamics. In the short-time regime, we observe a dynamical quantum phase transition arising from genuine higher-order correlations. In the long-time regime, the subsystem Loschmidt echo allows us to quantitatively determine the effective dimension and structure of the accessible Hilbert space in the thermodynamic limit. Performing these measurements in the ergodic regime and in the presence of emergent kinetic constraints, we provide direct experimental evidence for ergodicity breaking due to fragmentation of the Hilbert space. Our results establish the subsystem Loschmidt echo as a novel and powerful tool that allows paradigmatic studies of both non-equilibrium dynamics and equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-body systems, applicable to a broad range of quantum simulation and computing platforms.

Title: Upper critical field and colossal spin valve analogy in normal metal-superconductor-normal metal trilayers
Authors: Kelsey B. Robbins, Pukar Sedai, Alexandra J. Howzen, Robert M. Klaes, Reza Loloee, Norman O. Birge, Nathan Satchell
Abstract: The role of spin orbit interaction in superconducting proximity effect is an area of intense research effort. Recent theoretical and experimental works investigate the possible role of spin-orbit interaction in generating spin-triplet pair correlations. In this work, we present an experimental survey of thin normal metal-superconductor-normal metal trilayers with Nb superconductor and Al, Ti, Cu, Pt, Ta, and Au normal metals, along with single layers of Nb as reference. We aim to probe the role of spin-orbit interaction and resistivity on the normal metal proximity effect through measurements of the upper critical field. We find that the upper critical fields of the trilayers are lower than that of a single layer Nb reference sample, and that the trilayers with higher resistivity metals, Ti, Pt, and Ta, behave as 2-dimensional superconductors. We also find that compared to single layer Nb films, the trilayers show a greater suppression of critical temperature during rotation from in-plane to out-of-plane applied magnetic field. This suppression of critical temperature under field rotation is analogous to the colossal spin valve effect that can be achieved in systems with ferromagnetic materials, however in our trilayers only orbital contributions to the suppression are present.

Title: Numerical insights on the volume phase transition of thermoresponsive hollow microgels
Authors: Leah Rank, Emanuela Zaccarelli
Abstract: Hollow microgels, consisting of a pNIPAM polymer network with a central cavity, have significant potential due to their tunable softness and encapsulation capabilities. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we thoroughly characterise the swelling behaviour of neutral hollow microgels across the Volume Phase Transition (VPT) upon varying crosslinker concentration, shell thickness, and size. In particular, we examine in detail the onset of cavity filling and its relation to the VPT, detecting the presence of a discontinuity in the radius of gyration of the microgels, if an appropriate balance between shell stiffness and thermoresposiveness is reached. The discontinuity is, however, absent in the behaviour of the hydrodynamic radius, in agreement with experimental observations. We then test our numerical model by direct comparison of form factors with available measurements in the literature and also establish a minimal-size, stable hollow microgel for future computationally feasible bulk investigations. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental swelling properties of hollow microgels that can be useful to control the opening and closing of the cavity for application purposes.

Title: Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance through Site-Specific Doping in Tetragonal Cu$_{2}$S: A First-Principles Study
Authors: Sonam Phuntsho
Abstract: This work investigates how site-specific doping can enhance the thermoelectric performance of tetragonal Cu$_{2}$S using Density functional Theory and Projected Atomic Orbital Framework for Electronic Transport. We address the gap in current research, where most doping studies focus on the high-temperature cubic polymorph, leaving the tetragonal structure underexplored. By substituting Cu with Li, Na, or Mg, as well as partially replacing S with Se or Te, we systematically examine changes in electronic structure and transport properties. Our results reveal that cation-site doping can strongly shift the Fermi level. In particular, Li doping enhances the power factor ($\sigma S^2$) by optimizing carrier concentrations and band-edge alignments, whereas Mg, due to its divalent nature, offers a higher carrier density but requires careful balancing to maintain a large Seebeck coefficient. On the anion side, substituting heavier chalcogens (Se or Te) reshapes the valence bands and subtly shifts the Fermi level, yielding moderate improvements in both electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. These doping-induced alterations, captured through transport calculations, demonstrate a clear route for tailoring the interplay between conductivity and thermal transport toward potentially high figure-of-merit values. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of site specificity in doping strategies for tetragonal Cu$_{2}$S, showing that judicious choice of dopant elements and concentrations can significantly improve key thermoelectric metrics. Such insights provide a foundation for experimental validation and further development of Cu$_{2}$S-based materials for mid- to high-temperature thermoelectric applications.

Title: Quantitative study on anomalous Nernst effect in Co thin films by laser irradiation
Authors: Soichiro Mochizuki, Itaru Sugiura, Tetsuya Narushima, Teruo Ono, Takuya Satoh, Kihiro T. Yamada
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) generates electromotive forces transverse to temperature gradients and has attracted much attention for potential applications into novel thermoelectric power generators. ANE efficiency is generally characterized by uniform temperature gradients in a steady state prepared by heaters. However, although focusing laser beams on a magnetic film can form much larger temperature gradients, the laser irradiation method has not been sufficiently considered for quantifying the ANE coefficient due to the difficulty in estimating the localized in-homogeneous temperature gradients. In this study, we present a quantitative study of ANE in Ru(5 nm)/Co($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$) ($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$ = 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, and 60 nm) bilayers on sapphire (0001) substrates by combining a laser irradiation approach with finite element analysis of temperature gradients under laser excitation. We find that the estimated ANE coefficients are consistent with previously reported values and one independently characterized using a heater. Our results also reveal the advantages of the laser irradiation method over the conventional method using heaters. Intensity-modulated laser beams can create ac temperature gradients as large as approximately 10$^3$ K/mm at a frequency of tens of kilohertz in a micrometer-scale region.

Title: Low-temperature magnetic behaviour on the triangular lattice in hexagonal Ba$_3$Tb(BO$_3$)$_3$
Authors: Nicola Kelly, Manh Duc Le, Denis Sheptyakov, Camilla Tacconis, Cheng Liu, Gavin Stenning, Peter Baker, Siân Dutton
Abstract: The hexagonal polymorph of Ba$_3$Tb(BO$_3$)$_3$ contains Tb$^{3+}$ ions on a quasi-2D triangular lattice, resulting in geometric magnetic frustration. Powder samples of Ba$_3$Tb(BO$_3$)$_3$ have been investigated using specific heat, powder neutron diffraction (PND), inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon-spin relaxation spectroscopy ($\mu$SR). No long-range magnetic ordering is observed down to the lowest measured temperatures of 75 mK in PND and specific heat data and 1.5 K in the $\mu$SR data. Modelling the INS spectrum using a point charge model suggests that the ground state is a singlet with a low-lying doublet on each of the two crystallographically independent Tb$^{3+}$ sites and that both the Tb ions display weak XY single-ion anisotropy.

Title: Inhomogeneous Electric Fields for Precise Control and Displacement of Polar Textures
Authors: Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Louis Bastogne, He Xu, Philippe Ghosez
Abstract: Since the discovery of polar topological textures, achieving efficient control and manipulation of them has emerged as a significant challenge for their integration into nanoelectronic devices. In this study, we use second principles molecular dynamic simulations to demonstrate the precise and reversible control of domain arrangements stabilizing diverse polarization textures through the application of various inhomogeneous electric fields. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth study of ferroelectric domain motion under such fields, revealing features consistent with creep dynamics and establishing an upper limit for their propagation speed. Notably, our findings show that domain walls exhibit an asymmetric inertial response, present at the onset of the dynamics but absent during their cessation. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of polar textures, paving the way for the development of high-speed, low-power nanoelectronic applications.

Title: A Variational Theory for Soft Shells
Authors: Andre M. Sonnet, Epifanio G. Virga
Abstract: Three general modes are distinguished in the deformation of a thin shell; these are stretching, drilling, and bending. Of these, the drilling mode is the one more likely to emerge in a soft matter shell (as compared to a hard, structural one), as it is ignited by a swerve of material fibers about the local normal. We propose a hyperelastic theory for soft shells, based on a separation criterion that envisages the strain-energy density as the sum of three independent pure measures of stretching, drilling, and bending. Each individual measure is prescribed to vanish on all other companion modes. The result is a direct, second-grade theory featuring a bending energy quartic in an invariant strain descriptor that stems from the polar rotation hidden in the deformation gradient (although quadratic energies are also appropriate in special cases). The proposed energy functional has a multi-well character, which fosters cases of soft elasticity (with a continuum of ground states) related to minimal surfaces.

Title: Mechanism of Oxygen Reduction via Chemical Affinity in NiO/SiO2 Interfaces Irradiated with keV Energy Hydrogen and Helium Ions for Heterostructure Fabrication
Authors: Mario Mery, Claudio Gonzalez-Fuentes, Igor Stankovic, Jorge M. Nuñez, Jorge E. Valdés, Myriam H Aguirre, Carlos García
Abstract: Low-energy light ion beams are an essential resource in lithography for nanopatterning magnetic materials and interfaces due to their ability to modify the structure and properties of metamaterials. Here we create ferromagnetic/non-ferromagnetic heterostructures with a controlled layer thickness and nanometer-scale precision. For this, hydrogen ion (H+) irradiation is used to reduce the antiferromagnetic nickel oxide (NiO) layer into ferromagnetic Ni with lower fluence than in the case of helium ion (He+) irradiation. Our results indicate that H+ chemical affinity with oxygen is the primary mechanism for efficient atom remotion, as opposed to He+ irradiation, where the chemical affinity for oxygen is negligible.

Title: Nanoparticle simulations of logarithmic creep and microprestress relaxation in concrete and other disordered solids
Authors: Enrico Masoero, Giovanni Di Luzio
Abstract: Bažant's microprestress theory relates the logarithmic basic creep of concrete to power-law relaxation of heterogeneous eigenstresses at the nanoscale. However, the link between material chemistry, nanostructure, and microprestress relaxation, is not understood. To approach this, we use a simple model of harmonically interacting, packed nanoparticles, relaxing with and without external stress. Microprestresses are related to per-particle virial stress heterogeneities. Simulation results show that logarithmic creep and power-law microprestress relaxation emerge from generic deformation kinetics in disordered systems, which can occur in various materials and at various scales. When the interactions are matched to some mechanical properties of C--S--H at the 100 nm scale, the predicted microprestresses have similar magnitude as in Bažant's theory. The ability of our simulations to quantitatively link stress relaxation with nanostructure and chemistry-dependent interactions, provides a pathway to better characterise, extrapolate, and even engineer the creep behaviour of traditional and new concretes.

Title: New Method for Robust Critical Analysis of Magnetic Systems
Authors: Harish Chandr Chauhan, Umesh C. Roy, Shovan Dan, A. Thamizhavel, Pintu Das
Abstract: Here, we present new methods for critical analysis to determine the range of exchange interaction(s) and appropriate values of critical exponents for different magnetic systems. From computational and experimental investigations of magnetic behavior of Ni and Gd, we show that the critical behavior remains the same on either side of transition temperature. Using our proposed method of analysis for Gd, we find a critical role of competing interactions where the local electron moments follow 3D Ising type short-range interactions whereas the itinerant electron moments constitute mean-field type long-range RKKY interaction.

Title: Interlayer Hopping between Surface Mott Insulator and Bulk Band Insulator in layered 1T-TaS_{2}
Authors: Zijian Lin, Jie Li, Xiaodong Cao, Jingjing Gao, Xuan Luo, Yuping Sun, Yi Lu, Nanlin Wang, Jiandong Guo, Xuetao Zhu
Abstract: In condensed matter physics, various mechanisms give rise to distinct insulating phases. The competition and interplay between these phases remain elusive, even for the seemingly most distinguishable band and Mott insulators. In multilayer systems, such interplay is mediated by interlayer hopping, which competes with the Coulomb repulsion to determine the nature of insulators. The layered compound 1T-TaS_{2} provides an ideal platform for investigating this phenomenon, as it naturally hosts coexisting Mott and band insulating states. However, distinguishing these distinct insulating states and characterizing the evolution remain challenging. In this study, we employ a dual approach utilizing surface-sensitive High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and bulk-sensitive Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to investigate the electronic excitation spectrum of 1T-TaS_{2}. Our methodology effectively identifies the features originating from the Mott and band insulators by analyzing the differences in their bulk and surface spectral weights, along with their energy distinctions. Based on the previous identification, we further investigate the evolution of insulating state features in the homostructure as they are modulated by temperature. The measurements and Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) calculations suggest that the softening and broadening of Hubbard excitations in the Mott state with increasing temperature result from enhanced interlayer hopping between the Mott and band insulators.

Title: Self-induced Josephson oscillations and self-trapping in a supersolid dipolar quantum gas
Authors: Beatrice Donelli, Nicolò Antolini, Giulio Biagioni, Marco Fattori, Andrea Fioretti, Carlo Gabbanini, Massimo Inguscio, Luca Tanzi, Giovanni Modugno, Augusto Smerzi, Luca Pezzè
Abstract: The Josephson effect characterizes superfluids and superconductors separated by a weak link, the so-called Josephson junction. A recent experiment has shown that Josephson oscillations can be observed also in a supersolid, where the weak link is not due to an external barrier, but is self-induced by interparticle interactions. Here we show theoretically that supersolids -- despite their self-induced character -- feature all the standard properties of bosonic Josephson junction arrays, including macroscopic quantum self-trapping. We focus on the harmonically trapped dipolar supersolids of interest for current experiments, and show that they can be described with a generalized Josephson model that takes into account spatial inhomogeneities. Our work shades new light on the dynamics of supersolids and opens the way to the study of a novel class of Josephson junctions.

Title: Phase-field modeling of radiation-induced composition redistribution: An application to additively manufactured austenitic Fe-Cr-Ni
Authors: Sourabh Bhagwan Kadambi, Daniel Schwen, Jia-Hong Ke, Lingfeng He, Andrea M. Jokisaari
Abstract: Multicomponent alloys undergoing irradiation damage develop radiation-induced composition redistribution at point defect sinks such as grain boundaries (GBs) and dislocations. Such redistribution results in undesired changes to their mechanical behavior and corrosion resistance. Additively manufactured alloys proposed for future nuclear applications are expected to demonstrate a distinct response to irradiation owing to their unique microstructure with as-solidified dislocation density and chemical microsegregation. To capture the composition redistribution in such systems, we develop a mesoscale model with coupled evolution of atomic and point defect components in the presence of dislocation density, dislocation heterogeneity, and thermodynamic interactions at the GB. The model is parameterized for an FCC Fe-Cr-Ni alloy as a representative system for austenitic stainless steels, and simulations are performed in 1D and 2D as a function of irradiation temperature, dose, dislocation density, and grain size. Radiation-induced segregation (RIS) characterized by Cr depletion and Ni enrichment is predicted at both the GB and the dislocation cell wall, with RIS being lower in magnitude but wider at the cell wall. Strongly biased absorption of self-interstitials by dislocations is found to suppress Ni enrichment but slightly enhance Cr depletion under certain conditions. Thermodynamic segregation at the GB is predicted to be narrower and opposite in sign to RIS for both Cr and Ni. Importantly, non-monotonic segregation is found to occur when both thermodynamic and RIS mechanisms are considered, providing a novel physical interpretation of experimental observations. The model is expected to serve as a key tool in accelerated qualification of irradiated materials.

Title: Viewing fluxonium through the lens of the cat qubit
Authors: Simon Lieu, Emma L. Rosenfeld, Kyungjoo Noh, Connor T. Hann
Abstract: We draw analogies between protected superconducting qubits and bosonic qubits by studying the fluxonium Hamiltonian in its Fock basis. The mean-field phase diagram of fluxonium (at the sweet spot) is identified, with a region in parameter space that is characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry-broken ground states. In the heavy fluxonium limit, these ground states are well approximated by squeezed coherent states in a Fock basis (corresponding to persistent current states with definite flux but indefinite charge), and simple expressions are provided for them in terms of the circuit parameters. We study the noise bias in fluxonium via a universal Lindblad master equation and find that the bit-flip rate is exponentially small in $E_j/(k_B T)$, while the phase-flip rate does not get worse with this ratio. Analogous behavior is found in $\cos(2 \theta)$ qubits. We discuss first steps towards generating an Ising interaction between protected superconducting qubits on a two-dimensional lattice, with the aim of achieving a passive quantum memory by coupling a static Hamiltonian to a generic thermal bath.

Title: Carroll at Phase Separation
Authors: Sourav Biswas, Ashutosh Dubey, Saikat Mondal, Aritra Banerjee, Arijit Kundu, Arjun Bagchi
Abstract: Asymptotic behavior of generic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the vicinity of phase-separated regions is known to produce an instability where well-known relativistic Conformal Field Theory (CFT) techniques fail. In this letter, we introduce an analytic paradigm which solves this important issue. We show that there is an emergent Carrollian symmetry when phase separation is reached and techniques of Carroll CFT, as opposed to its relativistic relative, is central to the understanding of the physics. We work with the analogous spinless fermionic system in this region and capture the transition across this phase separation. Our numerical results corroborate the density-density correlations intrinsically computed using Carroll CFT.

Title: Wilsonian renormalisation group and thermal field theory in the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path formalism
Authors: Giorgio Frangi, Sašo Grozdanov
Abstract: We study perturbative Wilsonian renormalisation group (RG) for the scalar $\phi^4$ theory at finite temperature to one loop order in the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path (CTP) formalism. By explicitly integrating out the UV modes, we show how effective interactions coupling the two branches of the CTP contour arise. This provides a microscopic derivation of the type of effective CTP actions used in the literature. While the full effective theory has no critical points, we instead proceed to study critical properties of the RG flow in a reduced space of complex couplings that characterise certain time-ordered correlators and show the existence of two novel fixed points in $d=4$ spacetime dimensions. We relate one to the Wilson-Fished fixed point known to exist only in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions, and the other to the standard Gaussian fixed point.

Title: Symmetry- and Gradient-enhanced Gaussian Process Regression for the Active Learning of Potential Energy Surfaces in Porous Materials
Authors: Johannes K. Krondorfer, Christian W. Binder, Andreas W. Hauser
Abstract: The theoretical investigation of gas adsorption, storage, separation, diffusion and related transport processes in porous materials relies on a detailed knowledge of the potential energy surface of molecules in a stationary environment. In this article, a new algorithm is presented, specifically developed for gas transport phenomena, which allows for a highly cost-effective determination of molecular potential energy surfaces. It is based on a symmetry-enhanced version of Gaussian Process Regression with embedded gradient information and employs an active learning strategy to keep the number of single point evaluations as low as possible. The performance of the algorithm is tested for a selection of gas sieving scenarios on porous, N-functionalized graphene and for the intermolecular interaction of CH$_4$ and N$_2$.

Title: Phase-matched electron-photon interactions enabled by 3D-printed helical waveguides
Authors: Masoud Taleb, Mohsen Samadi, Nahid Talebi
Abstract: The Smith-Purcell effect enables electromagnetic radiation across arbitrary spectral ranges by phase-matching the diffraction orders of an optical grating with the near-field of a moving electron. In this work, we introduce a novel approach using a helically shaped waveguide, where phase-matching is achieved through guided light within a helical optical fiber fabricated via two-photon polymerization using a 3D printer. Our results demonstrate that radiation from these structures precisely satisfies the phase-matching condition and is emitted directionally at specific angles, contrasting with the broad angular distribution characteristic of the traditional Smith-Purcell effect. Helical electron-driven photon sources establish a new paradigm, enabling 3D-printed structures to control electron-beam-induced radiation and, inversely, to facilitate light-induced efficient electron beam shaping and acceleration.

Title: GPU acceleration of hybrid functional calculations in the SPARC electronic structure code
Authors: Xin Jing, Abhiraj Sharma, John E. Pask, Phanish Suryanarayana
Abstract: We present a GPU-accelerated version of the real-space SPARC electronic structure code for performing hybrid functional calculations in generalized Kohn-Sham density functional theory. In particular, we develop a batch variant of the recently formulated Kronecker product-based linear solver for the simultaneous solution of multiple linear systems. We then develop a modular, math kernel based implementation for hybrid functionals on NVIDIA architectures, where computationally intensive operations are offloaded to the GPUs while the remaining workload is handled by the CPUs. Considering bulk and slab examples, we demonstrate that GPUs enable up to 8x speedup in node-hours and 80x in core-hours compared to CPU-only execution, reducing the time to solution on V100 GPUs to around 300 seconds for a metallic system with over 6,000 electrons, and significantly reducing the computational resources required for a given wall time.

Title: Vortices and backflow in hydrodynamic heat transport
Authors: Enrico Di Lucente, Francesco Libbi, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: Recent experiments have provided compelling evidence supporting the theoretical predictions of phonon hydrodynamics in fast thermal conductors. Unlike diffusive heat transport, this regime is primarily governed by momentum-conserving phonon collisions. At the mesoscopic scale it is described by viscous heat equations (VHE), that resemble the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in the laminar regime. We show how the VHE can be separated and recast as modified biharmonic equations, allowing for an analytical solution of the velocity potential and stream function of the phonon fluid. These two can be merged into a complex potential defining the flow streamlines, and give rise to two distinct temperature contributions, ultimately related to thermal compressibility and vorticity. By examining thermal flow within a 2D graphite strip device, we explore the boundary conditions and transport coefficients needed to observe thermal vortices and negative thermal resistance, or heat backflow from cooler to warmer regions, and propose a straightforward experimental setup to detect these distinctive hallmarks of viscous transport. Finally, the irrotational and incompressible limits of the phonon VHE are analyzed, showing how the latter mirrors the NSE for the electron fluid. This work provides novel analytical tools to design hydrodynamic phonon flow, highlights the connection to electron hydrodynamics, and paves the way to improve heat management in next-generation devices.

Title: Symmetry-induced fragmentation and dissipative time crystal
Authors: Haowei Li, Wei Yi
Abstract: We propose a general protocol for engineering dissipative time crystals in quantum open systems through symmetry-induced fragmentation and ergodicity breaking. Building upon a U(1)-symmetry-induced Liouville-space fragmentation, we devise a generic Liouvillian possessing a series of non-dissipative eigenmodes with purely imaginary eigenvalues, which give rise to long-time oscillations breaking both ergodicity and time-translation symmetry. Illustrating our proposal using a dissipative lattice model, we show that, even when the U(1) symmetry is broken, a prethermal time-crystal behavior survives, with distinct oscillation frequencies at different times of the steady-state approaching dynamics. The richly structured prethermal dynamics derive from Fermi statistics and the Liouvillian skin effect of our model, under which excitations above the boundary-localized dark states can be mapped to the irreducible representations of the permutation group. The branching rules of the permutation group then dictate that the Liouvillian gaps acquired by the non-dissipative eigenmodes should be higher-order powers of the symmetry-breaking perturbation, protecting the prethermal time crystal.

Title: Convection-modulated topological edge mode and extended-localized criticality in thermal metamaterials
Authors: Zhoufei Liu, Jiping Huang, Ying Li
Abstract: Convection offers a dynamic and flexible approach to achieving a variety of novel physical phenomena beyond pure conduction. Here, we demonstrate that thermal metamaterials with convection modulation enable the realization of non-Hermitian topological edge modes and bulk mode criticality. We illustrate that a periodic modulation can induce localized edge modes within the band gap. The temperature field of the topological state is localized at the edge rings, decaying exponentially at a fixed rate. Additionally, we introduce an extended-localized criticality through the quasiperiodic convection modulation in thermotics. The convections have an advantage of fantastic tunability in the application. Our work proposes a scheme for implementing topological modes and bulk mode criticality through modulating convection in diffusion systems, paving the way for the design of reconfigurable thermal devices.

Title: Tunable quantum light by modulated free electrons
Authors: Valerio Di Giulio, Rudolf Haindl, Claus Ropers
Abstract: Nonclassical states of light are fundamental in various applications, spanning quantum computation to enhanced sensing. Fast free electrons, which emit light into photonic structures through the mechanism of spontaneous emission, represent a promising platform for generating diverse types of states. Indeed, the intrinsic connection between the input electron wave function and the output light field suggests that electron-shaping schemes, based on light-induced scattering, facilitates their synthesis. In this article, we present a theoretical framework capable of predicting the final optical density matrix of a generic N-electron state that can also account for post-sample energy filtering. By using such framework, we study the modulation-dependent fluctuations of the N-electron emission and identify regions of Poissonian and super-Poissonian statistics. In the single-electron case, we show how coherent states with nearly 90% purity can be formed by pre-filtering a portion of the spectrum after modulation, and how non-Gaussian states are generated after a precise energy measurement. Furthermore, we present a strategy combining a single-stage electron modulation and post-filtering to harness tailored light states, such as squeezed vacuum, cat, and triangular cat states, with fidelity close to 100%.

Title: Trends and Reversion in Financial Markets on Time Scales from Minutes to Decades
Authors: Sara A. Safari, Christof Schmidhuber
Abstract: We empirically analyze the reversion of financial market trends with time horizons ranging from minutes to decades. The analysis covers equities, interest rates, currencies and commodities and combines 14 years of futures tick data, 30 years of daily futures prices, 330 years of monthly asset prices, and yearly financial data since medieval times. Across asset classes, we find that markets are in a trending regime on time scales that range from a few hours to a few years, while they are in a reversion regime on shorter and longer time scales. In the trending regime, weak trends tend to persist, which can be explained by herding behavior of investors. However, in this regime trends tend to revert before they become strong enough to be statistically significant, which can be interpreted as a return of asset prices to their intrinsic value. In the reversion regime, we find the opposite pattern: weak trends tend to revert, while those trends that become statistically significant tend to persist. Our results provide a set of empirical tests of theoretical models of financial markets. We interpret them in the light of a recently proposed lattice gas model, where the lattice represents the social network of traders, the gas molecules represent the shares of financial assets, and efficient markets correspond to the critical point. If this model is accurate, the lattice gas must be near this critical point on time scales from 1 hour to a few days, with a correlation time of a few years.

Title: Electron dynamics induced by quantum cat-state light
Authors: Shohei Imai, Atsushi Ono, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: We present an effective theory for describing electron dynamics driven by an optical external field in a Schrödinger's cat state. We show that the electron density matrix evolves as an average over trajectories $\{\rho_\alpha\}$ weighted by the Sudarshan--Glauber $P$ distribution $P(\alpha)$ in the weak light--matter coupling regime. Each trajectory obeys an equation of motion, $\mathrm{i} \partial_t\rho_\alpha=\mathcal{H}_{\alpha} \rho_\alpha-\rho_\alpha\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$, where an effective Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$ becomes non-Hermitian due to quantum interference of light. The optical quantum interference is transferred to electrons through the asymmetric action between the ket and bra state vectors in $\rho_{\alpha}$. This non-Hermitian dynamics differs from the conventional one observed in open quantum systems, described by $\mathrm{i} \partial_t\rho=\mathcal{H}\rho-\rho \mathcal{H}^\dagger$, which has complex conjugation in the second term. We confirm that the results of the effective theory agree with those of full electron--photon system simulations for the few-electron Dicke model, demonstrating experimental accessibility to exotic non-Hermitian dynamics.

Title: Transport approach to two-qubit quantum state tomography
Authors: Jeanne Bourgeois, Gianmichele Blasi, Géraldine Haack
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a central task for quantum information processing, enabling quantum cryptography, computation, and state certification. Traditional QST relies on projective measurements of single- and two-qubit Pauli operators, requiring qubits to be isolated from environmental dissipation. In this work, we demonstrate that measuring currents and associated transport quantities flowing through a two-qubit system between two terminals biased in temperature or voltage are sufficient to perform complete QST of the open quantum system. This transport approach requires minimal knowledge of the system-environment couplings and of the parameters setting the system's dynamics, accessible in state-of-the-art solid-state experiments via spectroscopic measurements for instance. Our findings are analytical, offering comprehensive insights into the underlying processes. As a direct consequence of our approach, we are able to provide a transport-based entanglement measure to certify the presence of quantum correlations, expressing the concurrence in terms of currents and correlations functions only.

Title: Optically trapped exciton-polariton condensates in a perovskite microcavity
Authors: Maciej Zaremba, Mateusz Kędziora, Laura Stańco, Krzysztof Piskorski, Kamil Kosiel, Anna Szerling, Rafał Mazur, Wiktor Piecek, Andrzej Opala, Helgi Sigurðsson, Barbara Piętka
Abstract: We demonstrate room temperature optical trapping and generation of high-order angular harmonics in exciton-polariton condensates in a monocrystalline CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite-filled microcavity. Using an annular nonresonant excitation profile focused onto the perovskite, we observed power-driven switching between different transverse modes of the optically induced trap. We explore the interplay between the perovskite crystal dimensions and the optical trap diameter that allows the condensate to transition from whispering gallery-like petal shapes to extended ripple states. Our results underline the feasibility in creating high-order quantum states in perovskite polariton condensates for reconfigurable and structured room temperature nonlinear lasing.

Title: Space-Time-Coupled Qubits for Enhanced Superconducting Quantum Computing
Authors: Sajjad Taravati
Abstract: The pursuit of scalable and robust quantum computing necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the inherent challenges of qubit connectivity, decoherence, and susceptibility to noise and crosstalk. Conventional monochromatic qubit coupling architectures, constrained by nearest-neighbor interactions and limited algorithmic flexibility, exacerbate these issues, hindering the realization of practical large-scale quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a paradigm leveraging a space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurface to enable polychromatic qubit coupling. This metasurface facilitates frequency-selective interactions, transforming nearest-neighbor connectivity into all-to-all qubit interactions, while significantly enhancing coherence, noise robustness, and entanglement fidelity. Our proposed approach capitalizes on the unique capabilities of space-time-modulated Josephson metasurfaces, including dynamic four-dimensional wave manipulation, nonreciprocal state transmission, and state-frequency conversion, to mediate multi-frequency qubit interactions. By isolating qubit couplings into distinct spectral channels, the cryogenic-compatible metasurface mitigates crosstalk and environmental decoherence, extending coherence times and preserving quantum state fidelity. Full-wave simulations and quantum performance analyses demonstrate a significant enhancement in the operational efficiency of a superconducting qubit array, showcasing improved connectivity, robustness, and entanglement stability. This study establishes the potential of space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurfaces as a transformative platform for next-generation quantum computing, addressing critical bottlenecks and paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum processors.

Title: CASK: A Gauge Covariant Transformer for Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Yuki Nagai, Hiroshi Ohno, Akio Tomiya
Abstract: We propose a Transformer neural network architecture specifically designed for lattice QCD, focusing on preserving the fundamental symmetries required in lattice gauge theory. The proposed architecture is gauge covariant/equivariant, ensuring it respects gauge symmetry on the lattice, and is also equivariant under spacetime symmetries such as rotations and translations on the lattice. A key feature of our approach lies in the attention matrix, which forms the core of the Transformer architecture. To preserve symmetries, we define the attention matrix using a Frobenius inner product between link variables and extended staples. This construction ensures that the attention matrix remains invariant under gauge transformations, thereby making the entire Transformer architecture covariant. We evaluated the performance of the gauge covariant Transformer in the context of self-learning HMC. Numerical experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves higher performance compared to the gauge covariant neural networks, demonstrating its potential to improve lattice QCD calculations.

Title: Scaling of connectivity metrics in river networks
Authors: E. H. Colombo, A. B. García-Andrade, Ismail, J. M. Calabrese
Abstract: Rivers are well-known to exhibit fractal-like properties that lead to existence of scaling laws that link network geometry and size. However, these geometric relations might not necessarily capture the spatial features that most directly influence ecological processes such as the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Connectivity metrics, on the other hand, have been shown both theoretically and empirically to influence relevant large-scale ecological outcomes. Therefore, in this work, we establish how river network connectivity scales with system size by analyzing networks obtained for more than 1000 rivers across the globe. Specifically, we found clear power-law scaling of both the Harmonic and Betweenness centrality network connectivity metrics. We then created a synthetic river network dataset by fitting an Optimal Channel Network (OCN) model to each real river, to ask if OCNs, which are widely used to represent rivers in many theoretical studies, exhibit the same connectivity scaling laws as empirical river networks. We found excellent agreement between empirical and OCN-based scaling laws, supporting the notion that OCNs can accurately represent rivers in network-based models and analyses. Finally, we examined the robustness of the connectivity scaling laws by varying species movement strategies from perfect shortest-path navigation to unbiased random walks. Surprisingly, we found that random walk movement breaks the power-law scaling relationship for harmonic, but not for betweenness centrality.

Title: Emergence of network communities driven by local rules
Authors: Alexei Vazquez
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks where nodes represent the system units and links their interactions. The networks nodes are often segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here I demonstrate that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. Network communities are bound to emerge as a consequence of the local nature of the network evolution. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_C$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. I show that the Watts-Strogatz, local search and duplication-split network models all have finite $r_C$ values. In contrast, random graphs do not have emergent communities property and the Barabási-Albert model does not reach certainty for the emergence of communities. I conclude that network communities are an emergent property rooted on the local nature of the network evolution.

Title: The fluid dynamics of liquid mushrooms
Authors: Akshay Manoj Bhaskaran, Arnov Paul, Apurba Roy, Devranjan Samanta, Purbarun Dhar
Abstract: Droplets that impact the surface of a deep liquid pool may form a vertical jet after the cavity formation event, provided they have sufficient impact energy. Depending on the associated time scales and the effect of the Rayleigh Plateau instability, this jet may either continue to rise, or may form satellite droplets via necking. Collision of these structures with a second incoming droplet, ejected from the same dispensing tip as the first droplet, may result in the formation of various lamellar patterns, depending on the impact conditions, giving rise to liquid mushroom and or umbrella structures. In this research, we experiment for the first time with hydrodynamics of such liquid mushrooms, and study the effect of droplet impact height, surface tension, and viscosity on the dynamics of such lamellar formations. We further explore the role of the orientation of incoming droplet impact, ie whether head on or offset collision with the rising jet or satellite droplet. We discuss the spatiotemporal evolution of the lamella diameters, and its susceptibility to surface tension, viscosity, and droplet impact height. We put forward a theoretical model based on energetics, to predict the maximum spread diameter of the lamellae, which yields accurate predictions with respect to our experiments. Our findings may help to provide important insights towards a fluid dynamic phenomenon observed often in nature and may be important in niche utilities as well.

Title: Directly probing work extraction from a single qubit engine fueled by quantum measurements
Authors: Rémy Dassonneville, Cyril Elouard, Romain Cazali, Réouven Assouly, Audrey Bienfait, Alexia Auffèves, Benjamin Huard
Abstract: Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of resources of quantum origin in engines. One of the main remaining challenges consists in directly measuring the work extracted from such quantum engines. Here we probe the work extracted from a transmon superconducting qubit acting as a working medium. The engine is fueled by performing quantum measurements of an observable which does not commute with the bare qubit Hamiltonian. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon working without a hot thermal source. In our implementation, the qubit working medium amplifies a coherent microwave field from which work is extracted. The latter is not only inferred from tomographic measurements of the qubit state but also directly monitored via heterodyne detection of the field quadratures. We demonstrate the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, losses and drifts. To emphasize the role of feedback, we also study the breakdown of the engine in the open-loop configuration.

Title: Hovering of an actively driven fluid-lubricated foil
Authors: Stéphane Poulain, Timo Koch, L. Mahadevan, Andreas Carlson
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental observations of a harmonically excited elastic foil hovering near a wall while supporting substantial weight, we develop a theoretical framework that describes the underlying physical effects. Using elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory, we quantify how the dynamic deformation of the soft foil couples to the viscous fluid flow in the intervening gap. Our analysis shows that the soft foil rectifies the reversible forcing, breaking time-reversal symmetry; the relative spatial support of the forcing determines whether the sheet is attracted to or repelled from the wall. A simple scaling law predicts the time-averaged equilibrium hovering height and the maximum weight the sheet can sustain before detaching from the surface. Numerical simulations of the governing equation corroborate our theoretical predictions, are in qualitative agreement with experiments, and might explain the behavior of organisms while providing design principles for soft robotics.

Title: Multiscale simulations of three-dimensional nanotube networks: Enhanced modeling using unit cells
Authors: Fabian Gumpert, Dominik Eitel, Olaf Kottas, Uta Helbig, Jan Lohbreier
Abstract: This study presents a simulation approach for three-dimensional nanotube networks using cubic and tetragonal unit cells to enhance modeling efficiency. A random-walk algorithm was developed to generate these networks, which were analyzed in a Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation to assess their electrical conductivity. The percolation probability as a function of the nanotube filling factor can be derived from these simulation results. It is found that smaller tetragonal unit cells can replicate the behavior of larger networks with significantly reduced computational effort, achieving a 20 times reduction in computational time while receiving similar results. In this work, we focus on carbon-doped titanate nanotubes for hydrogen applications, but the method is adaptable for other nanocomposite applications. The findings provide a universal framework for the investigation of nanotube-based materials.

Title: Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet-Bloch states in crystals
Authors: Vishal Tiwari, Ignacio Franco
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions enable triggering on-demand novel functionalities in materials. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet-Bloch states have emerged as the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these non-equilibrium systems. However, robust signatures of the Floquet-Bloch states are needed as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet-Bloch states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy to finally capture the response properties of realistic laser-dressed solids, and use it to compute the optical absorption of ZnO using a model of full-dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet-Bloch states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet-Bloch states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.

Title: MPS Stability and the Intersection Property
Authors: José Garre-Rubio, Alex Turzillo, András Molnár
Abstract: We identify a property of the local tensors of matrix product states (MPS) that guarantees that their parent Hamiltonians satisfy the intersection property. The intersection property ensures that the ground space consists of MPS, with degeneracy bounded by the square of the bond dimension. The new local property, dubbed stability, generalizes (block) injectivity and is satisfied by the MPS tensors that construct the W state, domain wall superposition states, and their generalizations.

Title: Excited State Absorption: Reference Oscillator Strengths, Wavefunction and TD-DFT Benchmarks
Authors: Jakub Širůček, Boris Le Guennic, Yann Damour, Pierre-François Loos, Denis Jacquemin
Abstract: Excited-state absorption (ESA) corresponds to the transition between two electronic excited states and is a fundamental process for probing and understanding light-matter interactions. Accurate modeling of ESA is indeed often required to interpret time-resolved experiments. In this contribution, we present a dataset of 53 ESA oscillator strengths in three different gauges and the associated vertical transition energies between 71 excited states of 23 small- and medium-sized molecules from the QUEST database. The reference values were obtained within the quadratic-response (QR) CC3 formalism using eight different Dunning basis sets. We found that the d-aug-cc-pVTZ basis set is always adequate while its more compact double-$\zeta$ counterpart, d-aug-cc-pVDZ, performs well in most applications. These QR-CC3 data allow us to assess the performance of QR-TDDFT, with and without applying the Tamm-Dancoff approximation, using a panel of global and range-separated hybrids (B3LYP, BH{\&}HLYP, CAM-B3LYP, LC-BLYP33, and LC-BLYP47), as well as several lower-order wavefunction methods, i.e., QR-CCSD, QR-CC2, EOM-CCSD, ISR-ADC(2), and ISR-ADC(3). We show that QR-TDDFT delivers acceptable errors for ESA oscillator strengths, with CAM-B3LYP showing particular promise, especially for the largest molecules of our set. We also find that ISR-ADC(3) exhibits excellent performance

Title: Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Liam L.H. Lau, Piers Coleman
Abstract: Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moiré AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moiré K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.

Title: Tuning Higher Order Structure in Colloidal Fluids
Authors: Xiaoyue Wu, Fiona C. Meldrum, Katherine Skipper, Yushi Yang, C. Patrick Royall
Abstract: Colloidal particles self assemble into a wide range of structures under external AC electric fields due to induced dipolar interactions [Yethiraj and Van Blaaderen Nature 421 513 (2003)]. As a result of these dipolar interactions, at low volume fraction the system is modulated between a hard-sphere like state (in the case of zero applied field) and a "string fluid" upon application of the field. Using both particle-resolved experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the emergence of the string fluid with a variety of structural measures including two-body and higher-order correlations. The higher-order structure we probe using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many-body approach based on minimum energy clusters of a dipolar-Lennard-Jones system. This yields a series of geometrically distinct minimum energy clusters upon increasing the strength of the dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher-order structure of the colloidal fluids we study here. We find good agreement between experiment and simulation at the two-body level, although some discrepancies are found at higher field strength, where the system falls out of equilibrium. Higher-order correlations exhibit reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation, again with more discrepancy at higher field strength for three--body correlation functions. At higher field strength, the cluster population in our experiments and simulations is dominated by the minimum energy clusters for all sizes $8 \leq m \leq 12$. The agreement that we find here is notable considering that there is no fit parameter in our mapping between experiment and simulation.

Title: Why Charge Added Using Transition Metals To Some Insulators -- Including LK-99 -- Localizes and Does Not Yield a Metal
Authors: Alexandru B. Georgescu
Abstract: While adding charge to semiconductors via dopants is a well-established method for tuning electronic properties, we demonstrate that introducing transition metal impurities into certain insulators can lead to localized charge, assisted by a Jahn-Teller distortion. This leads to isolated charge, and an insulating material as opposed to emergent states - including superconductivity. We focus on Cu impurities added to Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O ('LK-99'), replacing 10% of Cu ions, as discussed in recent literature. Our calculations show that the material remains a wide bandgap insulator with isolated, S=1/2 localized charges on the Cu ions-similar to color centers-even within standard DFT, without the need for electron correlation corrections to the Cu d-orbitals. Superconductivity is excluded by known mechanisms that require the material to be metallic. We resolve previously observed inconsistencies between density functional theory results and experimental findings related to doping site energetics, crystal structure, and transparency. We find that Cu doping either Pb site leads to CuO$_4$ coordination and a similar unit cell volume contraction. Engineering materials with dopant sites that have different local symmetries can induce non-relativistic spin splitting-often referred to as altermagnetism. However, in the case of localized charges, this may enable spins to be individually controlled.

Title: Design of superparamagnetic nanoparticle-materials for high-frequency inductor cores
Authors: Mathias Zambach, Ziwei Ouyang, Matti Knaapila, Marco Beleggia, Cathrine Frandsen
Abstract: The progress in the semiconductor industry has resulted in great demand for high-frequency magnetic materials applicable in microfabricated inductor cores. Nanocomposite materials, containing magnetic nanoparticles in a non-conducting matrix, may provide a solution for materials with high susceptibility (/permeability) and low power loss in the MHz regime, where traditional ferrites fail in performance. Here, we present a design guide for usage of magnetic nanoparticles in such materials. We use statistical mechanics methods to derive the magnetic susceptibility of nanoparticles in case of uniaxial or cubic anisotropy, as function of particle size and applied field direction, and investigate shape and interaction effects on the susceptibility. Using the derived susceptibilities, with inductor-core applications in mind, we show that close-to-spherical particles of materials with high saturation magnetization and low magnetic anisotropy, such as FeNi$_3$, are optimal. Additionally, the particle size shall be optimized to be as large as possible while maintaining superparamagnetic behaviour at the relevant frequency. Based on this, we predict that high particle susceptibilities of $>$700 (/$>$1500) are possible for randomly oriented (/aligned) 20$\pm$1 nm diameter FeNi$_3$ particles, together with high-frequency stability, shown by low out-of-phase component at 2 MHz. This implies that materials containing nanoparticles have the potential to be tuned to outperform state-of-the-art ferrite inductor-core materials at MHz-frequencies.

Title: Dynamical deconfinement transition driven by density of excitations
Authors: Nishan Ranabhat, Alessandro Santini, Emanuele Tirrito, Mario Collura
Abstract: We investigate the deconfinement transition driven by excitations in long-range spin models. At low temperatures, these models exhibit a confined phase where domain-wall (or kinks) are localized. As temperature increases, kinks interact and propagate, leading to a transition to a de-confined phase. This transition is influenced by the interplay between thermal energy and interaction effects, resulting in extended, de-confined regions. Although kinks density is dynamically stable, non-equilibrium changes in their fluctuations characterize the transition. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of confinement and deconfinement in long-range spin models, with implications for both condensed matter physics and lattice gauge theories. Bridging these fields, this study sheds light on the universal aspects of confinement and opens avenues for further exploration and experimental verification.

Title: Signatures of Mode-Resolved, Nonlocal Electron-Phonon Coupling in Two-Dimensional Spectroscopy
Authors: Sheng Qu, Vishal K. Sharma, Jaco Geuchies, Maksim Grechko, Mischa Bonn, Falko Pientka, Heejae Kim
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is foundational in condensed matter physics, determining intriguing phenomena and properties in both conventional and quantum materials. In this manuscript, we propose and demonstrate a novel two dimensional (2D) EPC spectroscopy which allows for direct extraction of EPC matrix elements for specific phonon modes and different electron energies, simultaneously. Using this technique, we are able to measure the electron-energy dependence of the EPC strength for individual phonon modes. This capability allows us to identify unique signatures distinguishing nonlocal Su-SchriefferHeeger (SSH)-type couplings from local Holstein-type couplings. In application to a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskite, we find that two pronounced phonon modes at room temperature exhibit highly distinctive EPC behaviors, concerning strength, anisotropy, and temperature-dependence across the structural phase transition. Our approach paves the way for unraveling the microscopic origin of EPC, the change of the phonon-mode-specific EPC with external conditions, and phonon-mediated ultrafast control of condensed materials.

Title: Sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting in the nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Chengliang Xia, Hongquan Liu, Shengjie Zhou, Hanghui Chen
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has drawn great attention. However, consensus has not been reached on its pairing symmetry in theory. By combining density-functional-theory (DFT), maximally-localized-Wannier-function, and linearized gap equation with random-phase-approximation, we find that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is $d_{xy}$, if its DFT band structure is accurately reproduced by a downfolded bilayer two-orbital model. More importantly, we reveal that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ sensitively depends on the crystal field splitting between two Ni-$e_g$ orbitals. A slight increase in Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting alters the pairing symmetry from $d_{xy}$ to $s_{\pm}$. Such a transition is associated with the change in inverse Fermi velocity and susceptibility, while the shape of Fermi surface remains almost unchanged. Our work highlights the sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on low-energy electronic structure in multi-orbital superconductors, which calls for care in the downfolding procedure when one calculates their pairing symmetry.

Title: Effects of clustering heterogeneity on the spectral density of sparse networks
Authors: Tuan Minh Pham, Thomas Peron, Fernando L. Metz
Abstract: We derive exact equations for the spectral density of sparse networks with an arbitrary distribution of the number of single edges and triangles per node. These equations enable a systematic investigation of the effect of clustering on the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix. In the case of heterogeneous networks, we demonstrate that the spectral density becomes more symmetric as the fluctuations in the triangle-degree sequence increase. This phenomenon is explained by the small clustering coefficient of networks with a large variance of the triangle-degree distribution. In the homogeneous case of regular clustered networks, we find that both perturbative and non-perturbative approximations fail to predict the spectral density in the high-connectivity limit. This suggests that traditional large-degree approximations may be ineffective in studying the spectral properties of networks with more complex motifs. Our theoretical results are fully confirmed by numerical diagonalizations of finite adjacency matrices.

Title: Boson-fermion pairing and condensation in two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures
Authors: Leonardo Pisani, Pietro Bovini, Fabrizio Pavan, Pierbiagio Pieri
Abstract: We consider a mixture of bosons and spin-polarized fermions in two dimensions at zero temperature with a tunable Bose-Fermi attraction. By adopting a diagrammatic T-matrix approach, we analyze the behavior of several thermodynamic quantities for the two species as a function of the density ratio and coupling strength, including the chemical potentials, the momentum distribution functions, the boson condensate density, and the Tan's contact parameter. By increasing the Bose-Fermi attraction, we find that the condensate is progressively depleted and Bose-Fermi pairs form, with a small fraction of condensed bosons surviving even for strong Bose-Fermi attraction. This small condensate proves sufficient to hybridize molecular and atomic states, producing quasi-particles with unusual Fermi liquid features. A nearly universal behavior of the condensate fraction, the bosonic momentum distribution, and Tan's contact parameter with respect to the density ratio is also found.

Title: Theory and Modeling of Transport for Simple Fluids in Nanoporous Materials: From Microscopic to Coarse-Grained Descriptions
Authors: Alexander Schlaich, Jean-Louis Barrat, Benoit Coasne
Abstract: We present the state-of-the-art theoretical modeling, molecular simulation, and coarse-graining strategies for the transport of gases and liquids in nanoporous materials (pore size 1-100 nm). Special emphasis is placed on the transport of small molecules in zeolites, active carbons, metal-organic frameworks, but also in nanoporous materials with larger pores such as ordered and disordered mesoporous oxides. We present different atomistic and mesoscopic methods as well as the theoretical formalisms. Attention is given to the investigation of different molecular transport coefficients - including the self, collective and transport diffusivities - but also to the determination of free energy barriers and their role in overall adsorption/separation process rates. We also introduce other available approaches such as hierarchical simulations and upscaling strategies. This review focuses on simple fluids in prototypical nanoporous materials. While the phenomena covered here capture the main physical mechanisms in such systems, complex molecules will exhibit additional specific features. For the sake of clarity and brevity, we also omit multicomponent systems (e.g. fluid mixtures, electrolytes, etc.) and electrokinetic effects arising when charged systems are considered (ionic species, charged surfaces, etc.), both of which add to the complexity.

Title: Theory of Correlated Insulator(s) and Superconductor at $\nu=1$ in Twisted WSe$_2$
Authors: Sunghoon Kim, Juan Felipe Mendez-Valderrama, Xuepeng Wang, Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: The observation of a superconducting phase, an intertwined insulating phase, and a continuous transition between the two at a commensurate filling of $\nu=1$ in bilayers of twisted WSe$_2$ at $\theta=3.65^0$ raises a number of intriguing questions about the origin of this phenomenology. Here we report the possibility of a displacement-field induced continuous transition between a superconductor and a quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator at $\nu=1$, starting with a simplified three-orbital model of twisted WSe$_2$, including on-site, nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, and a chiral-exchange interaction, respectively. By employing parton mean-field theory, we discuss the nature of these correlated insulators, their expected evolution with the displacement-field, and their phenomenological properties.

Title: Borromean supercounterfluids at finite temperatures
Authors: Alexandru Golic, Igor Timoshuk, Egor Babaev, Boris Svistunov
Abstract: While the properties of standard (single-component) superfluids are well understood, principal differences arise in a special type of multicomponent systems -- the so-called Borromean supercounterfluids -- in which (i) supertransport is possible only in the counterflow regime and (ii) there are three or more counterflowing components. Borromean supercounterfluids's correlation and topological properties distinguish them from their single- and two-component counterparts. The component-symmetric case characterized by a distinctively different universality class of the supercounterfluid-to-normal phase transition is especially interesting. Using the recently introduced concept of compact-gauge invariance as the guiding principle, we develop the finite-temperature description of Borromean supercounterfluids in terms of an asymptotically exact long-wave effective action. We formulate and study Borromean XY and loop statistical models, capturing the universal long-range properties and allowing us to perform efficient worm algorithm simulations. Numeric results demonstrate perfect agreement with analytic predictions. Particularly instructive is the two-dimensional case, where the Borromean nature of the system is strongly manifested while allowing for an asymptotically exact analytic description.

Title: Decoherence of Histories: Chaotic Versus Integrable Systems
Authors: Jiaozi Wang, Philipp Strasberg
Abstract: We study the emergence of decoherent histories in isolated systems based on exact numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation for a Heisenberg chain. We reveal that the nature of the system, which we switch from (i) chaotic to (ii) interacting integrable to (iii) non-interacting integrable, strongly impacts decoherence. From a finite size scaling law we infer a strong exponential suppression of coherences for (i), a weak exponential suppression for (ii) and no exponential suppression for (iii) on a relevant short (nonequilibrium) time scale. Moreover, for longer times we find stronger decoherence for (i) but the opposite for (ii), hinting even at a possible power-law decay for (ii) at equilibrium time scales. This behaviour is encoded in the multi-time properties of the quantum histories and it can not be explained by environmentally induced decoherence. Our results suggest that chaoticity plays a crucial role in the emergence of classicality in finite size systems.

Title: Spontaneous Motion of Liquid Droplets on Soft Gradient Surfaces
Authors: Weiwei Zhao, Wenjie Qian, Chang Xu, Qin Xu
Abstract: We report an experimental investigation of the spontaneous motion of liquid droplets on soft gels with a crosslinking gradient. By systematically adjusting the spatial difference in crosslinking density, we observed that millimeter-sized liquid droplets moved along the gradient of elastic modulus and even climbed tilted slopes against gravity. Unlike the wetting dynamics of micro-droplets, which are governed by elastocapillary effects, we demonstrated that the observed spontaneous movements of millimeter-sized droplets were attributed to the surface energy difference resulting from the variation in crosslinking density. Using {\em in-situ} confocal microscopy imaging, we analyzed the viscoelastic dissipation induced by the moving wetting ridges near dynamic contact lines. Based on the relationship between the crosslinking density and surface energy of soft gels, our findings reveal a new method for controlling droplet dynamics at soft and dissipative interfaces.

Title: Effect of spin-dependent tunneling in a MoSe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ van der Waals heterostructure on exciton and trion emission
Authors: Annika Bergmann, Swarup Deb, Klaus Zollner, Veronika Schneidt, Mustafa Hemaid, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Rico Schwartz, Jaroslav Fabian, Tobias Korn
Abstract: We study van der Waals heterostructures consisting of monolayer MoSe$_2$ and few-layer Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ fully encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride using low-temperature photoluminescence and polar magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements. Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and recombination.

Title: Autonomous Bootstrapping of Quantum Dot Devices
Authors: Anton Zubchenko, Danielle Middlebrooks, Torbjørn Rasmussen, Lara Lausen, Ferdinand Kuemmeth, Anasua Chatterjee, Justyna P. Zwolak
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a promising platform for multiple different qubit implementations, all of which are voltage controlled by programmable gate electrodes. However, as the QD arrays grow in size and complexity, tuning procedures that can fully autonomously handle the increasing number of control parameters are becoming essential for enabling scalability. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm for initializing a depletion-mode QD device in preparation for subsequent phases of tuning. During bootstrapping, the QD device functionality is validated, all gates are characterized, and the QD charge sensor is made operational. We demonstrate the bootstrapping protocol in conjunction with a coarse-tuning module, showing that the combined algorithm can efficiently and reliably take a cooled-down QD device to a desired global-state configuration in under 8 min with a success rate of 96 %. Finally, by following heuristic approaches to QD device initialization and combining the efficient ray-based measurement with the rapid radio-frequency reflectometry measurements, the proposed algorithm establishes a reference in terms of performance, reliability, and efficiency against which alternative algorithms can be benchmarked.

Title: Raman tensor for two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions
Authors: Selçuk Parlak, Ion Garate
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a valuable characterization tool for two-dimensional materials. Starting from model Hamiltonians for Chern insulators and magnetized monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides, we theoretically predict two unconventional features of Raman spectroscopy. First, a selection rule emerges in the Raman tensor when the incident and scattered photons are circularly polarized. This rule generalizes the well-known valley selection rule of optical conductivity in Dirac insulators. Second, for an electronic model with single massive Dirac fermion, the phase difference between Raman tensor elements is quantized to $\pm\pi/2$ for any frequency of the incident light. The quantization is robust under perturbations and the sign of the phase difference is reversed when the mass term of the Hamiltonian is inverted.

Title: Flat Band Generation through Interlayer Geometric Frustration in Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Yawen Peng, Ren He, Peng Li, Sergey Zhdanovich, Matteo Michiardi, Sergey Gorovikov, Marta Zonno, Andrea Damascelli, Guo-Xing Miao
Abstract: Electronic flat bands can lead to rich many-body quantum phases by quenching the electron's kinetic energy and enhancing many-body correlation. The reduced bandwidth can be realized by either destructive quantum interference in frustrated lattices, or by generating heavy band folding with avoided band crossing in Moire superlattices. Here we propose a general approach to introduce flat bands into widely studied transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials by dilute intercalation. A flat band with vanishing dispersion is observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) over the entire momentum space in intercalated Mn1/4TaS2. Polarization dependent ARPES measurements combined with symmetry analysis reveals the orbital characters of the flat band. Supercell tight-binding simulations suggest that such flat bands arising from destructive interference between Mn and Ta on S through hopping pathways, are ubiquitous in a range of TMD families as well as for different intercalation configurations. Our findings establish a new material platform to manipulate flat band structures and explore their corresponding emergent correlated properties.

Title: A Field Guide to non-Onsager Quantum Oscillations in Metals
Authors: Valentin Leeb, Nico Huber, Christian Pfleiderer, Johannes Knolle, Marc A. Wilde
Abstract: Quantum oscillation (QO) measurements constitute a powerful method to measure the Fermi surface (FS) properties of metals. The observation of QOs is usually taken as strong evidence for the existence of extremal cross-sectional areas of the FS according to the famous Onsager relation. Here, we review mechanisms that generate QO frequencies that defy the Onsager relation and discuss material candidates. These include magnetic breakdown, magnetic interaction, chemical potential oscillations, and Stark quantum interference, most of which lead to signals occurring at combinations of ``parent'' Onsager frequencies. A special emphasis is put on the recently discovered mechanism of quasi-particle lifetime oscillations (QPLOs). We aim to provide a field guide that allows, on the one hand, to distinguish such non-Onsager QOs from conventional QOs arising from extremal cross sections and, on the other hand, to distinguish the various non-Onsager mechanisms from each other. We give a practical classification of non-Onsager QOs in terms of the prerequisites for their occurrence and their characteristics. We show that, in particular, the recently discovered QPLOs may pose significant challenges for the interpretation of QO spectra, as they may occur quite generically as frequency differences in multi-orbit systems, \emph{without} the necessity of visible ``parent'' frequencies in the spectrum, owing to a strongly suppressed temperature dephasing of QPLOs. We present an extensive list of material candidates where QPLOs may represent an alternative explanation for the observation of unexpected QO frequencies.

Title: Magnetic field tunable spectral response of kinetic inductance detectors
Authors: F. Levy-Bertrand, M. Calvo, U. Chowdhury, A. Gomez, J. Goupy, A. Monfardini
Abstract: We tune the onset of optical response in aluminium kinetic inductance detectors from a natural cutoff frequency of 90 GHz to 60 GHz by applying an external magnetic field. The change in spectral response is due to the decrease of the superconducting gap, from 90 GHz at zero magnetic field to 60 GHz at a magnetic field of around 3 mT. We characterize the variation of the superconducting gap, the detector frequency shift and the internal quality factor as a function of the applied field. In principle, the magnetic field tunable response could be used to make spectroscopic measurements. In practice, the internal quality factor behaves hysteretically with the magnetic field due to the presence of vortices in the thin superconducting film. We conclude by discussing possible solutions to achieve spectroscopy measurements using kinetic inductance detectors and magnetic field.

Title: Many-body perturbation theory with hybrid density functional theory starting points accelerated by adaptively compressed exchange
Authors: Victor Wen-zhe Yu, Marco Govoni
Abstract: We report on the use of the adaptively compressed exchange (ACE) operator to accelerate many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations, including G$_0$W$_0$ and the Bethe Salpeter equation (BSE), for hybrid density functional theory starting points. We show that by approximating the exact exchange operator with the low-rank ACE operator, substantial computational savings can be achieved with systematically controllable errors in the quasiparticle energies computed with full-frequency G$_0$W$_0$ and the optical absorption spectra and vertical excitation energies computed by solving the BSE within density matrix perturbation theory. Our implementation makes use of the ACE-accelerated electronic Hamiltonian to carry out both G$_0$W$_0$ and BSE without explicitly computing empty states. We show the robustness of the approach and present the computational gains obtained on both the central processing unit and graphics processing unit nodes. Our work will facilitate the exploration and evaluation of fine-tuned hybrid starting points aimed at enhancing the accuracy of MBPT calculations without involving computationally demanding self-consistency in Hedin's equations.

Title: Precisely controlled colloids: A playground for path-wise non-equilibrium physics
Authors: Cai Dieball, Yasamin Mohebi Satalsari, Angel B. Zuccolotto-Bernezb, Stefan U. Egelhaaf, Manuel A. Escobedo-Sánchez, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: We investigate path-wise observables in experiments on driven colloids in a periodic light field to dissect selected intricate transport features, kinetics, and transition-path time statistics out of thermodynamic equilibrium. These observables directly reflect the properties of individual paths in contrast to the properties of an ensemble of particles, such as radial distribution functions or mean-squared displacements. In particular, we present two distinct albeit equivalent formulations of the underlying stochastic equation of motion, highlight their respective practical relevance, and show how to interchange between them. We discuss conceptually different notions of local velocities and interrogate one- and two-sided first-passage and transition-path time statistics in and out of equilibrium. Our results reiterate how path-wise observables may be employed to systematically assess the quality of experimental data and demonstrate that, given sufficient control and sampling, one may quantitatively verify subtle theoretical predictions.

Title: Topological phase transition and its stability against an applied magnetic field in a class of low dimensional decorated lattices
Authors: Sougata Biswas
Abstract: The possibility of topological phase transition with or without a magnetic flux trapped in the cells of a class of decorated lattices is explored in this http URL a tight binding Hamiltonian and a real space decimation scheme we analytically obtain the non-dispersive and dispersive energy bands, and exactly locate the eigenvalues at which energy gaps this http URL find that despite the local breaking of the time reversal symmetry, as a magnetic field is turned on, the topological invariant exhibits quantization, and a clear appearance of edge localized modes is observed exactly at the gap-closing energy eigenvalues in the topologically non-trivial insulating this http URL bulk boundary correspondence is obeyed. The protection of the edge states by a chiral symmetry is confirmed for both the presence and absence of magnetic flux. Our studies have been extended to other kinds of decorated lattices where topological phase transition is possible only above a threshold value of the hopping integral describing these lattice. Our results are analytically exact.

Title: Energy-Specific Bethe-Salpeter Equation Implementation for Efficient Optical Spectrum Calculations
Authors: Christopher Hillenbrand, Jiachen Li, Tianyu Zhu
Abstract: We present an energy-specific Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) implementation for efficient core and valence optical spectrum calculations. In energy-specific BSE, high-lying excitation energies are obtained by constructing trial vectors and expanding the subspace targeting excitation energies above the predefined energy threshold in the Davidson algorithm. To calculate optical spectra over a wide energy range, energy-specific BSE can be applied to multiple consecutive small energy windows, where trial vectors for each subsequent energy window are made orthogonal to the subspace of preceding windows to accelerate the convergence of the Davidson algorithm. For seven small molecules, energy-specific BSE combined with $G_0W_0$ provides small errors around 0.8 eV for absolute and relative $K$-edge excitation energies when starting from a hybrid PBEh solution with 45% exact exchange. We further showcase the computational efficiency of this approach by simulating the N $1s$ $K$-edge excitation spectrum of the porphine molecule and the valence optical spectrum of silicon nanoclusters involving 6,000 excited states using $G_0W_0$-BSE. This work expands the applicability of the $GW$-BSE formalism for investigating high-energy excited states of large systems.

Abstract: We consider the model of complex hyperbranched polymer structures formed on the basis of scale-free graphs, where functionalities (degrees) $k$ of nodes obey a power law decaying probability $p(k)\sim{k^{-\alpha}}$. Such polymer topologies can be considered as generalization of regular hierarchical dendrimer structures with fixed functionalities. The conformational size and shape characteristics, such as averaged asphericity $\langle A_3 \rangle$ and size ratio $g$ of such polymer networks are obtained numerically by application of Wei's method, which defines the configurations of any complex Gaussian network in terms of eigenvalue spectra of corresponding Kirchhoff matrix. Our quantitative results indicate, in particular, an increase of compactness and symmetry of network structures with the decrease of parameter $\alpha$.

Title: Unconventional and Powerful Ion Sources for Solid-State Ion Exchange, Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4: Exemplified by Synthesis of Metastable \beta-CuGaO2 from Stable \beta-LiGaO2
Authors: Issei Suzuki, Kako Washizu, Daiki Motai, Masao Kita, Takahisa Omata
Abstract: This study introduces a new method for synthesizing Cu+-containing metastable phases through ion exchange. Traditionally, CuCl has been used as a Cu+ ion source for solid-state ion exchanges; however, its thermodynamic driving force is often insufficient for complete ion exchange with Li+-containing precursors. First-principles calculations have identified Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4 as more powerful alternatives, providing a higher driving force than CuCl. It has been experimentally demon-strated that these ion sources can open up new reaction pathways through experimental ion exchanges, such as from \beta-LiGaO2 to \beta-CuGaO2, which were previously unattainable. An important perspective provided by this study is that the poten-tial of such basic compounds to act as powerful ion sources has been overlooked, and that they were identified through straightforward first-principles calculations. This work presents the initial strategic design of an ion exchange reaction by exploring suitable ion sources, thereby expanding the potential for synthesizing metastable materials.

Title: Enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature due to multiband effect in the topological nodal-line semimetal Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$
Authors: K. Kumarasinghe, A. Rahman, M. Tomlinson, Y. Nakajima
Abstract: We report a systematic study of the normal-state and superconducting properties of single crystal Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$ $(0\leq x \leq 0.23)$. Sn doping enhances the superconducting temperature $T_{c}$ up to 5.1 K while also significantly increasing impurity scattering in the crystals. For $x=0$ and 0.018, the specific heat jump at $T_{c}$ exceeds the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) weak-coupling value of 1.43, indicating the realization of strong-coupling superconductivity in undoped and slightly Sn-doped PbTaSe$_{2}$. Substituting Pb with more Sn lowers the specific heat jump at $T_{c}$ below the BSC value of 1.43, which cannot be explained by a single-gap model. Rather, the observed specific heat data of moderately Sn-doped PbTaSe$_{2}$ ($x= 0.08$ and 0.15) are reproduced by a two-gap model. Our observations suggest that additional Fermi pockets appear due to a reduction of the spin-orbit gap with Sn doping, and the multiband effect arising from these emergent Fermi pockets enhances the effective electron-phonon coupling strength, leading to the increase in $T_{c}$ of Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$.

Title: Consequences of the failure of equipartition for the p-V behavior of liquid water and the hydration free energy components of a small protein
Authors: Dilipkumar N. Asthagiri, Arjun Valiya Parambathu, Thomas L. Beck
Abstract: Earlier we showed that in the molecular dynamics simulation of a rigid model of water it is necessary to use an integration time-step $\delta t \leq 0.5$ fs to ensure equipartition between translational and rotational modes. Here we extend that study in the $NVT$ ensemble to $NpT$ conditions and to an aqueous protein. We study neat liquid water with the rigid, SPC/E model and the protein BBA (PDB ID: 1FME) solvated in the rigid, TIP3P model. We examine integration time-steps ranging from $0.5$ fs to $4.0$ fs for various thermostat plus barostat combinations. We find that a small $\delta t$ is necessary to ensure consistent prediction of the simulation volume. Hydrogen mass repartitioning alleviates the problem somewhat, but is ineffective for the typical time-step used with this approach. The compressibility, a measure of volume fluctuations, and the dielectric constant, a measure of dipole moment fluctuations, are also seen to be sensitive to $\delta t$. Using the mean volume estimated from the $NpT$ simulation, we examine the electrostatic and van der Waals contribution to the hydration free energy of the protein in the $NVT$ ensemble. These contributions are also sensitive to $\delta t$. In going from $\delta t = 2$ fs to $\delta t = 0.5$ fs, the change in the net electrostatic plus van der Waals contribution to the hydration of BBA is already in excess of the folding free energy reported for this protein.

Title: Diffusion behavior of Li ions in crystalline and amorphous Li-Zr-O and Li-Nb-O phases
Authors: Daniel Mutter, Diego A. Pantano, Christian Elsässer, Daniel F. Urban
Abstract: Li containing transition metal oxides are known as good ionic conductors. Performing classical molecular dynamics simulations, the diffusion behavior of Li ions is investigated in crystalline and amorphous phases with the stoichiometries Li$_2$ZrO$_3$ and LiNbO$_3$. We first demonstrate the stability of the crystal structures for the used interatomic potential model and then analyze the amorphous phases, which result from melt-and-quench simulations, in terms of radial distribution functions. Diffusivities of Li ions in those systems are obtained from a statistical Arrhenius analysis of mean square displacement curves at different temperatures. The crystalline phase of Li$_2$ZrO$_3$ exhibits two well-defined migration mechanisms: vacancy-mediated migration is dominant below and a site exchange of Li ions above a crossover region between about 1700 and 1800 K. The latter mechanism also prevails in the amorphous phases of Li$_2$ZrO$_3$ with a strongly reduced activation energy, which is due to a smaller equilibrium separation of Li ions as in the crystal structure. This migration mechanism is found in amorphous LiNbO$_3$, too.

Title: Foundational Large Language Models for Materials Research
Authors: Vaibhav Mishra, Somaditya Singh, Dhruv Ahlawat, Mohd Zaki, Vaibhav Bihani, Hargun Singh Grover, Biswajit Mishra, Santiago Miret, Mausam, N. M. Anoop Krishnan
Abstract: Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.

Title: Berry Phase and Quantum Oscillation from Multi-orbital Coadjoint-orbit Bosonization
Authors: Mengxing Ye, Yuxuan Wang
Abstract: We develop an effective field theory for a multi-orbital fermionic system using the method of coadjoint orbits for higher-dimensional bosonization. The dynamical bosonic fields are single-particle distribution functions defined on the phase space. We show that when projecting to a single band, Berry curvature effects naturally emerge. In particular, we consider the de Haas-van Alphen effect of a 2d Fermi surface, and show that the oscillation of orbital magnetization in an external field is offset by the Berry phase accumulated by the cyclotron around the Fermi surface. Beyond previously known results, we show that this phase shift holds even for interacting systems, in which the single-particle Berry phase is replaced by the static anomalous Hall conductance. Furthermore, we obtain the correction to the amplitudes of de Haas-van Alphen oscillations due to Berry curvature effects.

Title: Role of electron-electron interaction in the Mpemba effect in quantum dots
Authors: Juliane Graf, Janine Splettstoesser, Juliette Monsel
Abstract: The Mpemba effect has initially been noticed in macroscopic systems -- namely that hot water can freeze faster than cold water -- but recently its extension to open quantum systems has attracted significant attention. This phenomenon can be explained in the context of nonequilibrium thermodynamics of Markovian systems, relying on the amplitudes of different decay modes of the system dynamics. Here, we study the Mpemba effect in a single-level quantum dot coupled to a thermal bath, highlighting the role of the sign and magnitude of the electron-electron interaction in the occurrence of the Mpemba effect. We gain physical insights into the decay modes from a dissipative symmetry of this system called fermionic duality. Based on this analysis of the relaxation to equilibrium of the dot, we derive criteria for the occurrence of the Mpemba effect using two thermodynamically relevant measures of the distance to equilibrium, the nonequilibrium free energy and the dot energy. We furthermore compare this effect to a possible exponential speedup of the relaxation. Finally, we propose experimentally relevant schemes for the state preparation and explore different ways of observing the Mpemba effect in quantum dots in experiments.

Title: Deterministic role of chemical bonding in the formation of altermagnetism: Reflection from correlated electron system NiS
Authors: Arijit Mandal, Arindom Das, B.R.K. Nanda
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new collinear magnetic state, has gained significant attention in the last few years, and the underlying mechanisms driving this quantum phase are still evolving. Going beyond the group theoretical analyses, which focus on providing a binary description of the presence or absence of the altermagnetic state, in this work, we explore the role of crystal chemical bonding. As the latter successfully integrates the crystal and orbital symmetries and is tunable, it provides a quantitative and realistic mechanism to explain the formation of altermagnetism. From the first principles calculations and tight-binding models within the framework of the linear combination of atomic orbitals on NiS, we establish a set of selection rules for the formation of altermagnetism in the NiAs prototype compounds (e.g. CrSb, MnTe, etc.). Broadly, if single orbitals from Ni and S sites are involved in the bonding, the second neighbor interaction between the nonmagnetic atoms is a must to modulate the intra-sublattice interactions differently for the opposite spin sublattices so that the antiferromagnetic sublattice band degeneracy is lifted and momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin split (ASS) appears. However, when multiple orbitals are involved from the Ni and S sites in the chemical bonding, altermagnetism is naturally present. Together they amplify the ASS. Further, we propose twelve antinodal regions in the NiAs type hexagonal crystals, where ASS split is maximum. Specific to NiS, ASS increases with correlation, and for the edge valence and conduction bands it can go beyond 1eV. The present study opens up new pathways to design chemical bonding driven selection rules in addition to the existing crystal symmetry criteria to tailor tunable altermagnetism.

Title: Off-resonant photoluminescence spectroscopy of high-optical quality single photon emitters in GaN
Authors: Nilesh Dalla, Paweł Kulboka, Michał Kobecki, Jan Misiak, Paweł Prystawko, Henryk Turski, Piotr Kossacki, Tomasz Jakubczyk
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the relevance of excitation parameters on the emission from single-photon emitting defect centers in GaN. We investigate the absorption spectrum of different emitters by photoluminescence excitation technique at 10\,K. We report large spectral jumps (shifts up to 22\,meV) in the emitters' zero-phonon line (ZPL). The likelihood of such jumps is increased by the change in excitation energy. The shifts indicate a large built-in dipole moment of the defects and suggest a possibility to electrically tune their ZPL in a wide range. From the photoluminescence excitation studies, we observe that for majority of the emitters the absorption peaks exist between 2 and 2.55\,eV. The absorption peaks vary from emitter to emitter, and no universal absorption pattern is apparent. Finally, for selected emitters we observe significantly reduced spectral diffusion and instrument-limited linewidth of $138\,\mu eV$ (0.04\,nm).These findings show a new perspective for atomic defect GaN emitters as sources of coherent photons, shine new light on their energy level structure and show the possibility of tuning the ZPL, paving the way to fully harness their potential for applications in quantum technologies.

Title: Effects of electron correlation on resonant Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects
Authors: Mojdeh Saleh, Abhishek Kumar, Dmitrii L. Maslov, Saurabh Maiti
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in systems with broken inversion symmetry gives rise to the Edelstein effect, which is the induced spin polarization in response to an applied electric field or current, and the inverse Edelstein effect, which is the induced electric current in response to an oscillatory magnetic field or spin polarization. At the same time, an interplay between spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interaction leads to a special type of collective excitations -- chiral-spin modes -- which are oscillations of spin polarization in the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, both Edelstein and inverse Edelstein effects exhibit resonances at the frequencies of spin-chiral collective modes. Here, we present a detailed study of the effect of electron correlation on the Edelstein and inverse Edelstein effects in a single-valley two-dimensional electron gas and a multi-valley Dirac system with proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. While the chiral-spin modes involve both in-plane and out-of-plane oscillations of spins, we show that only the in-plane modes are responsible for the above resonances. In the multi-valley system, electron correlation splits the in-plane modes into two. We also study the spectral weight distribution between the two resonances over a large parameter space of intra- and inter-valley interactions.

Title: Origin of the Diagonal Double-Stripe Spin-Density-Wave and Potential Superconductivity in Bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at Ambient Pressure
Authors: Yu-Bo Liu, Hongyi Sun, Ming Zhang, Qihang Liu, Wei-Qiang Chen, Fan Yang
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) with $T_c\approx 80$ K in the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has aroused great interests. Currently, due to technical difficulties, most experiments on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ can only be performed at ambient pressure (AP). Particularly, various experiments have revealed the presence of spin-density wave (SDW) in the unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern with wave vector near $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. In this work, we employ first-principle calculations followed by the random phase approximation (RPA)-based study to clarify the origin of this special SDW pattern and the potential SC in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. Starting from our density-functional-theory band structure, we construct an eight-band bilayer tight-binding model using the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which is equipped with the standard multi-orbital Hubbard interaction. Our RPA calculation reveals an SDW order driven by Fermi-surface nesting with wave vector ${Q}\approx(0,\pm0.84\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone (BZ). From the view of the unfolded BZ, the wave vector turns to ${Q}_0\approx\pm(0.58\pi,0.58\pi)$, which is near the one detected by various experiments. Further more, this SDW exhibits an interlayer antiferromagnetic order with a unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern, consistent with recent soft X-ray scattering experiment. This result suggests that the origin of the SDW order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP can be well understood in the itinerant picture as driven by Fermi surfaces nesting. In the aspect of SC, our RPA study yields an approximate $s^\pm$-wave spin-singlet pairing with $T_c$ much lower than that under high pressure. Further more, the $T_c$ can be strongly enhanced through hole doping, leading to possible high-temperature SC at AP.

Title: Strong-coupling RPA theory of a Bose gas near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition: universal thermodynamics and two-body contact
Authors: Nicolas Dupuis, Moksh Bhateja, Adam Rançon
Abstract: We present a strong-coupling expansion of the Bose-Hubbard model based on a mean-field treatment of the hopping term, while onsite fluctuations are taken into account exactly. This random phase approximation (RPA) describes the universal features of the generic Mott-insulator--superfluid transition (induced by a density change) and the superfluid phase near the phase transition. The critical quasi-particles at the quantum critical point have a quadratic dispersion with an effective mass $m^*$ and their mutual interaction is described by an effective $s$-wave scattering length $a^*$. The singular part of the pressure takes the same form as in a dilute Bose gas, provided we replace the boson mass $m$ and the scattering length in vacuum $a$ by $m^*$ and $a^*$, and the density $n$ by the excess density $|n-n_{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. We define a ``universal'' two-body contact $C_{\rm univ}$ that controls the high-momentum tail $\sim 1/|{\bf k}|^4$ of the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution. We also apply the strong-coupling RPA to a lattice model of hard-core bosons and find that the high-momentum distribution is controlled by a universal contact, in complete agreement with the Bose-Hubbard model. Finally, we discuss a continuum model of bosons in an optical lattice and define two additional two-body contacts: a short-distance ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}^{\rm sd}$ which controls the high-momentum tail of $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ at scales larger than the inverse lattice spacing, and a ``full'' contact $C$ which controls the high-momentum tail of the full momentum distribution $n_{\bf k}$.

Title: Binary random packing fraction of hyperspheres with small or large size difference: a geometric approach
Authors: H.J.H. Brouwers
Abstract: The random packing fraction of binary particles in D-dimensional Euclidean space R^D is studied using a geometric approach. First, the binary packing fraction of assemblies with small size difference are studied, using the excluded volume model by Onsager for particles in three-dimensional space (D = 3). According to this model the packing increase by bidispersity is proportional to (1 - f)(u^D - 1)^2, with f as monosized packing fraction, u as size ratio and D as space dimension. The model predictions are compared with computational results for disks in two dimensions (D = 2) and hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit (D to infinity), yielding good agreement. Subsequently, the packing of hyperspheres with large size difference is modeled, employing the classic theory of Furnas. This theory, developed for three dimensions, starts from an infinite size ratio of larger and smaller particles (u to infinity). Here, the pertaining equations are applied to hyperspheres, and successfully compared with computational results for hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation of the binary packing fraction for large size ratio is derived, which shows that the first order variation of the Furnas packing fraction (u^-1 = 0) is proportional to (2 - f)u^-1. Finally, a scaled D-dimensional binary packing graph is presented, governing a simplified phase diagram that borders the binary random packing fraction of amorphous assemblies. To summarize, basic space-filling and geometric (a-thermal) theories on simple hard spheres appear to be a valuable tool for the study of hyperspheres packing and amorphization.

Title: Melting through Barrier-Crossing: The Role of Equilibrium Thermally Activated Particles
Authors: Rongchao Ma
Abstract: Melting is often understood in purely equilibrium terms, where crystalline order disappears once the free energy of the solid equals that of the liquid. Yet at the microscopic level, the initiating events for melting can often be traced to the formation of defects or local ``jumps'' over interatomic barriers. In this work, we offer a unified interpretation of melting by focusing on the equilibrium fraction of particles whose energy exceeds a characteristic barrier \(E_a\). We show that when this fraction surpasses a small but critical threshold \cite{Feder1958,Kraftmakher1998} (on the order of \(10^{-4}\)-\(10^{-3}\)), the crystal loses its rigidity, thus reconciling Born's mechanical-instability picture with the older Lindemann notion of large atomic displacements. We derive this threshold condition from standard Boltzmann (and Bose/Fermi) statistics, ensuring consistency with standard thermodynamics. Our approach naturally extends to vortex lattices in superconductors (where vortex activation energies play the role of \(E_a\)) and to quantum-lattice systems (Hubbard-type models). Crucially, while the interpretation emphasizes barrier crossing, the criterion itself is built on equilibrium statistical mechanics, offering a transparent link between defect formation rates and the macroscopic transition.

Title: Geospatial distributions reflect rates of evolution of features of language
Authors: Henri Kauhanen, Deepthi Gopal, Tobias Galla, Ricardo Bermúdez-Otero
Abstract: Quantifying the speed of linguistic change is challenging due to the fact that the historical evolution of languages is sparsely documented. Consequently, traditional methods rely on phylogenetic reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to the problem through the analysis of language change as a stochastic process combining vertical descent, spatial interactions, and mutations in both dimensions. A notion of linguistic temperature emerges naturally from this analysis as a dimensionless measure of the propensity of a linguistic feature to undergo change. We demonstrate how temperatures of linguistic features can be inferred from their present-day geospatial distributions, without recourse to information about their phylogenies. Thus the evolutionary dynamics of language, operating across thousands of years, leaves a measurable geospatial signature. This signature licenses inferences about the historical evolution of languages even in the absence of longitudinal data.

Title: Universal trade-off structure between symmetry, irreversibility, and quantum coherence in quantum processes
Authors: Hiroyasu Tajima, Ryuji Takagi, Yui Kuramochi
Abstract: Symmetry, irreversibility, and quantum coherence are foundational concepts in physics. Here, we present a universal tradeoff relation between these three concepts. This particularly reveals that (1) under a global symmetry, any attempt to change the local conserved charge causes inevitable irreversibility, and (2) such irreversibility can be mitigated by quantum coherence. Our tradeoff relation follows solely from the unitarity and global symmetry of the total dynamics, allowing for general applicability. For non-equilibrium physics, it relates the coherence cost and the entropy production -- representing thermodynamic irreversibility -- in arbitrary quantum processes. It also provides fundamental limitations on the capability of a number of quantum information processing tasks -- such as gate and measurement implementation and error correction -- that involve symmetry restrictions. Furthermore, it predicts how many bits of classical information thrown into a black hole become unreadable under energy conservation. Our tradeoff relation is based on quantum uncertainty relation, showcasing intimate connections between fundamental physical principles and ultimate operational capability of quantum processes.

Title: Coherence in resonance fluorescence
Authors: Xu-Jie Wang, Guoqi Huang, Ming-Yang Li, Yuan-Zhuo Wang, Li Liu, Bang Wu, Hanqing Liu, Haiqiao Ni, Zhichuan Niu, Weijie Ji, Rongzhen Jiao, Hua-Lei Yin, Zhiliang Yuan
Abstract: Resonance fluorescence of a two-level emitter displays persistently anti-bunching irrespective of the excitation intensity, but inherits the driving laser's linewidth under weak monochromatic excitation. These properties are commonly explained in terms of two disjoined pictures, i.e., the emitter's single photon saturation or passively scattering light. Here, we propose a unified model that treats all fluorescence photons as spontaneous emission, one at a time, and can explain simultaneously both the spectral and correlation properties of the emission. We theoretically derive the excitation power dependencies, measurable at the single-photon incidence level, of the first-order coherence of the whole resonance fluorescence and super-bunching of the spectrally filtered, followed by experimental confirmation on a semiconductor quantum dot micro-pillar device. Furthermore, our model explains peculiar coincidence bunching observed in phase-dependent two-photon interference experiments. Our work provides an intuitive understanding of coherent light-matter interaction and may stimulate new applications.

Title: Variational Neural and Tensor Network Approximations of Thermal States
Authors: Sirui Lu, Giacomo Giudice, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: We introduce a variational Monte Carlo algorithm for approximating finite-temperature quantum many-body systems, based on the minimization of a modified free energy. This approach directly approximates the state at a fixed temperature, allowing for systematic improvement of the ansatz expressiveness without accumulating errors from iterative imaginary time evolution. We employ a variety of trial states -- both tensor networks as well as neural networks -- as variational Ansätze for our numerical optimization. We benchmark and compare different constructions in the above classes, both for one- and two-dimensional problems, with systems made of up to $N=100$ spins. Our results demonstrate that while restricted Boltzmann machines show limitations, string bond tensor network states exhibit systematic improvements with increasing bond dimensions and the number of strings.

Title: Revisiting Shooting Point Monte Carlo Methods for Transition Path Sampling
Authors: Sebastian Falkner, Alessandro Coretti, Baron Peters, Peter G. Bolhuis, Christoph Dellago
Abstract: Rare event sampling algorithms are essential for understanding processes that occur infrequently on the molecular scale, yet they are important for the long-time dynamics of complex molecular systems. One of these algorithms, transition path sampling (TPS), has become a standard technique to study such rare processes since no prior knowledge on the transition region is required. Most TPS methods generate new trajectories from old trajectories by selecting a point along the old trajectory, modifying its momentum in some way, and then ``shooting'' a new trajectory by integrating forward and backward in time. In some procedures, the shooting point is selected independently for each trial move, but in others, the shooting point evolves from one path to the next so that successive shooting points are related to each other. To account for this memory effect, we introduce a theoretical framework based on an extended ensemble that includes both paths and shooting indices. We derive appropriate acceptance rules for various path sampling algorithms in this extended formalism, ensuring the correct sampling of the transition path ensemble. Our framework reveals the need for amended acceptance criteria in the flexible-length aimless shooting and spring shooting methods.

Title: Entanglement Negativity and Replica Symmetry Breaking in General Holographic States
Authors: Xi Dong, Jonah Kudler-Flam, Pratik Rath
Abstract: The entanglement negativity $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ is a useful measure of quantum entanglement in bipartite mixed states. In random tensor networks (RTNs), which are related to fixed-area states, it was found in [arXiv:2101.11029] that the dominant saddles computing the even Rényi negativity $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ generically break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. This calls into question previous calculations of holographic negativity using 2D CFT techniques that assumed $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry and proposed that the negativity was related to the entanglement wedge cross section. In this paper, we resolve this issue by showing that in general holographic states, the saddles computing $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ indeed break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. Our argument involves an identity relating $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ to the $k$-th Rényi entropy on subregion $AB^*$ in the doubled state $|{\rho_{AB}}\rangle_{AA^*BB^*}$, from which we see that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_{k}$. For $k<1$, which includes the case of $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ at $k=1/2$, we use a modified cosmic brane proposal to derive a new holographic prescription for $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ and show that it is given by a new saddle with multiple cosmic branes anchored to subregions $A$ and $B$ in the original state. Using our prescription, we reproduce known results for the PSSY model and show that our saddle dominates over previously proposed CFT calculations near $k=1$. Moreover, we argue that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ symmetric configurations previously proposed are not gravitational saddles, unlike our proposal. Finally, we contrast holographic calculations with those arising from RTNs with non-maximally entangled links, demonstrating that the qualitative form of backreaction in such RTNs is different from that in gravity.

Title: Low-dimensional model for adaptive networks of spiking neurons
Authors: Bastian Pietras, Pau Clusella, Ernest Montbrió
Abstract: We investigate a large ensemble of Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons with heterogeneous input currents and adaptation variables. Our analysis reveals that for a specific class of adaptation, termed quadratic spike-frequency adaptation (QSFA), the high-dimensional system can be exactly reduced to a low-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, which describes the dynamics of three mean-field variables: the population's firing rate, the mean membrane potential, and a mean adaptation variable. The resulting low-dimensional firing rate equations (FRE) uncover a key generic feature of heterogeneous networks with spike frequency adaptation: Both the center and the width of the distribution of the neurons' firing frequencies are reduced, and this largely promotes the emergence of collective synchronization in the network. Our findings are further supported by the bifurcation analysis of the FRE, which accurately captures the collective dynamics of the spiking neuron network, including phenomena such as collective oscillations, bursting, and macroscopic chaos.

Title: Split Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter
Authors: Eduardo Barredo-Alamilla, Luis F. Urrutia, Maxim A. Gorlach
Abstract: Chiral matter exhibits unique electromagnetic responses due to the macroscopic manifestation of the chiral anomaly as anomalous transport currents. Here, we study the modification of electromagnetic radiation in isotropic chiral matter characterized by an axion coupling that varies linearly over time $\theta(t) = b_0 t$. Using Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, we derive the causal Green's function to investigate the stability and radiation properties of the system. Even though the plane-wave modes of isotropic chiral matter exhibit imaginary frequencies for long wavelengths, which might suggest instability in the system, we show that their contribution is confined to the near-field region. Also we find no exponentially growing fields at arbitrarily large times, so that stability is preserved. Under these conditions the radiation yields a positive energy flux, although this is not an inherent property of the general definition. In the case of a fast-moving charge, we confirm the existence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation and show that, for refractive indices $n > 1$, the Cherenkov cone can split into two concentric cones with opposite circular polarizations. This split, governed by the speed of the particle $v$, $n$ and $b_0$, resembles the optical spin-Hall effect and offers potential applications for creating circularly polarized terahertz (THz) light sources. Our Green's function approach provides a general method for analyzing radiation in chiral matter, from Weyl semimetals to quark-gluon plasmas, and can be extended to systems such as oscillating dipoles and accelerated charges.

Title: A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography
Authors: Taishi Kawamoto
Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to be hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.

Title: Bose-Einstein condensation in a rigidly rotating relativistic boson gas
Authors: E. Siri, N. Sadooghi
Abstract: We study the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a free Bose gas under rigid rotation. The aim is to explore the impact of rotation on the thermodynamic quantities associated with BEC, including the Bose-Einstein (BE) transition temperature and condensate fraction. We begin by introducing the rotation in the Lagrangian density of free charged Klein-Gordon fields and determine the corresponding grand canonical partition function at finite temperature, chemical potential, and finite angular velocity. Assuming slow rotation, we derive analytical expressions for the pressure, energy, number, and angular momentum densities of a free Bose gas in nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits in terms of the corresponding fugacities. We then focus on the phenomenon of BEC. We calculate the critical temperature of BEC transition and the condensate fraction in a slowly rotating Bose gas including only particles. Our findings indicate that the critical exponent associated with the BE transition in a rotating gas is lower compared to that in a nonrotating Bose gas. We also determine the fugacity in a rotating Bose gas in the aforementioned limits and examine how rotation affects its temperature dependence, both below and above the critical temperature. By analyzing the behavior of heat capacity at these temperatures, we demonstrate that in a nonrelativistic Bose gas, the rotation transforms the nature of the BE phase transition from a continuous to a discontinuous transition. In general, we find that a nonrelativistic Bose gas under rotation behaves similarly to a nonrotating Bose gas in ultrarelativistic limit.

Title: $\eta$ invariant of massive Wilson Dirac operator and the index
Authors: Shoto Aoki, Hidenori Fukaya, Mikio Furuta, Shinichiroh Matsuo, Tetsuya Onogi, Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We revisit the lattice index theorem in the perspective of $K$-theory. The standard definition given by the overlap Dirac operator equals to the $\eta$ invariant of the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass. This equality is not coincidental but reflects a mathematically profound significance known as the suspension isomorphism of $K$-groups. Specifically, we identify the Wilson Dirac operator as an element of the $K^1$ group, which is characterized by the $\eta$-invariant. Furthermore, we prove that, at sufficiently small but finite lattice spacings, this $\eta$-invariant equals to the index of the continuum Dirac operator. Our results indicate that the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and the associated exact chiral symmetry are not essential for understanding gauge field topology in lattice gauge theory.
