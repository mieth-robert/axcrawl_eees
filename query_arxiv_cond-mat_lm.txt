Title: polyBART: A Chemical Linguist for Polymer Property Prediction and Generative Design
Authors: Anagha Savit, Harikrishna Sahu, Shivank Shukla, Wei Xiong, Rampi Ramprasad
Abstract: Designing polymers for targeted applications and accurately predicting their properties is a key challenge in materials science owing to the vast and complex polymer chemical space. While molecular language models have proven effective in solving analogous problems for molecular discovery, similar advancements for polymers are limited. To address this gap, we propose polyBART, a language model-driven polymer discovery capability that enables rapid and accurate exploration of the polymer design space. Central to our approach is Pseudo-polymer SELFIES (PSELFIES), a novel representation that allows for the transfer of molecular language models to the polymer space. polyBART is, to the best of our knowledge, the first language model capable of bidirectional translation between polymer structures and properties, achieving state-of-the-art results in property prediction and design of novel polymers for electrostatic energy storage. Further, polyBART is validated through a combination of both computational and laboratory experiments. We report what we believe is the first successful synthesis and validation of a polymer designed by a language model, predicted to exhibit high thermal degradation temperature and confirmed by our laboratory measurements. Our work presents a generalizable strategy for adapting molecular language models to the polymer space and introduces a polymer foundation model, advancing generative polymer design that may be adapted for a variety of applications.

Title: Magnetophoresis of paramagnetic nanoparticles in suspensions under magnetic field gradients
Authors: Peter Rassolov, Jamel Ali, Theo Siegrist, Munir Humayun, Hadi Mohammadigoushki
Abstract: We systematically investigate the magnetophoresis of weakly paramagnetic manganese oxide nanoparticles under nonuniform magnetic fields using a combination of experiments and multiphysics numerical simulations. Experiments were conducted in a closed cuvette exposed to a nonuniform magnetic field generated by an electromagnet, covering a wide range of particle concentrations 25-200 mgL and magnetic field gradients 0-110 T2m. The experimental results reveal that paramagnetic manganese oxide nanoparticles exhibit significant magnetophoretic behavior, leading to particle depletion within the cuvette. The depletion rate is independent of the initial particle concentration but strongly depends on the magnetic field gradient. At low magnetic field gradients, magnetophoresis progresses slowly, while at higher gradients, the particle depletion rate increases significantly before stabilizing. Transient concentration gradients emerge within the cuvette during magnetophoresis, which we hypothesize are driven by magnetic Grashof numbers near unity. When magnetic Grashof is beyond 1, the formation of concentration gradients induces bulk fluid flows that accelerate particle capture at regions of maximum magnetic field strength. In systems where magnetophoresis opposes sedimentation, particle depleted regions form when the ratio of magnetic to gravitational Peclet numbers exceeds 1. The numerical simulations suggest formation field induced aggregation for manganese oxide nanoparticles with radii of 130 nm or larger. These insights highlight the potential of magnetic separation for sustainable metal recovery, offering a scalable and environmental friendly solution for recycling critical materials from spent electronics.

Title: Griffiths phases in structurally disordered CeRhSn: Experimental evidence and theoretical modeling
Authors: Andrzej Ślebarski, Maciej M. Maśka
Abstract: Our report paves the way for insight into a structural disorder and its impact on the physical properties of strongly correlated electron systems (SCESs). In a critical regime, each perturbation, e.g., disorder due to structural defects or doping, can have a significant effect on the nature of the quantum macrostate of these materials. For a select group of SCESs, we have empirically documented the Griffiths singularity, as exemplified by CeRhSn, which exhibits non-Fermi-liquid characteristics in susceptibility and specific heat. Our numerical analysis has supported the Griffiths phase scenario for CeRhSn and has revealed that its dc magnetic susceptibility is strongly dependent on the size of inhomogeneous magnetic particles that form in these materials. In the presence of strong disorder, we have proposed a magnetic phase diagram for CeRhSn. The classical Griffiths phase has been identified in the temperature range below the onset temperature of $T_G$ ~ 220 K, while the quantum Griffiths phase with non-Fermi liquid behavior emerges below the quantum critical temperature of $T_Q$ ~ 6 K. The phase diagram developed in this study bears notable similarities to the scenario previously proposed by Vojta for magnetic quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.

Title: Geometric Bloch oscillations and transverse displacement in flat band systems
Authors: Jing-Xin Liu, Giandomenico Palumbo, Marco Di Liberto
Abstract: We investigate transport phenomena and dynamical effects in flat bands where the band dispersion plays no role. We show that wavepackets in geometrically non-trivial flat bands can display dynamics when inhomogeneous electric fields are present. This dynamics is revealed both for the wavepacket trajectory and for its variance, for which we derive semiclassical equations extended to the non-Abelian case. Our findings are tested in flat band models in one- and two-dimensional lattices where the dynamics is solely determined by geometric effects, in the absence of band dispersion. In particular, in the one-dimensional case, we show the existence of Bloch oscillations for the wavepacket position and for the wavepacket variance, whereas in the two-dimensional case we observe a transverse displacement of the wavepacket in the absence of Berry curvature. This work paves the way for understanding quantum-geometry-induced dynamical effects in flat band materials and also opens the possibility for their observation with synthetic matter platforms.

Title: Emergent gravity and gravitational lensing in quantum materials
Authors: Yugo Onishi, Nisarga Paul, Liang Fu
Abstract: We show that an effective gravitational field naturally emerges in quantum materials with long-wavelength spin (or pseudospin) textures. When the itinerant electrons' spin strongly couples to the background spin texture, it effectively behaves as a spinless particle in a curved space, with the curvature arising from quantum corrections to the electron's spin orientation. The emergent gravity gives rise to the electron lensing effect, an analog of the gravitational lensing. Our work shows that novel ``gravitational'' phenomena generically appear in quantum systems due to nonadiabaticity, opening new research directions in quantum physics.

Title: Magnetic field-free braiding and nontrivial fusion of Majorana bound states in high-temperature planar Josephson junctions
Authors: Pankaj Sharma, Narayan Mohanta
Abstract: Demonstration of non-Abelian statistics of zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS) is crucial for long-sought-after decoherence-free topological quantum computing. The ability to move the MBS on a two-dimensional platform such as a planar Josephson junction is practically constrained by a fixed direction of applied magnetic field. In addition, the detrimental effects of the magnetic field on proximity-induced superconductivity in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures is an outstanding problem for the realization of topological superconductivity. Here we show that these problems can be solved in a planar Josephson junction coupled to a skyrmion crystal, which generates the MBS without the need of any external magnetic field, phase biasing, and Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Using a high-temperature superconductor having $d$-wave pairing symmetry, we confirm that our planar junction can support the MBS at high temperatures. We propose protocols for performing non-trivial fusion, exchange and non-Abelian braiding of multiple MBS in our field-free platforms. The proposed geometries and MBS movement protocols open a path towards successful experimental detection of the MBS via confirmation of their non-Abelian statistics.

Title: The Luttinger Count is the Homotopy not the Physical Charge: Generalized Anomalies Characterize Non-Fermi Liquids
Authors: Gabriele La Nave, Jinchao Zhao, Philip W. Phillips
Abstract: We show that the Luttinger-Ward functional can be formulated as an operator insertion in the path integral and hence can be thought of as a generalized symmetry. The key result is that the associated charge, always quantized, defines the homotopy, not the physical charge. The disconnect between the two arises from divergences in the functional or equivalently zeros of the single-particle Green function. Such divergences produce an anomaly of the triangle-diagram type. As a result of this anomaly, we are able to account for the various deviations\cite{rosch,dave,altshuler,osborne,l3,l5} of the Luttinger count from the particle density. As a consequence, non-Fermi liquids can be classified generally by the well known anomaly structures in particle physics. Charges descending from generalized symmetries, as in the divergence of the Luttinger-Ward functional, are inherently non-local, their key experimental signature.

Title: Intra-unit-cell singlet pairing mediated by altermagnetic fluctuations
Authors: Yi-Ming Wu, Yuxuan Wang, Rafael M. Fernandes
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting instabilities induced by altermagnetic fluctuations. Because of the non-trivial sublattice structure of the altermagnetic order, shorter-range and longer-range fluctuations favor qualitatively different types of pairing states. Specifically, while the latter stabilize a standard spin-triplet $p$-wave state, just like ferromagnetic fluctuations, the former leads to intra-unit-cell pairing, in which the Cooper pairs are formed by electrons from different sublattices. The symmetry of the intra-unit-cell gap function can be not only $p$-wave, but also spin-singlet $s$-wave and $d$-wave, depending on the shape of the Fermi surface. We also show that coexistence with altermagnetic order promotes intrinsic non-trivial topology, such as protected Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces and higher-order topological superconductivity. Our work establishes the key role played by sublattice degrees of freedom in altermagnetic-fluctuation mediated interactions.

Title: Substrate pre-sputtering for layer-by-layer van der Waals epitaxy of 2D materials
Authors: A. Rajan, M. Ramirez, N. Kushwaha, S. Buchberger, M. McLaren, P.D.C. King
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal chalcogenides, with their atomically layered structure, favourable electronic and mechanical properties, and often strong spin-orbit coupling, are ideal systems for fundamental studies and for applications ranging from spintronics to optoelectronics. Their bottom-up synthesis via epitaxial techniques such as molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) has, however, proved challenging. Here, we develop a simple substrate pre-treatment process utilising exposure to a low-energy noble gas plasma. We show how this dramatically enhances nucleation of an MBE-grown epilayer atop, and through this, realise a true layer-by-layer growth mode. We further demonstrate the possibility of tuning the resulting growth dynamics via control of the species and dose of the plasma exposure.

Title: Om-Theory of Macroscopic Electromagnetism: Greener Vibes for Isotropy-Broken Media
Authors: Maxim Durach
Abstract: The applicability ranges of macroscopic and microscopic electromagnetisms are opposite. While microscopic electromagnetism deals with point sources, singular fields, and discrete atomistic materials, macroscopic electromagnetism concerns smooth average distributions of sources, fields, and homogenized effective metamaterials. Greens function method - GFM - involves finding fields of point sources and applying superposition principle to find fields of distributed sources. When utilized to solve microscopic problems GFM is perfectly within the applicability range. Extension of GFM to simple macroscopic problems is convenient, but not fully logically sound, since point sources and singular fields are technically not a subject of macroscopic electromagnetism. This explains the difficulty of both finding the Greens functions and applying superposition principle in complex isotropy-broken media, which are very different from microscopic environments. In this manuscript, we lay out a path to solution of macroscopic Maxwells equations for distributed sources bypassing GFM, by introducing inverse approach and a method based on Om-potential which we describe here. To the researchers of electromagnetism this provides access to powerful analytical tools and a broad new space of solutions for Maxwells equations.

Title: Substrate matters: Coupled phonon modes of a spherical particle on a substrate probed with EELS
Authors: Ka Yin Lee, Elliot K. Beutler, Tifany Q. Crisolo, David J. Masiello, Maureen J. Lagos
Abstract: Using vibrational electron energy loss spectroscopy (vib-EELS) combined with numerical modeling, we investigate the physical mechanisms governing the phonon coupling between a spherical particle sustaining multipolar surface phonon modes and an underlying thin film. Depending upon their dielectric composition, a variety of hybrid phonon modes arise in the EEL spectrum due to the interaction between polarization charges in the particle and film. Mirror charge effects and phonon mode hybridization are the active mechanisms acting on dielectric and metallic-type films, respectively. Processes beyond dipole-dipole interactions are required to describe the sphere-film coupling.

Title: Enhanced strain rate sensitivity due to platelet linear complexions in Al-Cu
Authors: Pulkit Garg, Daniel S. Gianola, Timothy J. Rupert
Abstract: Platelet array linear complexions have been predicted in Al-Cu, with notable features being dislocation faceting and climb into the precipitate, both of which should impact plasticity. In this study, we examine the strain rate dependence of strength for platelet linear complexions using atomistic simulations, with classical precipitate strengthening through particle cutting and particle bowing used as baseline comparisons. Dislocation segments with edge character must climb down from the platelet structures prior to the commencement of glide, introducing a significant time-dependent barrier to plastic deformation. Consequently, the strain rate sensitivity of strength for the platelet linear complexions system was found to be up to five times higher than that of classical precipitation strengthening mechanisms.

Title: Direct Joule-Heated Non-Equilibrium Synthesis Enables High Performing Thermoelectrics

V. Maheswar Repaka, David Scanlon, Kanishka Biswas, Yee Kan Koh, Kedar Hippalgaonkar
Abstract: High-throughput synthesis of bulk inorganic materials is crucial for accelerating functional materials discovery but is hindered by slow, energy-intensive solid-state methods. We introduce Direct Joule-Heated Synthesis (DJS), a rapid, single-step and scalable solid-state synthesis technique achieving a $10^5$-fold speedup and 20,000x energy efficiency improvement over conventional synthesis. DJS enables the synthesis of dense, bulk chalcogenides ($\mathrm{Bi_{0.5}Sb_{1.5}Te_3}$, $\mathrm{AgSbTe_2}$), achieving a zT of 2.3 at 573 K in optimally Cd/Se co-doped $\mathrm{AgSbTe_2}$, one of the highest for polycrystalline materials at this temperature. DJS enables optimal co-doping and rapid, non-equilibrium solidification, producing lamellar microstructures, interfacial regions, and cation-ordered nanodomains that scatter all-scale phonons, achieving ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (~0.2 $W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 573 K). DJS establishes a new benchmark for scalable and fast synthesis, accelerating functional material discovery.

Title: Interfacial Energy Gradients Drive Coalescence of Supported Nanoparticles
Authors: Cheng-Yu Chen, Duncan Burns, Peter W. Voorhees, Eric A. Stach
Abstract: Understanding and controlling nanoparticle coalescence is crucial for applications ranging from catalysis to nanodevice fabrication, yet the behavior of nanoparticles on dynamically evolving, heterogeneous substrates remains poorly understood. Here, we employ in situ transmission electron microscopy to investigate platinum (Pt) nanoparticle dynamics on silicon nitride (SiN$_x$) substrates where localized crystalline silicon (Si) nanodomains are deliberately formed via electron beam irradiation at $800^\circ$C. We observe that Pt nanoparticles in contact with these Si pads transform into a more mobile platinum silicide (Pt$_3$Si) phase. Strikingly, these Pt$_3$Si nanoparticles exhibit pronounced directional migration away from the Si pads, driven by interfacial energy gradients, rather than undergoing stochastic Brownian motion. This directed movement fundamentally dictates coalescence pathways, leading to either enhanced sintering when particles are channeled together or inhibited coalescence when Si pads act as repulsive barriers. Our findings reveal that local substrate chemistry and the resulting interfacial energy landscapes can dominate over initial particle size or proximity in controlling solid-state nanoparticle migration and assembly. This work provides insights into how substrate heterogeneity can be used to direct nanoparticle behavior, challenging conventional coalescence models and offering pathways for the rational design of supported nanomaterials.

Title: Chern insulators in two and three dimensions: A global perspective
Authors: Jason G. Kattan, J. E. Sipe
Abstract: We introduce a second-quantized continuum model for bulk Chern insulators wherein the Hamiltonian features a static magnetic field that has the periodicity of the crystal's lattice and spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry even in the electronic ground state at zero temperature. The topological invariants characterizing the bulk band structure of Chern insulators in both two and three dimensions are written entirely in terms of the quantities in this Hamiltonian and are globally defined across the Brillouin zone. We discuss the symmetry properties of these systems, including the discrete symmetries in the "tenfold way" classification scheme, inversion symmetry, and gauge transformations. We also study the long-wavelength response of Chern insulators to both static and finite-frequency electric fields in the linear regime, using an expression for the conductivity tensor that was derived in recent work. And we discuss how our global expressions for the Chern invariants are modified when electron spin is considered.

Title: Neural Object Detection for 4D STEM: High-Throughput Sub-Pixel Electron Diffraction Pattern Recognition
Authors: Arda Genc, Ravit Silverstein
Abstract: High-throughput analysis of multidimensional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) datasets remains a significant challenge, limiting the broader impact on strategic materials research. Conventional workflows typically involve sequential, modular processing steps that necessitate extensive manual intervention and offline parameter tuning. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end post-processing framework for large-scale four-dimensional scanning TEM (4D-STEM) datasets, built around a highly efficient neural network-based object detection model. Central to our method is a sub-pixel accurate object center localization algorithm, which serves as the foundation for high-precision and high-throughput analysis of electron diffraction patterns. We demonstrate a strain measurement precision of 5x$10^{-4}$, quantified by the standard deviation of strain values within the strain-free Si substrate of a Si/SiGe multilayer TEM sample. Furthermore, by implementing an asynchronous, non-blocking object detection workflow, we achieve speeds exceeding 100 frames per second (fps), substantially accelerating the crystallographic phase identification and strain mapping in complex multiphase metallic alloys.

Title: Topology induced modifications in the critical behavior of the Yaldram Khan catalytic reaction model
Authors: Paulo F. Gomes, Henrique A. Fernandes, Roberto da Silva
Abstract: In this work, we investigated how the use of complex networks as catalytic surfaces can affect the phase diagram of the Yaldram-Khan model, as well as how the order of the phase transitions present in the seminal work behaves when the randomness is added to the model. The study was conducted by taking into consideration two well-known random networks, the Erdos-Renyi network (ERN), with its long-range randomness, and the random geometric graph (RGG), with its spatially constrained randomness. We perform extensive steady-state Monte Carlo simulations assuming the NO dissociation rate is equal to 1 and show the behavior of the reactive window as function of the average degree of the networks. Our results also show that, different from the ERN, which preserves the nature of the phase transitions of the original model for all considered average degrees, the RGG seems to have two second-order phase transitions for small values of average degree.

Title: It's about time: a thermodynamic information criterion (TIC)
Authors: Brendan Lucas, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 05-06
Abstract: Useful chemical processes often involve a desired steady state probability distribution, equilibrium or not, from which product is extracted. Given many different ways to attain the same steady state, which candidate "loses" the least in terms of time and energy? A scalar thermodynamic information criterion (TIC), inspired by AIC, assigns lower values to chemical processes with less estimated "loss" to generate the same desired steady state. As an element of thermodynamic machine learning, TIC naturally extends statistical objective optimization into the realm of chemical physics.

Title: Investigation of the Paramagnetic State of the Kagome Kondo Lattice Compound YbV$_6$Sn$_6$: a $^{51}$V Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Study
Authors: S. Park, H. Sakai, S. Hosoi, S. M. Thomas, S. Kambe, Y. Tokunaga, A. P. Dioguardi, J. D. Thompson, F. Ronning, M. Kimata, T. Furukawa, T. Sasaki, E. D. Bauer, M. Hirata
Abstract: YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is a recently discovered kagome-lattice metal that orders at $T_{\rm N}\approx0.4$~K. Its layered structure combines a triangular Kondo lattice of Yb$^{3+}$ ions with vanadium-based kagome planes, which may host an interplay between strong correlations and band topology. We report a $^{51}$V nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of the paramagnetic state of YbV$_6$Sn$_6$. Detailed field-angular dependence of single-crystal NMR spectra determined the principal-axis directions of the electric field gradient tensor at the $^{51}$V sites, as well as their nuclear quadrupole frequency, $\nu_{\rm Q}$, and asymmetry parameter, $\eta$. The Knight shift, $K$, was measured for different field orientations, and the analysis of $K$ against magnetic susceptibility to extract anisotropic hyperfine couplings. Accurate spectral assignments further enabled measurements of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate, $1/T_1$, for both in-plane and out-of-plane field directions. The temperature dependence of $1/T_1$ shows that out-of-plane spin fluctuations are suppressed below $\sim$20~K, whereas in-plane fluctuations are markedly enhanced, which might be understood by thermal depopulation of the low-lying crystalline electric field excited state. The notable anisotropy in $1/T_1$ indicates that the paramagnetic state of YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is strongly affected by in-plane spin dynamics.

Title: Nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with normal state field trainability in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5
Authors: Jun Ge, Xiaoqi Liu, Pinyuan Wang, Haowen Pang, Qiangwei Yin, Hechang Lei, Ziqiang Wang, Jian Wang
Abstract: Determining time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and chirality in the superconducting state and its relation to the symmetry and topology in the normal state are important issues in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero applied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in both flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such spontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We find that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample heating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with the expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on applying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave (CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above the superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic asymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This magnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting transition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic directionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry breaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the loop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our observations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS breaking in kagome superconductors.

Title: Correlating Superconducting Qubit Performance Losses to Sidewall Near-Field Scattering via Terahertz Nanophotonics
Authors: Richard H. J. Kim, Samuel J. Haeuser, Joong-Mok Park, Randall K. Chan, Jin-Su Oh, Thomas Koschny, Lin Zhou, Matthew J. Kramer, Akshay A. Murthy, Mustafa Bal, Francesco Crisa, Sabrina Garattoni, Shaojiang Zhu, Andrei Lunin, David Olaya, Peter Hopkins, Alex Romanenko, Anna Grassellino, Jigang Wang
Abstract: Elucidating dielectric losses, structural heterogeneity, and interface imperfections is critical for improving coherence in superconducting qubits. However, most diagnostics rely on destructive electron microscopy or low-throughput millikelvin quantum measurements. Here, we demonstrate noninvasive terahertz (THz) nano-imaging/-spectroscopy of encapsulated niobium transmon qubits, revealing sidewall near-field scattering that correlates with qubit coherence. We further employ a THz hyperspectral line scan to probe dielectric responses and field participation at Al junction interfaces. These findings highlight the promise of THz near-field methods as a high-throughput proxy characterization tool for guiding material selection and optimizing processing protocols to improve qubit and quantum circuit performance.

Title: Ultrafast Orbital-Selective Photodoping Melts Charge Order in Overdoped Bi-based Cuprates
Authors: Xinyi Jiang, Qizhi Li, Qingzheng Qiu, Li Yue, Junhan Huang, Yiwen Chen, Byungjune Lee, Hyeongi Choi, Xingjiang Zhou, Tao Dong, Nanlin Wang, Hoyoung Jang, Yingying Peng
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in cuprates remains one of the enduring puzzles of condensed matter physics, with charge order (CO) playing a central yet elusive role, particularly in the overdoped regime. Here, we employ time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant X-ray scattering at a free-electron laser to probe the transient electronic density of states and ultrafast CO dynamics in overdoped (Bi,Pb)$_{2.12}$Sr$_{1.88}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$. We reveal a striking pump laser wavelength dependence - the 800 nm light fails to suppress CO, whereas the 400 nm light effectively melts it. This behavior originates from the fact that 400 nm photons can promote electrons from the Zhang-Rice singlet band to the upper Hubbard band or apical oxygen states, while 800 nm photons lack the energy to excite electrons across the charge-transfer gap. The CO recovery time ($\sim$3 ps) matches that of the underdoped cuprates, indicating universal electronic instability in the phase diagram. Additionally, melting overdoped CO requires an order-of-magnitude higher fluence highlighting the role of lattice interactions. Our findings demonstrate orbital-selective photodoping and provide a route to ultrafast control of emergent quantum phases in correlated materials.

Title: Derivation of a non-stoichiometric 1/1 quasicrystal approximant from a stoichiometric 2/1 quasicrystal approximant and maximization of magnetocaloric effect
Authors: Farid Labib, Hiroyuki Takakura, Asuka Ishikawa, Takenori Fujii, Ryuji Tamura
Abstract: The present research introduces a novel strategy for tuning magnetic properties by overcoming the compositional limitation of stoichiometric intermetallic compounds via extension of their stability into a new dimension within valence electron-per-atom (e/a) parameter space. Focusing on approximant crystals (ACs), a "double hetero-valent elemental substitution" is employed in a stoichiometric Ga-Pt-Gd 2/1 AC whereby e/a is lowered from 1.92 to 1.60. Through this approach a new family of stable Ga-based Tsai-type 1/1 ACs with exceptionally wide composition stability within e/a space is derived. Remarkably, magnetic ground state is altered from initially spin-glass to ferromagnetic (FM) with second order phase transition and mean-field-like critical behavior. More importantly, through this strategy, the isothermal magnetic entropy change enhanced significantly and reached a maximum value of -8.7 J/K mol-Gd under a 5 T magnetic field change, even comparable to leading rare-earth magnetocaloric materials including RCo2 phases. These findings demonstrate the high potential of a double hetero-valent elemental substitution for tailoring magnetic properties and magnetocaloric response in stoichiometric compounds, offering a new pathway for designing high-performance magnetic refrigeration materials even beyond the quasicrystals and ACs.

Title: Buried unstrained Ge channels: a lattice-matched platform for quantum technology
Authors: Davide Costa, Karina Hudson, Patrick Del Vecchio, Lucas E. A. Stehouwer, Alberto Tosato, Davide Degli Esposti, Mario Lodari, Stefano Bosco, Giordano Scappucci
Abstract: Ge and Si strained quantum wells have enabled the most advanced spin-qubit quantum processors, but they are deposited on defective, metamorphic SiGe substrates, which may impact device performance and scaling. Here we introduce an alternative platform, based on a heterojunction between unstrained Ge and a strained SiGe barrier, which is lattice-matched to a Ge substrate. In a structure with a 52-nm-thick strained SiGe barrier, we demonstrate a low-disorder two-dimensional hole gas with a high-mobility of 1.33$\times$10$^5$ cm$^2$/Vs and a low percolation density of 1.4(1)$\times$10$^1$$^0$ cm$^-$$^2$. Quantum transport measurements show that confined holes have a strong density-dependent in-plane effective mass and out-of-plane $g$-factor, pointing to a significant heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in agreement with theory. The expected strong spin-orbit interaction, possibility of isotopic purification, and ability to host superconducting pairing correlations make this platform appealing for fast quantum hardware and hybrid quantum systems.

Title: Stochastic thermodynamics for classical non-Markov jump processes
Authors: Kiyoshi Kanazawa, Andreas Dechant
Abstract: Stochastic thermodynamics investigates energetic/entropic bounds in small systems, such as biomolecular motors, chemical-reaction networks, and quantum nano-devices. Foundational results, including the second law and thermodynamic uncertainty relations, predominantly rely on the Markov assumption -- neglecting history dependence of physical systems. However, while physicists recognise that the Markov assumption is dubious in real experimental setups, extending stochastic thermodynamics to general non-Markov systems has proven challenging due to their mathematical complexity. Here we establish the general theory of stochastic thermodynamics for arbitrary classical non-Markov jump processes. We introduce a key technique, called the {\it Fourier embedding}, which converts any non-Markov jump process into the Markov field dynamics of auxiliary Fourier modes. This approach yields the necessary and sufficient condition for time-reversal symmetry and enables the derivation of the second law for our non-Markov systems. Our framework accommodates diverse non-Markovian dynamics in realistic experimental setups and offers a guiding principle for physics-informed modelling of history-dependent fluctuations.

Title: Numerical Investigation of Stub Length Influence on Dispersion Relations and Parity Effect in Aharonov-Bohm Rings
Authors: Souvik Ghosh
Abstract: Aharonov-Bohm (AB) rings with side-attached stubs are model systems for quantum-interference studies in mesoscopic physics. The geometry of such systems, particularly the ratio of stub length ($v$) to ring circumference ($u$), can significantly alter their electronic states. In this work, we solve Deo's transcendental mode-condition equation (Eq. 2.15 from Deo, 2021 [Deo2021]) numerically -- using Python's NumPy and SciPy libraries -- for ring-stub geometries with $v/u = 0.200, 0.205,$ and $0.210$ to generate dispersion relations ($ku$ vs. $\Phi/\Phi_{0}$) and the underlying function $\text{Re}(1/T)$. We find that changing $v/u$ shifts several of the six lowest calculated dispersion branches, with $\Delta(ku)$ up to approximately $0.34$ for the 6th branch at $\Phi=0$ when comparing $v/u=0.200$ and $v/u=0.210$. This also alters gap widths. Notably, for $v/u=0.205$ and $v/u=0.210$, the 5th and 6th consecutive calculated modes both exhibit paramagnetic slopes near zero Aharonov-Bohm flux, indicating the parity breakdown initiates at or below $v/u=0.205$. This directly demonstrates a breakdown of the simple alternating parity effect predicted by Deo (2021) [Deo2021]. These results highlight the sensitivity of mesoscopic ring spectra to fine-tuning of stub length, with potential implications for experimental control of persistent currents, as further illustrated by calculations of the net current.

Title: Time Glasses: Symmetry Broken Chaotic Phase with a Finite Gap
Authors: Taiki Haga
Abstract: We introduce the time glass, a non-periodic analogue of the discrete time crystal that arises in periodically driven dissipative quantum many-body systems. This phase is defined by two key features: (i) spatial long-range order arising from the spontaneous breaking of an internal symmetry, and (ii) temporally chaotic oscillations of the order parameter, whose lifetime diverges with system size. To characterize the time glass phase, we focus on the spectral gap of the one-cycle (Floquet) Liouvillian, which determines the decay rate of the slowest relaxation mode. Numerical studies of periodically driven dissipative Ising models show that, in the time glass phase, the Liouvillian gap remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, in contrast to time crystals where the gap closes exponentially with system size. We further demonstrate that the Liouvillian gap converges to the decay rate of the order-parameter autocorrelation derived from the classical (mean-field) dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. This result establishes a direct correspondence between microscopic spectral features and emergent macroscopic dynamics in driven dissipative quantum systems. At first glance, the existence of a nonzero Liouvillian gap appears incompatible with the presence of indefinitely persistent chaotic oscillations. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that the quantum Rényi divergence between a localized coherent initial state and the highly delocalized steady state grows unboundedly with system size. This divergence allows long-lived transients to persist even in the presence of a finite Liouvillian gap.

Abstract: We generated trinitreno-s-heptazine, a small molecule featuring three nitrene centers, by tip-induced chemistry from the precursor 2,5,8-triazido-s-heptazine on bilayer NaCl on Au(111). The precursor's azide groups were dissociated to form mono-, di- and trinitreno-s-heptazine, yielding molecules with one to three nitrene centers. The precursor and its products are characterized by atomic force microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy. Broken-symmetry DFT and configuration interaction calculations of inter- and intra-nitrene exchange couplings suggest a ferromagnetic coupling of the S = 1 nitrene centers, resulting in a high-spin septet ground state for neutral trinitreno-s-heptazine in the gas phase. On bilayer NaCl on Au(111), the combined results of experiments and theory suggest trinitreno-s-heptazine to be an anion with a sextet ground state.

Title: Lattice Mismatch Driven In Plane Strain Engineering for Enhanced Upper Critical Fields in Mo2N Superconducting Thin Films
Authors: Aditya Singh, Divya Rawat, Victor Hjort, Abhisek Mishra, Arnaud le Febvrier, Subhankar Bedanta, Per Eklund, Ajay Soni
Abstract: Transition metal nitrides are a fascinating class of hard coating material that provide an excellent platform for investigating superconductivity and fundamental electron phonon interactions. In this work the structural morphological and superconducting properties have been studied for Mo2N thin films deposited via direct current magnetron sputtering on cplane Al2O3 and MgO substrates to elucidate the effect of internal strain on superconducting properties. High resolution X Ray diffraction and time of flight elastic recoil detection analysis confirms the growth of single phase Mo2N thin films exhibiting epitaxial growth with twin domain structure. Low temperature electrical transport measurements reveal superconducting transitions at 5.2 K and 5.6 K with corresponding upper critical fields of 5 T and 7 T for the films deposited on Al2O3 and MgO, respectively. These results indicate strong type II superconductivity and the observed differences in superconducting properties are attributed to substrate induced strain which leads to higher e ph coupling for the film on MgO substrate. These findings highlight the tunability of superconducting properties in Mo2N films through strategic substrate selection.

Title: Revisiting cofactor conditions: Elimination of transition layers in compound domains
Authors: Mohd Tahseen, Vivekanand Dabade
Abstract: This paper investigates the conditions necessary for the elimination of transition layers at interfaces involving compound domains, extending the classical framework of cofactor conditions. Although cofactor conditions enable stress-free phase boundaries between Type I/II domains and austenite, their applicability to compound domains has remained limited. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework to characterize all compatible interfaces, highlighting the fundamental importance of the commutation property among martensitic variants. By establishing necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions, referred to as extreme compatibility conditions, we demonstrate the simultaneous elimination of transition layers at phase interfaces for both Type I/II and compound laminates, across all volume fractions of the martensitic variants. We also investigate the possibility of achieving supercompatibility in non-conventional twins, recently observed in the NiMnGa system. The focus of our work is on cubic-to-orthorhombic and cubic-to-monoclinic~II phase transformations, for which the extreme compatibility conditions are explicitly derived and systematically analyzed. The theory predicts novel zero-elastic-energy microstructures, including an increased number of triple clusters, spearhead-shaped martensitic nuclei, stress-free inclusions of austenite within martensite, and distinctive four-fold martensitic clusters. This significantly expands the possible modes of forming stress-free interfaces between phases and reveals new energy-minimizing microstructures that can facilitate the nucleation of martensite within austenite and vice versa. These configurations highlight significant enhancements in transformation reversibility and material durability, guiding the rational design of next-generation shape memory alloys with optimized functional properties.

Title: Impact of border defects on the magnetic flux penetration in superconducting films
Authors: Alejandro V. Silhanek, Lu Jiang, Cun Xue, Benoît Vanderheyden
Abstract: Defects in superconducting systems are ubiquitous and nearly unavoidable. They can vary in nature, geometry, and size, ranging from microscopic-size defects such as dislocations, grain boundaries, twin planes, and oxygen vacancies, to macroscopic-size defects such as segregations, indentations, contamination, cracks, or voids. Irrespective of their type, defects perturb the otherwise laminar flow of electric current, forcing it to deviate from its path. In the best-case scenario, the associated perturbation can be damped within a distance of the order of the size of the defect if the rigidity of the superconducting state, characterized by the creep exponent $n$, is low. In most cases, however, this perturbation spans macroscopic distances covering the entire superconducting sample and thus dramatically influences the response of the system. In this work, we review the current state of theoretical understanding and experimental evidence on the modification of magnetic flux patterns in superconductors by border defects, including the influence of their geometry, temperature, and applied magnetic field. We scrutinize and contrast the picture emerging from a continuous media standpoint, i.e. ignoring the granularity imposed by the vortex quantization, with that provided by a phenomenological approach dictated by the vortex dynamics. In addition, we discuss the influence of border indentations on the nucleation of thermomagnetic instabilities. Assessing the impact of surface and border defects is of utmost importance for all superconducting technologies, including superconducting resonators, superconducting single-photon detectors, superconducting radio-frequency cavities and accelerators, superconducting cables, superconducting metamaterials, superconducting diodes, and many others.

Title: Kondo effect under arbitrary spin-momentum locking
Authors: Kinari Goto, Yusuke Nishida
Abstract: The Kondo effect originates from the spin exchange scattering of itinerant electrons with a localized magnetic impurity. Here, we consider generalization of Weyl-type electrons with their spin locked on a spherical Fermi surface in an arbitrary way and study how such spin-momentum locking affects the Kondo effect. After introducing a suitable model Hamiltonian, a simple formula for the Kondo temperature is derived with the second-order perturbation theory, which proves to depend only on the spin averaged over the Fermi surface. In particular, the Kondo temperature is unaffected as long as the average spin vanishes, but decreases as the average spin increases in its magnitude, and eventually vanishes when the spin is completely polarized on the Fermi surface, illuminating the role of spin-momentum locking in the Kondo effect.

Title: Tunable spin-phonon polarons in a chiral molecular qubit framework
Authors: Aimei Zhou, Ruihao Bi, Zhenghan Zhang, Luming Yang, Xudong Tian, Denan Li, Mingshu Tan, Weibin Ni, Haozhou Sun, Jinkun Guo, Xinxing Zhao, Zhifu Shi, Wei Tong, Zhitao Zhang, Jin-Hu Dou, Feng Jin, Shi Liu, Mircea Dinca, Tijana Rajh, Jian Li, Wenjie Dou, Lei Sun
Abstract: Chiral structures that produce asymmetric spin-phonon coupling can theoretically generate spin-phonon polarons -- quasiparticles exhibiting non-degenerate spin states with phonon displacements. However, direct experimental evidence has been lacking. Using a chiral molecular qubit framework embedding stable semiquinone-like radicals, we report spin dynamic signatures that clearly indicate the formation of spin-phonon polarons for the first time. Our non-adiabatic model reveals that these quasiparticles introduce an active spin relaxation channel when polaron reorganization energy approaches Zeeman splitting. This new channel manifests as anomalous, temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems. Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum information technologies without compromising coherence.

Title: Strongly enhanced topological quantum phases in dual-surface AlO$_x$-encapsulated MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
Authors: Zichen Lian, Yongqian Wang, Yongchao Wang, Liangcai Xu, Jinsong Zhang, Chang Liu, Yayu Wang
Abstract: The topological quantum phases in antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ hold promise for next-generation spintronics, but their experimental realization has been constrained by challenges in preparing high-quality devices. In this work, we report a new wax-assisted exfoliation and transfer method that enables the fabrication of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ heterostructures with both surfaces encapsulated by AlO$_x$. This strategy strongly enhances the topological quantum phases in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ flakes. We observe the robust axion insulator state in even-layer device with wide zero Hall plateau and high longitudinal resistivity, and the quantum anomalous Hall effect in odd-layer device with large hysteresis and sharp plateau transition. These results demonstrate that the combination of wax exfoliation and AlO$_x$ encapsulation provides great potentials for exploring novel topological quantum phenomena and potential applications in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and other two-dimensional materials.

Title: Dynamics of Wound Closure in Living Nematic Epithelia
Authors: Henry Andralojc, Jake Turley, Helen Weavers, Paul Martin, Isaac V. Chenchiah, Rachel R. Bennett, Tanniemola B. Liverpool
Abstract: We study theoretically the closure of a wound in a layer of epithelial cells in a living tissue after damage. Our analysis is informed by our recent experiments observing re-epithelialisation in vivo of Drosophila pupae. On time and length-scales such that the evolution of the epithelial tissue near the wound is well captured by that of a 2D active fluid with local nematic order, we consider the free-surface problem of a hole in a bounded region of tissue, and study the role that active stresses far from the hole play in the closure of the hole. For parallel anchored nematic order at the wound boundary (as we observe in our experiments), we find that closure is accelerated when the active stresses are contractile and slowed down when the stresses are extensile. Parallel anchoring also leads to the appearance of topological defects which annihilate upon wound closure.

Title: Identification of the high-pressure phases of alpha-SnWO4 combining x-ray diffraction and crystal structure prediction
Authors: Daniel Diaz-Anichtchenko, Jordi Ibáñez, Pablo Botella, Robert Oliva, Alexei Kuzmin, Li Wang, Yuwei Li, Alfonso Muñoz, Frederico Alabarse, Daniel Errandonea
Abstract: We have characterized the high-pressure behavior of alpha-SnWO4. The compound has been studied up to 30 GPa using a diamond-anvil cell and synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction. We report evidence of two structural phase transitions in the pressure range covered in our study, and we propose a crystal structure for the two high-pressure phases. The first one, observed around 12.9 GPa, has been obtained combining indexation using DICVOL and density-functional theory calculations. The second high-pressure phase, observed around 17.5 GPa, has been determined by using the CALYPSO code, the prediction of which was supported by a Le Bail fit to the experimental X-ray diffraction patterns. The proposed structural sequence involves two successive collapses of the unit-cell volume and an increase in the coordination number of Sn and W atoms. The room-temperature equations of state, the principal axes of compression and their compressibility, the elastic constants, and the elastic moduli are reported for {\alpha}-SnWO4 and for the two high-pressure phases.

Abstract: Optical generation of transverse coherent phonons by femtosecond light pulses is appealing for high-speed sub-THz active control of material properties. Lead-free double perovskite semiconductors, such as Cs2AgBiBr6, attract particular interest due to their cubic to tetragonal phase transition below room temperature and strong polaron effects from carrier-lattice coupling. Here, we reveal that the anisotropic photostriction in halide perovskites with tetragonal crystal structure represents an efficient non-thermal tool for generating transverse coherent phonons. In particular, we demonstrate that along with compressive strain, optical generation of photoexcited carriers leads to strong shear strain in Cs2AgBiBr6 below the phase transition temperature of 122 K. Using time-domain Brillouin spectroscopy, we observe coherent transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons with comparable amplitudes in the tetragonal phase, while in the cubic phase only longitudinal phonons are generated. The polarization of the photoinduced transverse phonons is dictated by the projection of the c-axis on the surface plane, which leads to a prominent anisotropic polarization response in the detection. The generated strain pulses correspond to transverse acoustic soft eigenmodes with a strong temperature dependence of dispersion, which provides an additional degree of freedom for active hypersonic control.

Title: Opposite pressure effects on magnetic phase transitions in NiBr2
Authors: Parvez Ahmed Qureshi, Krishna Kumar Pokhrel, Jiri Prchal, Subhasmita Ray, Sergiu Arapan, Karel Carva, Vladimir Sechovsky, Jiri Pospisil
Abstract: NiBr2, similar to NiI2, exhibits the onset of collinear antiferromagnetism at a subroom temperature and, with further cooling, undergoes a transition to a helimagnetic ordering associated with multiferroic behavior. This work investigates the hydrostatic pressure effects on magnetic phase transitions in NiBr2. We measured isobaric temperature dependencies of AC magnetic susceptibility at various pressures up to 3 GPa. The experimental data are interpreted in conjunction with the results of theoretical calculations focused on pressure influence on the hierarchy of exchange interactions. Contrary to the NiI2 case, the phase transition to helimagnetism rapidly shifts to lower temperatures with increasing pressure. Similar to the NiI2, the Neel temperature increases with pressure. The rate of increase accelerates when the helimagnetic phase is suppressed by pressure. The ab initio calculations link these contrasting trends to pressure-enhanced magnetic exchange interactions. Similarly to the NiI2 case, the stabilization of the collinear AFM phase is driven primarily by the second-nearest interlayer coupling (j2'). Furthermore, the ratio of in-plane interactions makes helimagnetic order in NiBr2 much more volatile, which permits its suppression with already small pressures. These findings highlight the principal role of interlayer interactions in the distinct response of NiBr2 and NiI2 magnetic phases to external pressure.

Title: Pressure-Induced Decomposition of beta-SnWO4
Authors: Sergio Ferrari, Daniel Diaz-Anichtchenko, Pablo Botella, Jordi Ibáñez, Robert Oliva, Alexei Kuzmin, Alfonso Muñoz, Frederico Alabarse, Daniel Errandonea
Abstract: This study reports the decomposition of beta-SnWO4 into Sn, SnO2, and WO3 induced by static compression. We performed high-pressure synchrotron powder angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction measurements and found that decomposition occurs at a pressure of 13.97(5) GPa and is irreversible. This result contradicts a previous study that, based on density-functional theory calculations and crystal-chemistry arguments, predicted a pressure-driven transition from beta-SnWO4 to alpha-SnWO4. Our analysis indicates that the observed decomposition is unrelated to mechanical or dynamic instabilities. Instead, it likely stems from frustration of the beta-alpha transition, as this transformation requires a change in Sn coordination from octahedral to tetrahedral. The assessment of how pressure influences the volume of the unit cell provided an accurate determination of the room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state for beta-SnWO4. Furthermore, the elastic constants and moduli, as well as the pressure dependence of Raman and infrared modes of beta-SnWO4, were derived from density-functional theory calculations. Several phonon modes exhibited softening, and three cases of phonon anti-crossing were observed.

Title: Gate-tunable spectrum and charge dispersion mitigation in a graphene superconducting qubit
Authors: Nicolas Aparicio, Simon Messelot, Edgar Bonet-Orozco, Eric Eyraud, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Johann Coraux, Julien Renard
Abstract: Controlling the energy spectrum of quantum-coherent superconducting circuits, i.e. the energies of excited states, the circuit anharmonicity and the states' charge dispersion, is essential for designing performant qubits. This control is usually achieved by adjusting the circuit's geometry. In-situ control is traditionally obtained via an external magnetic field, in the case of tunnel Josephson junctions. More recently, semiconductor-weak-links-based Josephson junctions have emerged as an alternative building block with the advantage of tunability via the electric-field effect. Gate-tunable Josephson junctions have been succesfully integrated in superconducting circuits using for instance semiconducting nanowires or two-dimensional electron gases. In this work we demonstrate, in a graphene superconducting circuit, a large gate-tunability of qubit properties: frequency, anharmonicity and charge dispersion. We rationalize these features using a model considering the transmission of Cooper pairs through Andreev bound states. Noticeably, we show that the high transmission of Cooper pairs in such weak link strongly suppresses the charge dispersion. Our work illustrates the potential for graphene-based qubits as versatile building-blocks in advanced quantum circuits.

Title: Field-controlled Electronic Breathing Modes and Transport in Nanoporous Graphene
Authors: Alan Anaya, Mads Brandbyge
Abstract: Nanoporous graphene (NPG) has been fabricated by on-surface-self assembly in the form of arrays of apporx. 1 nm-wide graphene nanoribbons connected via molecular bridges in a two-dimensional crystal lattice. It is predicted that NPG may, despite its molecular structure, work as electron waveguides that display e.g. Talbot wave interference. Here, we demonstrate how the electronic wave guidance may be controlled by the use of electrical fields transverse to the ribbons; at low fields, point injected currents display spatially periodic patterns along the ribbons, while high fields localize the injected current to single ribbons. This behavior constitutes an electronic version of optical breathing modes of Bloch oscillations, providing a simple mechanism for controlling the current patterns down to the molecular scale. The robustness of the self-repeating patterns under disorder demonstrate that the breathing modes of single-ribbon injections offer exciting opportunities for applications in nanoelectronics, molecular sensing, and quantum information processing.

Title: Hole spin qubits in unstrained Germanium layers
Authors: Lorenzo Mauro, Mauricio J. Rodriguez, Esteban A. Rodriguez-Mena, Yann-Michel Niquet
Abstract: Strained germanium heterostructures are one of the most promising material for hole spin qubits but suffer from the strong anisotropy of the gyromagnetic factors that hinders the optimization of the magnetic field orientation. The figures of merit (Rabi frequencies, lifetimes...) can indeed vary by an order of magnitude within a few degrees around the heterostructure plane. We propose to address this issue by confining the holes at the interface of an unstrained, bulk Ge substrate or thick buffer. We model such structures and show that the gyromagnetic anisotropy is indeed considerably reduced. In addition, the Rabi frequencies and quality factors can be significantly improved with respect to strained heterostructures. This extends the operational range of the qubits and shall ease the scale-up to many-qubit systems.

Title: Engineering harmonic emission through spatial modulation in a Kitaev chain
Authors: Nivash R., S. Srinidhi, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay, Amol R. Holkundkar
Abstract: We investigate High-harmonic generation (HHG) in a dimerized Kitaev chain. The dimerization in the model is introduced through a site-dependent modulating potential, determined by a parameter $\lambda \in [-1:1]$. This parameter also determines the strength of the hopping amplitudes and tunes the system's topology. Depending upon the parameter $\lambda$, the HHG emission spectrum can be classified into three segments. The first segment exhibits two plateau structures, with the dominant one resulting from transitions to the chiral partner state, consistent with quasiparticle behavior in the topological superconducting phase. The second segment displays multiple plateaus, where intermediate states enable various transition pathways to higher conduction bands. Finally, the third segment presents broader plateaus, indicative of active interband transitions. In the $\lambda\leq0$ regime, we observe the mid-gap states (MGSs) hybridize with the bulk, suppressing the earlier observed harmonic enhancements. This highlights the key role of the intermediate states, particularly when MGSs are isolated. These results demonstrate that harmonic emission profiles can be selectively controlled through the modulating parameter $\lambda$, offering new prospects for tailoring HHG in topological systems.

Title: Mechanistic Insights into Water-Splitting, Proton Migration, and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in g-C3N4/TiO2-B and Li-F co-doped Heterostructures
Authors: Shuhan Tang, Qi Jiang, Shuang Qiu, Hanyang Ji, Xiaojie Liu
Abstract: Solar water splitting has received a lot of attention due to its high efficiency and clean energy production potential. Herein, based on the band alignment principle, the g-C3N4/TiO2-B(001) heterostructure is strategically designed, then a Li-F co-doping approach is developed and implemented, leading to significant enhancement in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency of the heterostructure systems. The decomposition of water molecule on the surface of heterostructures, the migration and diffusion of proton across the interface, and the hydrogen evolution performance are systematically studied and comprehensively analyzed. The results demonstrate that the heterojunction surface exhibits a relatively low energy barrier for water decomposition, facilitating both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Proton transfer preferentially occurs from the TiO2-B(001) surface to the g-C3N4 surface through the interface. The presence of polar covalent bonds establishes a substantial energy barrier for proton migration from TiO2-B(001) surface to the interface, representing a rate-determining factor in the hydrogen evolution process. The formation of hydrogen bonds significantly reduces the migration energy barrier for protons crossing the interface to the g-C3N4 surface. Hydrogen adsorption free energy analysis show that that the heterojunction surface exhibits optimal proton adsorption and desorption characteristics. The synergistic combination of low water decomposition energy barrier, reduced proton migration energy barriers and exceptional HER performance endows both g-C3N4/TiO2-B(001) heterostructure and Li-F co-doped g-C3N4/TiO2-B(001) heterojunction with remarkbale potential as efficient HER photocatalyst.

Title: Magnetic Dissipation in Ferrofluids
Authors: Lili Vajtai, Norbert Marcel Nemes, Maria del Puerto Morales, Bence Gábor Márkus, László Forró, Ferenc Simon
Abstract: Ferrofluids, composed of magnetic nanoparticles suspended in a non-magnetic carrier liquid, have attracted considerable attention since their discovery in the 1960s. Their combination of liquid and magnetic properties gives rise to complex behaviors and unique functionalities, enabling a wide range of technological applications. Among these is the ability of the magnetic material to be moved by and to absorb heat when exposed to an external magnetic field -- a process that can occur through various dissipation mechanisms depending on the system. A detailed understanding of these mechanisms is crucial for tailoring materials to specific applications. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical principles underlying different energy dissipation processes and propose a coherent framework for their interpretation. Particular attention is devoted to describing the frequency-dependent susceptibility, which is the key parameter to describe dissipation. We demonstrate that dissipation, predicted from magnetometry-based studies, matches well with direct, frequency-dependent calorimetric results, expanding the available frequency range of the characterization. The demonstrating measurements were carried out with a dilute ferrofluid containing magnetite nanoparticles of a mean diameter of 10.6 nm.

Title: Complexity reduction of physical models: an equation-free approach by means of scaling
Authors: Simone Rusconi, Christina Schenk, Razvan Ceuca, Arghir Zarnescu, Elena Akhmatskaya
Abstract: The description of complex physical phenomena often involves sophisticated models that rely on a large number of parameters, with many dimensions and scales. One practical way to simplify that kind of models is to discard some of the parameters, or terms of underlying equations, thus giving rise to reduced models. Here, we propose a general approach to obtaining such reduced models. The method is independent of the model in use, i.e., equation-free, depends only on the interplay between the scales and dimensions involved in the description of the phenomena, and controls over-parametrization. It also quantifies conditions for asymptotic models by providing explicitly computable thresholds on values of parameters that allow for reducing complexity of a model, while preserving essential predictive properties. Although our focus is on complexity reduction, this approach may also help with calibration by mitigating the risks of over-parameterization and instability in parameter estimation. The benefits of this approach are discussed in the context of the classical projectile model.

Title: Hybrid between biologically inspired and quantum inspired many-body states
Authors: Miha Srdinšek, Xavier Waintal
Abstract: Deep neural networks can represent very different sorts of functions, including complex quantum many-body states. Tensor networks can also represent these states, have more structure and are easier to optimize. However, they can be prohibitively costly computationally in two or higher dimensions. Here, we propose a generalization of the perceptron - the perceptrain - which borrows features from the two different formalisms. We construct variational many-body ansatz from a simple network of perceptrains. The network can be thought of as a neural network with a few distinct features inherited from tensor networks. These include efficient local optimization akin to the density matrix renormalization algorithm, instead of optimizing of all the parameters at once; the possibility to dynamically increase the number of parameters during the optimization; the possibility to compress the state to avoid overfitting; and a structure that remains quantum-inspired. We showcase the ansatz using a combination of Variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) and Green Function Monte-Carlo (GFMC) on a $10\times 10$ transverse field quantum Ising model with a long range $1/r^6$ antiferromagnetic interaction. The model corresponds to the Rydberg (cold) atoms platform proposed for quantum annealing. We consistently find a very high relative accuracy for the ground state energy, around $10^{-5}$ for VMC and $10^{-6}$ for GFMC in all regimes of parameters, including in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition. We used very small ranks ($\sim 2-5$) of perceptrains, as opposed to multiples of thousand used in matrix product states. The optimization of the energy was robust with respect to the choice of initial conditions and hyper-parameters, in contrast to a common experience when using neural network wave functions.

Title: Chirality Amplification and Deracemization in Liquid Crystals
Authors: Matthew J. Deutsch, Robin L. B. Selinger, Paul van der Schoot
Abstract: Liquid crystal mesophases of achiral molecules are normally achiral, yet in a few materials they spontaneously deracemize and form right- and left-handed chiral domains. One mechanism that drives deracemization is molecular shape fluctuations between axial chiral conformations, where molecular interactions favor matching chirality and promote helical twist. Cooperative chiral ordering may also play a role in chirality amplification, as when a tiny fraction of chiral dopant drives a nematic phase to become cholesteric. We present a model of cooperative chiral ordering in liquid crystals using Maier-Saupe theory, and predict a phase diagram with a deracemized cholesteric phase as well as racemic nematic and isotropic phases. Our model also predicts chirality amplification in the nematic phase, which may be observed even in materials where the deracemization transition is preempted by a transition to another phase. We compare these results with Monte Carlo simulation studies of the switchable chiral Lebwohl-Lasher model, where each spin switches between right- and left-handed chiral states. Simulation results validate the predicted phase diagram, demonstrate chiral amplification in the racemic nematic phase, and reveal coarsening dynamics in the deracemized phase. Our results suggest that cooperative chiral ordering via molecular shape transitions is a common mechanism in liquid crystals.

Title: How does picosecond structural deformation of (Ba,Sr)TiO$_{3}$ relate to the pyroelectric effect?
Authors: D. Schmidt, J. Wawra, D. Hensel, M.Brede, R. Hühne, P. Gaal
Abstract: The pyroelectric effect in ferroelectric thin films is typically composed of different contributions, which are difficult to disentangle. In addition, clamping to the substrate interface plays an important role. We studied epitaxial (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ thin films grown on NdScO$_3$ to see if time-resolved measurements can shed more light on the complex interaction. In particular, we compare standard measurements of the pyroelectric coefficient by temperature-dependent hysteresis loops to transient deformation measurements on picosecond timescales in the same material. The advantage of the time-resolved approach lies in its increased sensitivity in thin films compared to that of polarization hysteresis measurements. Whereas a fast thermal expansion of the ferroelectric thin film was observed after femtosecond laser excitation of the intermediate SrRuO$_3$ layer, heat diffusion simulations reveal frustration of the thermal expansion, which might be explained with the charge dynamics at the Schottky barrier formed at the SrRuO$_3$/(Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. More studies are required to quantitatively assess the individual contributions to the pyroelectric coefficient of the materials used in our layer architecture.

Title: Ultrafast magneto-lattice dynamics in two-dimensional CrSBr driven by terahertz excitation
Authors: Yiqi Huo, Shuo Li, Luo Yan, Ningbo Li, Sergei Tretiak, Liujiang Zhou
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) lasers provide a new research perspective for spin electronics applications due to their sub-picosecond time resolution and non-thermal ultrafast demagnetization, but the interaction between spin, charge and lattice dynamics remains unclear. This study investigates photoinduced ultrafast demagnetization in monolayer CrSBr, a two-dimensional material with strong spin-orbit and spin-lattice coupling, and resolves its demagnetization process. Two key stages are identified: the first, occurring within 20 fs, is characterized by rapid electron-driven demagnetization, where charge transfer and THz laser are strongly coupled. In the second stage, light-induced lattice vibrations coupled to spin dynamics lead to significant spin changes, with electron-phonon coupling playing a key role. Importantly, the role of various phonon vibration modes in the electron relaxation process was clearly determined, pointing out that the electronic relaxation of the B3g1 phonon vibration mode occurs within 83 fs, which is less than the commonly believed 100 fs. Moreover, the influence of this coherent phonon on the demagnetization change is as high as 215 %. These insights into multiscale magneto-structural coupling advance the understanding of nonequilibrium spin dynamics and provide guidelines for the design of light-controlled quantum devices, particularly in layered heterostructures for spintronics and quantum information technologies.

Title: Estimation of Exciton Binding Energy and lifetime for Mono-layer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Rohit Ramesh Nimje, Swati G, Ashutosh Mahajan
Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical model for the Wannier-Mott exciton in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides such as $WS_2$, $WSe_2$, $MoS_2$, $MoSe_2$ that estimates the radiation lifetime in the effective mass approximation. We calculate exciton energy, and binding energy by solving the Schrodinger wave equation with open boundary conditions to obtain quasi-bound states in the confined direction in the monolayer and decay rates by the Fermi-Golden rule. The proposed model uses only the physical parameters such as band offsets, effective mass, and dielectric constants for the monolayers of $WS_2$, $WSe_2$, $MoS_2$, and $MoSe_2$. The model is validated against III-V material quantum well heterostructure, and the estimated effective lifetime considering the thermalization of the exciton has been compared with photoluminescence decay for the TMD heterostructure. Our calculated values show good agreement with the time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements and DFT estimations.

Title: Optimal protocol for collisional Brownian engines
Authors: Gustavo A. L. Forão
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have recently gained attention as alternatives to conventional nanoscale engines. However, a comprehensive optimization of their performance, which could serve as a benchmark for future engine designs, is still lacking. In this work, we address this gap by deriving and analyzing the optimal driving protocol for a collisional Brownian engine. By maximizing the average output work, we show that the optimal protocol consists of linear force segments separated by impulsive delta-like kicks that instantaneously reverse the particle's velocity. This structure enforces constant velocity within each stroke, enabling fully analytical expressions for optimal output power, efficiency, and entropy production. We demonstrate that the optimal protocol significantly outperforms standard strategies (such as constant, linear, or periodic drivings) achieving higher performance while keeping entropy production under control. Remarkably, when evaluated using realistic experimental parameters, the efficiency approaches near-unity at the power optimum, with entropy production remaining well controlled, a striking feature of the optimal protocol. To analyze a more realistic scenario, we examine the impact of smoothing the delta-like forces by introducing a finite duration and find that, although this reduces efficiency and increases entropy production, the optimal protocol still delivers high power output in a robust manner. Altogether, our results provide a theoretical benchmark for finite-time thermodynamic optimization of Brownian engines under time-periodic drivings.

Abstract: We numerically investigate the collective excitation of spin-conserving and spin-reversed configuration of rotating diluted ultra-cold dipolar Bose gas. Rotating trapped Bose gas produces a fictitious magnetic field perpendicular to the trapping harmonic potential, which exhibits strongly correlated fractional quantum Hall states. We consider the long-range dipole-dipole interaction and compute the low lying excitations spectrum for the three fractions of the first Jain series $\nu = 1/2, 1/4, 1/6$. We find that for both the spin-conserving and spin-reversed excitation the gap between the fundamental mode and the higher excitation mode increases upon increase in the filling fraction. The fundamental modes and the next higher-energy mode of excitation spectra for each of the three fractions show the presence of double roton for spin-conserving configuration only. Finally we complement our observation by calculating the spectral weight for the fundamental mode of excitation spectra which show the momenta at which the spectral weight exhibits the maxima shifts towards the lower momenta for both the excitations. Our observation for the spectral weight could be related with the inelastic Raman scattering which may be useful for the future experimental study to detect the excitation in ultracold system.

Title: Bilayer triple-Q state driven by interlayer higher-order exchange interactions
Authors: Bjarne Beyer, Mara Gutzeit, Tim Drevelow, Isabel Schwermer, Soumyajyoti Haldar, Stefan Heinze
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations and an atomistic spin model we predict the stabilization of a bilayer triple-Q state in an atomic Mn bilayer on Ir(111) due to interlayer higher-order exchange interactions. Based on density functional theory (DFT) we study the magnetic interactions and ground state in a Mn monolayer and bilayer on the Ir(111) surface. We calculate the energy dispersion of spin spirals (single-Q states) to scan a large part of the magnetic phase space and to obtain constants of pair-wise exchange interactions. By including spin-orbit coupling we determine the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. To reveal the role of higher-order exchange interactions in these films, we consider multi-Q states obtained by a superposition of spin spirals. For the Mn monolayer in fcc stacking on Ir(111), the triple-Q state exhibits the lowest total energy in DFT, while the Néel state is most favorable for hcp stacking. For the Mn bilayer on Ir(111), two types of the triple-Q state are possible. In both magnetic configurations, a triple-Q state occurs within each of the Mn layers. However, only in one of them the spin alignment between the layers is such that nearest-neighbor spins of different layers also exhibit the tetrahedron angles which characterize the triple-Q state. We denote this state -- which has the lowest total energy in our DFT calculations -- as the ideal bilayer triple-Q state. This state exhibits significant topological orbital moments within each of the two Mn layers which are aligned in parallel resulting in a large topological orbital magnetization. We interpret the DFT results within an atomistic spin model which includes pair-wise Heisenberg exchange, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, as well as higher-order exchange interactions....

Title: Frustrated $J_1-J_2$ Diamond Lattice Antiferromagnet Co$_2$Ti$_3$O$_8$ with a Vacancy-ordered Spinel Structure Synthesized via a Topochemical Reaction
Authors: Rio Kumeda, Yuya Haraguchi, Daisuke Nishio-Hamane, Akira Matsuo, Koichi Kindo, Hiroko Aruga Katori
Abstract: Metastable Co$_2$Ti$_3$O$_8$ was synthesized through a topochemical reaction using Li$_2$CoTi$_3$O$_8$ as the precursor, resulting in a vacancy-ordered spinel structure. Crystal structure analysis confirmed that Co ions selectively occupy the A-site, giving rise to a frustrated diamond lattice. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements revealed antiferromagnetic order at 4.4 K, which is markedly suppressed compared to the negative Weiss temperature of ${\sim}-27$ K, indicating a high degree of frustration effects. Pulsed high-field magnetization measurements revealed a four-step successive magnetic phase transition, demonstrating that Co$_2$Ti$_3$O$_8$ is a promising candidate for a frustrated $J_1-J_2$ diamond lattice. Additionally, the $J_2/J_1$ ration estimated from the molecular field approximation suggests the possibility of a spiral ordered ground state. These observations highlight the potential of frustrated magnetism in ordered spinel structures to expand the material search space for quantum magnetism, including magnetic skyrmions.

Title: Classification and enumeration of solid-solid phase transition mechanisms
Authors: Fang-Cheng Wang, Qi-Jun Ye, Yu-Cheng Zhu, Xin-Zheng Li
Abstract: Crystal-structure match (CSM), the atom-to-atom correspondence between two crystalline phases, is used extensively to describe solid-solid phase transition (SSPT) mechanisms. However, existing computational methods cannot account for all possible CSMs. Here, we propose a formalism to classify all CSMs into a tree structure, which is independent of the choices of unit cell and supercell. We rigorously proved that only a finite number of noncongruent CSMs are of practical interest. By representing CSMs as integer matrices, we introduce the crystmatch method to exhaustively enumerate them, which uncontroversially solves the CSM optimization problem under any geometric criterion. For most SSPTs, crystmatch can reproduce all known deformation mechanisms and CSMs within 10 CPU minutes, while also revealing thousands of new candidates. The resulting database can be further used for comparing experimental phenomena, high-throughput energy barrier calculations, or machine learning.

Title: Pressure-Driven Metallicity in Ångström-Thickness 2D Bismuth and Layer-Selective Ohmic Contact to MoS2
Authors: Shuhua Wang, Shibo Fang, Qiang Li, Yunliang Yue, Zongmeng Yang, Xiaotian Sun, Jing Lu, Chit Siong Lau, L. K. Ang, Lain-Jong Li, Yee Sin Ang
Abstract: Recent fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) metallic bismuth (Bi) via van der Waals (vdW) squeezing method opens a new avenue to ultrascaling metallic materials into the ångström-thickness regime [Nature 639, 354 (2025)]. However, freestanding 2D Bi is typically known to exhibit a semiconducting phase [Nature 617, 67 (2023), Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 236801 (2023)], which contradicts with the experimentally observed metallicity in vdW-squeezed 2D Bi. Here we show that such discrepancy originates from the pressure-induced buckled-to-flat structural transition in 2D Bi, which changes the electronic structure from semiconducting to metallic phases. Based on the experimentally fabricated MoS2-Bi-MoS2 trilayer heterostructure, we demonstrate the concept of layer-selective Ohmic contact in which one MoS2 layer forms Ohmic contact to the sandwiched Bi monolayer while the opposite MoS2 layer exhibits a Schottky barrier. The Ohmic contact can be switched between the two sandwiching MoS2 monolayers by changing the polarity of an external gate field, thus enabling charge to be spatially injected into different MoS2 layers. The layer-selective Ohmic contact proposed here represents a layertronic generalization of metal/semiconductor contact, paving a way towards layertronic device application.

Title: A framework for fluctuating times and counting observables in stochastic excursions
Authors: Guilherme Fiusa, Pedro E. Harunari, Abhaya S. Hegde, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: Many natural systems exhibit dynamics characterized by alternating phases. Describing the fluctuations of such systems over stochastic trajectories is necessary across diverse fields, from biological motors to quantum thermal machines. In an accompanying Letter, we introduced the notion of stochastic excursions -- a framework to analyze far from equilibrium processes via sub-trajectories. Through counting observables, this framework captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, which provides insights into thermodynamical trade-offs between thermodynamic quantities of interest, such as entropy production and dynamical activity. In this work, we enhance this formalism by providing a suite of technical results on how to efficiently compute excursion-related quantities. Our analytical results provide explicit formulas for general moments of counting variables and excursion duration, as well as their covariance and conditional moments. We show that excursion statistics recover full counting statistics results, and uncover a relation between fluctuations of counting observables at single-excursion level and the steady state diffusion coefficient (noise). We also discuss a fluctuation theorem for individual excursions. In addition, we explore how analyzing excursions and using the results developed here can yield insights into three problems of interest: the three-qubit absorption refrigerator, cellular sensing, and birth-and-death processes.

Title: Delicate Wannier insulators
Authors: Zoltán Guba, Aris Alexandradinata, Tomáš Bzdušek
Abstract: The defining feature of topological insulators is that their valence states are not continuously deformable to a suitably defined atomic limit without breaking the symmetry or closing the energy gap. When the atomic limit is given by symmetric exponentially-localized Wannier orbitals, one finds stable and fragile topological insulators characterized by robust bulk-boundary correspondence. More recently, delicate topological insulators (DIs) have been introduced, whose metallic states are guaranteed only at sharply terminated edges and surfaces. Although Wannierizable, their Wannier orbitals necessarily span multiple unit cells, thus refining the notion of the atomic limit. In this work, we extend delicate topological invariants from Bloch states to hybrid Wannier functions. The resulting models, dubbed delicate Wannier insulators (DWIs), are deformable to unicellular atomic limit in the absence of edges and surfaces; nevertheless, they exhibit obstructions to such deformations as well as topological boundary states in the presence of sharply terminated hinges and corners. We present a layering construction that allows us to elevate a DI in $d$ dimensions into a DWI in $(d\,{+}\,1)$ dimensions. We illustrate the phenomenology of DWIs by deploying the layering construction on three concrete models.

Title: Designer polyradical nanographenes with strong spin entanglement and perturbation resilience via Clar's goblet extension
Authors: En Li, Manish Kumar, Xinnan Peng, Tong Shen, Diego Soler-Polo, Yu Wang, Yu Teng, Haoyu Zhang, Shaotang Song, Jishan Wu, Pavel Jelinek, Jiong Lu
Abstract: Polyradical nanographenes featuring strong spin entanglement and robust many-body spin states against external magnetic perturbations not only enable the exploration of correlated quantum magnetism at the molecular scale, but also constitute promising candidates for developing molecular qubits with chemical tunability and building scalable quantum networks. Here, we employed a predictive design strategy to achieve the on-surface synthesis of two homologues of Clar goblet, C62H22 and C76H26, via lateral and vertical extensions of the parent structure, respectively. Vertical extension increases the number of topologically frustrated zero-energy modes, which scale linearly with the total number of benzene ring rows. In contrast, the lateral extension enhances electron-electron interactions, leading to the emergence of additional radical states beyond those predicted by the topological zero-energy modes. Consequently, both structures exhibit correlated tetraradical character and a many-body singlet ground state as confirmed by multireference theoretical calculations. These magnetic states arise from unique magnetic origins and also display distinct resilience to external perturbations, which can be experimentally validated using nickelocene-functionalized scanning probe techniques. Our work presents a general strategy for rational design of highly entangled polyradical nanographenes with tunable spin numbers and resilience of their many-body spin states to perturbations, opening exciting possibilities for exploring novel correlated spin phases in molecular systems and advancing quantum information technologies.

Title: Overlap Gap and Computational Thresholds in the Square Wave Perceptron
Authors: Marco Benedetti, Andrej Bogdanov, Enrico M. Malatesta, Marc Mézard, Gianmarco Perrupato, Alon Rosen, Nikolaj I. Schwartzbach, Riccardo Zecchina
Abstract: Square Wave Perceptrons (SWPs) form a class of neural network models with oscillating activation function that exhibit intriguing ``hardness'' properties in the high-dimensional limit at a fixed signal-to-noise ratio $\alpha = O(1)$. In this work, we examine two key aspects of these models. The first is related to the so-called overlap-gap property, that is a disconnectivity feature of the geometry of the solution space of combinatorial optimization problems proven to cause the failure of a large family of solvers, and conjectured to be a symptom of algorithmic hardness. We identify, both in the storage and in the teacher-student settings, the emergence of an overlap gap at a threshold $\alpha_{\mathrm{OGP}}(\delta)$, which can be made arbitrarily small by suitably increasing the frequency of oscillations $1/\delta$ of the activation. This suggests that in this small-$\delta$ regime, typical instances of the problem are hard to solve even for small values of $\alpha$. Second, in the teacher-student setup, we show that the recovery threshold of the planted signal for message-passing algorithms can be made arbitrarily large by reducing $\delta$. These properties make SWPs both a challenging benchmark for algorithms and an interesting candidate for cryptographic applications.

Title: The non-Hermitian magnetic moment
Authors: Bar Alon, Moshe Goldstein, Roni Ilan
Abstract: We construct a semiclassical theory for electrons in a non-Hermitian periodic system subject to perturbations varying slowly in space and time. We derive the energy of the wavepacket to first order in the gradients of the perturbations. Applying the theory to the specific case of a uniform external magnetic field, we obtain an expression for the orbital magnetization energy. Using the principles of non-Hermitian dynamics, we define a physically meaningful non-Hermitian generalization of the angular momentum operator and show that it is compatible with the real part of the orbital magnetic moment. The imaginary part of the orbital magnetic moment is also discussed and shown to originate from an imaginary counterpart to the angular momentum that gives rise to a non-Hermitian generalization of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

Title: Modelling the evolution of flow-induced anisotropy of concentrated suspensions
Authors: Pappu Acharya, Romain Mari
Abstract: Suspensions, which exhibit complex behaviors such as shear thickening, thinning, and jamming, are prevalent in nature and industry. However, predicting the mechanical properties of concentrated suspensions, in both steady state and the transient regime, remains a significant challenge, impacting product quality and process efficiency. In this study, we focus on developing a robust theoretical framework to explain how flow history governs the anisotropy of mechanical responses in suspensions of hard particles under unsteady flow conditions. Our starting point is the Gillissen-Wilson constitutive model, which we confront to DEM simulation data of the micro-structure during steady shear, and shear rotations where the shear axis is rotated by a specific angle around the flow gradient direction. We introduce a simple modification to the Gillissen-Wilson model which leads to a model with higher predictive power in steady state and during shear rotations.

Title: Exciton-Exciton Annihilation Mediated by Many-Body Coulomb and Phonon Interactions: An Ab Initio Study
Authors: Guy Vosco, Sivan Refaely-Abramson
Abstract: Exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA), in which two excitons interact to generate high-energy excitations, is an important non-radiative channel in light-induced excited-state relaxation. When efficient, this process offers an alternative route to exciton emission, potentially allowing extended energetically excited particles' lifetime and coherence. These properties are significant in designing and understanding materials-based quantum devices, particularly for low-dimensional semiconductors. Here, we present a first-principles framework to compute EEA mechanisms and rates using many-body perturbation theory within the GW and Bethe-Salpeter Equation (GW-BSE) formalism. Our method explicitly accounts for Coulomb-driven and phonon-assisted exciton-exciton scattering by explicitly evaluating the interaction channels between the constituent electrons and holes composing the BSE excitons. We apply this framework to monolayer WSe$_2$ and explore the $A$, $B$ excitation manifolds, finding picosecond-scale annihilation between bright and dark states, cross valleys, and cross peak manifolds. These channels become allowed due to scattering into free electron-hole pairs across the Brillouin zone. Our results supply new insights into non-radiative exciton relaxation mechanisms in two-dimensional materials, providing a predictive and general tool for modeling these interactions in excitonic materials.

Title: Tensor network method for real-space topology in quasicrystal Chern mosaics
Authors: Tiago V. C. Antão, Yitao Sun, Adolfo O. Fumega, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Computing topological invariants in two-dimensional quasicrystals and super-moire matter is an exceptional open challenge, due to the absence of translational symmetry and the colossal number of sites inherent to these systems. Here, we establish a method to compute local topological invariants of exceptionally large systems using tensor networks, enabling the computation of invariants for Hamiltonians with hundreds of millions of sites, several orders of magnitude above the capabilities of conventional methodologies. Our approach leverages a tensor-network representation of the density matrix using a Chebyshev tensor network algorithm, enabling large-scale calculations of topological markers in quasicrystalline and moire systems. We demonstrate our methodology with two-dimensional quasicrystals featuring 8-fold and 10-fold rotational symmetries and mosaics of Chern phases. Our work establishes a powerful method to compute topological phases in exceptionally large-scale topological systems, establishing the required tool to rationalize generic super-moire and quasicrystalline topological matter.

Title: Hydrodynamic fluctuations of stochastic charged cellular automata
Authors: Takato Yoshimura, Žiga Krajnik
Abstract: We study charge fluctuations of a family of stochastic charged cellular automata away from the deterministic single-file limit and obtain the exact typical charge probability distributions, known to be anomalous, using hydrodynamics. The cellular automata considered are examples of linearly degenerate systems where two distinct mechanisms of diffusion, namely normal and convective diffusion, coexist. Our formalism, based on macroscopic fluctuation theory, allows us to describe current fluctuations stemming from these two diffusive processes, and we expect it to be applicable to generic linearly degenerate systems. The derived probability distributions match the exact microscopic result and numerical simulations.

Title: Tuning Shear Rheology through Active Dopants
Authors: Amir Shee, Ritwik Bandyopadhyay, Haicen Yue
Abstract: We numerically investigate the shear rheology of mixtures of active and passive Brownian particles, with varying fractions of active components. We find that even a small fraction of active dopants triggers fluidization with comparable efficiency to fully active systems. A combined parameter, active energy, given by dopant fraction multiplied by propulsion speed squared controls the shear rheology and glass transition of the active-passive mixtures. These results together provide a quantitative strategy for fine-tuning the mechanical properties of a soft material with small amounts of active dopants.

Title: Geometric and Nonequilibrium Criticality in Run-and-Tumble Particles with Competing Motility and Attraction
Authors: Abir Bhowmick, Sayantan Mitra, P. K. Mohanty
Abstract: Self-propulsion in run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) generates effective attractive interactions that can drive motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), a phenomenon absent in their passive counterparts. In this work, we show that at high motility, introducing explicit attractive interactions among RTPs can suppress MIPS, leading to a homogeneous phase, and subsequently induce a re-emergence of phase separation at stronger attraction --thus realizing a reentrant phase transition. We characterize this transition by examining the percolation properties of dense clusters, which serve as geometric signatures of phase separation. Along the resulting critical line, we observe continuously varying critical exponents, while some of the associated scaling functions remain invariant and coincide with those of equilibrium lattice gas models undergoing interacting percolation, which is Ising-percolation universality. These findings reveal that the phase separation transition in interacting RTPs exhibits Ising-like super universality, bridging nonequilibrium active matter with classical critical behavior.

Title: Nonlinear projection for ballistic correlation functions: a formula in terms of minimal connected covers
Authors: Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: In many-body systems, the dynamics is governed, at large scales of space and time, by the hydrodynamic principle of projection onto the conserved densities admitted by the model. This is formalised as local relaxation of fluctuations in the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, a nonlinear Boltzmann-Gibbs principle. We use it to derive a projection formula, expressing n-point connected correlation functions (cumulants) of generic observables at different space-time points, in terms of those of conserved densities. This applies in every d >= 1 spatial dimensions and under the ballistic scaling of space and time, both in and out of equilibrium. It generalises the well-known linear-response principle for 2-point functions. For higher-point functions, one needs to account for nonlinear fluctuations of conserved densities. The result is a nonlinear projection, expressed as a sum over certain products of lower-order correlation functions of conserved densities with equilibrium multivariances as coefficients. Using Malyshev's formula, the sum is combinatorially organised via certain covers of the set of space-time points, which we call "minimal connected covers". We use this in order to get general, explicit formulas for two- and three-point functions in stationary states, expressed in terms of thermodynamic and Euler-scale data.

Title: Hydrodynamic noise in one dimension: projected Kubo formula and its vanishing in integrable models
Authors: Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: Hydrodynamic noise is the Gaussian process that emerges at larges scales of space and time in many-body systems. It arises by the central limit theorem applied to local microcanonical averages, representing the degrees of freedom that have been forgotten when projecting coarse-grained observables onto conserved quantities. It comes with "bare" diffusion terms. In one dimension of space, nonlinearities of the hydrodynamic equation are relevant (from a renormalisation perspective), usually giving rise to hydrodynamic superdiffusion. But in linearly degenerate systems, where the relevant nonlinearity vanishes, the diffusive scaling stays intact. Nevertheless, anomalies remain. We show that in such systems, the noise covariance is determined in terms of a modification of the Kubo formula, where effects of ballistic long-range correlations have been subtracted. This is the projected Onsager matrix, in which so-called quadratic charges are projected out. We show that the Einstein relation holds, giving a projected bare diffusion, and that the remaining nonlinearities are tamed by a point-splitting regularisation. Putting these ingredients together, we obtain an exact and well-defined hydrodynamic fluctuation theory in the ballistic scaling of space-time, for the asymptotic expansion in the inverse variation scale, including the first subleading (diffusive-scale) corrections beyond large deviations. This is expressed as a stochastic PDE. We then obtain the anomalous hydrodynamic equation, which takes into account separately long-range correlations and bare diffusion. Using these result, in integrable systems, we show that hydrodynamic noise must be absent, as was conjectured recently.

Title: Phase separation in a mixture of proliferating and motile active matter
Authors: Lukas Hupe, Joanna M. Materska, David Zwicker, Ramin Golestanian, Bartlomiej Waclaw, Philip Bittihn
Abstract: Proliferation and motility are ubiquitous drivers of activity in biological systems. Here, we study a dense binary mixture of motile and proliferating particles with exclusively repulsive interactions, where homeostasis in the proliferating subpopulation is maintained by pressure-induced removal. Using computer simulations, we show that phase separation emerges naturally in this system at high density and weak enough self-propulsion. We show that condensation is caused by interactions between motile particles induced by the growing phase, and recapitulate this behavior in an effective model of only motile particles with attractive interactions. Our results establish a new type of phase transition and pave a way to reinterpret the physics of dense cellular populations, such as bacterial colonies or tumors, as systems of mixed active matter.

Title: Transient dynamics of associative memory models
Authors: David G. Clark
Abstract: Associative memory models such as the Hopfield network and its dense generalizations with higher-order interactions exhibit a "blackout catastrophe"--a discontinuous transition where stable memory states abruptly vanish when the number of stored patterns exceeds a critical capacity. This transition is often interpreted as rendering networks unusable beyond capacity limits. We argue that this interpretation is largely an artifact of the equilibrium perspective. We derive dynamical mean-field equations using a bipartite cavity approach for graded-activity dense associative memory models, with the Hopfield model as a special case, and solve them using a numerical scheme. We show that patterns can be transiently retrieved with high accuracy above capacity despite the absence of stable attractors. This occurs because slow regions persist in the above-capacity energy landscape as shallow, unstable remnants of below-capacity stable basins. The same transient-retrieval effect occurs in below-capacity networks initialized outside basins of attraction. "Transient-recovery curves" provide a concise visual summary of these effects, revealing graceful, non-catastrophic changes in retrieval behavior above capacity and allowing us to compare the behavior across interaction orders. This dynamical perspective reveals rich energy landscape structure obscured by equilibrium analysis and suggests biological neural circuits may exploit transient dynamics for memory retrieval. Furthermore, our approach suggests ways of understanding computational properties of neural circuits without reference to fixed points, advances the technical repertoire of numerical mean-field solution methods for recurrent neural networks, and yields new theoretical results on generalizations of the Hopfield model.

Title: Heterogeneous response and non-Markovianity in the microrheology of semisolid viscoelastic materials
Authors: T. N. Azevedo, L. G. Rizzi
Abstract: Recent works indicate that heterogeneous response and non-Markovianity may yield recognizable hallmarks in the microrheology of semisolid viscoelastic materials. Here we perform numerical simulations using a non-Markovian overdamped Langevin approach to explore how the microrheology experienced by probe particles immersed in an effective semisolid material can be influenced by its micro-heterogeneities. Our results show that, besides affecting the mean squared displacement, the time-dependent diffusion coefficient, and the shear moduli, the micro-heterogeneities lead to displacement distributions that deviate from the usual Gaussian behavior. In addition, our study provides an analytical way to characterize the micro-heterogeneities of semisolid viscoelastic materials through their microrheology.

Title: Landau-Ginzburg Paradigm of Topological Phases
Authors: Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan
Abstract: Topologically ordered matter phases have been regarded as beyond the Landau-Ginzburg symmetry breaking paradigm of matter phases. Recent studies of anyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases back in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the string-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge theory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We reinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus extending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By explicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we construct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge transformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional lattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological phase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena, such as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping gauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective theory of the Higgs mechanism. To facilitate the understanding, we also compare anyon condensation to/with the Higgs boson condensation in the electroweak theory and the Cooper pair condensation.

Title: A 2D-CFT Factory: Critical Lattice Models from Competing Anyon Condensation Processes in SymTO/SymTFT
Authors: Ling-Yan Hung, Kaixin Ji, Ce Shen, Yidun Wan, Yu Zhao
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.

Title: Spinless and spinful charge excitations in moiré Fractional Chern Insulators
Authors: Miguel Gonçalves, Juan Felipe Mendez-Valderrama, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Jiabin Yu, Xiaodong Xu, Di Xiao, B. Andrei Bernevig, Nicolas Regnault
Abstract: Fractionally charged elementary excitations, the quasi-electron and quasi-hole, are one of the hallmarks of the fractional Chern insulator (FCI). In this work, we observe that spontaneous spin polarization in twisted MoTe$_2$ leads to multiple species of low-energy quasi-particles distinguished by their spin quantum numbers. We perform large-scale exact diagonalization (ED) calculations to investigate the nature of these excitations and develop a method to extract their fundamental energetic properties. Focusing on $\theta = 3.7^{\circ}$ and filling factor $\nu = -2/3$ relevant to recent experiments, we show that spin-preserving (spinless) charge excitations have smaller gap than spin-flipping (spinful) excitations both with and without band mixing. This result is in qualitative agreement with the measured magnetic field dependence of the transport gaps. Beyond the spinless and spinful quasi-particle gaps, we extract the full quasi-electron and quasi-hole ``band structure'' and find significant dispersion with emergent magnetic translation symmetry -- a fundamental departure from the immobile excitations of the quantum Hall fluid. Our results establish a framework for computing the properties of novel elementary excitations in FCIs.

Title: On the Potential of Microtubules for Scalable Quantum Computation
Authors: Nick E. Mavromatos, Andreas Mershin, Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We examine the quantum coherence properties of tubulin heterodimers in the Microtubule (MT) lattice. In the cavity-MT model proposed by the authors, according to which the MT interiors are modeled as high-Q quantum-electrodynamics cavities, decoherence-resistant entangled states have been argued to emerge under physiological conditions, with decoherence times of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ s. The latter is the result of strong electric-dipole interactions of tubulin dimers with ordered-water dipole quanta in the MT interior. We re-interpret the classical nonlinear (pseudospin) $\sigma$-models, describing the emergent dynamics of solitonic excitations in such systems, as representing quantum coherent (or possibly pointer) states, arising from the incomplete collapse of quantum-coherent dipole states. These solitons mediate dissipation-free energy transfer across the MT networks. We underpin logic-gate-like behavior through MT-associated proteins and detail how these structures may support scalable, ambient-temperature quantum computation, with the fundamental unit of information storage being a quDit associated with the basic unit of the MT honeycomb lattice. We describe in detail the decision-making process, after the action of an external stimulus, during which optimal path selection for energy-loss-free signal and information transport across the MT network emerges. Finally, we propose experimental pathways, including Rabi-splitting spectroscopy and entangled surface plasmon probes, to experimentally validate our predictions for MT-based, scalable quantum computation.

Title: Entanglement suppression and quantum scars in a three-oscillator gravitational analogue
Authors: P. George Christopher, S. Shankaranarayanan (IIT Bombay)
Abstract: We study quantum correlations in a tripartite system of coupled harmonic oscillators, modeling mediator-induced interactions akin to those in quantum gravity proposals. Surprisingly, despite the system's integrability, we identify regimes where bipartite entanglement between distant oscillators vanishes even with non-zero quantum couplings. In the Heavy Mediator Regime, entanglement is restricted to sharply localized islands in parameter space, surrounded by extended regions of suppression, analogous to quantum scars in non-integrable systems. Fidelity analysis reveal that these low-entanglement states exhibit dynamical stability and spectral signatures reminiscent of quantum scars in non-integrable systems, suggesting a continuous-variable analogue of scarring tied to hidden phase-space symmetries. The Light Mediator Regime, by contrast, displays smooth entanglement generation. These results challenge entanglement-based tests of quantum gravity: the absence of entanglement need not imply classical mediation but may instead reflect a mediator dynamically constrained to a quantum subspace-akin to gravitational memory or decoherence-free subspaces. Our findings emphasize the necessity of probing the mediator's dynamical regime to unambiguously diagnose quantum gravity.

Title: Superconducting antiqubits achieve optimal phase estimation via unitary inversion
Authors: Xingrui Song, Surihan Sean Borjigin, Flavio Salvati, Yu-Xin Wang, Nicole Yunger Halpern, David R. M. Arvidsson-Shukur, Kater Murch
Abstract: A positron is equivalent to an electron traveling backward through time. Casting transmon superconducting qubits as akin to electrons, we simulate a positron with a transmon subject to particular resonant and off-resonant drives. We call positron-like transmons "antiqubits." An antiqubit's effective gyromagnetic ratio equals the negative of a qubit's. This fact enables us to time-invert a unitary implemented on a transmon by its environment. We apply this platform-specific unitary inversion, with qubit--antiqubit entanglement, to achieve a quantum advantage in phase estimation: consider measuring the strength of a field that points in an unknown direction. An entangled qubit--antiqubit sensor offers the greatest possible sensitivity (amount of Fisher information), per qubit, per application of the field. We prove this result theoretically and observe it experimentally. This work shows how antimatter, whether real or simulated, can enable platform-specific unitary inversion and benefit quantum information processing.

We access this state from the metastable $4f^{14}5d (^2D_{3/2,5/2})$ manifold and observe an unexpectedly long lifetime of $\tau=37.9(9) \,\mu$s that allows visible Rabi oscillations and resolved-sideband spectroscopy. Using a combination of coherent population dynamics, high-fidelity detection and heralded state preparation, and optical pumping methods, we measure the branching ratios to the $^{2}D_{3/2}$, $^2D_{5/2}$, $^2S_{1/2}$ states to be 0.359(2), 0.639(2), 0.0023(16), respectively. The branching ratio to the $4f^{13}6s^{2}({^2F}_{7/2})$ is compatible with zero within our experimental resolution. We also report measurements of its Landé g-factor and the branching ratio of the ${^{2}{D}_{5/2}}$ to ${^{2}{S}_{1/2}}$ decay in $^{172}$Yb$^+$ to be 0.188(3), improving its relative uncertainty by an order of magnitude. Our measurements pave the way to a better understanding of the atomic structure of Yb$^+$ ions, which still lacks accurate numerical descriptions, and the use of high-lying excited states for partial detection and qubit manipulation in the omg architecture.

Title: Experimental Detection of Dissipative Quantum Chaos
Authors: Kristian Wold, Zitian Zhu, Feitong Jin, Xuhao Zhu, Zehang Bao, Jiarun Zhong, Fanhao Shen, Pengfei Zhang, Hekang Li, Zhen Wang, Chao Song, Qiujiang Guo, Sergey Denisov, Lucas Sá, H. Wang, Pedro Ribeiro
Abstract: More than four decades of research on chaos in isolated quantum systems have led to the identification of universal signatures -- such as level repulsion and eigenstate thermalization -- that serve as cornerstones in our understanding of complex quantum dynamics. The emerging field of dissipative quantum chaos explores how these properties manifest in open quantum systems, where interactions with the environment play an essential role. We report the first experimental detection of dissipative quantum chaos and integrability by measuring the complex spacing ratios (CSRs) of open many-body quantum systems implemented on a high-fidelity superconducting quantum processor. Employing gradient-based tomography, we retrieve a ``donut-shaped'' CSR distribution for chaotic dissipative circuits, a hallmark of level repulsion in open quantum systems. For an integrable circuit, spectral correlations vanish, evidenced by a sharp peak at the origin in the CSR distribution. As we increase the depth of the integrable dissipative circuit, the CSR distribution undergoes an integrability-to-chaos crossover, demonstrating that intrinsic noise in the quantum processor is a dissipative chaotic process. Our results reveal the universal spectral features of dissipative many-body systems and establish present-day quantum computation platforms, which are predominantly used to run unitary simulations, as testbeds to explore dissipative many-body phenomena.

Title: Lévy Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model
Authors: Budhaditya Bhattacharjee, William E. Salazar, Dario Rosa, Alexei Andreanov
Abstract: We explore the spectral properties of the $4$-fermion Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with interaction sourced from a Lévy Stable (fat-tailed) distribution. Lévy random matrices are known to demonstrate non-ergodic behaviour through the emergence of a mobility edge. We study the eigenvalue distribution, focusing on long- and short-range correlations and extreme statistics. This model demonstrates a crossover from chaotic to integrable behaviour (in the spectral correlations) as the distribution becomes increasingly fat-tailed. We investigate this crossover through a hierarchical analysis of the eigenvalue spectrum, based on the multi-fractal hierarchy of the Lévy Stable distribution. The crossover is explained in terms of a genuine many-body effect, distinct from the transition (controlled by a mobility edge) in the Lévy random matrices. We conclude with comments on the model's solvability and discussion of possible models with exact transitions.

Title: Matter-of-Fact: A Benchmark for Verifying the Feasibility of Literature-Supported Claims in Materials Science
Authors: Peter Jansen, Samiah Hassan, Ruoyao Wang
Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses. While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task (chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making near-term progress.

Title: Rigorous theory of coupled resonators
Authors: E. A. Muljarov
Abstract: We demonstrate the general failure of the famous concept of tight binding and mode hybridization underlying modern theories of coupled open resonators. In spite of sophisticated examples in the literature, successfully illustrating these theories, the latter fail to describe any planar systems. This includes the simplest possible case of two dielectric slabs placed next to each other or separated by a distance, which is straightforward for verification, due to its analytical solvability. We present a rigorous theory capable of calculating correctly the eigenmodes of arbitrary three-dimensional dispersive coupled resonators in terms of their individual modes, providing insight into the proper mode hybridization and formation of bonding and antibonding supermodes. Planar optical resonators, such as coupled slabs and Bragg-mirror microcavities, are used for illustrative purposes as they allow precise and reliable verification of the theory.

Title: Sedimentation of particulate suspensions under stagnant conditions in horizontal pipes
Authors: Tanmoy Das, Daniel Lester, Anthony Stickland, Nicky Eshtiaghi
Abstract: Sedimentation of particulate suspensions in horizontal pipes can lead to formation, growth and consolidation of a solid-like bed which can severely retard pipeline performance. As stagnant flow conditions frequently arise during industrial processes, critical operational questions are: (i) at what rate and extent does sedimentation proceed, and (ii) can the sedimentation dynamics be predicted from conventional suspension characterisation methods? We address these questions by characterising the sedimentation properties of an aqueous Kaolin suspension via batch settling tests and comparing predictions from 1D sedimentation theory with experiments in a horizontally oriented cylindrical pipe. We show that particulate sedimentation can be accurately predicted, indicating that the estimated sedimentation properties are representative material properties, and that transient effects such as gravity currents are not significant. Conversely, we find that the consolidation of the sediment is not well predicted by 1D theory, suggesting that the stress state is not 1D and likely involves contributions from the pipe walls. These stagnant cylindrical pipe results provide a basis for the development of methods to predict pipeline sedimentation under more general (laminar and turbulent) flow conditions.

Title: Accelerated Ostwald ripening by chemical activity
Authors: Benjamin Sorkin, Ned S. Wingreen
Abstract: Phase separation of biomolecular condensates is ubiquitous in living cells, promoting colocalization of enzymes and their substrates as well as achieving membrane-free compartmentalization. Energy-consuming processes are routinely used to regulate biocondensate growth by opposing the thermodynamic tendency toward coarsening. At the same time, cells often use energy to instead accelerate thermodynamic processes. Here, we theoretically explore the possibility of utilizing chemical reactions to accelerate biocondensate coarsening. We combine Lifshitz-Slyozov theory with a reaction-diffusion approach, wherein particles interconvert between phase-separating and inert forms. We find that mass conservation restricts the volume growth to be linear in time (as in the passive case) despite activity, though if reactions are restricted to occur only outside droplets, the rate of Ostwald ripening can be increased by an arbitrarily large factor. Our acceleration theory is quantitatively supported by recent experiments on ripening in the presence of fueled interconversion reactions, under precisely the predicted conditions. We posit that the ability to induce rapid biocondensate coarsening can be advantageous in synthetic-biological contexts as a regulator of metabolic channeling.

Title: Free Probability approach to spectral and operator statistics in Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles
Authors: Viktor Jahnke, Pratik Nandy, Kuntal Pal, Hugo A. Camargo, Keun-Young Kim
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial features of asymptotic freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates for the emergence of free probability behavior. Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.

Title: Perturbative Gradient Training: A novel training paradigm for bridging the gap between deep neural networks and physical reservoir computing
Authors: Cliff B. Abbott, Mark Elo, Dmytro A. Bozhko
Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Title: Multipurpose in situ cell design for 3D X-ray imaging of electrochemical processes
Authors: Riley J. Hultquist, David Simonne, Sayantan Mondal, Ericmoore Jossou
Abstract: We present the design of a modular multipurpose cell for monitoring the degradation of materials in extreme environments. This cell decouples the reference electrode from the working and counter electrodes, permitting precise electrochemical control and measurement reliability. The design is compatible with 4th generation synchrotron light sources, and its emphasis on modularity facilitates adaptation to different beamlines, where there may be variations in sample stage requirements and X-ray imaging techniques. Experimental tests with the novel design demonstrate its support of real-time corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement measurements under both Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) and Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) configurations.

Title: Entanglement cost hierarchies in quantum fragmented mixed states
Authors: Subhayan Sahu, Yahui Li, Pablo Sala
Abstract: Strong symmetries enforce non-trivial quantum entanglement patterns on the stationary states of symmetric open quantum dynamics. Specifically, non-commuting conserved quantities lead to long-range quantum entanglement even for infinite temperature mixed states within fixed symmetry sectors. Leveraging the commutant algebra framework, we show that various bipartite entanglement measures for mixed states -- including exact and asymptotically-exact entanglement costs and squashed entanglement, which are generally intractable for a generic many-body mixed state -- can be computed for this class of states. In particular, we focus on strongly symmetric maximally mixed states arising from the Temperley-Lieb model, which features quantum Hilbert space fragmentation with exponentially large (in system size) non-Abelian commutants. We find that while both the logarithmic negativity and the `exact' entanglement cost for equal-size bipartitions scale with the volume of the system, the entanglement of formation, squashed entanglement, entanglement cost, and distillable entanglement exhibit subextensive scaling. We relate this separation in entanglement measures to a parametric difference between the entanglement cost of exact and asymptotically-exact state preparations, and infer this to be a consequence of a particular pattern of quantum Hilbert space fragmentation.

Title: Adaptive recycled plastic architecture: Vacuum-Sealed Chainmail Structures Through Computational Design
Authors: Yi Xu, Farzin Lotfi-Jam, Mustafa Faruki
Abstract: The construction industry is a major consumer of raw materials, accounting for nearly half of global material usage annually, while generating significant waste that poses sustainability challenges. This paper explores the untapped potential of recycled plastics as a primary construction material, leveraging their lightweight, flexible, and customizable properties for advanced applications in modular chainmail systems. Through a computational workflow, the study optimizes the design, testing, and fabrication of vacuum-sealed chainmail structures composed of recycled plastic filaments, demonstrating their adaptability and structural performance for architectural use. Key contributions include a novel methodology for integrating recycled plastic filaments into chainmail geometries, validated through 2D sectional testing, 3D shell structure generation, and physical modeling under vacuum constraints. The research identifies the rectangular chainmail configuration as the most efficient and adaptable, achieving superior deformation capacity, material efficiency, and load-bearing performance. Optimization strategies for temporary structures highlight practical deployment potential, balancing material savings, usable area, and water drainage efficiency. The findings offer a foundation for innovative applications in extreme conditions, including disaster-prone areas, high-altitude environments, underwater platforms, and extraterrestrial habitats. These applications leverage the lightweight, adaptable, and durable properties of recycled plastics and modular chainmail systems, bridging the gap between waste management and high-performance design while addressing unique challenges in harsh and resource-constrained environments.

Title: Axion-mediated photon-to-photon transitions in high finesse dielectric resonators
Authors: Evangelos Almpanis
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical particles that could address both the strong charge-parity problem in quantum chromodynamics and the enigmatic nature of dark matter. However, if axions exist, their mass remains unknown, and they are expected to interact very weakly with the electromagnetic field, which explains why they have not been detected yet. This study proposes a way to substantially augment the axion-photon interaction by confining the photons within high-quality-factor dielectric resonators, increasing their intensity and lifetime and thus the possibility of interacting with axions in the background. In view of this, we study resonant axion-mediated photonic transitions in millimeter-sized spherical dielectric resonators, based on fully analytical calculations to the first order in perturbation theory. Such resonators exhibit high lifetime Mie resonances in the microwave part of the spectrum, with a separation that can be tailored with the radius of the sphere to match the expected axion frequency, allowing axion-mediated photonic transitions when particular selection rules are fulfilled. Such transitions are expected to be enhanced by more than ten orders of magnitude in the presence of the resonator, compared to transitions occurring in homogeneous space.

Title: Bacterial Chemotaxis in a Traveling Wave Attractant Environment
Authors: Shobhan Dev Mandal, Sakuntala Chatterjee
Abstract: We study single cell this http URL chemotaxis in a spatio-temporally varying attractant environment. Modeling the attractant concentration in the form of a traveling sine wave, we measure in our simulations, the chemotactic drift velocity of the cell for different propagation speed of the attractant wave. We find a highly non-trivial dependence where the chemotactic drift velocity changes sign, and also shows multiple peaks. For slowly moving attractant wave, drift velocity is negative, i.e. the drift motion is directed opposite to wave propagation. As the wave speed increases, drift velocity shows a negative peak, then changes sign, reaches a positive peak and finally becomes zero when the wave moves too fast for the cell to respond. We explain this rich behavior from the difference in attractant gradient perceived by the cell during its run along the propagation direction and opposite to it. In particular, when the cell moves in the same direction as the wave, the relative velocity of the cell with respect to the wave becomes zero when the wave speed matches the run speed. In this limit, the cell is able to ride the wave and experiences no concentration gradient during these runs. On the contrary, for runs in the opposite direction, no such effect is present and the effective gradient increases monotonically with the wave speed. We show, using detailed quantitative measurements, how this difference gives rise to the counter-intuitive behavior of chemotactic drift velocity described above.

Title: Thermal Property Microscopy with Compressive Sensing Frequency-Domain Thermoreflectance
Authors: Haobo Yang, Zhenguo Zhu, Zhongnan Xie, Jinhong Du, Shuo Bai, Hong Guo, Te-Huan Liu, Ronggui Yang, Xin Qian
Abstract: Spatial mapping of thermal properties is critical for unveiling the structure-property relation of materials, heterogeneous interfaces, and devices. These property images can also serve as datasets for training artificial intelligence models for material discoveries and optimization. Here we introduce a high-throughput thermal property imaging method called compressive sensing frequency domain thermoreflectance (CS-FDTR), which can robustly profile thermal property distributions with micrometer resolutions while requiring only a random subset of pixels being experimentally measured. The high-resolution thermal property image is reconstructed from the raw down-sampled data through L_1-regularized minimization. The high-throughput imaging capability of CS-FDTR is validated using the following cases: (a) the thermal conductance of a patterned heterogeneous interface, (b) thermal conductivity variations of an annealed pyrolytic graphite sample, and (c) the sharp change in thermal conductivity across a vertical aluminum/graphite interface. With less than half of the pixels being experimentally sampled, the thermal property images measured using CS-FDTR show nice agreements with the ground truth (point-by-point scanning), with a relative deviation below 15%. This work opens the possibility of high-throughput thermal property imaging without sacrificing the data quality, which is critical for materials discovery and screening.

Title: Exciton--hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridization in Biased Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Tomer Eini, N. M. R. Peres, Yarden Mazor, Itai Epstein
Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.

Title: Thermal avalanches in isolated many-body localized systems

Abstract: Many-body localization is a profound phase of matter affecting the entire spectrum which emerges in the presence of disorder in interacting many-body systems. Recently, the stability of many-body localization has been challenged by the avalanche mechanism, in which a small thermal region can spread, destabilizing localization and leading to global thermalization of the system. A key unresolved question is the critical competition between the thermal region's influence and the disorder strength required to trigger such an avalanche. Here, we numerically investigate many-body localization stability in an isolated Heisenberg spin chain of size $L$ subjected to a disordered magnetic field. By embedding a tunable thermal region of size $P$, we analyze the system's behavior in both static and dynamical regimes using entanglement entropy and the gap ratio. Our study yields two main findings. Firstly, for strong disorder, the avalanche only occurs if the thermal region scales with system size, specifically when $P/L$ exceeds a threshold value. Secondly, at strong disorder, we identify an intermediate phase between many-body localization and ergodic behavior as $P$ increases. This intermediate phase leaves its finger print in both static and dynamic properties of the system and tends to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. Although our simulations are restricted to finite system sizes, the analysis suggests that these results hold in the thermodynamic limit for isolated many-body systems.

Title: Thermoplasmonics of Gold-Core Silica-Shell Colloidal Nanoparticles under Pulse Illumination
Authors: Julien El Hajj, Gilles Ledoux, Samy Merabia
Abstract: Core-shell nanoparticles, particularly those having a gold core, have emerged as a highly promising class of materials due to their unique optical and thermal properties, which underpin a wide range of applications in photothermal therapy, imaging, and biosensing. In this study, we present a comprehensive study of the thermal dynamics of gold-core silica-shell nanoparticles immersed in water under pulse illumination. The plasmonic response of the core-shell nanoparticle is described by incorporating Mie theory with electronic temperature corrections to the refractive indices of gold, based on a Drude Lorentz formulation. The thermal response of the core-shell nanoparticles is modeled by coupling the two temperature model with molecular dynamics simulations, providing an atomistic description of nanoscale heat transfer. We investigate nanoparticles with both dense and porous silica shells (with 50% porosity) under laser pulse durations of 100 fs, 10 ps, and 1 ns, and over a range of fluences between 0.05 and 5mJ/cm2. We show that nanoparticles with a thin dense silica shell (5 nm) exhibit significantly faster water heating compared to bare gold nanoparticles. This behavior is attributed to enhanced electron-phonon coupling at the gold silica interface and to the relatively high thermal conductance between silica and water. These findings provide new insights into optimizing nanoparticle design for efficient photothermal applications and establish a robust framework for understanding energy transfer mechanisms in heterogeneous metal dielectric nanostructures.

Title: Organic Crystal Active Waveguide as an All-Angle Signal Receiver and Transmission Platform for Visible Light Communication
Authors: Ankur Khapre, Jyotisman Hazarika, Rajadurai Chandrasekar
Abstract: Organic crystal waveguides, known for excellent light-guiding and photonic versatility, present a promising alternative to conventional optical media in visible light communication (VLC) systems. In a novel approach, the high photoluminescence quantum yield organic crystal 2,2dash-((1E,1Edash)-hydrazine-1,2-diylidenebis(methaneylylidene))diphenol (SAA) is used as an optical waveguide medium for real-time data communication in the visible range, employing a microcontroller unit with on off keying modulation. Leveraging its spectral properties, the SAA crystal demonstrates dual active and passive waveguiding capabilities for signal modulation. Error-free signal detection is achieved thanks to the smooth, defect-free surface morphology of the crystal. The relationship between incident angle and light intensity reveals stable fluorescence under narrow angle excitation, positioning the crystal as an all-angle signal receiver that surpasses conventional optical fibers. A real time data transfer setup is demonstrated, enabling direct transmission from a serial interface and accurate reconstruction of grayscale images. This represents the first implementation of a fully organic crystal-based VLC platform, integrating wavelength conversion, omnidirectional waveguiding, and real time signal processing. The results establish a foundation for compact, efficient, and integrable photonic communication technologies.

Title: Quantum simulation of the Hubbard model on a graphene hexagon: Strengths of IQPE and noise constraints
Authors: Mohammad Mirzakhani, Kyungsun Moon
Abstract: Quantum computing offers transformative potential for simulating real-world materials, providing a powerful platform to investigate complex quantum systems across quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Noiseless simulations yield accurate ground-state energies (GSEs), charge and spin densities, and correlation functions, all in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization, underscoring the precision and reliability of quantum simulation for strongly correlated electron systems. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To examine these limitations, we utilize the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real backend. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Preliminary hardware runs on IBM devices further expose discrepancies between simulated and real-world noise, emphasizing the gap between ideal and practical implementations. Overall, our results highlight the promise of quantum computing for simulating correlated quantum materials, while also revealing the significant challenges posed by hardware noise in achieving accurate and reliable physical predictions using current quantum devices.

Title: A Gaussian process approach for rapid evaluation of skin tension
Authors: Matt Nagle, Hannah Conroy Broderick, Christelle Vedel, Michel Destrade, Michael Fop, Aisling Ni Annaidh
Abstract: Skin tension plays a pivotal role in clinical settings, it affects scarring, wound healing and skin necrosis. Despite its importance, there is no widely accepted method for assessing in vivo skin tension or its natural pre-stretch. This study aims to utilise modern machine learning (ML) methods to develop a model that uses non-invasive measurements of surface wave speed to predict clinically useful skin properties such as stress and natural pre-stretch. A large dataset consisting of simulated wave propagation experiments was created using a simplified two-dimensional finite element (FE) model. Using this dataset, a sensitivity analysis was performed, highlighting the effect of the material parameters and material model on the Rayleigh and supersonic shear wave speeds. Then, a Gaussian process regression model was trained to solve the ill-posed inverse problem of predicting stress and pre-stretch of skin using measurements of surface wave speed. This model had good predictive performance (R2 = 0.9570) and it was possible to interpolate simplified parametric equations to calculate the stress and pre-stretch. To demonstrate that wave speed measurements could be obtained cheaply and easily, a simple experiment was devised to obtain wave speed measurements from synthetic skin at different values of pre-stretch. These experimental wave speeds agree well with the FE simulations and a model trained solely on the FE data provided accurate predictions of synthetic skin stiffness. Both the simulated and experimental results provide further evidence that elastic wave measurements coupled with ML models are a viable non-invasive method to determine in vivo skin tension.

Authors: D. S. Grün, L. Bellinato Giacomelli, A. Tashchilina, R. Donofrio, F. Borchers, T. Bland, M. J. Mark, F. Ferlaino
Abstract: We present a quantitative investigation of one- and two-body light-mediated processes that occur to few erbium atoms in an optical tweezer, when exposed to near-resonant light. In order to study the intertwined effects of recoil heating, cooling and light-assisted collisions, we develop a first-principles Monte Carlo algorithm that solves the coupled dynamics of both the internal and external degrees of freedom of the atoms. After validating our theoretical model against experimental data, we use the predictive power of our code to guide our experiment and, in particular, we explore the performance of different transitions of erbium for light-assisted collisions in terms of their efficiency and fidelity for single-atom preparation.

Title: Precision Minimally-destructive detection of ultra-cold atomic ensembles
Authors: Ioannis Drougkakis, Georgios Vasilakis, Wolf von Klitzing
Abstract: Over the last two decades the cold-atom physics has matured from proof-of-principle demonstrations to a versatile platform for precision measurements and study of quantum phenomena. Ultra-cold atomic ensembles have been used both for technological and fundamental science applications. To fully exploit their potential, a precise measurement and control of the atom number in the ensemble is crucial. We report on a precise, minimally-destructive measurement technique that can be used to prepare an atomic ensemble with a desired atom number. The measurement relies on the dispersive light-atom interaction, thus it is expected to have a negligible effect on the ensemble temperature and to induce minimal decoherence in the atomic quantum state. As a result, it can be used to perform quantum-enhanced measurements and prepare the atom-number state at the start of an interferometer sequence.

Abstract: We introduce a technique to construct gapped lattice models using defects in topological field theory. We illustrate with 2+1 dimensional models, for example Chern-Simons theories. These models are local, though the state space is not necessarily a tensor product of vector spaces over the complex numbers. The Hamiltonian is a sum of commuting projections. We also give a topological field theory construction of Levin-Wen models.

Title: Associative Memory and Generative Diffusion in the Zero-noise Limit
Authors: Joshua Hess, Quaid Morris
Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one- and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks (equivalently, the attention mechanism).

Title: How to Train Your Dragon: Quantum Neural Networks
Authors: Hao Zhang, Alex Kamenev
Abstract: Training of neural networks (NNs) has emerged as a major consumer of both computational and energy resources. We demonstrate that quantum annealing platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its energy landscape--akin to cutting off the ever-regenerating heads of a dragon. The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple deep states (dragon heads to be cut). We found that this quantum-assisted training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical backpropagation methods, with a notably higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs. 0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.

Title: Full characterization of measurement-induced transitions of a superconducting qubit

Abstract: Repeated quantum non-demolition measurement is a cornerstone of quantum error correction protocols. In superconducting qubits, the speed of dispersive state readout can be enhanced by increasing the power of the readout tone. However, such an increase has been found to result in additional qubit state transitions that violate the desired quantum non-demolition character of the measurement. Recently, the readout of a transmon superconducting qubit was improved by using a tone with frequency much larger than the qubit frequency. Here, we experimentally identify the mechanisms of readout-induced transitions in this regime. In the dominant mechanism, the energy of an incoming readout photon is partially absorbed by the transmon and partially returned to the transmission line as a photon with lower frequency. Other mechanisms involve the excitation of unwanted package modes, decay via material defects, and, at higher qubit frequencies, the activation of undesired resonances in the transmon spectrum. Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of superconducting qubit state transitions caused by a strong drive.

Title: Delay Update in determinant quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: Fanjie Sun, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: Determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) is a widely used unbiased numerical method for simulating strongly correlated electron systems. However, the update process in DQMC is often a bottleneck for its efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a generalized delay update scheme that can handle both onsite and extended interactions. Our delay update scheme can be implemented in both zero-temperature and finite-temperature versions of DQMC. We apply the delay update scheme to various strongly correlated electron models and evaluate its efficiency under different conditions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed delay update scheme significantly improves the efficiency of DQMC simulations, enable it to simulate larger system size.

Abstract: Piezoelectricity of organic polymers has attracted increasing interest because of several advantages they exhibit over traditional inorganic ceramics. While most organic piezoelectrics rely on the presence of intrinsic local dipoles, a highly nonlocal electronic polarization can be foreseen in conjugated polymers, characterised by delocalized and highly responsive ${\pi}$-electrons. These 1D systems represent a physical realization of a Thouless pump, a mechanism of adiabatic charge transport of topological nature which results, as shown in this work, in anomalously large dynamical effective charges, inversely proportional to the band gap energy. A structural (ferroelectric) phase transition further contributes to an enhancement of the piezoelectric response reminiscent of that observed in piezoelectric perovskites close to morphotropic phase boundaries. First-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations performed in two representative conjugated polymers using hybrid functionals, show that state-of-the-art organic piezoelectric are outperformed by piezoelectric conjugated polymers, mostly thanks to strongly anomalous effective charges of carbon, larger than 5e - ordinary values being of the order of 1e - and reaching the giant value of 30e for band gaps of the order of 1 eV.

Title: Inhomogeneous Quantum Quenches of Conformal Field Theory with Boundaries
Authors: Xinyu Liu, Alexander McDonald, Tokiro Numasawa, Biao Lian, Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: We develop a method to calculate generic time-dependent correlation functions for inhomogeneous quantum quenches in (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) induced by sudden Hamiltonian deformations that modulate the energy density inhomogeneously. Our work particularly focuses on the effects of spatial boundaries, which have remained unresolved by previous analytical methods. For generic post-quench Hamiltonian, we develop a generic method to calculate the correlations by mirroring the system, which otherwise are Euclidean path integrals in complicated spacetime geometries difficult to calculate. On the other hand, for a special class of inhomogeneous post-quench Hamiltonians, including the Möbius and sine-square-deformation Hamiltonians, we show that the quantum quenches exhibit simple boundary effects calculable from Euclidean path integrals in a straightforward strip spacetime geometry. Applying our method to the time evolution of entanglement entropy, we find that for generic cases, the entanglement entropy shows discontinuities (shockwave fronts) propagating from the this http URL contrast, such discontinuities are absent in cases with simple boundary effects. We verify that our generic CFT formula matches well with numerical calculations from free fermion tight-binding models for various quench scenarios.

Title: DC electric field driven discretization of single-particle excitation spectra in a Mott insulator
Authors: Koudai Sugimoto
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the single-particle excitation spectra of a one-dimensional Hubbard model at half filling using an infinite matrix-product state and elucidate the discretized energy spectra emerging under the influence of a dc electric field. In a weak electric-field regime, we observe two kinds of spectral structures in the density of states. With increasing the electric-field strength, the discretized spectra, the period of which is proportional to the strength, become dominant, and the density of states exhibits the Wannier-Stark ladder in their spectra. In addition, we also simulate time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy using an ultrashort terahertz pump pulse that approximates a dc electric field. Our results represent a significant step forward in understanding the states in strongly correlated electron systems driven by a static electric field.

Title: Broken Symmetry in Ideal Chern Bands
Authors: Hui Liu, Kang Yang, Ahmed Abouelkomsan, Zhao Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz
Abstract: Recent observations of the fractional anomalous quantum Hall effect in moiré materials have reignited the interest in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). The chiral limit in which analytic Landau level-like single-particle states form an ``ideal" Chern band and local interactions lead to Laughlin-like FCIs at $1/3$ filling, has been very useful for understanding these systems by relating them to the lowest Landau level. We show, however, that, even in the idealized chiral limit, a fluctuating quantum geometry is associated with strongly broken symmetries and a phenomenology very different from that of Landau levels. In particular, particle-hole symmetry is strongly violated and e.g. at $2/3$ filling an emergent interaction driven Fermi liquid state with no Landau level counterpart is energetically favoured. In fact, even the exact Laughlin-like zero modes at $1/3$ filling have a non-uniform density tracking the underlying quantum geometry. Switching to a Coulomb interaction, the ideal Chern band with electron filling of $1/4$ features trivial charge density wave states. Moreover, applying a particle-hole transformation reveals that the ideal Chern band with hole filling of $3/4$ supports a quantum anomalous Hall crystal with quantized Hall conductance of $e^2/h$. These phenomena have no direct lowest Landau level counterpart.

Title: AC Josephson Signatures of the Superconducting Higgs/Amplitude Mode
Authors: Aritra Lahiri, Sang-Jun Choi, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: The Higgs mode in superconductors corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter. While its detection typically entails resonant optical excitation, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the importance of order parameter dynamics, the interplay of Higgs resonance and Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic Josephson current oscillating at twice the usual Josephson frequency in transparent junctions featuring single-band s-wave superconductors. If the leads have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs oscillations.

Title: High-Field Superconducting Halo in UTe$_2$
Authors: Sylvia K. Lewin, Peter Czajka, Corey E. Frank, Gicela Saucedo Salas, Hyeok Yoon, Yun Suk Eo, Johnpierre Paglione, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy, John Singleton, Nicholas P. Butch
Abstract: Heavy fermion UTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity that also exhibits multiple high-field superconducting phases. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase has only been observed in off-axis magnetic fields in the $bc$ plane at fields greater than 40 teslas, a striking scale given its critical temperature of only 2 kelvins. Here, we extend measurements of this unique superconducting state outside of the $bc$ plane and reveal its core structure. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase is not confined to fields in the $bc$ plane and in fact wraps around the $b$ axis in a halo-like fashion. In other words, this superconducting state, which exists in fields above 73 teslas, is stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. These remarkable field scales further underscore UTe$_2$'s unique magnetophilic superconducting tendencies and suggest an underlying pairing mechanism that is qualitatively distinct from known theories for field-enhanced superconductivity. Phenomenological modeling points to a two-component, non-unitary spin triplet order parameter with finite orbital momentum of the Cooper pairs as a natural explanation for the field-angle dependence of the upper critical field of the SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase.

Title: Fast real-time arbitrary waveform generation using graphic processing units
Authors: Juntian Tu, Sarthak Subhankar
Abstract: Real-time arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) is essential in various engineering and research applications. This paper introduces a novel AWG architecture using an NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) and a commercially available high-speed digital-to-analog converter (DAC) card, both running on a desktop personal computer (PC). The GPU accelerates the "embarrassingly" data-parallel additive synthesis framework for AWG, and the DAC reconstructs the generated waveform in the analog domain at high speed. The AWG software is developed using the developer-friendly compute unified device architecture (CUDA) runtime application programming interface (API) from NVIDIA. With this architecture, we achieve a 586-fold increase in the speed of computing periodic radio-frequency (rf) arbitrary waveforms compared to a central processing unit (CPU). We also demonstrate two different pathways for dynamically controlling multi-tone rf waveforms, which we characterize by chirping individual single-frequency tones in the multi-tone waveforms. One pathway offers arbitrary simultaneous chirping of 1000 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at a sampling rate of 280 megasamples per second (MS/s) for a limited time duration of 35 ms. The other pathway offers simultaneous chirping of 340 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at 50 MS/s, or 55 individual tones at 280 MS/s for an arbitrary duration. Using the latter pathway, we demonstrate control over 5000-tone and 10,000-tone waveforms by chirping all of their constituent tones in groups of up to 100 tones. This AWG architecture is designed for creating large defect-free optical tweezer arrays of single neutral atoms or molecules for quantum simulation and quantum computation.

Title: Capacitance-based Fermion parity read-out and predicted Rabi oscillations in a Majorana nanowire
Authors: Jay D. Sau, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: Recent experiments have measured flux dependent capacitance at radio frequencies leading to the potential for a fast parity read-out of a Majorana qubit. In this work we argue that the quantum dot used in the capacitance measurement can be reasonably approximated by a non-interacting weakly coupled orbital. We then predict the measured flux and parity dependent capacitance for several parameter regimes of the disordered Majorana nanowire model that are both topological and trivial. Following this we study how such a fast capacitance read-out can be used to characterize the quantum coherence of a Majorana nanowire-based qubit using Rabi oscillations. We additionally show that such measurements, if made possible by coherent inter-wire tunneling, would provide a valuable way of characterizing the low energy states in the frequency domain.

Title: Spin parallel transport and holonomy on a spherical two-dimensional electron gas
Authors: E.J. Rodríguez, A.A. Reynoso, J.P. Baltanás, D. Bercioux, D. Frustaglia
Abstract: The quantum conductance of circuits built on flat (Euclidean) two-dimensional electron gases in known to show a symmetric response to the inversion of Rashba spin-orbit coupling fields in Aharonov-Casher interference patterns. Here, we show that this symmetry breaks down in curved (non-Euclidean) circuits defined on a spherical two-dimensional electron gas. We demonstrate that this is a consequence of parallel spin transport and holonomy on the surface of the sphere, and that a symmetric response can be recovered when considering the parallel transport condition as an offset. We discuss triangular circuits defined along geodesic arcs on the sphere as a case study, and generalize it to regular polygons and parallel curves of given latitude.

Title: Self-consistent theory of $2\times2$ pair density waves in kagome superconductors
Authors: Meng Yao, Yan Wang, Da Wang, Jia-Xin Yin, Qiang-Hua Wang
Abstract: Pair density wave (PDW) is an intriguing quantum matter proposed in the frontier of condensed matter physics. However, the existence of PDW in microscopic models has been rare. In this work, we obtain, by Ginzburg-Landau arguments and self-consistent mean field theory, novel $2a_0\times2a_0$ PDW on the kagome lattice arising from attractive on-bond pairing interactions and the distinct Bloch wave functions near the p-type van Hove singularity. The PDW state carrying three independent wave-vectors, the so-called 3Q PDW, is nodeless and falls into two topological classes characterized by the Chern number $C = 0$ or $C = \pm2$. The chiral ($C=\pm2$) PDW state presents a rare case of interaction driven topological quantum state without the requirement of spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we analyze the stabilities and properties of these PDWs intertwining with charge orders, and discuss the relevance of our minimal model to recent experimental observations in kagome superconductors. Our theory not only elucidates the driving force of the chiral PDW, but also predicts strongly anisotropic superconducting gap structure in the momentum space and quantized transverse thermal conductivity that can be tested in future experiments.

Title: Atomic and inter-atomic orbital magnetization induced in SrTiO$_3$ by chiral phonons
Authors: Sergei Urazhdin
Abstract: An unexpectedly large transient magnetization induced by circularly polarized ferroelectric phonons was recently observed in a nonmagnetic insulator SrTiO3 [Nature 628, 534 (2024)]. We use a minimal molecular orbital model to demonstrate two electronic contributions to this effect. An atomic orbital contribution arises from the pumping of orbital angular momentum of Ti by chiral motion of coordinating oxygen atoms. An additional inter-atomic contribution is associated with the transient circulating current around the oxygen atoms, resulting in efficient dressing of phonons by electron dynamics. The insights provided by our model may facilitate the development of ultrafast magnetization control and orbitronic sources.

Title: Exceptional magic angles in non-Hermitian twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Juan Pablo Esparza, Vladimir Juricic
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) features strongly correlated and topological phases due to its flat bands emerging near the magic angle. However, the effects of the non-Hermiticity, arising from the coupling to the environment and dissipation, have remained unexplored. We here develop a simple non-Hermitian (NH) version of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) by considering relative twisting of two NH graphene monolayers with non-Hermiticity encoded in the imbalance of in-plane nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes. Remarkably, by generalizing the Bistritzer-MacDonald approach to NH systems, we discover exceptional magic angles where the band structure changes from purely real to purely imaginary thus featuring flat bands with infinite lifetime. Between them, the bands remain flattened, and a Hermitian magic angle emerges at which the imaginary part of energy is maximal, and corresponds to the usual magic angle in non-dissipative, purely Hermitian TBG. We propose an optical lattice setup with gain and loss where our theoretical predictions can be verified. These results suggest the robustness of the flat bands in open systems, paving the way for the further studies on the interplay of dissipative effects, electronic topology, and interactions in such NH moiré bands.

Title: Quick design of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization
Authors: Hyakka Nakada, Kotaro Tanahashi, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new method for constrained combinatorial optimization using tensor networks. Combinatorial optimization methods employing quantum gates, such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm, have been intensively investigated. However, their limitations in errors and the number of qubits prevent them from handling large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. Alternatively, attempts have been made to solve larger-scale problems using tensor networks that can approximately simulate quantum states. In recent years, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. For the principle verification of the proposed method, we constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem and conducted imaginary time evolution. We found that feasible solutions were obtained during the evolution, ultimately leading to the optimal solution. The proposed method is expected to facilitate the discovery of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization problems.

Title: Modeling of the micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectra
Authors: Ondřej Wojewoda, Martin Hrtoň, Michal Urbánek
Abstract: Although micro-focused Brillouin light scattering (BLS) has been used for more than twenty years, it lacks a complete theoretical description. This complicates the analysis of experimental data and significantly limits the information that can be obtained. To fill this knowledge gap, we have developed a semi-analytical model based on the mesoscopic continuous medium approach. The model consists of the following steps: calculation of the incident electric field and the dynamic susceptibility, calculation of the induced polarisation, and calculation of the emitted electric field and its propagation towards the detector. We demonstrate the model on the examples of the measurements of thermal and coherently excited spin waves. However, the used approach is general and can describe any micro-focused Brillouin light scattering experiment. The model can also bring new analytical approaches to mechanobiology experiments or to characterization of acoustic wave based devices.

Title: One-way catalysis in a solvable lattice model
Authors: Sara Mahdavi, Yann Sakref, Olivier Rivoire
Abstract: Catalysts speed up chemical reactions with no energy input and without being transformed in the process, therefore leaving equilibrium constants unchanged. Some catalysts, however, are much more efficient at accelerating one direction of a reaction. Is it possible for catalysis to be strictly unidirectional, accelerating only one direction of a reaction? Can we observe directional catalysis by analyzing the microscopic trajectory of a single reactant undergoing conversions between a substrate and a product state? We use the framework of a simple but exactly solvable lattice model to study these questions. The model provides examples of strictly one-way catalysts and illustrates a mathematical relationship between the asymmetric transition rates that underlie directional catalysis and the symmetric transition fluxes that underlie chemical equilibrium. The degree of directionality generally depends on the catalytic mechanism and we compare different mechanisms to show how they can obey different scaling laws.

Title: Two-dimensional materials as ideal substrates for molecular quantum emitters
Authors: Haiyuan Wang, Nicolas Stenger, Peder Lyngby, Mikael Kuisma, Jakob Schiøtz, Kristian Sommer Thygesen
Abstract: The generation and manipulation of non-classical states of light is central to quantum technologies. Color centers in insulators have been extensively studied for single-photon generation, but organic molecules immobilized on substrates have gained attention due to their superior scalability, large oscillator strengths, and tunable emission frequency. Here, we use first-principles calculations to investigate the photoemission from organic molecules adsorbed on 2D materials. Focusing on terrylene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we obtain zero phonon line (ZPL) energies and emission lineshapes in excellent agreement with experiments. Notably, antisite defects in hBN can immobilize the molecule without influencing its key emission features. We further show that the main effect of the 2D substrate is to introduce sharp sidebands near the ZPL as a fingerprint of hindered rotational, translational, or bending modes of the molecule. Our findings provide insight into how substrate interactions shape the optical properties of molecular systems for quantum applications.

Title: Superconducting junctions with flat bands
Authors: P. Virtanen, R. P. S. Penttilä, P. Törmä, A. Díez-Carlón, D. K. Efetov, T. T. Heikkilä
Abstract: We analyze the properties of flat-band superconductor junctions that behave differently from ordinary junctions containing only metals with Fermi surfaces. In particular, we show how in the tunneling limit the critical Josephson current between flat-band superconductors is inversely proportional to the pair potential, how the quantum geometric contribution to the supercurrent contributes even in the normal state of a flat-band weak link, and how Andreev reflection is strongly affected by the presence of bound states. Our results are relevant for analyzing the superconducting properties of junctions involving electronic systems with flat bands.

Title: Acceleration-induced transport of quantum vortices in joined atomtronic circuits
Authors: A. Chaika, A. O. Oliinyk, I. V. Yatsuta, N. P. Proukakis, M. Edwards, A. I. Yakimenko, T. Bland
Abstract: Persistent currents--inviscid quantized flow around an atomic circuit--are a crucial building block of atomtronic devices. We investigate how acceleration influences the transfer of persistent currents between two density-connected, ring-shaped atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, joined by a tunable weak link that controls system topology. We find that the acceleration of this system modifies both the density and phase dynamics between the rings, leading to a bias in the periodic vortex oscillations studied in T. Bland et al., Phys. Rev. Research 4, 043171 (2022). Accounting for dissipation suppressing such vortex oscillations, the acceleration facilitates a unilateral vortex transfer to the leading ring. We analyze how this transfer depends on the weak-link amplitude, the initial persistent current configuration, and the acceleration strength and direction. Characterization of the sensitivity to these parameters paves the way for a new platform for acceleration measurements, for which we outline a proof-of-concept ultracold double-ring accelerometer.

Title: Wave-packet dynamics in a graphene with periodic potentials
Authors: M.M. Suleimanov, M.U. Nosirov, H.T. Yusupov, A. Chaves, G.R. Berdiyorov, Kh.Yu. Rakhimov
Abstract: We use the Dirac continuum model to study the propagation of electronic wave packets in graphene with periodically arranged circular potential steps. The time propagation of the wave packets are calculated using the split-operator method for different size, height and separation of the barriers. The time propagation of the wave packets is calculated using the split-operator method for various barrier sizes, heights, and separations. We found that, despite the pronounced Klein tunneling effect in graphene, the presence of a lattice of defects significantly impacts the propagation properties of the wave packets. For example, depending on the height and size of the incident wave packet, the transmission probability can decrease by more than 20\%. The alteration of the polarity of the potential barriers also contributes to the transmission probabilities of the wave packet in graphene. The obtained results could provide valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of charge carrier dynamics in graphene-based nanodevices.

Title: Three-body Fermi liquid corrections for an infinite-$U$ SU($N$) Anderson impurity model
Authors: Kaiji Motoyama, Yoshimichi Teratani, Kazuhiko Tsutsumi, Kohei Wake, Ryosuke Kobayashi, Rui Sakano, Akira Oguri
Abstract: We study the three-body Fermi liquid effects in the SU($N$) Anderson impurity model in the strong interaction limit where the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of the impurity levels varies over the range of $0<N_d^{}<1$. The three-body correlation of impurity electrons contributes to the next-to-leading order terms of transport coefficients at low energies when the electron-hole symmetry, the time-reversal symmetries, or both are broken by external fields or potentials. Using the numerical renormalization group approach, we calculate the differential conductance and the nonlinear current noise through quantum dots, as well as the thermal conductivity of both quantum dots and magnetic alloys. Specifically, we focus on the SU(2) and SU(4) cases and demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve in the limit of $U\to\infty$, across the $1/N$-filling Kondo regime and the valence fluctuation regime. Our results clarify how the three-body correlation affects low-energy transport, with a crucial dependence on the occupation number $N_d^{}$. We also show that the three-body correlation strongly couples with asymmetries in the tunnel couplings between quantum dots and reservoirs; in particular it significantly affects the nonlinear current through the quarter-filling Kondo state for $N=4$.

Title: Toward machine learning interatomic potentials for modeling uranium mononitride
Authors: Lorena Alzate-Vargas, Kashi N. Subedi, Nicholas Lubbers, Michael W.D Cooper, Roxanne M. Tutchton, Tammie Gibson, Richard A. Messerly
Abstract: Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising accident-tolerant fuel because of its high fissile density and high thermal conductivity. In this study, we developed the first machine learning interatomic potentials for reliable atomic-scale modeling of UN at finite temperatures. We constructed a training set using density functional theory (DFT) calculations that was enriched through an active learning procedure, and two neural network potentials were generated. Both potentials successfully reproduce key thermophysical properties of interest, such as temperature-dependent lattice parameter, specific heat capacity, and bulk modulus. We also evaluated the energy of stoichiometric defect reactions and defect migration barriers and found close agreement with DFT predictions, demonstrating that our potentials can be used for modeling defects in UN. Additional tests provide evidence that our potentials are reliable for simulating diffusion, noble gas impurities, and radiation damage.

Title: Coexistence of gapless and gapped vortex modes with Majorana corner states in a 2D second-order topological superconductor
Authors: A. D. Fedoseev, A. O. Zlotnikov
Abstract: Although the appearance of vortex-localized states with zero energy in first-order topological superconductors is well known, their possibility to form in the higher-order topological phase of 2D systems has not been completely uncovered yet. Here we demonstrate the coexistence of zero-energy vortex modes and Majorana corner modes in the model of a 2D second-order topological superconductor. The model describes an interface between a normal layer supporting the topological insulating phase and a superconducting layer, for which different symmetries of the spin-singlet superconducting order parameter are considered. We show that the gapless vortex modes can appear under certain conditions in the superconducting state with a vortex if the bulk energy spectrum of the normal (non-superconducting) state is gapless and has Dirac cones. The number of pairs of such vortex modes corresponds to the number of Dirac cones. It is essential that if the normal bulk spectrum becomes gapped and the system is in the state of a topological insulator, then the zero-energy vortex modes can not be realized, while Majorana corner modes hold in the superconducting state. The interaction of the vortex modes with the edge and topological corner modes is studied when the vortex appears near the boundaries.

Title: Structural characterization of the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe
Authors: Liam J. Scanlon, Santosh Bhusal, Christina M. Hoffmann, Junhong He, Sean R. Parkin, Brennan J. Arnold, William J. Gannon
Abstract: Weyl semimetals have a variety of intriguing physical properties, including topologically protected electronic states that coexist with conducting states. Possible exploitation of topologically protected states in a conducting material is promising for technological applications. Weyl semimetals that form in a noncentrosymmetric structure that also contain magnetic moments may host a variety of emergent phenomena that cannot be seen in magnetic, centrosymmetric Weyl materials. It can be difficult to distinguish definitively between a centrosymmetric structure and one of its noncentrosymmetric subgroups with standard powder X-ray diffractometers in cases where two atoms in the compound have nearly the same atomic number, as is the case for the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe. In these cases, a careful single-crystal neutron diffraction experiment with high-angle reflections provides complimentary information to X-ray diffraction and definitively resolves any ambiguity between centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric crystal structures. Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements on the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe confirm that its structure is noncentrosymmetric, described by space group 109 $\left(I4_1md\right)$ rather than the centrosymmetric space group 141 $\left(I4_1/amd\right)$. There are many high-angle reflections in the data set that give clear, physically intuitive evidence that CeGaGe forms with $I4_1md$ symmetry since Bragg planes of these reflections can contain Ga with no Ge or vice versa, whereas the Bragg planes for a structure with $I4_1/amd$ symmetry would have a mix of Ga and Ge. Further, in some crystals we have studied, there is clear evidence for a structural transition from body-centered $I4_1md$ symmetry to primitive $P4_3$ and/or $P4_1$ symmetry.

Title: Emergent electrostatics in planar XY spin models: the bridge connecting topological order with broken $U(1)$ symmetry
Authors: Michael F. Faulkner
Abstract: Topological phases have been a central focus of condensed-matter physics for over 50 years. Along with many experimental applications, they have provided much intellectual interest due to their characterization via some form of topological ordering, as opposed to the symmetry-breaking ordering of conventional continuous phase transitions. This distinction is most subtle in the case of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition as its experimental realizations appear to break U(1) symmetry at low temperature. It also presents two further paradoxes: i) its prototypical short-range interacting planar XY spin model behaves as an emergent long-range interacting electrolyte; ii) its topological ordering is not accompanied by a topological nonergodicity within the BKT picture. This review paper addresses these three interconnected questions. We review a series of papers that demonstrate that U(1) symmetry is indeed broken, but within a broader framework than that traditionally used to characterize broken symmetry. We discuss recovery of this symmetry by breaking velocity-symmetry in a deterministic Markov process. We then expand on a modern field theory of the emergent electrolyte that maps directly from the spin field to an emergent lattice electric field governed by an augmented electrostatic Boltzmann distribution. This local model of electrolyte physics resolves both the short-range-long-range paradox and the question of topological nonergodicity - as in contrast with the BKT picture, it describes global topological defects and their nonergodic freezing by the topological ordering. It also connects the broken U(1) symmetry with the topological ordering, providing a comprehensive framework for broken symmetry at the transition. We introduce long-time topological stability as a measure of topological nonergodicity - within a general framework for weakly broken ergodicity.

Title: Spectra of Magnetoroton and Chiral Graviton Modes of Fractional Chern Insulator
Authors: Min Long, Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge-neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ (bosonic) \updated{ and $1/3$ (fermionic) fractional Chern insulator (FCI)} on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor acquires a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. As the system approaches the FCI-to-CDW transition point, we observe a pronounced sharpening of the roton mode, suggesting that the magnetoroton behaves more like a quasiparticle as it softens. Notably, this occurs while the single-particle gap remains finite. Besides the magnetoroton at finite momentum, we also construct quadrupolar chiral operators in a discrete lattice and resolve the chiral graviton mode around the $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, we show the different chiralities of the gravitons of FCIs with opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time.

Title: Deeper insight into the terahertz response of conventional superconductors under magnetic field
Authors: Michal Šindler, František Herman, Filip Kadlec, Christelle Kadlec
Abstract: We investigate the terahertz conductivity of conventional superconductors in Voigt and Faraday magneto-optical configurations. First, we review theoretical approaches describing the fundamental processes of suppression of superconductivity in magnetic field and how the in-gap states are filled. In the Voigt geometry, thin superconducting films are fully penetrated by the magnetic field which interacts with the spin, thus modifying the magnitudes of the optical gap and of the density of the condensate. In this configuration, we provide an alternative description of the recent experiments showing the gapless conductivity of a Nb film measured by Lee ${\it et\,al.}$ [Nat. Commun. 14,2737 (2023)], which better fits their data for magnetic fields above 1 T. In the Faraday geometry, we measured and analyzed the terahertz conductivity of three NbN films with varying thicknesses using the Maxwell-Garnett model, treating vortices as normal-state inclusions within a superconducting matrix. In both geometries, the optical conductivity can be comprehensively described by the model of Herman and Hlubina [Phys. Rev. B 96, 014509 (2017)] involving pair-conserving, and magnetic-field-dependent pair-breaking disorder scattering processes.

Title: Nanoscale structure formation in nickel-aluminum alloys synthesized far from equilibrium

Abstract: The present study reports on the structure formation in thin epitaxial nickel-aluminum films (Ni1-xAlx; Al atomic fraction x up to x=0.24) grown on MgO(001) substrates by magnetron sputtering. Experimental and computational data demonstrate that for x<0.11, the films exhibit the face-centered cubic random solid-solution Ni1-xAlx structure ({\gamma}). Whereas in the range x=0.11-0.24 the phase coexists with the ordered L12 structure ({\gamma}' phase). The two phases are homogenously intermixed forming a coherent and strained nano-solution, which exhibits a single lattice parameter that expands as the Al content increases. Isothermal annealing of films containing x=0.14 of Al, coupled with structural and nano-mechanical characterization, reveal that the nano-solution retains its overall integrity for temperatures up to 673 K, while the film hardness increases from 5.5 GPa (as deposited films) to 6 GPa. Further increase of the annealing temperature to 873 K and 1073 K causes the nano-solution to dissolve into distinct {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phase domains and the hardness to decrease down to values of 4 GPa. These findings confirm the metastable nature of the as-deposited thin Ni1-xAlx alloy films and underpin the effectiveness of high supersaturation/undercooling for creating non-equilibrium phases and self-organized nanostructures upon synthesis of multicomponent materials.

Title: Unconventional excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials
Authors: L. Maisel Licerán, H. T. C. Stoof
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between 50 K and 75 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.

Title: Imprinting of skyrmions and bimerons in an antiferromagnet
Authors: Coline Thevenard, Miina Leiviskä, Richard F. L. Evans, Daria Gusakova, Vincent Baltz
Abstract: Topologically protected magnetic states in condensed matter physics, particularly antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions (Sks) and bimerons (Bms), offer promising prospects for terahertz dynamics and sustained current-induced motion, thanks to their compensating multiple sub-lattice structure. However, nucleating AFM Sks and Bms is challenging due to the lack of net magnetization. Previous attempts to imprint pre-defined Sks and Bms in a ferromagnet (FM) and transfer them to an AFM using interfacial exchange bias in FM/AFM heterostructures have been hindered by complex multilayers with discontinuities, polycrystallinity, or multipartite chiral AFMs. Employing atomistic spin simulations, we demonstrate the viability of texture imprinting for nucleating Sks and Bms in AFMs, using a prototypical bipartite AFM layer in a multilayer structure free from discontinuities. Such imprinting is a crucial step towards understanding the static and dynamic properties of natural antiferromagnetic textures and their unique properties.

Title: Propagation of ultrashort voltage pulses through a small quantum dot
Authors: Thomas Kloss, Xavier Waintal
Abstract: The coherent transport of time-resolved ultrafast excitations in nanoelectronic interferometers is expected to exhibit an interesting interplay between the interferences and the time-dependent drive. However, the typical frequencies required to unlock this physics are in the THz range, making its observation challenging. In this work, we consider the propagation of the excitation generated by ultrashort voltage pulses through a small quantum dot, a system which we argue can display similar physics at significantly lower frequencies. We model the system with a single resonant level connected to two infinite electrodes subjected to a time-dependent voltage bias. For short pulses, we predict that the behaviour of the dot contrasts sharply with the long pulse (adiabatic) limit: the current actually oscillates with the amplitude of the voltage pulse. In the ultrafast limit, we predict that the current can even be negative, i.e. flow against the voltage drop. Our results are obtained by a combination of two approaches that are in quantitative agreement: explicit analytical expressions in the ultrafast and ultraslow limits and exact numerical simulations. We discuss the applicability of our findings and conclude that this system should be within reach of existing experimental platforms.

Title: Critical theories connecting gapped phases with $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry from the duality web
Authors: Andreas Karch, Ryan C. Spieler
Abstract: We use the ideas behind the duality web to construct numerous conformal field theories mediating the phase transitions between various symmetry broken and topological phases. In particular we obtain the full field theory version of the Kennedy Tasaki transformation, mapping a gapless theory mediating a topological phase transition of symmetry protected topological orders to a standard symmetry breaking one in a 1+1 dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. When we consider all possible discrete gauging operations, we obtain bosonic and fermionic webs with 9 critical theories per web, each connecting 4 separate gapped phases, some of them topological. Bosonization maps the two webs into each other. In addition to discussing the multi-critical theory connecting the four gapped phases in each phase diagram, we discuss the partially gapped theories connecting two of those four. Some of these are gapless symmetry protected topological phases.

Title: Exchange-phase erasure in anyonic Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry
Authors: Sushanth Varada, Christian Spånslätt, Matteo Acciai
Abstract: Two-particle interferometry is an important tool for extracting the exchange statistics of quantum particles. We theoretically investigate the prospects of such interferometry to probe the statistics of point-like anyonic excitations injected in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) setup based on a quantum point contact device in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We compute the standard HOM ratio, i.e., the ratio of tunneling noises for two- and one-particle injections, and find that for point-like anyons, it only depends on the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension. Importantly, the latter is not necessarily related to the exchange phase. In fact, we establish that the HOM ratio does not reveal the exchange phase of the injected anyons: For injection-time delays that are small compared to the thermal time scale, we find that the exchange phase accumulated due to time-domain braiding between injected and thermally activated anyons is erased due to two mutually canceling sub-processes. In contrast, for time delays large compared to the thermal time, only a single sub-process contributes to the braiding, but the accumulated phase is canceled in the HOM ratio. These findings suggest caution when interpreting HOM interferometry experiments with anyons and approaches beyond the standard HOM ratio are thus necessary to extract anyonic statistics with two-particle interferometry experiments.

Title: Wyckoff Transformer: Generation of Symmetric Crystals
Authors: Nikita Kazeev, Wei Nong, Ignat Romanov, Ruiming Zhu, Andrey Ustyuzhanin, Shuya Yamazaki, Kedar Hippalgaonkar
Abstract: Crystal symmetry plays a fundamental role in determining its physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. However, this is often inadequately addressed by existing generative models, making the consistent generation of stable and symmetrically valid crystal structures a significant challenge. We introduce WyFormer, a generative model that directly tackles this by formally conditioning on space group symmetry. It achieves this by using Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer encoder and an absence of positional encoding. Extensive experimentation demonstrates WyFormer's compelling combination of attributes: it achieves best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, incorporates a physics-motivated inductive bias, produces structures with competitive stability, predicts material properties with competitive accuracy even without atomic coordinates, and exhibits unparalleled inference speed.

Title: A simple method for detection and quantitative estimation of deep levels in a barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures by analysis of light induced threshold voltage shift
Authors: Maciej Matys, Atsushi Yamada, Yoichi Kamada, Toshihiro Ohki
Abstract: The characterization of deep levels in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures is one of the most important problems in GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) technology. This work reports on a technique for determination of deep level concentration in AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. The proposed method is relatively simple, and it is based on the detection of free holes created by optically induced transitions of electrons from the deep levels to the conduction band. The developed method can detect and provide quantitative estimation of deep level traps in a barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. Furthermore, it provides a framework for analysis of light induced threshold voltage shift, which includes an important experimental criterion of determination whether the holes are generated or not in the AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures by sub-band gap illumination. The method was verified by applications it to a study of the deep levels in GaN HEMTs grown on various substrates, i.e. SiC and GaN.

Title: Magnetoresistivity in the Antiferromagnetic Hubbard Model
Authors: Joel Bobadilla, Marcelo J. Rozenberg, Alberto Camjayi
Abstract: We investigate the magnetotransport properties of the half-filled antiferromagnetic (AF) one-band Hubbard model under an external magnetic field using the single-site dynamical mean-field approximation (DMFT). Particular attention is paid to the mechanisms driving the magnetoresistivity behavior. We analyze the dependence of magnetoresistivity on temperature and the strength of the applied magnetic field, providing insights into the interplay between magnetic fluctuations and transport properties in AF systems.

Title: Signatures of three-dimensional photo-induced superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$
Authors: M. Rosenberg, D. Nicoletti, M. Buzzi, A. Iudica, C. Putzke, Y. Liu, B. Keimer, A. Cavalleri
Abstract: Optical excitation of large-amplitude apical oxygen phonon oscillations has been shown to renormalize the electronic properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, inducing a superconducting-like optical response above equilibrium $T_C$. All of the evidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz frequency $c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer coupling was seen to transform into a superconducting-like inductive response. This assignment was strengthened by recent measurements of ultrafast magnetic field expulsion. Here, we report the first experimental determination of the transient in-plane optical properties, which has so far been elusive due to the high equilibrium reflectivity and the need to evaluate minute changes in the optical response. We report the appearance of a photo-induced in-plane optical gap $2\Delta\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity, both consistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these data suggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely equilibrate during the dynamics.

Abstract: We present time-resolved X-ray diffraction measurements using advanced timing schemes that provide high temporal resolution while also maintaining a high flux in the X-ray probe beam. The method employs patterned probe pulse sequences that are generated with the WaveGate solid-state pulse picker. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method at two different beamlines on millisecond and microsecond timescales.

Title: Ordering the topological order in the fractional quantum Hall effect
Authors: Meng Cheng, Seth Musser, Amir Raz, Nathan Seiberg, T. Senthil
Abstract: We discuss the possible topological order/topological quantum field theory of different quantum Hall systems. Given the value of the Hall conductivity, we constrain the global symmetry of the low-energy theory and its anomaly. Specifically, the one-form global symmetry and its anomaly are presented as the organizing principle of these systems. This information is powerful enough to lead to a unique minimal topological order (or a small number of minimal topological orders). Almost all of the known experimentally discovered topological orders are these minimal theories. Since this work is interdisciplinary, we made a special effort to relate to people with different backgrounds by providing translations between different perspectives.

Title: Phase engineering of MoS$_2$ monolayers: A pathway to enhanced lithium-polysulfide battery performance
Authors: J. W. González, E. Flórez, R. A. Gallardo, J. D. Correa
Abstract: This study explores the potential of MoS$_2$ polymorphs, specifically the semiconducting 2H phase and the metallic 1T$^\prime$ phase, as anchoring materials to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li--S) batteries. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$ exhibits stronger Li--S interactions, greater charge transfer, and enhanced catalytic activity compared to its 2H counterpart, effectively suppressing polysulfide dissolution and facilitating redox reactions. The reversible 2H$\leftrightarrow$1T$^\prime$ transition offers a tunable design space for balancing conductivity and structural stability. These findings position hybrid MoS$_2$ architectures as promising platforms for next-generation Li--S batteries with improved energy density, cycling stability, and rate capability.

Title: Engineering Altermagnetism via Layer Shifts and Spin Order in Bilayer MnPS$_3$
Authors: J. W. González, T. Brumme, E. Suárez Morell, A. M. León
Abstract: Altermagnetic materials combine compensated magnetic order with momentum-dependent spin splitting, offering a fundamentally new route for spintronic functionality beyond conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. While most studies have focused on three-dimensional compounds, the emergence of altermagnetism in few-layer two-dimensional materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that bilayer MnPS$_3$, a prototypical 2D van der Waals magnet, can host stacking-induced altermagnetic phases. Using density-functional theory and spin-Laue symmetry analysis, we show that interlayer spin alignment and lateral displacement act as coupled symmetry control parameters that switch the system between Type II (collinear AFM) and Type III (altermagnetic) phases. Our systematic exploration reveals how specific stacking geometries enable momentum-dependent spin polarization without net magnetization, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. These results establish stacking engineering as a powerful, purely structural route for designing tunable altermagnetic states in 2D magnets, opening pathways toward symmetry-driven spintronic and magnetoelectronic devices.

Title: Liouvillian skin effects in two-dimensional electron systems at finite temperatures
Authors: Yuta Shigedomi, Tsuneya Yoshida
Abstract: Liouvillian skin effects, manifested as the localization of Liouvillian eigenstates around the boundary, are distinctive features of non-Hermitian systems and are particularly notable for their impact on system dynamics. Despite their significance, Liouvillian skin effects have not been sufficiently explored in electron systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional electron system on a substrate exhibits $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Liouvillian skin effects due to the interplay among energy dissipations, spin-orbit coupling, and a transverse magnetic field. In addition, our analysis of the temperature dependence reveals that these Liouvillian skin effects become pronounced below the energy scale of band splitting induced by the spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic field. While our $\mathbb{Z}$ Liouvillian skin effect leads to charge accumulation under quench dynamics, its relaxation time is independent of the system size, in contrast to that of previously reported Liouvillian skin effects. This difference is attributed to the scale-free behavior of the localization length, which is analogous to non-Hermitian critical skin effects.

Title: Interface-induced collective phase transition in VO2-based bilayers studied by layer-selective spectroscopy

Abstract: We investigated the origin of collective electronic phase transitions induced at the heterointerface between monoclinic insulating (MI) VO2 and rutile metallic (RM) electron-doped VO2 layers using in situ soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPES) on nanoscale VO2/V0.99W0.01O2 (001)R bilayers. Thanks to the surface sensitivity of SXPES, we determined the changes in the electronic structure and V-V dimerization in each constituent layer separately. The layer-selective observation of the electronic and crystal structures in the upper VO2 layer of the bilayer indicates that the MI-phase VO2 layer undergoes a transition to the RM phase by forming the heterointerface. Detailed temperature-dependent measurements reveal that the RM-phase VO2 undergoes a transition to the MI phase with a decrease in temperature, as in the case of a VO2 single-layer film. Furthermore, during the temperature-induced phase transition in the VO2 layer, the spectra are well described by an in-plane phase separation of the RM and MI phases. These results suggest that the interface-induced transition from the MI to the RM phase in the VO2 layer of bilayers occurs as a collective phase transition derived from the static energy balance between the interfacial energy and the bulk free energies of the constituent layers.

Title: Absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code
Authors: M. Vieweg, V. Kott, L. Lenke, A. Schellenberger, K.P. Schmidt
Abstract: We investigate the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code which corresponds to the $U(1)$-symmetry enriched toric code with two distinct star sublattices. One can therefore tune from the limit of isolated stars to the uniform system. The uniform system has been conjectured to possess non-Abelian topological order based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations suggesting a non-trivial ground-state degeneracy depending on the compactification of the finite clusters. Here we show that these non-trivial properties can be naturally explained in the perturbative limit of isolated stars. Indeed, the compactification dependence of the ground-state degeneracy can be traced back to geometric constraints stemming from the plaquette operators. Further, the ground-state degeneracy is fully lifted in fourth-order degenerate perturbation theory giving rise to a non-topological phase with confined fracton excitations. These fractons are confined for small perturbations so that they cannot exist as single low-energy excitation in the thermodynamic limit but only as topologically trivially composite particles. However, the confinement scale is shown to be surprisingly large so that finite-size gaps are extremely small on finite clusters up to the uniform limit which is calculated explicitly by high-order series expansions. Our findings suggest that these gaps were not distinguished from finite-size effects by the recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the uniform limit. All our results therefore point towards the absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code along the whole parameter axis.

Title: Resonant Tunneling in Tri-layer 2H-MoTe2 grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy Coupled with layered WSe2 carrier Reservoir
Authors: Abir Mukherjee, Kajal Sharma, Kamlesh Bhatt, Santanu Kandar, Rajendra Singh, Samaresh Das
Abstract: Here, we report a prominent quantum oscillation in the conductance of 2H-MoTe2 based resonant tunneling structure. In this work, a n-WSe2/HfO2/i-MoTe2/HfO2/Au resonant tunneling device (RTD) with a symmetric and asymmetric double barrier has been fabricated using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) grown 2H-MoTe2 and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) grown 2H-WSe2 along with theoretical modeling by adopting non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) formalism. The impact of MoTe2-quantum well widths equal, and above its excitonic Bohr radius (EBR:0.7 nm) on resonant tunneling current is investigated at cryogenic temperatures. Such peak values increase with downscaling of the well width up to a certain value and then it decreases with further miniaturization. The corresponding maximum peak-to-valley current ratio (PVR) is estimated to be 4 at 4K in the low voltage range for the very first time in MoTe2 based RTD. Therefore, the present work may provide the route for fabrication of WSe2/MoTe2-based high performance resonant tunneling devices integrable with HEMT device for modern Qubit architecture operational at ultra-low temperatures.

Title: Nernst effect and its thickness dependence in superconducting NbN films
Authors: Thomas Bouteiller, Arthur Marguerite, Ramzy Daou, Dmitry Yakovlev, Stéphane Pons, Cheryl Feuillet-Palma, Dimitri Roditchev, Benoît Fauqué, Kamran Behnia
Abstract: Superconducting thin films and layered crystals display a Nernst signal generated by short-lived Cooper pairs above their critical temperature. Several experimental studies have broadly verified the standard theory invoking Gaussian fluctuations of a two-dimensional superconducting order parameter. Here, we present a study of the Nernst effect in granular NbN thin films with a thickness varying from 4 to 30 nm, exceeding the short superconducting coherence length and putting the system in the three-dimensional limit. We find that the Nernst conductivity decreases linearly with reduced temperature ($\alpha_{xy}\propto \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$), but the amplitude of $\alpha_{xy}$ scales with thickness. While the temperature dependence corresponds to what is expected in a 2D picture, scaling with thickness corresponds to a 3D picture. We argue that this behavior indicates a 2+1D situation, in which the relevant coherence length along the thickness of the film has no temperature dependence. We find no visible discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the Nernst conductivity across T$_c$. Explaining how the response of the superconducting vortices evolves to the one above the critical temperature of short-lived Cooper pairs emerges as a challenge to the theory.

Title: Unified Deep Learning Framework for Many-Body Quantum Chemistry via Green's Functions
Authors: Christian Venturella, Jiachen Li, Christopher Hillenbrand, Ximena Leyva Peralta, Jessica Liu, Tianyu Zhu
Abstract: Quantum many-body methods provide a systematic route to computing electronic properties of molecules and materials, but high computational costs restrict their use in large-scale applications. Due to the complexity in many-electron wavefunctions, machine learning models capable of capturing fundamental many-body physics remain limited. Here, we present a deep learning framework targeting the many-body Green's function, which unifies predictions of electronic properties in ground and excited states, while offering physical insights into many-electron correlation effects. By learning the $GW$ or coupled-cluster self-energy from mean-field features, our graph neural network achieves competitive performance in predicting one- and two-particle excitations and quantities derivable from one-particle density matrix. We demonstrate its high data efficiency and good transferability across chemical species, system sizes, molecular conformations, and correlation strengths in bond breaking, through multiple molecular and nanomaterial benchmarks. This work opens up opportunities for utilizing machine learning to solve many-electron problems.

Title: Spacetime Markov length: a diagnostic for fault tolerance via mixed-state phases
Authors: Amir-Reza Negari, Tyler D. Ellison, Timothy H. Hsieh
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between the fault-tolerance of local stabilizer codes experiencing measurement and physical errors and the mixed-state phases of decohered resource states in one higher dimension. Drawing from recent developments in mixed-state phases of matter, this motivates a diagnostic of fault-tolerance, which we refer to as the spacetime Markov length. This is a length scale determined by the decay of the (classical) conditional mutual information of repeated syndrome measurement outcomes in spacetime. The diagnostic is independent of the decoder, and its divergence signals the intrinsic breakdown of fault tolerance. As a byproduct, we find that decoherence may be useful for exposing transitions from higher-form symmetry-protected topological phases driven by both incoherent and coherent perturbations.

Title: Optomechanical systems with nonlinear interactions: photon blockade, collapse-revival effect and Fano-like resonance
Authors: A.P. Saiko, G.A. Rusetsky, S.A. Markevich, R. Fedaruk
Abstract: Closed-form expressions for the average amplitude of the optical field in optomechanical systems are obtained, in which, in addition to the linear interaction, quadratic and cubic interactions of the vibrational mode of the mechanical resonator with the mode of the optical resonator are considered. In the framework of the non-secular perturbation theory, using the Bogoliubov averaging method, it is shown that the effects of photon blockade, collapse and revival of optical oscillations in such systems can be realized. The main contribution to the formation of revivals is provided by the Kerr self-action of the optical mode and the cross-Kerr interaction of the fourth degree in optical and mechanical amplitudes. The cross-Kerr interactions of the sixth- and eighth-order in amplitudes destroy the regular structure of revivals. The influence of these cross-Kerr nonlinearities disappears with an increase in the decay rate of the optical mode and is also completely suppressed at zero temperature. It is shown that the asymmetry of the spectral line of the optical field intensity in the cavity is most pronounced with an increase in the degree of nonlinearity and is explained by Fano interference.

Title: An analytic theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models
Authors: Mason Kamb, Surya Ganguli
Abstract: We obtain an analytic, interpretable and predictive theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models. Indeed, score-matching diffusion models can generate highly original images that lie far from their training data. However, optimal score-matching theory suggests that these models should only be able to produce memorized training examples. To reconcile this theory-experiment gap, we identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1) induce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching; (2) result in fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, local score (LS) and equivariant local score (ELS) machines that, (3) after calibrating a single time-dependent hyperparameter can quantitatively predict the outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like ResNets and UNets) with high accuracy (median $r^2$ of $0.95, 0.94, 0.94, 0.96$ for our top model on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, MNIST, and CelebA). Our model reveals a locally consistent patch mosaic mechanism of creativity, in which diffusion models create exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local training set patches at different scales and image locations. Our theory also partially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention enabled UNets (median $r^2 \sim 0.77$ on CIFAR10), revealing an intriguing role for attention in carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.

Title: Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators
Authors: David Poland, Gordon Rogelberg
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to generate classical moments from the correlation function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 \equiv \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit.

Title: A theoretical framework for overfitting in energy-based modeling
Authors: Giovanni Catania, Aurélien Decelle, Cyril Furtlehner, Beatriz Seoane
Abstract: We investigate the impact of limited data on training pairwise energy-based models for inverse problems aimed at identifying interaction networks. Utilizing the Gaussian model as testbed, we dissect training trajectories across the eigenbasis of the coupling matrix, exploiting the independent evolution of eigenmodes and revealing that the learning timescales are tied to the spectral decomposition of the empirical covariance matrix. We see that optimal points for early stopping arise from the interplay between these timescales and the initial conditions of training. Moreover, we show that finite data corrections can be accurately modeled through asymptotic random matrix theory calculations and provide the counterpart of generalized cross-validation in the energy based model context. Our analytical framework extends to binary-variable maximum-entropy pairwise models with minimal variations. These findings offer strategies to control overfitting in discrete-variable models through empirical shrinkage corrections, improving the management of overfitting in energy-based generative models. Finally, we propose a generalization to arbitrary energy-based models by deriving the neural tangent kernel dynamics of the score function under the score-matching algorithm.

Title: Spatially Encoded Polaritonic Ultra-Strong Coupling in Gradient Metasurfaces with Epsilon-Near-Zero Modes
Authors: Enrico Bau, Andreas Aigner, Jonas Biechteler, Connor Heimig, Thorsten Goelz, Stefan A. Maier, Andreas Tittl
Abstract: We introduce a platform to achieve ultra-strong coupling (USC) between light and matter using widely available materials. USC is a light-matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths exceeding 10% of the ground state energy. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single-photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low-threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q-factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here we leverage dielectric dual gradient metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum to spatially encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space and demonstrate USC to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra-thin SiO2 layer. The strong out-of-plane electric fields in our tapered bar structure overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode, resulting in a normalized coupling strength of 0.101 and a mode splitting equivalent to 20% of the ENZ mode energy; a four- to five-fold increase compared to previous approaches. The strong field confinement of our approach opens new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices, such as tunable frequency converters and low-energy optical modulators.

Title: Separation of variables for higher rank integrable models: review of recent progress
Authors: Fedor Levkovich-Maslyuk
Abstract: Separation of variables (SoV) is a powerful method expected to be applicable for a wide range of quantum integrable systems, from models in condensed matter physics to gauge and string theories. Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N>2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.

Title: Something about the Mechanism of Induction Phenomena: The forgotten work of Berta de Haas-Lorentz on diamagnetism in superconductors
Authors: Giulia Venditti, Carlo Beenakker, Louk Rademaker
Abstract: In 1925, Dr. Geertruida Luberta "Berta" de Haas-Lorentz published the paper "Iets over het mechanisme van inductieverschijnselen" in the journal Physica. Her paper was the first to discuss perfect diamagnetism of superconductors, eight years before the discovery of the Meissner effect, when the essential difference between the two phenomena was not understood. Unfortunately, her work was almost forgotten by the scientific community. To counter this, we translate her seminal 1925 paper from Dutch into English. We provide an overview of the life of Dr. De Haas-Lorentz, and comment on her pioneering contribution to the theory of superconductivity.

Title: Disturbing news about the $d=2+ε$ expansion
Authors: Fabiana De Cesare, Slava Rychkov
Abstract: The $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in $d=2+\epsilon$ has long been conjectured to describe the same conformal field theory (CFT) as the Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ fixed point obtained from the $\lambda(\phi^2)^2$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$. In this work, we put this conjecture into question, building on the recent observation [Jones (2024)] that the NLSM CFT possesses a protected operator with dimension $N-1$, which is instead absent in the WF $O(N)$ CFT. For $N=3$, we investigate the possibility of lifting this operator via multiplet recombination - the only known mechanism that could resolve this mismatch. We compute the anomalous dimension of the lightest operator that could participate in recombination, and find that it remains too heavy to allow for this scenario. This suggests that the NLSM $O(3)$ fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ is not continuously connected to the WF $O(3)$ CFT, and may instead describe an alternative universality class, such as the hedgehog-suppressed critical point, corresponding to the Néel-VBS phase transition in $3$D. We also discuss how to generalize this analysis to $N>3$.
