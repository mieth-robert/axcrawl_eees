Title: Long-Term Stability of Superconducting Metal Superhydrides
Authors: Vasily S. Minkov, Mikhail A. Kuzovnikov, Panpan Kong, Alexander P. Drozdov, Feng Du, Jiafeng Yan, Jaeyong Kim, Stella Chariton, Vitali B. Prakapenka, Mohamed Mezouar, Björn Wehinger, G. Alexander Smith, Fedor F. Balakirev, Evgeny F. Talantsev
Abstract: Zhou et al., in their recent publication (Nat. Commun. 16, 1135, 2025), reported the synthesis of lanthanum superhydride, LaHx (x = 10.2-11.1), by laser heating LaH3 with NH3BH3 at a pressure of 170 GPa and investigated the temporal evolution of the NMR spectra of the reaction products. They observed a gradual decrease in the 1H-NMR signal intensity assigned to the synthesized metal hydride, accompanied by an increase in molecular hydrogen within the sample chamber over a period of 50 days. Based on these observations, the authors concluded that LaH10 progressively decomposes into LaH3 and H2 within two months after synthesis at its formation pressure of 170 GPa. Here, we demonstrate that, under their formation conditions, metal superhydrides are thermodynamically more stable than metal trihydrides. Furthermore, we present direct experimental evidence - based on X-ray diffraction and four-probe electrical resistance measurements - confirming the stability of both the crystal lattice and high-temperature superconducting properties of the Fm-3m-LaH10 phase for more than five years. This long-term stability is consistent with predictions from quantum chemistry calculations.

Title: Temperature
Authors: Miroslav Grmela
Abstract: Conversations about weather, environment, health, cuisine, and even politics, all involve the word "temperature". It was an attempt to understand the working of heat engines that gave the temperature a clear definition. In this Note we put the equilibrium-thermodynamics definition into a larger context of the multiscale thermodynamics, the multiscale rate thermodynamics, and nonphysical environments.

Title: Fractional Thouless pumping of solitons: a unique manifestation of bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear eigenvalue problems
Authors: Chenxi Bai, Zhaoxin Liang
Abstract: Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This raises a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we demonstrate the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of this correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model with next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we discover that the NNN parameters can induce fractional topological phases despite quantized topological invariants from conventional approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, linking nonlinear spectral features directly to bulk-boundary correspondence. This work reveals novel phenomena emerging from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for designing topological insulators and controlling quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.

Title: Ultrasensitive Magnetometer based on Cusp Points of the Photon-Magnon Synchronization Mode
Authors: Xinlin Mi, Jinwei Rao, Lijun Yan, Xudong Wang, Bingbing Lyu, Bimu Yao, Shishen Yan, Lihui Bai
Abstract: Ultrasensitive magnetometers based on spin resonances have led to remarkable achievements. However, the gyromagnetic ratios of these spin resonances that determine the responsivity of magnetometers to weak magnetic fields are inherently constrained by the Land$\acute{e}$ g-factor of particles, such as the electron, with a constant gyromagnetic ratio of $\gamma_e=2\pi\times28$ GHz/T. Here, we demonstrate an ultrasensitive magnetometer based on the cusp point (CP) of photon-magnon synchronization modes (PMSMs). The PMSM's gyromagnetic ratio at the CP is enhanced to $37\gamma_e$ and further amplified to $236\gamma_e$ by utilizing the sixth-order oscillating mode of the PMSM. Moreover, the emission linewidth of the PMSM can be reduced to 0.06 Hz, resulting in excellent sensitivity to weak magnetic fields. These outstanding properties position our magnetometer to potentially achieve superior sensitivity to conventional magnetometers. Our work introduces a cost-effective prototype for the next generation of magnetometry, and may advance scientific research and technologies that rely on ultrasensitive magnetic field detection.

Title: Quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response
Authors: Anwei Zhang, C. M. Wang
Abstract: In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric sources. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.

Title: Electric and spin current vortices in altermagnets
Authors: A.A. Herasymchuk, Karl Bergson Hallberg, Erik Wegner Hodt, Jacob Linder, E.V. Gorbar, Pavlo Sukhachov
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and vanishing net magnetization. Direct observation of the characteristic altermagnetic spin splitting, however, remains challenging. Indirect signatures can be obtained via transport studies, which so far have only considered homogeneous fields driving currents. We propose to leverage nonuniform electric fields and spin density gradients to probe the shape and the spin polarization of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces via transport measurements. By using both a semiclassical Boltzmann approach and a lattice Keldysh formalism, we show that altermagnets excite swirling electric and spin currents whose profiles depend on the relative orientation of altermagnetic lobes with respect to the sample boundaries. These currents can be measured via magnetometry techniques. Unlike previous proposals considering the hydrodynamic regime of transport, swirling currents are observed even in the Ohmic regime and rely exclusively on the altermagnetic spin splitting, with no swirls observed in ferromagnets. The electric and spin current vortices predicted here provide a unique altermagnetic signature in an experimentally accessible setup.

Title: Partial suppression of magnetism in the square lattice SU(3) Hubbard model
Authors: Samuel Bird, Sebastian Huber, Jannes Nys
Abstract: The SU(N) Hubbard model is a natural extension of the SU(2) model. However, even the N=3 case remains poorly understood. We report a substantially new ground-state phase diagram of the square lattice SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model. Using a backflow ansatz, we identify strong signatures of a Mott transition and a subsequent magnetic transition, and the suppression of a previously predicted magnetic phase. We study the hole-doped model, identifying a transition from magnetic to paramagnetic behavior in the strong-coupling regime. Our findings offer a qualitatively new ground state picture. More broadly, our work suggests a path to study general SU(N) Hubbard models with arbitrary filling and geometry.

Title: Diagonal Isometric Form for Tensor Product States in Two Dimensions
Authors: Benjamin Sappler, Masataka Kawano, Michael P Zaletel, Frank Pollmann
Abstract: Isometric tensor product states (isoTPS) generalize the isometric form of the one-dimensional matrix product states (MPS) to tensor networks in two and higher dimensions. Here, we introduce an alternative isometric form for isoTPS by incorporating auxiliary tensors to represent the orthogonality hypersurface. We implement the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on this new isometric form and benchmark the method by computing ground states and the real time evolution of the transverse field Ising model in two dimensions on large square lattices of up to 1250 sites. Our results demonstrate that isoTPS can efficiently capture the entanglement structure of two-dimensional area law states. The short-time dynamics is also accurately reproduced even at the critical point. Our isoTPS formulation further allows for a natural extension to different lattice geometries, such as the honeycomb or kagome latice.

Title: Long range to short range crossover in one dimension
Authors: Mrinal Sarkar, Nicolò Defenu, Tilman Enss
Abstract: This work investigates the critical behavior of one-dimensional systems with long-range (LR) interactions, focusing on the crossover to short-range (SR) universality. Through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of self-avoiding Lévy flights on a 1D lattice, we compute the anomalous dimension \eta, the correlation length exponent \nu, and the susceptibility exponent \gamma across a wide range of LR decay parameters \sigma. Our results provide strong numerical evidence that supports Sak's scenario. They identify the crossover at \sigma^* = 1 and demonstrate the continuity of critical exponents across this point, with strong corrections to scaling. The study also reveals deviations from Flory-type scaling predictions and discusses the limitations of effective dimension approaches in general. These findings clarify the nature of the LR-SR crossover in low-dimensional systems and open avenues for exploring criticality in disordered and complex networks.

Title: Charge distribution and magnetism in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: a hybrid functional study
Authors: Kateryna Foyevtsova, Ilya Elfimov, George A. Sawatzky
Abstract: An accurate understanding of the ground state electronic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a high-temperature superconductor under pressure, is key for unveiling the origin of its superconductivity. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.

Title: Phonon mode splitting and phonon anomaly in multiband electron systems
Authors: Klaus Ziegler
Abstract: We investigate the topological consequences of coupling chiral fermions to local, dispersionless phonons. This interaction induces a splitting of the phonon spectrum into three bands: a flat band and two bands with linear dispersion, all of which are degenerate at a nodal point located at zero wavevector. The flat band exhibits vanishing Berry curvature, while the linearly dispersing bands carry nontrivial topological features. Their Berry curvature fields assume a hedgehog-like structure in momentum space, analogous to monopole configurations, and reflect the chirality of the underlying fermionic system. Moreover, the effective phonon response reveals a phonon parity anomaly, observable as a discontinuity in the phonon current. This anomaly originates from the singularities of the fermion Green's function and signals the transfer of topological information from fermions to phonons. Our results demonstrate that phonon currents provide a direct probe of electronic chirality and topological structures. The framework offers a foundation for extending topological concepts to interacting bosonic systems and may guide the engineering of phononic materials with tunable geometric and topological properties.

Title: Exciting terahertz magnons with amplitude modulated light: spin pumping, squeezed states, symmetry breaking and pattern formation
Authors: Egor I. Kiselev, Jonas F. Karcher, Mark S. Rudner, Rembert Duine, Netanel H. Lindner
Abstract: We show how amplitude modulated, coherent high-frequency drives can be used to access otherwise difficult to reach collective resonances and off-resonantly induce parametric instabilities. In particular, we demonstrate that difficult to access antiferromagnetic resonances in the THz range can be parametrically excited with signals at optical frequencies via a mechanism that we call Modulated Floquet Parametric Driving (MFPD). We study spin pumping and the formation of entangled, two-mode squeezed magnon pairs in anisotropic antiferromagnets under MFPD. Furthermore, we show that MFPD induces transitions to symmetry breaking steady-states in which dynamical spin patterns are formed by resonant magnon pairs.

Title: Tunable chiral and nematic states in the triple-Q antiferromagnet Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$
Authors: Erik Kirstein, Pyeongjae Park, Woonghee Cho, Cristian D. Batista, Je-Geun Park, Scott A. Crooker
Abstract: Complex spin configurations in magnetic materials, ranging from collinear single-Q to noncoplanar multi-Q states, exhibit rich symmetry and chiral properties. However, their detailed characterization is often hindered by the limited spatial resolution of neutron diffraction techniques. Here we employ magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and magnetic linear dichroism (MLD) to investigate the triangular lattice antiferromagnet Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, revealing three-state (Z3) nematicity and also spin chirality across its multi-Q magnetic phases. At intermediate temperatures, the presence of MLD identifies nematicity arising from a single-Q stripe phase, while at high magnetic fields and low temperatures, a phase characterized solely by MCD emerges, signifying a purely chiral non-coplanar triple-Q state. Notably, at low temperatures and small fields, we discover a unique phase where both chirality and nematicity coexist. A theoretical analysis based on a continuous multi-Q manifold captures the emergence of these distinct magnetic phases, as a result of the interplay between four-spin interactions and weak magnetic anisotropy. Additionally, MCD and MLD microscopy spatially resolves the chiral and nematic domains. Our findings establish Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$ as a rare platform hosting diverse multi-Q states with distinct combinations of spin chirality and nematicity while demonstrating the effectiveness of polarized optical techniques in characterizing complex magnetic textures.

Title: Off-resonant light-induced topological phase transition and thermoelectric transport in semi-Dirac materials
Authors: Vassilios Vargiamidis, P. Vasilopoulos, Neophytos Neophytou
Abstract: We show that a semi-Dirac (SD) system with an inversion symmetry breaking mass exhibits a topological phase transition when irradiated with off-resonant light. Using Floquet theory, we derive the band structure, Chern numbers, phase diagram, and we show that as the light intensity is swept at fixed mass, the SD system undergoes normal-Chern-normal insulator transition. Along the phase boundaries we observe single semi-Dirac-cone (SSDC) semimetal states in which one SD cone is gapless and the other gapped. The nontrivial Berry curvature distribution $\Omega(\mathbf{k}) \neq -\Omega ( - \mathbf{k} )$ generates an orbital magnetization $M$ and anomalous Nernst ($\alpha_{xy}$) and thermal Hall ($\kappa_{xy}$) conductivities. We show that $M$ remains constant as the Fermi level $E_F$ scans the insulating gap, but it changes linearly with it in the Chern insulator (CI) phase, as expected. In the normal insulator phase, we find that $\alpha_{xy}$ exhibits a dip-peak profile which is reversed in the CI phase. We also find that switching the light's circular polarization from left to right induces a sign change in $M$, $\alpha_{xy}$, and $\kappa_{xy}$, regardless of the topological phase, thereby allowing us to reverse the direction of flow of the transverse charge and heat currents. Further, we evaluate the components of the charge ($\sigma_{aa}$), thermoelectric ($\alpha_{aa}$), and thermal ($\kappa_{aa}$) conductivity tensors ($a=x, y$) and examine the effect of light on them. With a linear dispersion along the $y$-direction, we find that $\alpha_{yy}$ and $\kappa_{yy}$ are significantly larger than $\alpha_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{xx}$, respectively, due to the much larger squared Dirac velocity $v_y^2$ compared to $v_x^2$.

Title: Stability of discrete-symmetry flocks: sandwich state, traveling domains and motility-induced pinning
Authors: Swarnajit Chatterjee, Mintu Karmakar, Matthieu Mangeat, Heiko Rieger, Raja Paul
Abstract: Polar flocks in discrete active systems are often assumed to be robust, yet recent studies reveal their fragility under both imposed and spontaneous fluctuations. Here, we revisit the four-state active Potts model (APM) and show that its globally ordered phase is metastable across a broad swath of parameter space. Small counter-propagating droplets disrupt the flocking phase by inducing a persistent sandwich state, where the droplet-induced opposite-polarity lane remains embedded within the original flock, particularly pronounced at low noise, influenced by spatial anisotropy. In contrast, small transversely propagating droplets, when introduced into the flock, can trigger complete phase reversal due to their alignment orthogonal to the dominant flow and their enhanced persistence. At low diffusion and strong self-propulsion, such transverse droplets also emerge spontaneously, fragmenting the flock into multiple traveling domains and giving rise to a short-range order (SRO) regime. We further identify a motility-induced pinning (MIP) transition in small diffusion and low-temperature regimes when particles of opposite polarity interact, flip their state, hop, and pin an interface. Our comprehensive phase diagrams, encompassing full reversal, sandwich coexistence, stripe bands, SRO, and MIP, delineate how thermal fluctuations, self-propulsion strength, and diffusion govern flock stability in discrete active matter systems.

Title: Unveiling the electronic structure of the charge density wave and topological semimetal TaTe4 through high-field magnetotransport measurements
Authors: D. Silvera-Vega, J. Rojas-Castillo, E. Herrera-Vasco, E. Ramos-Rodríguez, A. F. Santander-Syro, J. A. Galvis, B. Uribe, R. González-Hernández, A. C. García-Castro, P. Giraldo-Gallo
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between topology and correlated electron states is central to the study of quantum materials. TaTe$_4$, a charge density wave (CDW) compound predicted to host topological phases, offers a platform to explore this interplay. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the Fermi surface (FS) of TaTe$_4$ via high-field magnetotransport measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Using three distinct field-current configurations, we resolve four out of five FS pockets predicted in the CDW phase, with no evidence of residual non-CDW features - in contrast to recent ARPES studies. Remarkably, we identify a previously unobserved quasi-cylindrical hole pocket and a high-frequency quantum oscillation contribution to the magnetoresistance attributable to magnetic breakdown between reconstructed FS sheets, from which we estimate a CDW gap of $\sim$0.29 eV. Additionally, we observe a robust linear magnetoresistance (MR) for all field orientations when current flows along the $a-$axis, with a distinct high-field linear MR regime emerging near the $c-$axis, consistent with FS hot spots and magnetic breakdown. Our results establish TaTe$_4$ as a paradigmatic system where CDW-driven FS reconstruction governs the bulk electronic structure, enabling new routes to probe the novel physics that can arise in the intersection between correlated electronic states and topological band features.

Title: Consciousness as a Jamming Phase
Authors: Kaichen Ouyang
Abstract: This paper develops a neural jamming phase diagram that interprets the emergence of consciousness in large language models as a critical phenomenon in high-dimensional disordered this http URL establishing analogies with jamming transitions in granular matter and other complex systems, we identify three fundamental control parameters governing the phase behavior of neural networks: temperature, volume fraction, and this http URL theory provides a unified physical explanation for empirical scaling laws in artificial intelligence, demonstrating how computational cooling, density optimization, and noise reduction collectively drive systems toward a critical jamming surface where generalized intelligence emerges. Remarkably, the same thermodynamic principles that describe conventional jamming transitions appear to underlie the emergence of consciousness in neural networks, evidenced by shared critical signatures including divergent correlation lengths and scaling this http URL work explains neural language models' critical scaling through jamming physics, suggesting consciousness is a jamming phase that intrinsically connects knowledge components via long-range correlations.

Title: Corner-Sharing PS$_4$-BS$_4$ Modes Facilitate Fast Ion Conduction in Lithium Thioborophosphate Iodide Glassy Solid Electrolytes
Authors: Yun An
Abstract: Glassy solid electrolytes (GSEs), with their amorphous nature and the absence of grain boundaries, make them highly attractive for applications in all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), a leading candidate for next-generation energy storage technologies. A recently developed lithium thioborophosphate iodide GSE, composed of 30Li$_2$S-25B$_2$S$_3$-45LiI-5P$_2$S$_5$ (LBPSI), has demonstrated excellent room-temperature ionic conductivity and low activation energy. Despite this exciting finding, the underlying mechanism behind this ultrafast ion transport remains ambiguous. Here, we accurately fine-tune the foundational MACE-MP-0 model and perform large-scale machine learning molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural and ion dynamics in LBPSI GSE. Our results reveal that B$_2$S$_3$ glass formers primarily form multi-bridged B$_x$S$_y$ long-chain networks that impede Li$^+$ conduction. In contrast, P$_2$S$_5$ gives rise to mono-tetrahedral PS$_4$$^{3-}$ and di-tetrahedral P$_2$S$_7$$^{4-}$ tetrahedra, which engage in distinctive corner-sharing modes with BS$_4$$^{5-}$ tetrahedra, effectively disrupting the B$_x$S$_y$ chains and enhancing Li$^+$ mobility. Furthermore, the polyhedral anion rotations of PS$_4$$^{3-}$ and BS$_4$$^{5-}$ in the corner-sharing PS$_4$-BS$_4$ motifs may further promote fast Li$^+$ conduction.

Title: Symmetry and Thermodynamic Bounds on Cross-Coupling Transport in Chiral Liquid Crystals
Authors: Shunsuke Takano, Takuya Nakanishi, Kenta Nakagawa, Toru Asahi
Abstract: We reformulate the Leslie effects that describe the dynamic cross-couplings in chiral liquid crystals driven by the transport of heat, electric charge, and mass. The Ericksen--Leslie model is extended in the linear response framework by representing nematic order with the Q-tensor. Subsequently, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation is applied to identify the upper bounds of the Leslie cross-coupling coefficients. We reveal that the cross-coupling coefficients are dependent on the scalar order parameter and vanish in the isotropic phase. In addition, the chirality of the phase allows torque induced by a transport current parallel to the director. The mutual signs of the Leslie thermohydrodynamic and thermomechanical coefficients are likely to be opposite in calamitic liquid crystals, as suggested by recent experimental observations. Our model is applicable to the thermal, chemical, and electrical Leslie effects. The present arguments suggest that a common underlying principle may govern both the Leslie effects and the thermal Edelstein effect in chiral solid crystals attributed to chiral phonons.

Title: Thermoelectric optimization and quantum-to-classical crossover in gate-controlled two-dimensional semiconducting nanojunctions
Authors: Yu-Chang Chen, Yu-Chen Chang
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric performance of 2D nanojunctions with gate tunable architectures and varying channel lengths from 3 to 12 nm using a combination of first principles simulations, including density functional theory, DFT with nonequilibrium Greens function formalism (nanoDCAL), and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our study reveals a gate, temperature, and length dependent transition from quantum to classical in electron transport, transitioning from quantum tunneling in short junctions to thermionic emission in longer ones. We observe nontrivial dependencies of the thermoelectric figure of merit on the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivities, and thermal conductivities as a result of this crossover and gate controlling. We identify that maximizing ZT requires tuning the chemical potential just outside the band gap, where the system lies at the transition between insulating and conducting regimes. While extremely large Seebeck coefficients are observed in the insulating state, they do not yield high ZT due to suppressed electrical conductivity and dominant phononic thermal transport. The optimal ZT larger than 2.3 is achieved in the shortest 3 nm junction at 500 K, where quantum tunneling and thermionic emission coexist. These findings offer fundamental insights into transport mechanisms in 2D semiconducting nanojunctions and present design principles for high efficiency nanoscale thermoelectric devices.

Title: Validity of perturbation theory in calculations of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in Co-based layered systems
Authors: M. Cinal
Abstract: Validity of second-order perturbation theory (PT) is examined for magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) energy in Co films with enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Co/Pt bilayers. Comparison with accurate results obtained with the force theorem (FT) reveals significant discrepancies in the dependence of the MCA energy on the Co thickness. For systems with strong SOC, the PT fails to correctly describe the oscillations of the MCA energy, largely overestimating their amplitude and even failing (for Co/Pt bilayers) to reproduce their specific periodicity. These failures specifically concern the dominating oscillations with the 2-monolayer period which arise from pairs of quantum well (QW) minority-spin d states in the Co layer, degenerate at the centre of the Brillouin zone (BZ). A simplified model of such states demonstrates that the large discrepancies between PT and FT predictions arise from the breakdown of the PT in a region around the BZ centre where the energy spacing between states within each pair is small compared to the SOC strength. The oscillation amplitude of the MCA energy calculated with the FT is limited by the finite energy spacing between consecutive QW pairs, whereas this amplitude grows quadratically with the SOC strength in the PT calculations. Furthermore, for weak and moderate SOC strengths, the accuracy of the PT diminishes with increasing the ratio of the SOC constant to temperature. This explains why the PT overestimates the amplitude of MCA energy oscillations at low temperatures, even for the Co film with a relatively weak nominal SOC. For the Co/Pt bilayer, the strong temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude in the PT approach leads to the MCA energies markedly different at low and zero temperatures, of opposite sign and several times larger in magnitude, compared to the FT results.

Title: Symmetry-based theory of Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic crystals: Coupling to the spin connection
Authors: Ana Djordjević, Marija Dimitrijević Ćirić, Vladimir Juričić
Abstract: Discrete fermionic and bosonic models for hyperbolic lattices have attracted significant attention across a range of fields since the experimental realization of hyperbolic lattices in metamaterial platforms, sparking the development of hyperbolic crystallography. However, a fundamental and experimentally consequential aspect remains unaddressed: fermions propagating in curved space inherently couple to the underlying geometry via the spin connection, as required by general covariance - a feature not yet incorporated in studies of hyperbolic crystals. Here, we introduce a symmetry-based framework for Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic lattices, explicitly incorporating spin-curvature coupling via a discrete spin connection. Starting from the continuous symmetries of the Poincaré disk, we classify the irreducible representations and construct a symmetry-adapted basis, establishing a direct correspondence to the continuum Dirac theory. We show that this continuum theory predicts a finite density of states at zero energy for any finite curvature in $D-$dimensional hyperbolic space with $2\leq D \leq 4$, suggesting enhanced susceptibility of Dirac fermions to interaction-driven instabilities at weak coupling. We then derive explicit forms of discrete translational and rotational symmetries for lattices characterized by Schläfli symbols $\{p,q\}$, and explicitly construct the discrete spin connection, represented as hopping phases, via parallel transport. Our results pave the way for experimental realization of spin-curvature effects in metamaterial platforms and systematic numerical studies of correlated Dirac phases in hyperbolic geometries.

Title: Sensitive infrared surface photovoltage in quasi-equilibrium in a layered semiconductor at low-intensity low-temperature condition
Authors: Qiang Wan, Keming Zhao, Guohao Dong, Enting Li, Tianyu Yang, Hao Wang, Yaobo Huang, Yao Wen, Yiwei Li, Jun He, Youguo Shi, Hong Ding, Nan Xu
Abstract: Benefit to layer-dependent bandgap, van der Waals materials with surface photovoltaic effect (SPV) enable photodetection over a tunable wavelength range with low power consumption. However, sensitive SPV in the infrared region, especially in a quasi-steady illumination condition, is still elusive in layered semiconductors. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we report a sensitive SPV in quasi-equilibrium in NbSi0.5Te2, with photoresponsivity up to 2.4*10^6 V/(W*cm^(-2)) at low intensity low temperature condition (LILT). The sensitive SPV is further confirmed by observing the Dember effect, where the photogenerated carrier density is high enough and diffusion currents suppress SPV. Temperature-dependent measurements indicate that intrinsic carriers freezing at low temperature leads to the ultrahigh photoresponse, while a small amount of photon-generated carriers in quasi-equilibrium dominate the system. Our work not only provides a promising layered semiconductor for Infrared optoelectronic devices with strong infrared SPV at LILT, which has application potential in fields such as quantum information and deep-space exploration, but also paves a novel way to enhance light-matter interaction effect by freezing bulk carriers.

Title: Anomalous diffusion in coupled viscoelastic media: A fractional Langevin equation approach
Authors: Chan Lim, Jae-Hyung Jeon
Abstract: Anomalous diffusion often arises in complex environments where viscoelastic or crowded conditions influence particle motion. In many biological and soft-matter systems, distinct components of the medium exhibit unique viscoelastic responses, resulting in time-dependent changes in the observed diffusion exponents. Here, we develop a theoretical model of two particles, each embedded in a distinct viscoelastic medium, and coupled via a harmonic potential. By formulating and solving a system of coupled fractional Langevin equations (FLEs) with memory exponents $0<\alpha<\beta\leq 1$, we uncover rich transient anomalous diffusion phenomena arising from the interplay of memory kernels and bilinear coupling. Notably, we identify recovery dynamics, where a subdiffusive particle ($\alpha$) transiently accelerates and eventually regains its intrinsic long-time mobility. This recovery emerges only when memory exponents differ ($\alpha<\beta$), whereas identical exponents ($\alpha=\beta$) suppress recovery. Our theoretical predictions offer insight into experimentally observed transient anomalous diffusions, such as polymer--protein complexes and cross-linked cytoskeletal networks, highlighting the critical role of memory heterogeneity and mechanical interactions in biological anomalous diffusion.

Title: Rocksalt rare-earth monoxides as electronic and magnetic materials
Authors: Tomoteru Fukumura, Satoshi Sasaki, Masamichi Negishi, Daichi Oka
Abstract: Stable binary rare earth (RE) oxides are usually trivalent RE ion sesquioxides (RE2O3), that are highly insulating and either nonmagnetic or antiferromagnetic. On the other hand, rocksalt-type divalent RE ion monoxides (REOs) have been scarcely synthesized owing to their metastable nature. Accordingly, their fundamental properties have not been unveiled. Recently, thin film epitaxy was successfully applied to synthesize various REOs. In stark contrast with RE2O3, REOs are highly electrically conducting, and exhibit superconductivity, room temperature ferromagnetism, and so on. Therefore, REOs are new and simple f-electron system, promising as electronic, magnetic, and spintronic materials. In this review, their fundamental properties are introduced, and their significance and future prospects are discussed toward a new paradigm in f-electron systems.

Title: Quantized order parameters of approximate symmetry for metals and insulators
Authors: Yasuhiro Tada
Abstract: We develop a simple scheme to distinguish between metals and insulators, or more generally gapless and gapped phases, by introducing the notion of an approximate symmetry order parameter. For one dimensional systems, we provide an explicit proof for the known criteria of metals and insulators based on the polarization operator which have been widely accepted for decades without a rigorous proof. For higher dimensions, we introduce a tiny magnetic flux to control the system, where the translation symmetry becomes approximate. We show that insulators and metals can be well distinguished with use of the approximate symmetry operators and they work as quantized order parameters in the thermodynamic limit characterizing gapless and gapped nature of the system.

Title: Control of nonreciprocal charge transport in topological insulator/superconductor heterostructures with Fermi level tuning and superconducting-layer thickness
Authors: Soma Nagahama, Yuki Sato, Minoru Kawamura, Ilya Belopolski, Ryutaro Yoshimi, Atsushi Tsukazaki, Naoya Kanazawa, Kei S Takahashi, Masashi Kawasaki, Yoshinori Tokura
Abstract: Nonreciprocal charge transport (NCT) is defined as a phenomenon where electrical resistance depends on the current direction. It has been drawing much attention because it sensitively reflects the symmetry breaking of material systems. A topological insulator (TI)/superconductor (SC) heterostructure where the topological surface state (TSS) of the TI layer is proximitized with the SC layer is one such system that presents a sizable NCT due to a large spin-orbit coupling and superconductivity. Here, we report a control of the magnitude and sign of NCT: reversal of the direction of NCT by tuning the Fermi energy of TSS of the TI layer with respect to the charge neutral point by systematic regulation of Sb composition $x$ in a TI/SC heterostructures of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$/FeSe$_{0.1}$Te$_{0.9}$. The result is consistent with the model of a TSS proximitized with superconductivity. Furthermore, we find a significant enhancement of the magnitude of NCT in the TI/SC heterostructures by reducing the thickness of the SC layer. The enhancement can be ascribed to the inversion-symmetry breaking of the FeSe$_{0.1}$Te$_{0.9}$ SC-layer itself adjacent to the TI layer. Our results highlight the essential role of the TSS for exhibiting NCT and offer new knobs to control the direction and magnitude of NCT.

Title: Electronic and optical properties of the thio-apatites phases Ba$_5$(VS$_α$O$_β$)$_3$X [X=Cl, F, Br, I]: impact of multiple anionic substitution
Authors: Smritijit Sen, Houria Kabbour
Abstract: A systematic study of the electronic structure and optical properties of the thio-apatites Ba$_5$(VS$_{\alpha}$O$_{\beta}$)$_3$X (X= Cl, F, Br, I) is carried out through first principles density functional theory simulations. The band gap and properties evolution from fluorine to iodine on fixed O/S ratios, as well as by substituting sulfur (S) for oxygen (O) are discussed. The reduction of the band gap by raising valence band energy levels, with an increasing S/O ratio can also be further modulated by the type of halide in the channels of the structure, thus promoting fine tuning of the band gap region. Defect states also play a crucial role in band gap modulation. Furthermore, the examination of the band edges properties in Ba$_5$(VS$_{\alpha}$O$_{\beta}$)$_3$X compounds suggests they can be potential photocatalysts candidates for the water splitting reaction, with reduced band gaps enabling efficient light-driven reactions, particularly in Ba$_5$(VS$_{\alpha}$O$_{\beta}$)$_3$I. Optical investigations reveal that sulfur doping induces optical anisotropy, enhancing light absorption and offering tailored optical behaviour. These results provide new insights for the design of functional materials in the broad family of apatites.

Title: Nanoscale symmetry protection of the reciprocal acoustoelectric effect
Authors: Sandeep Vijayan, Stephan Suffit, Scott E. Cooper, Yejun Feng
Abstract: Neumann's principle states that all physical properties of a material are bound by its symmetry. While bulk crystals follow well-defined point and space groups, phenomena at a substrate's surface could have less apparent symmetry origins. Here we experimentally explore both reciprocal and non-reciprocal types of acoustoelectric (AE) effects driven by surface acoustic waves (SAW). The non-reciprocal AE voltage is connected to the natural single-phase unidirectional transducer from device engineering. On the other hand, reciprocal AE effect exists in certain SAW configurations that are of different symmetry origins. Half of the configurations have a valid reciprocity-preserving symmetry element of either a mirror plane or an even-order rotational axis that is perpendicular to the substrate surface. The other half of the configurations do not possess reciprocity-preserving symmetry operations of the half-space but have the SAW propagation and the surface normal directions interchanged from the first scenario. Here, the reciprocity of SAW states is protected by the symmetric structure of the nanoscale strain tensor. The correspondence between two types of configurations has its origin imbedded in the SAW composition of both compression and shear waves along two orthogonal directions respectively.

Title: Interfacially ordered phase states enable high-strength ductile eutectic Al alloys
Authors: Hemant Kumar, Praveen Kumar, Dierk Raabe, Baptiste Gault, Surendra Kumar Makineni
Abstract: Lightweight, high-strength structural materials are component enablers in transportation and aerospace, improving carbon footprint and fuel efficiency. Aluminium (Al)-based eutectics have property combinations that qualify them for such applications. However, they are prone to catastrophic failure because of insufficient load transfer across the interfaces between the brittle eutectic phase and the ductile matrix. Here we present a general solution to this problem by engineering these interfaces at the atomic scale, equipping them with excellent load transfer capabilities, thus qualifying such composites for lightweight structural applications. We demonstrate the approach by adding Zr to an Al-Gd-based hypoeutectic alloy, promoting the formation of a coherent Interfacial-Ordered-Phase (IOP) around the brittle Al3Gd eutectic phase and nanosized core-shell ordered precipitates in the primary Al matrix. This enables a 400% increase in tensile plasticity while retaining a high tensile strength of 295 MPa at room temperature and 130 MPa at 250C. This exceptional increase in formability is attributed to the ability of the IOP layer to prevent dislocations from accumulating at the weak fibre/matrix interfaces, avoiding stress concentrations that would otherwise initiate fibre breakage and debonding. The core-shell precipitates in Al cause a large number of dislocation cross/multiple-slips on different {111} planes, forming ultra-fine (10 nm) dislocation networks that leverage substantial plastic strain accumulation. The approach shows how atomic interface design overcomes the ductility limitations of lightweight high-strength ductile eutectic alloys for structural applications.

Title: Enhanced dispersion of active microswimmers in confined flows
Authors: Marc Lagoin (LOMA), Juliette Lacherez (LOMA), Guirec de Tournemire (LOMA), Ahmad Badr (LOMA), Yacine Amarouchene (LOMA), Antoine Allard (LOMA, UB), Thomas Salez (LOMA)
Abstract: In the presence of a laminar shear flow, the diffusion of passive colloidal particles is enhanced in the direction parallel to the flow. This classical phenomenon is known as Taylor-Aris dispersion. Besides, microorganisms, such as active microswimmers, exhibit an effective diffusive behavior at long times. Combining the two ingredients above, a natural question then emerges on how the effective diffusion of active microswimmers is altered in shear flows - a widespread situation in natural environments with practical implications, e.g. regarding biofilm formation. In this Letter, we investigate the motility and dispersion of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii microalgae, within a rectangular microfluidic channel subjected to a sinusoidal Poiseuille flow. Using high-resolution optical microscopy and a particle-tracking algorithm, we reconstruct individual trajectories in various flow conditions and statistically analyze them through moment theory and wavelet decomposition. We find that the velocity fluctuations and the dispersion coefficient increase as the flow amplitude is increased, with only weak dependencies on the flow periodicity. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the generalization of Taylor-Aris law to active particles is valid.

Title: The effects of knot topology on the collapse of active polymers
Authors: Davide Breoni, Emanuele Locatelli, Luca Tubiana
Abstract: We use numerical simulations to study tangentially active flexible ring polymers with different knot topologies. Simple, unknotted active rings display a collapse transition upon increasing the degree of polymerization. We find that topology has a significant effect on the polymer size at which the collapse takes place, with twist knots collapsing earlier than torus knots. Increasing knot complexity further accentuates this difference, as the collapse point of torus knots grows linearly and that of twist knots shrinks, eventually canceling the actively stretched regime altogether. This behavior is a consequence of the ordered configuration of torus knots in their stretched active state, featuring an effective alignment for non-neighboring bonds which increases with the minimal crossing number. Twist knots do not feature ordered configurations or bond alignment, increasing the likelihood of collisions, leading to collapse. These results yield a degree of control on the collapse point of active ring polymers, as it can be tuned by changing the topology.

Title: Learning the bulk and interfacial physics of liquid-liquid phase separation
Authors: Silas Robitschko, Florian Sammüller, Matthias Schmidt, Robert Evans
Abstract: We use simulation-based supervised machine learning and classical density functional theory to investigate bulk and interfacial phenomena associated with phase coexistence in binary mixtures. For a prototypical symmetrical Lennard-Jones mixture our trained neural density functional yields accurate liquid-liquid and liquid-vapour binodals together with predictions for the variation of the associated interfacial tensions across the entire fluid phase diagram. From the latter we determine the contact angles at fluid-fluid interfaces along the line of triple-phase coexistence and confirm there can be no wetting transition in this symmetrical mixture.

Title: Strengthened correlations near [110] edges of $d$-wave superconductors in the t-J model with the Gutzwiller approximation
Authors: Ambjorn Joki, Mikael Fogelstrom, Tomas Lofwander
Abstract: We report results of a study of strongly correlated $d$-wave superconducting slabs within a t-J model solved using the statistically consistent Gutzwiller approach. For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.

Title: Thermodynamic theory of square skyrmion lattice in tetragonal frustrated antiferromagnets
Authors: Oleg I. Utesov, Danila P. Budylev
Abstract: High-temperature part of the phase diagram of tetragonal frustrated antiferromagnets is discussed within the framework of the mean-field approach. Based on recent experimental and theoretical studies, we consider a model including frustrated Heisenberg exchange, biquadratic exchange, anisotropic exchange, and magnetodipolar interaction. It is analytically demonstrated that a subtle interplay among these interactions results in a variety of phase diagrams in the temperature-magnetic field plane. We argue that the phase diagram obtained for the easy axis along the high-symmetry direction $[001]$ and moderate biquadratic exchange reproduces all crucial features of the phase diagram experimentally observed for~\gdru~compound. The topological properties of the respective double-modulated square skyrmion lattice phase are discussed. The developed analytical approach can also be useful for the refinement of the microscopic model parameters when comparing its predictions with experimental findings.

Title: Observation of quasi-steady dark excitons and gap phase in a doped semiconductor
Authors: Shangkun Mo, Yunfei Bai, Chunlong Wu, Xingxia Cui, Guangqiang Mei, Qiang Wan, Renzhe Li, Cao Peng, Keming Zhao, Dingkun Qin, Shuming Yu, Hao Zhong, Xingzhe Wang, Enting Li, Yiwei Li, Limin Cao, Min Feng, Sheng Meng, Nan Xu
Abstract: Exciton plays an important role in optics and optics-related behaviors and leads to novel correlated phases like charge order, exciton insulator, and exciton-polariton condensation. Dark exciton shows distinct properties from bright one. However, it cannot be directly detected by conventional optic measurements. The electronic modulation effect of dark excitons in quasi-equilibrium distribution, critical for electronic devices in working status, is still elusive. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we report creating, detecting, and controlling dark excitons in the quasi-equilibrium distribution in a doped semiconductor SnSe2. Surprisingly, we observe an excitonic gap phase, with a conduction band opening an anisotropic gap. Our results broaden the scope of dark excitons, extending their studies from the picosecond timescale in the ultrafast photoemission process to conditions occurring under quasi-equilibrium. We reveal the light-matter interaction in the engineering of electronic structures and provide a new way to realize the excitonic gap phase in semiconductors with large band gaps.

Title: A Cryogenic Uniaxial Strain Cell for Elastoresistance Measurements
Authors: Eckelt Franz, Cavallaro Isidoro, Wagner Ralph, Haghighirad Amir-Abbas, Wolf Thomas, Wilmers Jana, Bargmann Swantje, Hess Christian
Abstract: We present the design, implementation, and validation of a cryo-compatible strain cell for elastoresistance measurements in quantum materials. The cell is actuated by three large-format piezoelectric stacks and enables both compressive and tensile strain up to approximately $\pm5\%$. The relative displacement of the sample holders is measured in situ using a high-resolution capacitive displacement sensor, ensuring precise strain control throughout measurement. To operate the strain cell over a broad temperature range from 4.2\,K to 300\,K, a modular measurement probe was developed, allowing efficient thermal coupling and integration into cryogenic environments. The functionality and precision of the setup were demonstrated by elastoresistance measurements on the iron-based superconductor BaFe$_2$As$_2$ along the [110] direction. The results were validated against conventional techniques based on glued samples and strain gauges, showing excellent agreement in amplitude and temperature dependence of the elastoresistance coefficient. Additional tests revealed that the system remains robust under mechanical vibrations introduced by vacuum pumps, enabling stable operation even with liquid nitrogen cooling. This highlights the high mechanical and thermal reliability of the developed platform for low-temperature transport measurements under controlled uniaxial strain.

Title: Extending Nonlocal Kinetic Energy Density Functionals to Isolated Systems via a Density-Functional-Dependent Kernel
Authors: Liang Sun, Mohan Chen
Abstract: The Wang-Teter-like nonlocal kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) in the framework of orbital-free density functional theory, while successful in some bulk systems, exhibits a critical Blanc-Cances instability [J. Chem. Phys. 122, 214106 (2005)] when applied to isolated systems, where the total energy becomes unbounded from below. We trace this instability to the use of an ill-defined average charge density, which causes the functional to simultaneously violate the scaling law and the positivity of the Pauli energy. By rigorously constructing a density-functional-dependent kernel, we resolve these pathologies while preserving the formal exactness of the original framework. By systematically benchmarking single-atom systems of 56 elements, we find the resulting KEDF retains computational efficiency while achieving an order-of-magnitude accuracy enhancement over the WT KEDF. In addition, the new KEDF preserves WT's superior accuracy in bulk metals, outperforming the semilocal functionals in both regimes.

Title: Nonconserved critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model as a surface kinetic roughening process
Authors: Hector Vaquero del Pino, Rodolfo Cuerno
Abstract: We have revisited the non-conserved (or model A) critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model through numerical simulations of its lattice and continuum formulations --Glauber dynamics and the timedependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation, respectively--, to analyze them with current tools from surface kinetic roughening. Our study examines two critical quenches, one from an ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of which we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and the fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling ansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a critical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling, while a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth regime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to equilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby the linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions. For both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution functions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the non-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent fluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface model for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field (integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or faceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as well as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical quench from the ordered phase.

Title: Modulation of energy and angular momentum radiation of two-dimensional altermagnets
Authors: Yong-Mei Zhang, Zhi- Ping Niu
Abstract: This paper investigates the energy and angular momentum radiation of altermagnets under Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and external magnetic fields. Using an effective low-energy Hamiltonian, we derive electronic energy bands and calculate optical conductivity via the Kubo formula. Results show that RSOC strength, altermagnet interactions strength, and Neel vector direction notably affect the optical conductivity of altermagnet metals. Energy radiation is highly sensitive to Rashba spin-orbit coupling, with a saturation effect beyond a particular value, and its peak emission rate is lower than that of graphene due to reduced conductivity. Different from usual semi-conductor, semi-metal or Dirac materials, eg. graphene or silicene, altermagnets generate angular momentum radiation with specific Rashba spin-orbit coupling and altermagnet interaction strength. Angular momentum radiation is minimally reactive to Rashba spin-orbit coupling at low altermagnet interactions strength values but exhibits drastic oscillations between extreme values as altermagnet interactions strength reaches a critical point, showing high sensitivity. These findings suggest that adjusting these parameters can tailor altermagnet applications in spintronics and quantum technologies, potentially leading to innovative devices with customized radiation attributes.

Title: Coarse Graining Photo-Isomerization Reactions: Thermodynamic Consistency and Implications for Molecular Ratchets
Authors: Francesco Avanzini, Massimiliano Esposito, Emanuele Penocchio
Abstract: We formulate thermodynamically consistent coarse-graining procedures for molecular systems undergoing thermally and photo-induced transitions: starting from elementary vibronic transitions, we derive effective photo-isomerization reactions interconverting ground-state species. Crucially, the local detailed balance condition, that constrains reaction kinetics to thermodynamics, remains satisfied throughout the coarse-graining procedures. It applies to the effective photo-isomerization reactions just as it does to the elementary vibronic transitions. We then demonstrate that autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets operate via the same fundamental mechanism as chemically driven ones. Because the local detailed balance remains satisfied, autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets, like chemically driven ones, operate exclusively through an information ratchet mechanism. This reveals new key principles for their design and optimization.

Title: Virtual walks in the Ising model: a different criticality in two dimensions?
Authors: Amit Pradhan, Parongama Sen, Sagnik Seth
Abstract: The dynamics of the spins in the Ising model are analysed using a virtual walk scenario. The system is quenched from a very high temperature to a lower one using the Glauber scheme. A walk is associated with each spin which evolves according to the current state of the spin. The known critical temperatures can be accurately detected in both one and two dimensions using the properties of the distribution of the displacements of the walkers. In one dimension, exponentially diverging quantities are obtained close to zero temperature. In two dimensions, a second type of walk involving local energies is considered and several quantities are found to exhibit power law behavior near the critical point. The results in two dimensions suggest an unconventional phase transition occurring in terms of the walk dynamics at the known critical temperature.

Title: The viscoelastic rheology of transient diffusion creep
Authors: John F. Rudge
Abstract: Polycrystalline materials have a viscoelastic rheology where the strains produced by stresses depend on the timescale of deformation. Energy can be stored elastically within grain interiors and dissipated by a variety of different mechanisms. One such dissipation mechanism is diffusionally-accommodated/-assisted grain boundary sliding, also known as transient diffusion creep. Here we detail a simple reference model of transient diffusion creep, based on finite element calculations with simple grain shapes: a regular hexagon in 2D and a tetrakaidecadedron in 3D. The linear viscoelastic behaviour of the finite element models can be well described by a parameterised extended Burgers model, which behaves as a Maxwell model at low frequencies and as an Andrade model at high frequencies. The parametrisation has a specific relaxation strength, Andrade exponent and Andrade time. The Andrade exponent depends only on the angles at which grains meet at triple junctions, and can be related to the exponents of stress singularities that occur at triple junctions in purely elastic models without diffusion. A comparison with laboratory experiments shows that the simple models here provide a lower bound on the observed attenuation. However, there are also clearly additional dissipative processes occurring in laboratory experiments that are not described by these simple models.

Title: Quantum register based on double quantum dots in semiconductor nanowires
Authors: Vladimir Vyurkov, Leonid Fedichkin, Igor Semenikhin, Denis Drozhzhin, Konstantin Rudenko, Vladimir Lukichev
Abstract: An implementation of a universal solid-state quantum register based on electron space states in field-defined double quantum dots (DQD possesses one electron in two adjacent tunnel bound dots) in an ultrathin semiconductor nanowire is discussed. To some extent, the structure resembles that of a field-effect transistor with multiple controlling electrodes (gates). Scalability is audible and it opens up a possibility of large-scale quantum computer fabricated by advanced silicon technology. Moreover, the structure could be developed into an ensemble quantum register where instead of single nanowire an array of them with common controlling electrodes and contacts is fabricated. This ensemble register is much more resistant against environment noise caused by phonons and stray charges due to averaging and compensation. It is crucial that an individual qubit consists of two DQDs. The basic states of that qubit correspond to symmetric state of one DQD and antisymmetric state of another, and vice versa. Then the quantum information can be encoded and processed without charge transfer between dots. The probability to find an electron in a dot constantly equals 1/2 thus the Coulomb interaction between DQDs is also constant. Although the Coulomb interaction is incessant, the strength of its action depends on mutual states of interacting DQDs (in-resonance or off-resonance). Therefore, a quantum algorithm could be effectuated via manipulation solely with steady and pulse gate potentials that reminds an operation of a digital integrated circuit. The final read-out of the register is performed after decoding into charge states of DQDs and a transmission of current through the wire.

Title: Hydrogen toggling between Yoshimori spin spirals and elliptical Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya skyrmions in Fe on Ir(110)
Authors: Timo Knispel, Vasily Tseplyaev, Gustav Bihlmayer, Stefan Blügel, Thomas Michely, Jeison Fischer
Abstract: Skyrmions are particle-like spin textures that arise from spin spiral states in the presence of an external magnetic field. These spirals can originate from either frustrated Heisenberg exchange interactions or the interplay between exchange interactions and the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, leading to atomic- and mesoscale textures, respectively. However, the conversion of exchange-stabilized spin spirals into skyrmions typically requires magnetic fields that exceed practical laboratory limits. Here, we demonstrate a strategy leveraging hydrogen adsorption to expand the range of magnetic films capable of hosting stable or metastable skyrmions. In a structurally open and anisotropic system of two pseudomorphic Fe layers on Ir(110), spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy combined with ab initio calculations reveals that a right-handed, exchange-stabilized Néel-type spin spiral propagating along the [$\overline{1}10$] direction with a $1.3$~nm period transitions upon hydrogen adsorption to a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type spiral with a sevenfold longer period of $8.5$~nm. This transition enables elliptical skyrmions to form at moderate magnetic fields. Hydrogenation thus provides a non-volatile mechanism to toggle between distinct magnetic states, offering a versatile platform for controlling spin textures.

Title: Phase analysis of Ising machines and their implications on optimization
Authors: Shu Zhou, K. Y. Michael Wong, Juntao Wang, David Shui Wing Hui, Daniel Ebler, Jie Sun
Abstract: Ising machines, which are dynamical systems designed to operate in a parallel and iterative manner, have emerged as a new paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Despite computational advantages, the quality of solutions depends heavily on the form of dynamics and tuning of parameters, which are in general set heuristically due to the lack of systematic insights. Here, we focus on optimal Ising machine design by analyzing phase diagrams of spin distributions in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. We find that that the ground state can be achieved in the phase where the spin distribution becomes binary, and optimal solutions are produced where the binary phase and gapless phase coexist. Our analysis shows that such coexistence phase region can be expanded by carefully placing a digitization operation, giving rise to a family of superior Ising machines, as illustrated by the proposed algorithm digCIM.

Title: Emergent Softening and Stiffening Dictate Transport of Active Filaments
Authors: Bipul Biswas, Prasanna More, Hima Nagamanasa Kandula
Abstract: Active semiflexible filaments are crucial in various biophysical processes, yet insights into their single-filament behavior have predominantly relied on theory and simulations, owing to the scarcity of controllable synthetic systems. Here, we present an experimental platform of active semiflexible filaments composed of dielectric colloidal particles, activated by an alternating electric field that induces contractile or extensile electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flows. Our experiments reveal that contractile flow generating filaments undergo softening, significantly expanding the range of accessible conformations, whereas filaments composed of extensile flow monomers exhibit active stiffening. By independently tuning filament elasticity and activity, we demonstrate that the competition between elastic restoring forces and emergent hydrodynamic interactions along the filament governs conformational dynamics. Crucially, we discover that the timescale of conformational dynamics directly governs transport behavior: enhanced fluctuations promote diffusion while stiffening facilitates directed propulsion of nonlinear filaments. Together, our direct visualization studies elucidate the links between inherent filament properties, microscopic activity, and emergent transport while establishing a versatile experimental platform of synthetic filamentous active matter.

Abstract: Abinit is a widely used scientific software package implementing density functional theory and many related functionalities for excited states and response properties. This paper presents the novel features and capabilities, both technical and scientific, which have been implemented over the past 5 years. This evolution occurred in the context of evolving hardware platforms, high-throughput calculation campaigns, and the growing use of machine learning to predict properties based on databases of first principles results. We present new methodologies for ground states with constrained charge, spin or temperature; for density functional perturbation theory extensions to flexoelectricity and polarons; and for excited states in many-body frameworks including GW, dynamical mean field theory, and coupled cluster. Technical advances have extended abinit high-performance execution to graphical processing units and intensive parallelism. Second principles methods build effective models on top of first principles results to scale up in length and time scales. Finally, workflows have been developed in different community frameworks to automate \abinit calculations and enable users to simulate hundreds or thousands of materials in controlled and reproducible conditions.

Title: Band Meandering due to Charged Impurity Effects and Carrier Transport in Ternary Topological Insulators
Authors: Kanav Sharma, Niranjay K R, Radha Krishna Gopal, Chiranjib Mitra
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the impact of charged impurities on the electrical properties of the topological insulator $\left(\mathrm{Bi}_{0.3} \mathrm{Sb}_{0.7}\right)_2 \mathrm{Te}_3$ (BST) and its indium-doped counterpart, $\mathrm{In}_{0.14}\left(\mathrm{Bi}_{0.3} \mathrm{Sb}_{0.7}\right)_{1.86} \mathrm{Te}_3$ (IBST), using field-effect gating. For thin BST (30 nm), charged impurities, potentially from silicon dioxide substrate traps, contribute to band tail-type localization, with the impurity density ($ n_{\text{imp}} = 10^{11} \text{ cm}^{-2} $) suggesting an external influence, though quantitative confirmation is needed. In contrast, thick BST (60 nm) exhibits potential fluctuations driven by inherent impurities ($ n_{\text{imp}} = 2.23 \times 10^{14} \text{ cm}^{-2} $), forming electron-rich (n-type) and hole-rich (p-type) regions that cause band meandering near the chemical potential. Indium doping in thin IBST significantly increases the impurity density to $ 1.53 \times 10^{15} \text{ cm}^{-2} $, exacerbating these fluctuations and reducing mobility due to enhanced scattering. Gate-dependence analysis further revealed a temperature-driven transition from n-type to p-type characteristics at elevated temperatures (~170 K), attributed to thermal activation of holes in p-type regions. These findings highlight the critical role of impurity management in optimizing topological insulators for applications in spintronics and quantum computing.

Title: Local persistence exponent and its log-periodic oscillations
Authors: Yilin Ye, Denis S. Grebenkov
Abstract: We investigate the local persistence exponent of the survival probability of a particle diffusing near an absorbing self-similar boundary. We show by extensive Monte Carlo simulations that the local persistence exponent exhibits log-periodic oscillations over a broad range of timescales. We determine the period and mean value of these oscillations in a family of Koch snowflakes of different fractal dimensions. The effect of the starting point and its local environment on this behavior is analyzed in depth by a simple yet intuitive model. This analysis uncovers how spatial self-similarity of the boundary affects the diffusive dynamics and its temporal characteristics in complex systems.

Title: Chiral-split magnons in the S = 1 Shastry-Sutherland model
Authors: Absur Khan Siam, Se Kwon Kim
Abstract: In ferromagnets, magnons have only one chirality; while in common antiferromagnets, bands with opposite chiralities are degenerate across the Brillouin zone. Recent studies have shown that it is possible to observe non-degenerate bands of opposite chiralities in altermagnetic materials. Here we take the S = 1 Shastry-Sutherland model, which shows the collinear Néel (I) phase, and investigate the magnon band structure showing alternate chirality-splitting and the resulting transport properties. In magnon bands, we find a notable feature of the chirality-split magnon bands, and the split is opposite along two different directions in the Brillouin zone. We also calculate the spin and thermal conductivities using Kubo formalism. Our calculations show robust spin Seebeck and spin Nernst effects due to the alternating chirality split across the Brillouin zone, without any external magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Granular jamming and rheology in microgravity
Authors: Qing Yu, Thorsten Pöschel, Olfa D'Angelo
Abstract: Understanding how granular materials behave in low gravity is crucial for planetary science and space exploration. It can also help us understand granular phenomena usually hidden by gravity. On Earth, gravity dominates granular behavior, but disentangling its role from intrinsic particle interactions is challenging. We present a series of compression and shear experiments conducted in microgravity using the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) drop tower and GraviTower Bremen (GTB). Our in-house developed experimental setup enables precise measurement of packing density and in-situ shear stress via a Taylor-Couette rheometer. We find that the jamming transition occurs at lower packing density in microgravity than on Earth, confirming that gravity promotes densification. Rheological measurements further reveal that in microgravity, the lack of a secondary force field and predominance of cohesive interparticle forces increase the stress needed for granular media to flow. These findings highlight gravity's dual role in enhancing both compaction and flow, and demonstrate the need for tailored granular models, valid in low- and microgravity environments.

Title: Microscopic Scattering Approach to In-Gap States: Cr Adatoms on Superconducting β-Bi2Pd
Authors: Joseph Sink, Hari Paudyal, Divya Jyoti, Andreas J. Heinrich, Deung-Jang Choi, Nicolás Lorente, Michael E. Flatté
Abstract: We develop a microscopic scattering formalism to describe Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states due to a single Cr adatom on the Bi-terminated surface of $\beta-Bi_2Pd$, by combining ab initio Wannier functions with a real-space Green's function approach in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. Our framework reproduces key scanning tunneling spectroscopy features, including a single particle-hole asymmetric YSR peak and isotropic dIdV maps around the impurity. Decomposing the YSR states reveals contributions from four nearly degenerate C4v representations, with energy broadening masking their individual signatures. Spin-orbit coupling induces partial spin polarization, while the spatial asymmetry between particle and hole components arises from Cr d-Bi p hybridization. These results highlight the importance of realistic band structures and microscopic modeling for interpreting STM data and provide a foundation for studying impurity chains hosting topological excitations.

Abstract: In 1965, Kohn and Luttinger published a note revealing that dynamical screening of the repulsive Coulomb interaction leads under certain conditions to an effective attraction necessary for the formation of Cooper pairs. We propose such a formalism adapted to the cuprates where the screening arises from the superexchange dynamics of virtual holes in the oxygen orbitals of the $Cu O_2$ plane. Using an adequate Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, the basic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) method and the {\it ab initio} data on orbitals (energy, hopping, interaction), we derive some predictions for the temperature-doping phase diagram (pseudo-gap, strange metal, antiferromagnetism, superconducting and normal states) and for the doping dependant band energy spectrum in semi-quantitative agreement with observations.

Title: Interplay of polar order and positional order in liquid crystals -- observation of re-entrant ferroelectric nematic phase
Authors: Grant Strachan, Shona Ramsay, Marijus Juodka, Damian Pociecha, Jadwiga Szydlowska, John M.D. Storey, Natasa Vaupotic, Rebecca Walker, Ewa Gorecka
Abstract: We show that development of polar order may spontaneously destroy the lamellar structure of a liquid crystal. This results in an unusual sequence of phases with the ferroelectric nematic phase appearing below a non-polar smectic phase. The effect is related to unfavourable dipole interactions within the smectic layers and can be explained by Landau theory in which the temperature dependent term is non-monotonic as it is renormalized by spontaneous electric polarization.

Title: Suppression of Intertwined Density Waves in La$_4$Ni$_{3-x}$Cu$_x$O$_{10+δ}$
Authors: Stephen Zhang, Danrui Ni, Ruyi Ke, Guangming Cheng, Nan Yao, Robert J. Cava
Abstract: Superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ has been reported to emerge upon suppression of intertwined spin and charge density wave (SDW/CDW) order, suggesting a possible connection to the pairing mechanism. Here we report a systematic investigation of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3-x}$Cu$_{x}$O$_{10+\delta}$ ($0 \leq x \leq 0.7$), focusing on the evolution of the SDW/CDW order as a function of chemical substitution. Temperature-dependent resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and Hall effect measurements reveal a linear suppression of density wave transition temperature $T{\text{dw}}$ and a concurrent enhancement of hole concentration with increasing Cu content. At higher substitution levels ($x > 0.15$), the transition-induced anomaly in the resistivity becomes undetectable while a magnetic signature persists, indicating a partial decoupling of spin and charge components and the possible survival of short-range spin correlations. The absence of superconductivity across the substitution series highlights the importance of additional factors in stabilizing the superconducting state in pressurized La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$.

Title: Singular density correlations in chiral active fluids in three dimensions
Authors: Yuta Kuroda, Takeshi Kawasaki, Kunimasa Miyazaki
Abstract: We investigate density fluctuations in three-dimensional chiral active fluids by using a simple particle model of helical self-propelled particles. Each particle is driven by a self-propelled force and a constant uniaxial chiral torque, whose direction is identical for all particles. Due to the helical nature of the particle motion, the system is generically anisotropic even when it is spatially homogeneous. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the helicity induces an anisotropic pattern and a singularity in the static structure factor (the density correlation function in Fourier space) in the low-wavenumber limit. Moreover, the system in the limit of infinite persistence time exhibits hyperuniformity in the direction perpendicular to the chiral torque, while giant density fluctuations emerge along the parallel direction. We then construct a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory for the system to describe the singular behavior. A linear analysis of the resulting equations yields an analytical expression for the static structure factor, which qualitatively agrees with our numerical findings.

Title: Probing electron spin dynamics in single telecom InAs(P)/InP quantum dots using the Hanle effect
Authors: Maja Wasiluk, Helena Janowska, Anna Musiał, Johann P. Reithmaier, Mohamed Benyoucef, Wojciech Rudno-Rudziński
Abstract: Spins of carriers confined in quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidates for qubits due to their relatively long spin relaxation times. However, the electron spin dephasing, primarily driven by hyperfine interactions with nuclear spins, can limit their coherence. Here, we report the first Hanle effect demonstration in single InAs(P)/InP QDs emitting in the telecom C-band leading to experimental determination of electron spin dephasing time. Using polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we identified excitonic complexes and confirmed the presence of a negatively charged trion, exhibiting a degree of circular polarization (DOCP) of $-36\%$ under quasi--resonant excitation. From the analysis of Hanle linewidth and employing a previously reported value of the electron $g$-factor, we extracted an electron spin dephasing time of $T_2^{\ast} = 1.59 \pm 0.49~\mathrm{ns}$. Despite the large indium nuclear spin, the obtained $T_2^{\ast}$ is comparable to values reported for GaAs-based QDs, which we attribute to the larger volume of the InAs(P)/InP QDs. These findings confirm the potential of InP-based telecom QDs for use in spin-photon interfaces.

Abstract: We present a hardware realization and measurements of a tetron qubit device in a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure. The device architecture contains two parallel superconducting nanowires, which support four Majorana zero modes (MZMs) when tuned into the topological phase, and a trivial superconducting backbone. Two distinct readout interferometers are formed by connecting the superconducting structure to a series of quantum dots. We perform single-shot interferometric measurements of the fermion parity for the two loops, designed to implement Pauli-$X$ and $Z$ measurements of the tetron. Performing repeated single-shot measurements yields two widely separated time scales $\tau_X = 14.5\pm 0.3 \, \mathrm{\mu s}$ and $\tau_Z = 12.4\pm 0.4\, \mathrm{ms}$ for parity switches observed in the $X$ and $Z$ measurement loops, which we attribute to intra-wire parity switches and external quasiparticle poisoning, respectively. We estimate assignment errors of $\mathrm{err}^X_a=16\%$ and $\mathrm{err}^Z_a=0.5\%$ for $X$ and $Z$ measurement-based operations, respectively.

Title: Enhanced entanglement from quantum ergodicity
Authors: Amit Vikram
Abstract: The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling circuits such as random unitaries. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a "non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks.

Title: Real-Time Dynamics in a (2+1)-D Gauge Theory: The Stringy Nature on a Superconducting Quantum Simulator
Authors: Jesús Cobos, Joana Fraxanet, César Benito, Francesco di Marcantonio, Pedro Rivero, Kornél Kapás, Miklós Antal Werner, Örs Legeza, Alejandro Bermudez, Enrique Rico
Abstract: Understanding the confinement mechanism in gauge theories and the universality of effective string-like descriptions of gauge flux tubes remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. We probe string modes of motion with dynamical matter in a digital quantum simulation of a (2+1) dimensional gauge theory using a superconducting quantum processor with up to 144 qubits, stretching the hardware capabilities with quantum-circuit depths comprising up to 192 two-qubit layers. We realize the $Z_2$-Higgs model ($Z_2$HM) through an optimized embedding into a heavy-hex superconducting qubit architecture, directly mapping matter and gauge fields to vertex and link superconducting qubits, respectively. Using the structure of local gauge symmetries, we implement a comprehensive suite of error suppression, mitigation, and correction strategies to enable real-time observation and manipulation of electric strings connecting dynamical charges. Our results resolve a dynamical hierarchy of longitudinal oscillations and transverse bending at the end points of the string, which are precursors to hadronization and rotational spectra of mesons. We further explore multi-string processes, observing the fragmentation and recombination of strings. The experimental design supports 300,000 measurement shots per circuit, totaling 600,000 shots per time step, enabling high-fidelity statistics. We employ extensive tensor network simulations using the basis update and Galerkin method to predict large-scale real-time dynamics and validate our error-aware protocols. This work establishes a milestone for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics via superconducting quantum simulation and elucidates the real-time behavior of confining strings.

Abstract: Reducing materials and processing-induced decoherence is critical to the development of utility-scale quantum processors based on superconducting qubits. Here we report on the impact of two fluorine-based wet etches, which we use to treat the silicon surface underneath the Josephson junctions (JJs) of fixed-frequency transmon qubits made with aluminum base metallization. Using several materials analysis techniques, we demonstrate that these surface treatments can remove germanium residue introduced by our JJ fabrication with no other changes to the overall process flow. These surface treatments result in significantly improved energy relaxation times for the highest performing process, with median $T_1=334~\mu$s, corresponding to quality factor $Q=6.6\times10^6$. This result suggests that the metal-substrate interface directly underneath the JJs was a major contributor to microwave loss in these transmon qubit circuits prior to integration of these surface treatments. Furthermore, this work illustrates how materials analysis can be used in conjunction with quantum device performance metrics to improve performance in superconducting qubits.

Title: Noise-Enabled Goal Attainment in Crowded Collectives
Authors: Lucy Liu, Justin Werfel, Federico Toschi, L. Mahadevan
Abstract: In crowded environments, individuals must navigate around other occupants to reach their destinations. Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these spaces is relevant to coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure for dense populations. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and robotic experiments to study how noisy motion can disrupt traffic jams and enable flow as agents travel to individual goals. Above a critical noise level, large jams do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the goal attainment rate as a function of the noise level, then solve for the optimal agent density and noise level that maximize the swarm's goal attainment rate. We perform robotic experiments to corroborate our simulated and theoretical results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally efficient than a planner, suggesting lessons for real-world problems.

Title: Emergent Harmonics in Josephson Tunnel Junctions Due to Series Inductance

Abstract: Josephson tunnel junctions are essential elements of superconducting quantum circuits. The operability of these circuits presumes a $2\pi$-periodic sinusoidal potential of a tunnel junction, but higher-order corrections to this Josephson potential, often referred to as "harmonics," cause deviations from the expected circuit behavior. Two potential sources for these harmonics are the intrinsic current-phase relationship of the Josephson junction and the inductance of the metallic traces connecting the junction to other circuit elements. Here, we introduce a method to distinguish the origin of the observed harmonics using nearly-symmetric superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). Spectroscopic measurements of level transitions in multiple devices reveal features that cannot be explained by a standard cosine potential, but are accurately reproduced when accounting for a second-harmonic contribution to the model. The observed scaling of the second harmonic with Josephson-junction size indicates that it is due almost entirely to the trace inductance. These results inform the design of next-generation superconducting circuits for quantum information processing and the investigation of the supercurrent diode effect.

Title: Air-Stable Room-Temperature Quasi-2D Tin Iodide Perovskite Microlasers
Authors: Sangyeon Cho, Wenhao Shao, Jeong Hui Kim, Letian Dou, Seok-Hyun Yun
Abstract: Quasi-2D tin iodide perovskites (TIPs) are promising lead-free alternatives for optoelectronic applications, but achieving stable lasing remains challenging due to their limited environmental stability. Here, we report air-stable, room-temperature lasing from quasi-2D TIP microcrystals as small as 4 {\mu}m. Incorporation of the organic spacer 5IPA3 significantly enhanced the stability of these materials compared to previously reported TIPs. Lasing was observed from both dielectric (n=4) and plasmonic (n=3 and n=4) TIP microlasers. Under picosecond pumping, lasing was sustained for over 10^8 pump pulses in ambient conditions. These results represent a significant step toward practical photonic applications of tin-based perovskites.

Title: Exponential onset of scalable entanglement via twist-and-turn dynamics in XY models
Authors: Tommaso Roscilde, Meenu Kumari, Alexandre Cooper, Fabio Mezzacapo
Abstract: The efficient preparation of scalable multipartite entanglement is a central goal in the development of next-generation quantum devices. In this work, we show that the so-called ``twist-and-turn" (TaT) dynamics for interacting spin ensembles, generated by Hamiltonians with U(1)-symmetric interactions and with a transverse field, can offer an important resource to reach this goal. For models with sufficiently high connectivity, TaT dynamics exhibits two key features: 1) it features both scalable squeezing at short times, as well as quantum Fisher information with Heisenberg scaling at later times; and 2) scalable multipartite entanglement (up to Heisenberg scaling) is reached in a time growing only logarithmically with system size, associated with an exponential buildup of quantum correlations. These results can be shown exactly in the XY model with a Rabi field and infinite range interactions, and numerically in the case of spatially decaying XY interactions, such as dipolar interactions in two dimensions, provided that unstable spin-wave modes do not develop for large system sizes and/or strong fields. For dipolar interactions, the entanglement dynamics at intermediate times is completely at odds with thermalization; and it appears to saturate the maximum speed of entanglement buildup allowed by Lieb-Robinson bounds generalized to power-law interacting systems.

Title: Computational Study of the Spectral Properties of Isospectrally Patterned Lattices
Authors: Peter Schmelcher
Abstract: We perform a computational spectral analysis of different isospectrally patterned lattices (IPL). Having been introduced very recently, the lattice Hamiltonian of IPL consist of coupled cells which possess all the same set of eigenvalues. The latter is achieved in a controllable manner by parametrizing the cells via the phases of the involved orthogonal (or unitary) transformations. This opens the doorway of systematically designing lattice Hamiltonians with unique properties by choosing correspondingly varying phases across the lattice. Here we focus on two-dimensional cells and explore symmetric as well as asymmetric IPL w.r.t. a given center. A tunable fraction of localized vs. delocalized eigenstates belonging to the three subdomains of the corresponding energy bands is demonstrated and analyzed with different measures of localization. In the asymmetric case the center of localization can be shifted arbitrarily by shifting the underlying phase grid. Introducing a complete phase revolution leads for low and high energies to two well-separated branches of localized states which finally merge with increasing energy into the branch of delocalized states. Remarkably, the localized states appear in near-degenerate pairs and this near-degeneracy is lifted upon entering the delocalization regime. A corresponding generalization to several phase revolutions is provided showing a characteristic nodal pattern among the near-degenerate eigenstates.

Title: Continuous-time parametrization of neural quantum states for quantum dynamics
Authors: Dingzu Wang, Wenxuan Zhang, Xiansong Xu, Dario Poletti
Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schrödinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.

Title: Spin-Orbit Structure and Helicity Anomaly in Relativistic Electron Vortex Beams
Authors: Zhongze Guo, Bei Xu, Qiang Gu
Abstract: The relativistic electron vortex beam (REVB) has attracted increasing attention due to its nontrivial spin-orbit structure recently. As relativistic electrons are governed by the Dirac equation, exact solutions to this equation provide the most reliable starting point for understanding angular momentum characteristics of REVBs. In this work, a set of exact eigensolutions of the Dirac equation are derived in a complex cylindrical coordinate system using a generalized series expansion method. We demonstrate that the eigenstate carries net angular momentum with the vortex charge being the quantum number of the total angular momentum along the propagation direction and deduce the explicit expression for the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling strength. Furthermore, we show that helicity, which exhibits anomaly in the vortex state, can serve as a practical characterizing quantity for the REVB. This work lays a theoretical foundation for further exploration of REVBs in both theory and experiment.

Title: Interfacial Entanglement-Induced Time-Dependent Solidification of Polymeric Fluids
Authors: Jaewon Shim (Seoul National University), Manhee Lee (Chungbuk National University), Wonho Jhe (Seoul National University)
Abstract: The structure of polymers at solid interfaces evolves over time, but the corresponding changes in their rheological properties remain poorly understood. Here, using a home-built quartz tuning fork atomic force microscope-based nano-rheometer, we directly measure the time-dependent viscoelasticity of the interfacial fluid. The bottommost layer, closest to the substrate, undergoes solidification over 10 hours, exhibiting an approximately five-fold increase in storage modulus and a two-fold increase in loss modulus. This arises from interfacial entanglement due to the strong binding of polymers to the solid surface driven by solid-wall attractive interactions. In contrast, within the second and third layers, the storage modulus remains nearly constant over time, while the loss modulus shows approximately two-fold increase. In this region, unlike the strongly bound first layer, entropic repulsion dominates, allowing the material to behave fluid-like while becoming increasingly viscous. Notably, as the first layer, where interfacial entanglement occurs, undergoes solidification, the flow boundary for interfacial fluid flow shifts upward away from the substrate, resulting in a negative slip length. This highlights the critical role of nanoscale interfacial structure and properties in governing macroscopic flow behavior.

Title: Domino Tilings of the Aztec Diamond in Random Environment and Schur Generating Functions
Authors: Alexey Bufetov, Leonid Petrov, Panagiotis Zografos
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond of size $M$ in a random environment, where the environment is a one-periodic sequence of i.i.d. random weights attached to domino positions (i.e., to the edges of the underlying portion of the square grid). We consider two cases: either the variance of the weights decreases at a critical scale $1/M$, or the distribution of the weights is fixed. In the former case, the unrescaled fluctuations of the domino height function are governed by the sum of a Gaussian Free Field and an independent Brownian motion. In the latter case, we establish fluctuations on the much larger scale $\sqrt M$, given by the Brownian motion alone. To access asymptotic fluctuations in random environment, we employ the method of Schur generating functions. Moreover, we substantially extend the known Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorems for particle systems via Schur generating functions in order to apply them to our setting. These results might be of independent interest.

Title: Neutron-induced opalescence in silica glass
Authors: S. A. Vasiliev, P. F. Kashaykin, A. L. Tomashuk
Abstract: Light scattering intensity distribution along the optical fiber length is analyzed, which was measured by optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) during and after fiber irradiation in a nuclear reactor. The OTDR traces prove to contain two components associated with either radiation-induced attenuation (RIA), or with Rayleigh scattering coefficient (RSC) variation. The RSC increase effect in the first stage of fast-neutron irradiation is argued to be similar to the anomalous scattering buildup near the critical point of the liquid-vapor transition known as critical opalescence. For his reason, the RSC increase due to fast-neutron irradiation can be named neutron-induced opalescence (NIO).

Title: Time correlations from steady-state expectation values
Authors: Wojciech Górecki, Simone Felicetti, Lorenzo Maccone, Roberto Di Candia
Abstract: Recovering properties of correlation functions is typically challenging. On one hand, experimentally, it requires measurements with a temporal resolution finer than the system's dynamics. On the other hand, analytical or numerical analysis requires solving the system evolution. Here, we use recent results of quantum metrology with continuous measurements to derive general lower bounds on the relaxation and second-order correlation times that are both easy to calculate and measure. These bounds are based solely on steady-state expectation values and their derivatives with respect to a control parameter, and can be readily extended to the autocorrelation of arbitrary observables. We validate our method on two examples of critical quantum systems: a critical driven-dissipative resonator, where the bound matches analytical results for the dynamics, and the infinite-range Ising model, where only the steady state is solvable and thus the bound provides information beyond the reach of existing analytical approaches. Our results can be applied to experimentally characterize ultrafast systems, and to theoretically analyze many-body models with dynamics that are analytically or numerically hard.

Title: Free phases of Majorana fermions: Tenfold ways compared
Authors: Luuk Stehouwer
Abstract: We provide a mathematically rigorous classification of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of neutral free fermions. Our approach utilizes Karoubi triples with negative squares, thought of as polarizations. We prove that neutral free fermion SPT phases protected by a symmetry algebra $A$ are classified by the real $K$-theory group $K_2(A^{op})$, and demonstrate how our classification reproduces known results in the presence of charge. Our formalism also allows for symmetries described by groups, potentially with time-reversal, using the formalism of fermionic groups and their fermionic group $C^*$-algebras. Our classification extends to positive spatial dimensions and includes weak phases using the crystalline equivalence principle. Our approach clarifies and unifies various existing tenfold way classifications by establishing their equivalence through Morita equivalences of symmetry algebras. We expect our classification to be the natural domain for the free-to-interacting map proposed by Freed and Hopkins.

Title: Tunneling spectroscopy as a probe of fractionalization in 2D magnetic heterostructures
Authors: Matteo Carrega, Ivan J. Vera-Marun, Alessandro Principi
Abstract: In this paper we develop the theory for 2D-to-2D tunneling spectroscopy aided by magnetic or quantum-order excitations, and apply it to the description of van-der-Waals heterostructures of graphene/ultrathin $\alpha-{\rm RuCl}_3$. We study the behavior of both the differential conductance and the inelastic electron tunneling spectrum (IETS) of these heterostructures. The IETS in particular exhibits features, such as the gap of continuum spinon excitations and Majorana bound states, whose energies scale {\it cubicly} with the applied magnetic field. Such scaling, which exists for a relatively wide range of fields, is at odds with the linear one exhibited by conventional magnons and can be used to prove the existence of Kitaev quantum spin liquids.

Title: Wehrl Entropy and Entanglement Complexity of Quantum Spin Systems
Authors: Chen Xu, Yiqi Yu, Peng Zhang
Abstract: The Wehrl entropy of a quantum state is the Shannon entropy of its coherent-state distribution function, and remains non-zero even for pure states. We investigate the relationship between this entropy and the many-particle quantum entanglement, for $N$ spin-1/2 particles. Explicitly, we numerically calculate the Wehrl entropy of various $N$-particle ($2\leq N\leq 20$) entangled pure states, with respect to the SU(2)$^{\otimes N}$ coherent states. Our results show that for the large-$N$ ($N\gtrsim 10$) systems the Wehrl entropy of the highly chaotic entangled states (e.g., $2^{-N/2}\sum_{s_1,s_2,...,s_N=\uparrow,\downarrow}|s_1,s_2,...,s_N\rangle e^{-i\phi_{s_1,s_2,...,s_N}}$, with $\phi_{s_1,s_2,...,s_N}$ being random angles) are substantially larger than that of the very regular entangled states (e.g., the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state). Therefore, the Wehrl entropy can reflect the complexity of the quantum entanglement of many-body pure states, as proposed by A. Sugita (Jour. Phys. A 36, 9081 (2003)). In particular, the Wehrl entropy per particle (WEPP) can be used as a quantitative description of this entanglement complexity. Unlike other quantities used to evaluate this complexity (e.g., the degree of entanglement between a subsystem and the other particles), the WEPP does not necessitate the division of the total system into two subsystems. We further demonstrate that many-body pure entangled states can be classified into three types, based on the behavior of the WEPP in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$: states approaching that of a maximally mixed state, those approaching completely separable pure states, and a third category lying between these two extremes. Each type exhibits fundamentally different entanglement complexity.

Title: Probing the dichotomy between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov and Majorana bound states via conductance, quantum noise and $Δ_T$ noise
Authors: Sachiraj Mishra, Colin Benjamin
Abstract: We investigate charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, along with charge and spin $\Delta_T$ noise, as diagnostic tools to distinguish Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states from Majorana-bound states (MBS) in a one-dimensional metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction. YSR states arise from magnetic impurities acting as spin-flippers within a trivial s-wave superconducting gap, while MBS emerge in topological superconductors, often leading to ambiguity in experiments where magnetic impurities mimic zero-energy MBS signatures. By replacing the trivial superconductor with a topological one exhibiting triplet pairing (e.g., chiral p or spinless p-wave nanowires), we identify robust and distinguishing features of YSR and MBS states. Our analysis demonstrates that combined measurements of both charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, and their $\Delta_T$ noise counterparts offer unique and reliable signatures to differentiate YSR states from genuine MBS, thereby reducing false-positive interpretations in topological superconductivity experiments.

Title: Phase separation of chemokinetic active particles
Authors: Euijoon Kwon, Yongjae Oh, Yongjoo Baek
Abstract: Motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) is a well-studied nonequilibrium collective phenomenon observed in active particles. Recently, there has been growing interest in how coupling the self-propulsion of active particles to chemical degrees of freedom affects MIPS. Although the effects of chemotaxis on MIPS have been extensively studied, little is known about how chemokinesis affects MIPS. In this study, we demonstrate that various patterns can be induced when active particles consume chemicals and exhibit chemokinesis, where higher chemical concentrations enhance self-propulsion without causing alignment with the chemical gradient. We discover that MIPS is intensified if chemical consumption is proportional to particle density (as in the basal metabolic regime), but it is suppressed if chemical consumption is closely tied to particle motion (as in the active metabolic regime). While the former produces large-scale phase separation via coarsening, the latter suppresses the coarsening process, leading to microphase separation and oscillating patterns. We also derive a hydrodynamic theory that describes these findings.

Title: Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group
Authors: Nikolay Ebel, Tom Kennedy, Slava Rychkov
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising and 3-state Potts models. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensors with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.

Title: Dissipation and Interaction-Controlled Non-Hermitian Skin Effects
Authors: Yang Li, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu, Franco Nori
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) have recently been extensively studied at the single-particle level. When many-body interactions become dominant, novel non-Hermitian phenomena can emerge. In this work, we propose an experimentally accessible mechanism to induce and control NHSEs in interacting and reciprocal dissipative systems. We consider both 1D and 2D Bose-Hubbard lattices subject to staggered two-particle loss combined with synthetic magnetic flux and long-range hopping. When the two-particle loss is small, the bound eigenstates (e.g., doublons and triplons) are all localized at the same boundary due to the interplay between the magnetic flux and staggered two-particle loss. In contrast, for strong two-particle loss, the skin-mode localization direction of the bound particles is unexpectedly reversed. This reversal stems from the combined effect of the staggered two-particle loss, synthetic magnetic flux, and long-range hopping, through which virtual second-order and third-order hopping processes induce effectively strong nonreciprocal hopping of doublons. Our results open up a new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena in many-body systems.

Title: Viscosity as the product of its ideal low-concentration value times a thermodynamic function
Authors: L. Marchioni, M. A. Di Muro, M. Hoyuelos
Abstract: The behavior of viscosity, $\eta$, as a function of concentration in dense fluids remains an unsolved problem, as is the case with other transport coefficients. Boltzmann's theory and the Chapman-Enskog method predict the value of the viscosity at low concentrations, $\eta_0$. Here, the hypothesis $\eta=\phi\, \eta_0$ is proposed, where $\phi$ is a function of the thermodynamic state that represents the effects of interactions as concentration increases. We consider that $\eta_0$ is the viscosity in an ideal hypothetical system, where the condition of small interactions applies for the whole density range ($\phi \to 1$ for low concentration). The method proposed to verify this hypothesis involves coupling the system with a solvent represented by a Langevin thermostat, characterized by a damping time $t_d$. Molecular dynamics simulations show that different values of noise intensity modify $\eta$ and $\eta_0$, but do not affect $\phi$. This result supports the assumption that $\phi$ is a state function, since the thermodynamic state remains unaltered by the presence of damping and noise. Simulations were conducted for particles that interact via a pseudo-hard sphere or a Lennard-Jones potential.

Title: Theory of magnetism for rare-earth magnets on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice with non-Kramers ions
Authors: Guijing Duan, Rong Yu, Changle Liu
Abstract: Motivated by the rapid experimental progress on the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets, we propose a generic effective spin model that describes interacting non-Kramers local moments on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. We point out that the local moments consist of both magnetic dipole and quadrupole components and the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model with an intrinsic field that accounts for the crystal field splitting. We then study the ground-state phase diagram of the model and find that pure quadrupole orders, which are invisible to conventional experimental probes, can be stabilized over a broad regime. In particular, we show that a hidden ``1/3 magnetization plateau'' with quadrupole orders generally exists and discuss its experimental signatures. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results to the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets Pr$_{2}$Ga$_{2}$BeO$_{7}$ and Pr$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$.

Abstract: Bose-Fermi mixtures naturally appear in various physical systems. In semiconductor heterostructures, such mixtures can be realized, with bosons as excitons and fermions as dopant charges. However, the complexity of these hybrid systems challenges the comprehension of the mechanisms that determine physical properties such as mobility. In this study, we investigate interlayer exciton diffusion in an H-stacked WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer. Our measurements are performed in the ultra-low exciton density regime at low temperatures to examine how the presence of charges affects exciton mobility. Remarkably, for charge doping near the Mott insulator phase, we observe a giant enhancement of exciton diffusion of three orders of magnitude compared to charge neutrality. We attribute this observation to mobile valence holes, which experience a suppressed moiré potential due to the electronic charge order in the conduction band, and recombine with any conduction electron in a non-monogamous manner. This new mechanism emerges for sufficiently large fillings in the vicinity of correlated generalized Wigner crystal and Mott insulating states. Our results demonstrate the potential to characterize correlated electron states through exciton diffusion and provide insights into the rich interplay of bosons and fermions in semiconductor heterostructures.

Title: Design of thermal hysteresis in nonstoichiometric alloys with giant magnetocaloric effect

Abstract: The non-stoichiometric Fe$_2$P-type (FeMnP$_{0.5}$Si$_{0.5}$)$_{1-x}$(FeV)$_{x}$ alloys ( $x=0, 0.01$, $0.02$, and $0.03$) have been investigated as potential candidates for magnetic refrigeration near room temperature. The magnetic ordering temperature decreases with increasing FeV concentration, $x$, which can be ascribed to decreased ferromagnetic coupling strength between the magnetic atoms. The strong magnetoelastic coupling in these alloys results in large values of the isothermal entropy change ($\Delta S_M$); $15.7$ J/kgK, at $2$ T magnetic field for the $x = 0$ alloy. $\Delta S_M$ decreases with increasing $x$. Results from M{ö}ssbauer spectroscopy reveal that the average hyperfine field (in the ferromagnetic state) and average center shift (in the paramagnetic state) have the same decreasing trend as $\Delta S_M$. The thermal hysteresis ($\Delta T_{hyst}$) of the magnetic phase transition decreases with increasing $x$, while the mechanical stability of the alloys improves due to the reduced lattice volume change across the magnetoelastic phase transition. The adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{ad}$, which highly depends on $\Delta T_{hyst}$, is $1.7$ K at $1.9$ T applied field for the $x = 0.02$ alloy.

Title: Collaborative filtering based on nonnegative/binary matrix factorization
Authors: Yukino Terui, Yuka Inoue, Yohei Hamakawa, Kosuke Tatsumura, Kazue Kudo
Abstract: Collaborative filtering generates recommendations by exploiting user-item similarities based on rating data, which often contains numerous unrated items. This paper proposes a nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF) algorithm modified for collaborative filtering and demonstrates that utilizing a low-latency Ising machine in NBMF is advantageous in terms of computation time. While previous studies have primarily applied NBMF to dense data, such as images, this study applies a modified NBMF to sparse data. Results show the benefits of using a low-latency Ising machine to implement the proposed method.

Title: Kinetic uncertainty relations for quantum transport
Authors: Didrik Palmqvist, Ludovico Tesser, Janine Splettstoesser
Abstract: We analyze the precision of currents in a generic multi-terminal quantum-transport setting. Employing scattering theory, we show that the precision of the currents is limited by a function of the particle-current noise that can be interpreted as the activity in the classical limit. We thereby establish a kinetic uncertainty relation for quantum transport. In the full quantum limit, we find precision bounds in which we modify the activity constraints depending on whether the system is fermionic or bosonic. We expect these bounds to be guidelines for any transport process aiming at high precision.

Title: Designing complex behaviors using transition-based allosteric self-assembly
Authors: Jakob Metson
Abstract: Allosteric interactions occur when binding at one part of a complex affects the interactions at another part. Allostery offers a high degree of control in multi-species processes, and these interactions play a crucial role in many biological and synthetic contexts. Leveraging allosteric principles in synthetic systems holds great potential for designing materials and systems that can autonomously adapt, reconfigure, or replicate. In this work we establish a basic allosteric model and develop an intuitive design process, which we demonstrate by constructing systems to exhibit four different complex behaviors: controlled fiber growth, shape-shifting, sorting, and self-replication. In order to verify that the systems evolve according to the pathways we have developed, we also calculate and measure key length and time scales. Our findings demonstrate that with minimal interaction rules, allosteric systems can be engineered to achieve sophisticated emergent behaviors, opening new avenues for the design of responsive and adaptive materials.

Title: Microsecond-lived quantum states in a carbon-based circuit driven by cavity photons

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots are an attractive platform for the realisation of quantum processors. To achieve long-range coupling between them, quantum dots have been integrated into microwave cavities. However, it has been shown that their coherence is then reduced compared to their cavity-free implementations. Here, we manipulate the quantum states of a suspended carbon nanotube double quantum dot with ferromagnetic contacts embedded in a microwave cavity. By performing quantum manipulations via the cavity photons, we demonstrate coherence times of the order of $1.3\mu s$, two orders of magnitude larger than those measured so far in any carbon quantum circuit and one order of magnitude larger than silicon-based quantum dots in comparable environment. This holds promise for carbon as a host material for spin qubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics.

Title: Fluctuation-dominated phase ordering in the one dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model
Authors: Souvik Sadhukhan, Mustansir Barma, Saroj Kumar Nandi
Abstract: Many physical systems, including some examples of active matter, granular assemblies, and biological systems, show fluctuation-dominated phase ordering (FDPO), where macroscopic fluctuations coexist with long-range order. Most of these systems are out of equilibrium. By contrast, a recent work has analytically demonstrated that an equilibrium one-dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model shows FDPO. The analytical results rely on a cluster representation of the model that we term TIDSI-CL and are governed by the ratio, $c$, of the long-range interaction strength to the critical temperature. We show that the allowed range of $c$ is very narrow in the TIDSI model while it is unbounded in TIDSI-CL. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations for the TIDSI model and show consistency with the analytical results in the allowed range of $c$. The correlation length grows strongly on approaching the critical point, leading to a broad near-critical region. Within this region, $\alpha$, which is the cusp exponent of the power-law decay of the scaled correlation function at criticality, changes to $\alpha^\text{eff}$. We also investigate the coarsening dynamics of the model: the correlation function, domain size distribution, and aging behavior are consistent with the equilibrium properties upon replacing the system size, $L$, with the coarsening length, $\mathcal{L}(t)$. The mean largest cluster size shows logarithmic corrections due to finite $L$ and waiting time, $t_w$. The aging autocorrelation function exhibits two different scaling forms, characterized by exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$, at short and long times compared to $t_w$, where $\beta=\alpha/2$.

Title: Non-Markovian effects in long-range polariton-mediated energy transfer
Authors: Kristin B. Arnardottir, Piper Fowler-Wright, Christos Tserkezis, Brendon W. Lovett, Jonathan Keeling
Abstract: Intramolecular energy transfer driven by near-field effects plays an important role in applications ranging from biophysics and chemistry to nano-optics and quantum communications. Advances in strong light-matter coupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy transfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has been reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes, and the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to light, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and vibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate off-resonant transitions, and thus energy relaxation between polaritonic states at different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of those modes makes it challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here we capture them via process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) methods, to describe exactly the vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field treatment of the light-matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission dynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different species of molecules coupled to a common photon mode, and show that the strength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling this dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to polaron formation. Our results shed light on polaritonic long-range energy transfer, and provide further understanding of the role of vibrational modes of relevance to the growing field of molecular polaritonics.

Title: Spin excitations arising from anisotropic Dirac spinons in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{0.33}$(OD)$_{0.67}$]
Authors: Lankun Han, Zhenyuan Zeng, Min Long, Menghan Song, Chengkang Zhou, Bo Liu, Maiko Kofu, Kenji Nakajima, Paul Steffens, Arno Hiess, Zi Yang Meng, Yixi Su, Shiliang Li
Abstract: A Dirac quantum spin liquid hosts Dirac spinons, which are low-energy fractionalized neutral quasiparticles with spin 1/2 that obey the Dirac equation. Recent inelastic neutron scattering studies have revealed a cone spin continuum in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{x}$(OD)$_{1-x}$], consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. In this work, we further studied spin excitations using the inelastic neutron scattering technique. The width of low-energy spin excitations shows a linear temperature dependence, which can be explained by spinon-spinon interactions with a Dirac dispersion. Polarized neutron scattering measurements reveal that in-plane magnetic fluctuations are about 1.5 times stronger than the out-of-plane ones, suggesting the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and consistent with our theoretical modeling and simulations. Moreover, the high-energy spin excitations around 14 meV agree with the one-pair spinon-antispinon excitations in Raman studies. The real part of the dynamical susceptibility derived from the Kramers-Kronig relationship also agrees with the Knight shift measured by nuclear magnetic resonance, clearly demonstrating the negligible effects of magnetic impurities on static susceptibility. These results provide a rare example in studying quantum-spin-liquid materials where different experimental techniques can be directly compared, and they give further insights for the possible Dirac quantum spin liquid in this system.

Title: Phase-Biased Andreev Diffraction Grating
Authors: Magnus R. Lykkegaard, Anders Enevold Dahl, Karsten Flensberg, Tyler Lindemann, Michael J. Manfra, Charles M. Marcus
Abstract: In optical diffraction, the phase difference between sources in a grating or multi-slit mask is determined by the angle to the imaging screen, yielding the familiar multi-lobed diffraction image. Here, we realize a similar phenomenon in a superconductor-semiconductor hybrid circuit configured to allow Andreev scattering from multiple parallel scatterers. Phase differences between scatterers are set by tapping off of a remote superconducting meander. We investigate arrays with two, three, four, and ten Andreev scatterers, examining local and nonlocal diffraction patterns, finding good agreement with a theory of multiple Andreev scattering, not to be confused with multiple Andreev reflection. Adding current-carrying taps to the meander allows individual phase control.

Title: Electronic structure of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates: strain to mimic the effects pressure
Authors: Yi-Feng Zhao, Antia S. Botana
Abstract: Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the $c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a structural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed, bringing the apical Ni-O-Ni angle to 180$^\circ$ and causing an increase in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Due to this strong interlayer coupling, a flat band of pure $d_{z^2}$ character crosses the Fermi level. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and tensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP nickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight that strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects obtained under hydrostatic pressure: while compressive strain brings the apical Ni-O-Ni angle closer to 180$^\circ$, it shifts the $d_{z^2}$ flat bands away from the Fermi energy, giving rise to a more cuprate-like electronic structure. In contrast, tensile strain reduces the apical Ni-O-Ni angle (to values $\sim$ 160$^\circ$), but it recovers the flat $d_{z^2}$ band at the Fermi level appearing in the bilayer and trilayer RPs under pressure. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic structure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve superconductivity at ambient pressure in this family of materials.

Title: Anisotropic moiré band flattening in twisted bilayers of M-valley MXenes
Authors: Kejie Bao, Huan Wang, Zhaochen Liu, Jing Wang
Abstract: Experimental studies on moiré materials have predominantly focused on twisted hexagonal lattice with low-energy states near the $\Gamma$- or K-points, where the electronic dispersion is typically isotropic. In contrast, we introduce a class of semiconducting transition metal carbides (MXenes) $M_2$C$T_2$ ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf, Sc, Y; $T$ = O, F, Cl) as a new platform for M-valley moiré materials, which exhibit pronounced anisotropic properties. Using Ti$_2$CO$_2$ and Zr$_2$CO$_2$ as representative examples, we perform large-scale \emph{ab initio} calculations and demonstrate that their AB-stacked twisted homobilayer hosts three threefold rotational-symmetry-related M-valleys with time-reversal symmetry. These systems show striking anisotropic band flattening in the conduction band minimum. To elucidate the underlying physics, we construct a simplified moiré Hamiltonian that captures the essential features of the band structure, revealing the origins of anisotropic flattening through the mechanisms of band folding and interlayer tunneling. Our findings expand the current landscape of moiré materials, establishing valley- and spin-degenerate, two-dimensional arrays of quasi-one-dimensional systems as promising platforms for exploring many interesting correlated electronic phases.

Title: Beyond traditional box-covering: Determining the fractal dimension of complex networks using a fixed number of boxes of flexible diameter
Authors: Michal Lepek, Kordian Makulski, Agata Fronczak, Piotr Fronczak
Abstract: In this article, we present a novel box-covering algorithm for analyzing the fractal properties of complex networks. Unlike traditional algorithms that impose a predetermined box size, our approach assigns nodes to boxes identified by their nearest local hubs without enforcing rigid distance constraints. This flexibility leads to a key methodological shift: instead of fixing the box size in advance, we first determine the number of boxes and then compute their average size. We argue that this procedure is fully consistent with the recently proposed scaling theory of fractal complex networks and closely related to the concept of hidden metric spaces in which network nodes are embedded. We demonstrate that our approach not only significantly reduces computational complexity compared to existing methods, but also (despite relaxing constraints on box diameter) covers networks using boxes of more similar sizes than, for instance, the classical greedy coloring (GC) algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze nine complex networks (three model-based and six real-world) representing a broad spectrum: from networks with confirmed fractality, through those with initially uncertain, but here confirmed, fractal properties (such as the Internet at the level of autonomous systems), to large-scale networks that have so far remained beyond the reach of existing algorithms due to their size.

Title: Direction-Dependent Conduction Polarity in Altermagnetic CrSb
Authors: Banik Rai, Krishnendu Patra, Satyabrata Bera, Sk Kalimuddin, Kakan Deb, Mintu Mondal, Priya Mahadevan, Nitesh Kumar
Abstract: CrSb has recently gained immense attention as an altermagnetic candidate. This work reports on the experimental observation of direction-dependent conduction polarity (DDCP) in altermagnetic CrSb through Hall and Seebeck thermopower measurements. Conduction is dominated by holes along the c-axis and by electrons in the ab-plane of the hexagonal crystal of CrSb. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that DDCP in CrSb arises from a multicarrier mechanism, where electrons and holes living in distinct bands dominate conduction along different crystallographic directions. Furthermore, DFT predicts that DDCP exists within a narrow energy window near the Fermi level and is sensitive to small doping levels. This prediction is experimentally validated by the loss of DDCP in hole-doped Cr$_{0.98}$V$_{0.02}$Sb. These findings highlight the potential for tunable electronic behavior in CrSb, offering promising avenues for applications in devices that require both p-type and n-type functionalities within a single material.

Title: Mitigating disorder and optimizing topological indicators with vision-transformer-based neural networks in Majorana nanowires
Authors: Jacob R. Taylor, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: Disorder remains a major obstacle to realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires, and we show how deep learning can be used to recover topological MZMs mitigating disorder even when the pre-mitigation situation manifests no apparent topology. The disorder potential, as well as the scattering invariant ($T_V$) normally used to classify a device as topologically non-trivial are not directly measurable experimentally. Additionally, the conventional signatures of MZMs have proved insufficient due to their being accidentally replicated by disorder-induced trivial states. Recent advances in machine learning provide a novel method to solve these problems, allowing the underlying topology, suppressed by disorder, to be recovered using effective mitigation procedures. In this work, we leverage a vision transformer neural network trained on conductance measurements along with a CMA-ES optimization framework to dynamically tune gate voltages mitigating disorder effects. Unlike prior efforts that relied on indirect cost functions, our method directly optimizes $T_V$ alongside additional local density of states-based topological indicators. Using a lightweight neural network variant, we demonstrate that even highly disordered nanowires initially lacking any topologically non-trivial regions can be transformed into robust topological devices.

Title: Antisymmetry rules of response properties in certain chemical spaces
Authors: Takafumi Shiraogawa, Simon León Krug, Masahiro Ehara, O. Anatole von Lilienfeld
Abstract: Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic boron nitride-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. The rules predict the electric response properties more accurately than the magnetizabilities. The electric response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power.

Title: Shift current response in twisted double bilayer graphenes
Authors: Takaaki V. Joya, Takuto Kawakami, Mikito Koshino
Abstract: We calculate the shift current response in twisted double bilayer graphenes (TDBG) by applying the perturbative approach to the effective continuum Hamiltonian. We have performed a systematic study of the shift current in AB-AB and AB-BA stacked TDBG, where we have investigated the dependence of the signal on the twist angle, the vertical bias voltage and the Fermi level. The numerical analyses demonstrate that the signal is greatly enhanced as the twist angle is reduced. Notably, we also found that there is a systematic sign reversal of the signal in the two stacking configurations below the charge neutrality point for large bias voltages. We qualitatively explain the origin of this sign reversal by studying the shift current response in AB-stacked bilayer graphene.

Title: Cusplike feature in Hall resistivity of a uniaxial ferromagnet in nonorthogonal Hall geometry
Authors: Banik Rai, Nitesh Kumar
Abstract: Recent magnetotransport studies on uniaxial ferromagnets have reported a cusplike feature in Hall resistivity when the magnetic field is tilted away from the conventional orthogonal direction of the Hall measurement. This feature has often been attributed to the topological Hall effect arising from a non-coplanar spin structure. In this article, we have studied the uniaxial ferromagnet SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$ to demonstrate that this feature is rather a consequence of the nonorthogonal geometry of the Hall measurement and is expected to appear whenever the magnetic field is applied away from the easy axis of magnetization, nonorthogonal to the sample plane. The Hall resistivity, exhibiting this feature, scales with the orthogonal component of the magnetization, indicating that the observed feature is simply a manifestation of the anomalous Hall effect. We explain the origin of this feature based on the evolution of ferromagnetic domains under a nonorthogonal external magnetic field.

Title: Structure factors and quantum geometry in multiband BCS superconductors
Authors: M. Iskin
Abstract: We consider multiband BCS superconductors that exhibit time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing, and analyze their dynamic density and spin structure factors using linear-response theory within the mean-field BCS-BEC crossover framework at zero temperature. Our results for the multi-orbital Hubbard model satisfy the associated f-sum rules in several limits. In particular, in the strong-coupling limit, they coincide with those of a weakly-interacting Bose gas of Cooper pairs, where the low-energy collective Goldstone modes serve as Bogoliubov phonons. We further reveal that the quantum-geometric origin of the low-energy structure factors, along with related observables such as the superfluid-weight tensor and the effective-mass tensor of Cooper pairs, can be traced all the way back to the effective-mass theorem for Bloch bands in this limit. As an illustration, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that the Goldstone modes are the only relevant collective degrees of freedom in the flat-band regime.

Title: Many-body localization in a slowly varying potential
Authors: Zi-Jian Li, Yi-Ting Tu, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We study many-body localization (MBL) in a nearest-neighbor hopping 1D lattice with a slowly varying (SV) on-site potential $U_j = \lambda\cos(\pi\alpha j^s)$ with $0<s<1$. The corresponding non-interacting 1D lattice model is known to have single-particle localization with mobility edges. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the MBL of this model has similar features to the conventional MBL of extensively studied random or quasiperiodic (QP) models, including the transitions of eigenstate entanglement entropy (EE) and level statistics, and the logarithmic growth of EE. To further investigate the universal properties of this MBL transition in the asymptotic regime, we implement a real-space renormalization group (RG) method. RG analysis shows a subvolume scaling $\sim L^{d_{\rm MBL}}$ with $d_{\rm MBL} \approx 1-s$ of the localization length (length of the largest thermal clusters) in this MBL phase. In addition, we explore the critical properties and find universal scalings of the EE and localization length. From these quantities, we compute the critical exponent $\nu$ using different parameters $s$ (characterizing different degrees of spatial variation of the imposed potential), finding the critical exponent staying around $\nu\approx2$. This exponent $\nu \approx 2$ is close to that of the QP model within the error bars but differs from the random model. This observation suggests that the SV and QP models may belong to the same universality class, which is, however, likely distinct from the random universality class.

Title: Dynamical properties of particulate composites derived from ultradense stealthy hyperuniform sphere packings
Authors: Carlo Vanoni, Jaeuk Kim, Paul J. Steinhardt, Salvatore Torquato
Abstract: Stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) many-particle systems are distinguished by a structure factor that vanishes not only at zero wavenumber (as in ``standard'' hyperuniform systems) but also across an extended range of wavenumbers near the origin. We generate disordered SHU packings of identical and `nonoverlapping' spheres in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space using a modified collective-coordinate optimization algorithm that incorporates a soft-core repulsive potential between particles in addition to the standard stealthy pair potential. These SHU packings are ultradense, spanning a broad spectrum of structures depending on the stealthiness parameter $\chi$. We consider two-phase media composed of hard particles derived from ultradense SHU packings embedded in a matrix phase, with varying stealthiness parameter $\chi$ and packing fractions $\phi$. Our main objective is the estimation of the dynamical physical properties of such two-phase media, namely, the effective dynamic dielectric constant and the time-dependent diffusion spreadability, which is directly related to nuclear magnetic relaxation in fluid-saturated porous media. We show through spreadability that two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit faster interphase diffusion due to the higher packing fractions achievable compared to media obtained without soft-core repulsion. The imaginary part of the effective dynamic dielectric constant of SHU packings vanishes at a small wavenumber, implying perfect transparency for the corresponding wavevectors. We also obtain cross-property relations between transparency characteristics and long-time behavior of the spreadability for such two-phase media. Our results demonstrate that disordered two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit advantageous transport and optical behaviors of both theoretical and experimental significance.

Title: Symmetry-Projected Spin-AGP Methods Applied to Spin Systems
Authors: Zhiyuan Liu, Thomas M. Henderson, Gustavo E. Scuseria
Abstract: Symmetry-projected wave function methods capture static correlation by breaking and restoring the symmetries of a system. In this article, we present the symmetry-projected spin antisymmetrized geminal power (spin-AGP) state projected onto space group symmetry as well as complex conjugation, spin-flip, and time-reversal symmetries. The method is benchmarked on the 1D XXZ model and 2D $\mathrm{J_1-J_2}$ model with square and triangular lattices. Our results indicate that symmetry projection methods provide a powerful tool for frustrated spin systems.

Title: Uncertainty-aware electronic density-functional distributions
Authors: Teitur Hansen, Jens Jørgen Mortensen, Thomas Bligaard, Karsten Wedel Jacobsen
Abstract: We introduce a method for the estimation of uncertainties in density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations for atomistic systems. The method is based on the construction of an uncertainty-aware functional distribution (UAFD) in a space spanned by a few different exchange-correlation functionals and is illustrated at the level of generalized-gradient-approximation functionals. The UAFD provides reliable estimates of errors -- compared to experiments or higher-quality calculations -- in calculations performed self-consistently with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. The scheme furthermore allows for a decomposition of the error into a systematic bias and a reduced error. The approach is applied to four different properties: molecular atomization energies, cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli of solids. The probability distribution can be tailored to optimize the prediction of a single property or for several properties simultaneously.

Title: Graph neural network-based structural classification of glass-forming liquids and its interpretation via self-attention mechanism
Authors: Kohei Yoshikawa, Kentaro Yano, Shota Goto, Kang Kim, Nobuyuki Matubayasi
Abstract: Glass-forming liquids exhibit slow dynamics below their melting temperatures, maintaining an amorphous structure reminiscent of normal liquids. Distinguishing microscopic structures in the supercooled and high-temperature regimes remains a debated topic. Building on recent advances in machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), our study automatically extracts features, unveiling fundamental mechanisms driving structural changes at varying temperatures. We employ the self-attention mechanism to generate attention coefficients that quantify the importance of connections between graph nodes, providing insights into the rationale behind GNN predictions. Exploring structural changes with decreasing temperature through the GNN+self-attention using physically-defined structural descriptors, including the bond-orientational order parameter, Voronoi cell volume, and coordination number, we identify strong correlations between high attention coefficients and more disordered structures as a key indicator of variations in glass-forming liquids.

Title: Quasi-bound layer-breathing phonons inside perfect dislocations of lattice-relaxed twisted bilayers
Authors: V. V. Enaldiev
Abstract: Using multiscale modelling we investigate layer-breathing phonons in MX$_2$ bilayers (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se) containing dislocations specific for lattice-relaxed moiré superlattices. The dislocations, forming in the bilayers with parallel and antiparallel alignment of layers, bring about spatial modulation of the interlayer distance, generating effective potentials that promote the emergence of one-dimensional quasi-bound bands of layer-breathing modes inside perfect dislocations. For parallel MX$_2$ bilayers, perfect dislocations host multiple quasi-bound bands, with frequencies above the layer-breathing mode in rhombohedral-stacked domains. In contrast, antiparallel bilayers exhibit only a single quasi-bound band arising for orientations close to the edge-dislocation type, having frequencies above the layer-breathing mode in 2H-stacked domains.

Title: Superradiance Enhanced Light-Matter Interaction in Spatially Ordered Shape and Volume Controlled Single Quantum Dots: Enabling On-Chip Photonic Networks
Authors: Lucas Jordao, Qi Huang, Swarnabha Chattaraj, Siyuan Lu, Jiefei Zhang, Anupam Madhukar
Abstract: On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon interconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the requirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network. The mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to meet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE) approach underpinning the realization of these unique quantum emitters allows control on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these epitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the MTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon superradiance, a characteristic of the SESRE-enabled delicate balance between the confinement pontential volume, depth, the resulting exciton binding energy, and the degree of confinement of the center of mass (CM) motion of the exciton. Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) studies reveal the structural (atomic scale) and chemical (nm scale) nature of the material region defining the notion of the shape and volume (here large) of the electron confinement region (i.e. the QD). In the exciton's weake CM confinement regime, owing to its coherent sampling of the large volume, enhancement of the MTSQD oscillator strength to ~30 is demonstrated. Theoretical modelling with input from the STEM finding provide corroboration for single photon superradiance causing enhancement of the oscillator strength by ~2.5 to 3. Our findings allow fabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by the unique matter qubit-light qubit interconversion units that can be realized for lattice matched and mismatched material combinations covering UV to midinfrared wavelength range.

Title: Topological surface states induced by the magnetic proximity effect
Authors: Soichiro Fukuoka, Le Duc Anh, Masayuki Ishida, Tomoki Hotta, Takahiro Chiba, Yohei Kota, Masaaki Tanaka
Abstract: The combination of magnetism and topological properties in one material platform is attracting significant attention due to the potential of realizing low power consumption and error-robust electronic devices. Common practice is to start from a topological material with band inversion and incorporates ferromagnetism via chemical doping or magnetic proximity effect (MPE). In this work, we show that a topological material is not necessary and that both ferromagnetism and band inversion can be established simultaneously in a trivial insulating material by MPE from a neighbouring ferromagnetic layer. This novel route is demonstrated using quantum transport measurements and first principles calculations in a heterostructure consisting of 5 nm thick FeOx/1 monolayer of FeAs/ 3 nm thick alpha Sn. The Shubnikov de Haas oscillations show that there is linear band dispersion with high mobility in the heterostructure even though a 3 nm thick alpha Sn single layer is a trivial semiconductor. Furthermore, first principles calculations reveal that band inversion indeed occurs in this heterostructure, suggesting that the observed linear band is a topological surface state within this inverted gap. This work significantly expands the foundation for realizing magnetic topological materials in a myriad of trivial narrow gap semiconductors.

Title: PtyRAD: A High-performance and Flexible Ptychographic Reconstruction Framework with Automatic Differentiation
Authors: Chia-Hao Lee, Steven E. Zeltmann, Dasol Yoon, Desheng Ma, David A. Muller
Abstract: Electron ptychography has recently achieved unprecedented resolution, offering valuable insights across diverse material systems, including in three dimensions. However, high-quality ptychographic reconstruction is computationally expensive and time consuming, requiring a significant amount of manually tuning even for experts. Additionally, essential tools for ptychographic analysis are often scattered across multiple software packages, with some advanced features available only in costly commercial software like MATLAB. To address these challenges, we introduce PtyRAD, an open-source software framework offers a comprehensive, flexible, and computationally efficient solution for electron ptychography. PtyRAD provides seamless optimization of multiple parameters--such as sample thickness, local tilts, probe positions, and mixed probe and object modes--using gradient-based methods with automatic differentiation (AD). By utilizing PyTorch's highly optimized tensor operations, PtyRAD achieves up to a 17x speedup in reconstruction time compared to existing packages without compromising image quality. In addition, we propose a real-space depth regularization, which avoids wrap-around artifacts and can be useful for twisted two-dimensional (2D) material datasets and vertical heterostructures. Moreover, PtyRAD integrates a Bayesian optimization workflow that streamlines hyperparameter selection. We hope the open-source nature of PtyRAD will foster reproducibility and community-driven development for future advances in ptychographic imaging.

Title: Coexistence of charge density wave and field-tuned magnetic states in TmNiC$_2$
Authors: Kamil K. Kolincio, Marta Roman, Valerio Tammurello, Simone Di Cataldo, Daniel Matulka, Sonia Francoual, Berthold Stöger, Herwig Michor
Abstract: Exploring the relations between coexisting, cooperative, or competing types of ordering is a key to identify and harness the mechanisms governing the mutual interactions between them, and to utilize their combined properties. We have experimentally explored the response of the charge density wave (CDW) to various antiferromagnetic, metamagnetic, and field-aligned ferromagnetic states that constitute the magnetic phase diagram of TmNiC$_2$. The high resolution x-ray diffraction experiment employing synchrotron radiation at low temperature and high magnetic field, allowed to follow the superstructure satellite reflections, being a sensitive probe of CDW. This investigation not only reveals direct evidence that the charge density wave avoids even a partial suppression in the antiferromagnetic ground state but also proves that this state coexists, without any visible signatures of weakening, in the entire dome of the magnetically ordered phases, including the field-aligned ferromagnetic state. The calculations of the electronic and phonon structures support the experiment, revealing that the dominant contribution to the CDW transition stems from momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling. We conclude that this mechanism prevents the CDW from vanishing, although the nesting conditions within the magnetically ordered phases deteriorate.

Title: Canonical Thermodynamics
Authors: Arnaldo Spalvieri
Abstract: In the paper, thermodynamics of canonical systems is derived from the multinomial distribution of the occupancy numbers of quantum eigenstates. The cathegorical distribution (i.e. the one-particle distribution) on which the multinomial distribution is based, should be derived from the maximum entropy principle, but, being the multinomial distribution intractable, the paper proposes to take instead the Boltzmann distribution as cathegorical distribution, discussing the reason why the entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution should closely approximate the entropy achieved by the multinomial distribution equipped with the entropy-maximizing cathegorical distribution. After this, the imposition of Clausius' equation on the Shannon entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution leads to an unexpected result: in general, the Lagrange multiplier $\beta$ that imposes the energy constraint in constrained entropy maximization turns out to be substantially different from the inverse temperature. To support this unexpected result, the paper presents an example where, with $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature, the thermodynamic entropy (i.e. the entropy at a given temperature) of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution is greater than the Bose-Einstein thermodynamic entropy. However, the latter is derived from entropy maximization with constrained expected energy and expected number of particles, therefore if we plug $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature in the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution, then the thermodynamics of the canonical system obtained in this way turns out to be non-compatible with the principle of maximum entropy.

Title: Strain as a tool to stabilize the isotropic triangular lattice in a geometrically frustrated organic quantum magnet
Authors: Francisco Lieberich, Yohei Saito, Yassine Agarmani, Takahiko Sasaki, Naoki Yoneyama, Stephen M. Winter, Michael Lang, Elena Gati
Abstract: Geometric frustration is a key ingredient in the emergence of exotic states of matter, such as the quantum spin liquid in Mott insulators. While there has been intense interest in experimentally tuning frustration in candidate materials, achieving precise and continuous control has remained a major hurdle -- particularly in accessing the properties of the ideally frustrated lattice. Here, we show that large, finely controlled anisotropic strains can effectively tune the degree of geometric frustration in the Mott insulating $\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ -- a slightly anisotropic triangular-lattice quantum magnet. Using thermodynamic measurements of the elastocaloric effect, we experimentally map out a temperature-strain phase diagram that captures both the ground state of the isotropic lattice and the less frustrated parent state. Our results provide a new benchmark for calculations of the triangular-lattice Hubbard model as a function of frustration and highlight the power of lattice engineering as a route to realizing perfectly frustrated quantum materials.

Title: Coercivity Panorama of Dynamic Hysteresis
Authors: Miao Chen, Xiu-Hua Zhao, Yu-Han Ma
Abstract: We study the stochastic $\phi^4$ model under periodic driving by an external field $H$ at different scales of driving rate $v_H$, where the noise strength $\sigma$ quantifies the deviation of the system size from the thermodynamic limit. For large systems with small $\sigma$, we find the coercivity $H_c \equiv H(\langle\phi\rangle=0)$ sequentially exhibits distinct behaviors with increasing $v_H$: $v_H$-scaling increase from zero, stable plateau ($v_H^0$), $v_H^{1/2}$-scaling increase, and abrupt decline to disappearance. The $H_c$-plateau reflects the competition between thermodynamic and quasi-static limits, namely, $\lim_{\sigma\to 0}\lim_{v_H\to 0}H_c = 0$, and $\lim_{v_H\to 0}\lim_{\sigma\to 0}H_c=H^*$. Here, $H^*$ is exactly the first-order phase transition (FOPT) point. In the post-plateau slow-driving regime, $H_c-H^*$ scales with $v_H^{2/3}$. Moreover, we reveal a finite-size scaling for the coercivity plateau $H_P$ as $(H^*-H_P)\sim\sigma^{4/3}$ by utilizing renormalization-group theory. These predicted scaling relations are demonstrated in magnetic hysteresis described by the $N$-spin Curie-Weiss model where $N^{-1/2}\sim\sigma$. Our work provides a panoramic view of finite-time scalings of the hysteresis phenomenon, bridges dynamics of FOPT and dynamic phase transition, and offers new insights into finite-time/finite-size effect interplay in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

Title: Ontological differentiation as a measure of semantic accuracy
Authors: Pablo Garcia-Cuadrillero, Fabio Revuelta, Jose Angel Capitan
Abstract: Understanding semantic relationships within complex networks derived from lexical resources is fundamental for network science and language modeling. While network embedding methods capture contextual similarity, quantifying semantic distance based directly on explicit definitional structure remains challenging. Accurate measures of semantic similarity allow for navigation on lexical networks based on maximizing semantic similarity in each navigation jump (Semantic Navigation, SN). This work introduces Ontological Differentiation (OD), a formal method for measuring divergence between concepts by analyzing overlap during recursive definition expansion. The methodology is applied to networks extracted from the Simple English Wiktionary, comparing OD scores with other measures of semantic similarity proposed in the literature (cosine similarity based on random-walk network exploration). We find weak correlations between direct pairwise OD scores and cosine similarities across ~2 million word pairs, sampled from a pool representing over 50% of the entries in the Wiktionary lexicon. This establishes OD as a largely independent, definition-based semantic metric, whose orthogonality to cosine similarity becomes more pronounced when low-semantic-content terms were removed from the dataset. Additionally, we use cumulative OD scores to evaluate paths generated by vector-based SN and structurally optimal Shortest Paths (SP) across networks. We find SN paths consistently exhibit significantly lower cumulative OD scores than shortest paths, suggesting that SN produces trajectories more coherent with the dictionary's definitional structure, as measured by OD. Ontological Differentiation thus provides a novel, definition-grounded tool for analyzing semantic structure and validating navigation processes in lexical networks.

Title: Hydrodynamic bend instability of motile particles on a substrate
Authors: Sameer Kumar, Niels de Graaf Sousa, Amin Doostmohammadi
Abstract: The emergence of hydrodynamic bend instabilities in ordered suspensions of active particles is widely observed across diverse living and synthetic systems, and is considered to be governed by dipolar active stresses generated by the self-propelled particles. Here, using linear stability analyses and numerical simulations, we show that a hydrodynamic bend instability can emerge in the absence of any dipolar active stress and solely due to the self-propulsion force acting on polar active units suspended in an incompressible fluid confined to a substrate. Specifically, we show analytically, and confirm in simulations, that a uniformly ordered state develops bend instability above a critical self-propulsion force. Numerical simulations show that a further increase in the self-propulsion strength leads the system towards a disorderly flow state. The results offer a new route for development of hydrodynamic instabilities in two-dimensional self-propelled materials that are in contact with a substrate, with wide implications in layers of orientationally ordered cells and synthetic active particles.

Title: Resilient cluster Mott states in layered Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ against pressure-induced symmetry breaking
Authors: Hongbin Qu, Xiaoqun Wang, Hai-Qing Lin, ang Gang Li
Abstract: In this work, by combining density-functional theory (DFT) with dynamical mean-field calculations (DMFT), we compare the crystal and electronic structures of the prototype cluster Mott insulator Nb$_{3}$Cl$_8$ at ambient and high-pressure. We explain the finite but significantly reduced charge gap experimentally observed at $P=9.7$ GPa. We reveal a local symmetry breaking of the Nb$_{3}$ trimer under pressure, reducing its symmetry from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{s}$. This leads to a strong bandwidth enhancement and a lift of band degeneracy. Crucially, despite the significant change of band details, the cluster Mott insulating state is robust against local symmetry breaking. We show that the experimental observed gap under pressure is still a cluster Mott gap and its reduced value stems from both increased bandwidth and reduced Coulomb interactions under pressure. Our study provides the first systematic theoretical elucidation of how pressure-induced symmetry breaking dictates the cluster Mott state, establishing a robust foundation for understanding the intricate relationship between symmetry, local/non-local correlations, and emergent quantum states in correlated cluster compounds.

Title: Gaussian pseudo-Orthogonal Ensemble of Real Random Matrices
Authors: Sachin Kumar, Amit Kumar, S M Yusuf
Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct Gaussian pseudo-orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \altmathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ elements independently drawn from a Gaussian random population and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently, all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \altmathcal{D}^t \zeta \altmathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to a pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.

Title: Exploring the Convergence and Properties of Intrinsic Bond Orbitals in Solids
Authors: Benjamin Wöckinger, Alexander Rumpf, Tobias Schäfer
Abstract: We present a study of the construction and spatial properties of localized Wannier orbitals in large supercells of insulating solids using plane waves as the underlying basis. The Pipek-Mezey (PM) functional in combination with intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs) as projectors is employed, resulting in so-called intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs). Independent of the bonding type and band gap, a correlation between orbital spreads and geometric properties is observed. As a result, comparable sparsity patterns of the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix are found across all considered bulk 3D materials, exhibiting covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, and ionic bonds. Recognizing the considerable computational effort required to construct localized Wannier orbitals for large periodic simulation cells, we address the performance and scaling of different solvers for the localization problem. This includes the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), Conjugate-Gradient (CG), Steepest Ascent (SA) as well as the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) method. Each algorithm performs a Riemannian optimization under unitary matrix constraint, efficiently reaching the optimum in the "curved parameter space" on geodesics. We hereby complement the quantum chemistry and materials science literature with an introduction to this topic along with key references. The solvers have been implemented both within the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) and as a standalone open-source software package. Furthermore, we observe that the construction of Wannier orbitals for supercells of metal oxides presents a significant challenge, requiring approximately one order of magnitude more iteration steps than other systems studied.

Title: Versatile Control of Nonlinear Topological States in Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Zhao-Fan Cai, Yu-Chun Wang, Yu-Ran Zhang, Tao Liu, Franco Nori
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.

Title: Exceptional stationary state in a dephasing many-body open quantum system
Authors: Alice Marché, Gianluca Morettini, Leonardo Mazza, Lorenzo Gotta, Luca Capizzi
Abstract: We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.

Title: Stability analysis through folds: An end-loaded elastic with a lever arm
Authors: Siva Prasad Chakri Dhanakoti
Abstract: Many physical systems can be modelled as parameter-dependent variational problems. In numerous cases, multiple equilibria co-exist, requiring the evaluation of their stability, and the monitoring of transitions between them. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.

Title: Vortices and backflow in hydrodynamic heat transport
Authors: Enrico Di Lucente, Francesco Libbi, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: Recent experiments have provided compelling and renewed interest in phonon hydrodynamics. At variance with ordinary diffusive heat transport, this regime is primarily governed by momentum-conserving phonon collisions. At the mesoscopic scale it can be described by the viscous heat equations (VHE), that resemble the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in the laminar regime. Here, we show that the VHE can be separated and recast as modified biharmonic equations in the velocity potential and stream function$-$solvable analytically. These two can be merged into a complex potential defining the flow streamlines, and give rise to two distinct temperature contributions, ultimately related to thermal compressibility and vorticity. The irrotational and incompressible limits of the phonon VHE are analyzed, showing how the latter mirrors the NSE for the electron fluid. This work also extends to the electron compressible regime that arises when drift velocities can be higher than plasmonic velocities. Finally, by examining thermal flow within a 2D graphite strip device, we explore the boundary conditions and transport coefficients needed to observe thermal vortices and negative thermal resistance, or heat backflow from cooler to warmer regions. This work provides novel analytical tools to design hydrodynamic phonon flow, highlights its generalization for electron hydrodynamics, and promotes additional avenues to explore experimentally such fascinating phenomena.

Title: Open Materials Generation with Stochastic Interpolants

Abstract: The discovery of new materials is essential for enabling technological advancements. Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must effectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite design space. We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMatG), a unifying framework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline materials. OMatG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary base distribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad class of tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and flow matching as special cases. In this work, we adapt the SI framework by integrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and extending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell representations. Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates and lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species. We benchmark OMatG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) for specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering stable, novel, and unique structures. In our ground-up implementation of OMatG, we refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. OMatG establishes a new state of the art in generative modeling for materials discovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations. These results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning frameworks to accelerate progress in materials science. The OMatG code is available at this https URL.

Title: Model-based reconstruction of real-world fractal complex networks
Authors: Kordian Makulski, Mateusz Samsel, Michal Lepek, Agata Fronczak, Piotr Fronczak
Abstract: This paper presents a versatile model for generating fractal complex networks that closely mirror the properties of real-world systems. By combining features of reverse renormalization and evolving network models, the proposed approach introduces several tunable parameters, offering exceptional flexibility in capturing the diverse topologies and scaling behaviors found in both natural and man-made networks. The model effectively replicates their key characteristics such as fractal dimensions, power-law degree distributions, and scale-invariant properties of hierarchically nested boxes. Unlike traditional deterministic models, it incorporates stochasticity into the network growth process, overcoming limitations like discontinuities in degree distributions and rigid size constraints. The model's applicability is demonstrated through its ability to reproduce the structural features of real-world fractal networks, including the Internet, the World Wide Web, and co-authorship networks.

Title: Active gel theory for cell migration with two myosin isoforms
Authors: Nils O. Winkler, Oliver M. Drozdowski, Falko Ziebert, Ulrich S. Schwarz (Heidelberg University)
Abstract: Myosin II molecular motors slide actin filaments relatively to each other and are essential for force generation, motility and mechanosensing in animal cells. For non-muscle cells, evolution has resulted in three different isoforms, which have different properties concerning the motor cycle and also occur in different abundances in the cells, but their respective biological and physical roles are not fully understood. Here we use active gel theory to demonstrate the complementary roles of isoforms A and B for cell migration. We first show that our model can be derived both from coarse-graining kinetic equations and from nonequilibrium thermodynamics as the macroscopic limit of a two-component Tonks gas. We then parametrize the model and show that motile solutions exist, in which the more abundant and more dynamic isoform A is localized to the front and the stronger isoform B to the rear, in agreement with experiments. Exploring parameter space beyond the isoform parameters typical for animal cells, we also find cell oscillations in length and velocity, which might be realized for genetically engineered systems. We also describe an analytical solution for the stiff limit, which then is used to calculate a state diagram, and the effect of actin polymerization at the boundaries, that leads to an imperfect pitchfork bifurcation. Our findings highlight the importance of including isoform-specific molecular details to describe whole cell behavior.

Title: Universality classes in the time evolution of epidemic outbreaks on complex networks
Authors: Mateusz J. Samsel, Agata Fronczak, Piotr Fronczak
Abstract: We investigate the full temporal evolution of epidemic outbreaks in complex networks, focusing on the susceptible-infected (SI) model of disease transmission. Combining theoretical analysis with large-scale numerical simulations, we uncover two universal patterns of epidemic growth, determined by the structure of the underlying network. In small-world networks, the prevalence follows a Gompertz-like curve, while in fractal networks it evolves according to Avrami-type dynamics, which is typical of spatially constrained systems. These regimes define distinct universality classes that remain robust across arbitrary transmission rates. Notably, our approach provides explicit analytical formulas for the global epidemic prevalence and class-specific scaling relations capturing its dependence on the transmission rate. We show that the commonly assumed early exponential growth occurs only in small-world networks, where it corresponds to the short-time approximation of the Gompertz function. In contrast, this exponential phase is entirely absent in fractal networks, where spreading is markedly slower and governed by different mechanisms. Our approach clarifies the structural origins of these contrasting behaviors and offer a unified framework for understanding epidemic dynamics across diverse network topologies.

Title: Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures
Authors: Tâm Johan Nguyên, Darrick Lee, Bernadette Jana Stolz
Abstract: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity, which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures, a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths, to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and can be used to compute the lead matrix, which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto Stochastic Block Model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. We also explored the performance of our community detection on a stochastic variant of the KSBM as well as on real neuropixels of cortical recordings to demonstrate applicability on real-world data. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.

Title: Towards a multi-dimensional picture of nucleation: The example of liquid condensation through theory and rare event sampling
Authors: Yijian Wu, Thomas Philippe, Aymane Graini, Julien Lam
Abstract: While very popular for its ability to provide an elegant conceptual framework, classical nucleation theory (CNT) often fails at quantitatively reproducing most of the experimental and numerical observations of first order transitions. In this paper, we extend CNT by explicitly incorporating the multi-dimensional aspect of nucleation. Focusing on the liquid condensation of a Lennard-Jones gas, we used state of the art rare event sampling simulations to precisely characterize the nucleation event emphasizing the specific features of the critical cluster. Our numerical results indicate a simultaneous growth and densification in liquid condensation. We then exploit these insights to develop a 2-variable nucleation theory. Our model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties. Furthermore, our model provides a qualitatively more accurate representation of nucleation near the spinodal regime. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework highlights the limitations of CNT and more recent theories while offering a robust foundation for its refinement.

Title: Coherence-decoherence interplay in quantum systems due to projective stochastic pulses: The case of Rabi oscillations
Authors: Sushanta Dattagupta, Shamik Gupta
Abstract: The interplay of coherence and decoherence is played out in a three-level quantum system, in which the third level is incoherently coupled to the second one which itself is in coherent interaction with the first level. The study is based on a stochastic scenario in which the coherent, unitary evolution of the system is randomly interrupted by a Poisson-driven pulse sequence. In the absence of an external pulse, the system undergoes coherent, unitary evolution restricted to the subspace spanned by the first level (level $1$) and the second level (level $2$). The application of a pulse induces transitions between the second and the third level (level $3$), thereby introducing non-unitary effects that perturb the otherwise isolated two-level dynamics. The pulses are assumed to have infinitesimal duration, with strengths modeled as random variables that are uncorrelated across different pulses. A representative model for the stochastically-averaged transition (super)operator mimicking the dynamics induced by the application of pulses allows for an analytical derivation of the matrix elements of the averaged density operator. When the system is initially in level $1$, we obtain in particular the temporal behavior of the stay-put probability, that is, the probability $P_1(t)$ that the system is still in level $1$ at time $t$. As a function of time, the quantity $P_1(t)$ exhibits a coherence-to-decoherence crossover behavior. At short times $t \ll 1/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the average frequency at which pulses are applied to the system, coherent dynamics dominate. Consequently, $P_1(t)$ displays pronounced Rabi-like oscillations. At long times $t \gg 1/\lambda$, decoherence effects prevail, leading to an exponential decay of the form $P_1(t) \sim \exp(-\lambda t)$.

Title: Hyperchaos and complex dynamical regimes in $N$-dimensional neuron lattices
Authors: Brandon B. Le, Dima Watkins
Abstract: We study the dynamics of $N$-dimensional lattices of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons coupled with a flow of electrical current. We consider both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, homogeneous and heterogeneous neurons, and small and large lattices over a wide range of electrical coupling strengths. As the coupling strength is varied, the neurons exhibit a number of complex dynamical regimes, including unsynchronized chaotic spiking, local quasi-bursting, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. For lattices in higher spatial dimensions, we discover dynamical effects arising from the "destructive interference" of many connected neurons and miniature "phase transitions" from coordinated spiking threshold crossings. In large two- and three-dimensional neuron lattices, we observe emergent dynamics such as local synchronization, quasi-synchronization, and lag synchronization. These results illustrate the rich dynamics that emerge from coupled neurons in multiple spatial dimensions, highlighting how dimensionality, connectivity, and heterogeneity critically shape the collective behavior of neuronal systems.

Title: Hydrodynamic Trapping of Tracer Particles Induced by Spatially Correlated Noise in Thermal Equilibrium
Authors: Sijie Huang, Ayush Saurabh, Steve Presse
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuating Stokes equation in the presence of spatially correlated noise -- characterized by a single length scale -- while preserving thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation-dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends nonmonotonically on the ratio $\ell/r$ between the correlation length $\ell$ and the particle radius $r$: the MSD decreases as $\ell$ approaches $r$, reaches a minimum near $\ell\simeq r$, and rises again for $\ell > r$. The initial suppression stems from transient trapping, where sluggish momentum diffusion at short wavelengths confines the particle. When $\ell>r$, the particle hops between traps and eventually recovers normal diffusion ($\text{MSD}\propto t$) consistent with the fact that momentum diffusion crosses over to the standard Laplacian at long wavelengths. We further illustrate that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equations, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.
