Title: Observing dissipationless flow of an impurity in a strongly repulsive quantum fluid
Authors: Milena Horvath, Sudipta Dhar, Elisabeth Wybo, Dimitrios Trypogeorgos, Yanliang Guo, Mikhail Zvonarev, Michael Knap, Manuele Landini, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl
Abstract: The frictionless motion of an object through a fluid medium is commonly viewed as a hallmark of superfluidity. According to Landau, kinematic constraints prohibit superfluid behavior in one-dimensional (1D) bosonic systems. Here, using ultracold atoms, we show how a microscopic impurity can propagate through a strongly interacting 1D Bose gas without any friction, at odds with conventional expectations. We inject the impurity with initial velocities ranging from the subsonic to supersonic regime, and subsequently track its dynamics. For supersonic initial velocities, we observe the formation of a shock wave and a remarkably fast relaxation to a stationary regime, on a time scale that increases with decreasing impurity velocity. After reaching the stationary state, the impurity continues its motion through the system with a finite velocity. Our findings demonstrate how quantum effects can conspire to eliminate dissipation of a microscopic object immersed in a quantum fluid, thereby bringing novel insights into the propagation of matter and information in the quantum realm.

Title: Compact localized states and magnetic flux-driven topological phase transition in a diamond-dodecagon lattice geometry
Authors: Joydeep Majhi, Biplab Pal
Abstract: We propose and investigate a novel two-dimensional (2D) tight-binding model defined on a diamond-dodecagon lattice geometry that hosts multiple flat bands (FBs) and supports topological phase transitions driven by a magnetic flux. This lattice exhibits three completely flat, non-dispersive bands in the band structure in the absence of magnetic flux due to destructive interference in the electron hoppings, leading to the emergence of compact localized states (CLS). These CLS are analytically constructed and exhibit real-space confinement of the electrons, arising solely due to the lattice's geometrical frustration. It has been shown that these FBs are very robust against the introduction of weak random onsite disorder in the system. By tuning the uniform magnetic flux threaded through the diamond plaquettes, we demonstrate a tunable evolution of the band structure and show that certain bands develop nontrivial topological features with nonzero integer values of the Chern number. Additionally, we have computed the multi-terminal transport properties for this 2D lattice system, which display the flux-tunable resonances and transmission suppression linked to the FBs, establishing a clear interplay between the localization, topology, and transport. Our findings put forward the diamond-dodecagon lattice as a robust and tunable platform for studying the flat-band physics and magnetic flux-controlled topological phenomena, offering promising experimental feasibility in photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems.

Title: Controlled Zeno-Induced Localization of Free Fermions in a Quasiperiodic Chain
Authors: Pinaki Singha, Nilanjan Roy, Marcin Szyniszewski, Auditya Sharma
Abstract: We investigate measurement-induced localization in a continuously monitored one-dimensional Aubry--André--Harper model, focusing on the quantum Zeno regime in which the measurements dominate coherent dynamics. The presence of a quasiperiodic potential renders the problem analytically tractable and enables a controlled study of the interplay between monitoring and disorder. We develop an analytical description based on an instantaneous Schrödinger equation with a measurement-induced effective potential constructed self-consistently from individual quantum trajectories, without relying on postselection. In the quantum Zeno regime, an emergent dominant energy scale reduces the problem to a transfer-matrix formulation of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which allows direct computation of the Lyapunov exponent. Complementarily, we extract the localization length numerically from long-time steady-state quantum state diffusion trajectories by reconstructing the intrinsic localized single-particle wave functions and analyzing their spatial decay. These numerical results show quantitative agreement with the effective theory predictions, with controlled corrections of order $J^2/[\lambda^2+(\gamma/2)^2]$ (where $J$ is the hopping amplitude, $\gamma$ the measurement strength, and $\lambda$ the quasiperiodic potential). Our results underscore the connection between the effective non-Hermitian description and the stochastic monitored dynamics, showing the interplay between Zeno-like localization, coherent hopping, and quasiperiodic-disorder-induced localization, while also laying the groundwork for understanding and exploiting measurement-induced localization as a tool for quantum control and state preparation.

Title: Investigating the Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Na$_x$Fe$_{1/2}$Mn$_{1/2}$O$_2$ Cathode Materials with X-ray Compton Scattering

Abstract: We discuss electronic and magnetic properties of Na$_x$Fe$_{1/2}$Mn$_{1/2}$O$_2$, a promising Na-ion battery cathode material. Using x-ray Compton scattering, SQUID magnetometry, and density-functional-theory based modeling, we probe how electrons and spins evolve during sodiation. By comparing Compton profiles of sodiated and desodiated samples, we show that oxygen 2$p$ orbitals drive the redox process, while transition-metal 3$d$ electrons become more delocalized, explaining the metallic phase at $x=2/3$. These profile differences define a quantitative descriptor for the sodiation range associated with improved conductivity. Electron holes on oxygen, reflected in oxygen magnetization, confirm the important role of oxygen in the electrochemical activity of the cathode.

Title: Symmetries of Spin-Splitting Induced by Spin-Orbit Coupling in Non-magnetic Crystals
Authors: Fan Yang, Rafael M. Fernandes, Turan Birol
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) leads to splitting of otherwise spin-degenerate bands in noncentrosymmetric materials, even if time-reversal symmetry is present. While this gives rise to well-known phenomena such as the Rashba and Dresselhaus effects, various other terms are allowed based on the point group of the crystal and the electronic Hamiltonian. In this study, we utilize point group representations to illustrate that four different types of SOC terms (Rashba, Dresselhaus, Weyl, and Ising) can emerge in periodic solids. We construct reciprocal space energy expressions for each type of SOC-induced splitting of opposite spin bands, and follow a similar procedure to also obtain minimal tight-binding models that capture all types of spin-splittings for subgroups of the cubic parent group $m\bar{3}m$. Furthermore, we also obtain a complete list of nodal features in the electronic band structure in these systems, distinguishing between crystallographic-symmetry-imposed nodal lines and those imposed by time-reversal-symmetry only. Finally, we conclude by presenting a list of materials that host each type of inversion-breaking SOC effects. Our classification of the spin-splitting symmetries in non-magnetic systems with SOC is the counterpart of the recent classification of spin-splitting symmetries in unconventional magnetic systems without SOC, such as altermagnets and odd-parity magnets. More broadly, our work provides a basis for studying superconductivity and other collective electronic phenomena that are impacted by SOC-induced band splittings in noncentrosymmetric materials.

Title: Information lattice approach to the metal-insulator transition
Authors: William Skoglund, Elton Giacomelli, Yiqi Yang, Jens H. Bardarson, Erik van Loon
Abstract: Correlation functions and correlation lengths are frequently used to describe phase transitions in quantum systems, but they require an explicit choice of observables. The recently introduced information lattice instead provides an observable-independent way to identify where and at which scale information is contained in quantum lattice models. Here, we use it to study the difference between the metallic and insulating regime of one-dimensional tight-binding chains. We find that the information per scale follows a power law in metals at low temperature and that Friedel-like oscillations are visible in the information lattice. At high temperature or in insulators at low temperature, the information per scale decays exponentially. Thus, the information lattice is a useful tool for analyzing the metal-insulator transition.

Title: A Transformer-based Model for Rapid Microstructure Inference from Four-Dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Data
Authors: Kwanghwi Je, Ellis R. Kennedy, Sungin Kim, Yao Yang, Erik H. Thiede
Abstract: Properties of crystalline materials are closely linked to microstructure arising from the spatial arrangement, orientation, and phase of nanocrystals. Rapid characterization of crystalline microstructure can accelerate the identification of these links and the development of materials with desired properties. Here, we combine a machine learning framework with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to enable fast inference of crystalline microstructure over large fields of view. The framework employs a transformer-based architecture to predict crystallographic orientations and phases from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, yielding spatially resolved maps of microstructural features at the nanoscale. With this framework, crystallographic orientations are inferred up to two orders of magnitude faster than widely used correlative template-matching approaches. This capability enables high-throughput characterization of complex crystalline materials and facilitates the establishment of structure-property relationships central to materials design and optimization.

Title: A variational critical-state theory of friction
Authors: Mary Agajanian, Nadia Lapusta, Anna Pandolfi, Michael Ortiz
Abstract: Friction plays a fundamental role in many natural processes, including earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions. Earthquakes occur when highly compressed fault surfaces accumulate large enough shear stresses, causing the faults to move relative to one another, or slip. The slip is accommodated within a thin layer of comminuted granular material -- called fault gouge -- between the fault surfaces. As a result, characterizing the mechanical behavior of fault gouge in response to shear is a major open problem in earthquake source physics. Modeling gouge is complicated by large deformations, inelasticity, rate dependence, and volumetric changes. As such, researchers typically rely on empirical formulations to capture the effective response. Here, we systematically develop a variational, finite-kinematics framework for fault gouge. We first describe a general theory for a rigid-viscoplastic, pressure-sensitive material, where the plasticity evolution follows from the principle of maximum dissipation. Then, we specialize the governing equations for a Cam-Clay material within a shearing and dilating layer. We rely on convexity considerations and experimental observations from consolidation tests of granular layers to calibrate the model and develop explicit solutions for the rate- and state- dependent response of the model to shear tests under constant compressive normal stress and prescribed shearing rate. To validate the model, we select common rate functions and compare numerical material point tests and theoretical solutions to standard laboratory experiments of shearing granular layers. Lastly, we discuss connections of the model to empirical rate-and-state friction laws.

Title: Composite colloidal assembly by critical Casimir forces
Authors: T.E. Kodger, N. Farahmand Bafi, M. Labbé-Laurent, E. Steijlen, A. Maciolek, P. Schall
Abstract: We investigate the phase behaviour of mixtures of two populations of colloidal particles dispersed in a binary solvent system near its critical composition. The surfaces of particles are chemically modified to elicit a specific solvent affinity for one of the solvents. In this way, fluid-mediated interactions, which involve the critical Casimir effect, become particle population specific. As a result, the colloidal mixture shows a complex crystallization behavior reminiscent of the crystallization of atomic alloys. We show that the exquisite temperature dependence and reversibility of the critical Casimir interaction allows sampling the entire phase diagram of the binary system, and can be even used to anneal the crystalline microstructure analogous to temperature cycling of atomic alloy phases.

Title: Magnetotransport Spectroscopy of Strongly Rashba-Split Hole Subbands Reveals Many-Body Interactions
Authors: F. Sfigakis, N. A. Cockton, M. Korkusinski, S. R. Harrigan, G. Nichols, Z. D. Merino, T. Zou, A. C. Coschizza, T. Joshi, A. Shetty, M. C. Tam, Z. R. Wasilewski, S. A. Studenikin, D. G. Austing, J. B. Kycia, J. Baugh
Abstract: We report the results of magnetotransport experiments carried out on low-disorder 2D hole gases (2DHG) in the strongly correlated liquid regime, hosted in dopant-free (100) GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunctions. Over a wide range of 2DHG densities (from 0.7 $\times$ 10$^{15}$/m$^2$ to $2 \times 10^{15}$/m$^2$), Fourier analysis of low-field (B < 1 T) Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations reveals two spin-orbit-split heavy-hole (HH) subbands with distinct effective masses contributing to transport. Surprisingly, the lighter-mass HH subband exhibits a parabolic dispersion with Fermi wavevector below the anticrossing between the heavy-hole and light-hole subbands, while the heavier HH subband is non-parabolic throughout. Quantitative comparison with numerical calculations based on the Luttinger model reveals that both effective masses are enhanced by a common factor ($\approx$ 2.3), which we attribute to many-body interactions. This common scaling factor has a very weak dependence on the 2DHG density, likely due to band hybridization. Our measured hole masses are compared with published cyclotron resonance and magnetotransport values. We propose a cohesive framework reconciling the long-standing three-way discrepancy between Luttinger theory, magnetotransport, and cyclotron resonance measurements of density-dependent effective masses in partially spin-orbit-polarized heavy-hole systems in GaAs.

Title: Re-evaluating photoluminescent defects in Cu$_2$O
Authors: Alistair Brewin, Matthew P A Jones, Stewart J Clark
Abstract: Cuprous oxide (Cu$_2$O) is of interest for several technologies, including solar cells, and more recently, quantum devices via Rydberg excitons. It's performance in these capacities is strongly affected by defects in the crystal. The current best diagnostic for the presence of defects in a sample is the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum, which shows a number of strong lines at energies below the band gap, with brightnesses dependent on the sample. However, the assignment of PL lines to particular defects has not been substantiated by modern theory. Using density functional theory (DFT), we investigate from first principles which native defects introduce electronic states within the Cu$_2$O band gap, and therefore would produce lines in the PL spectrum. We find that the accepted assignments of lines to simple oxygen and copper vacancies are unsupported, and propose a new assignment based on oxygen and copper interstitials, and (one of the possible) split copper vacancies, a significant step towards the use of PL as a diagnostic tool for Cu$_2$O crystal growth.

Title: Time Reversal Symmetry Breaking and {\it Fragile Magnetic Superconductors}
Authors: Warren E. Pickett
Abstract: Roughly twenty reports (as of 2025) of time-reversal-symmetry breaking (TRSB) states in low critical temperature (T$_c$) superconducting (SC), otherwise conventional Fermi liquid, metals have emerged primarily from muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) data. The detected fields, inferred from the current interpretation of depolarization data, are similar in magnitude and not far above the lower limit of detection, corresponding to magnetizations of no more than 10$^{-3}$ $\mu_B$/atom. These materials comprise a new class of {\it fragile magnetic superconductors} modeled as triplet pairing. The measured SC state properties, excepting only the fields detected below T$_c$, are representative of low T$_c$ singlet BCS SCs, not showing unusual coherence lengths or critical fields. While it is recognized that the muon does affect the sample by displacing nearby atoms and impacting magnetic interaction parameters, the measurement process, changing the system from sample $\rightarrow$ sample+$\mu^+$ thereby breaking TRS, may deserve further scrutiny. This overview provides a survey of the environment of the muon, from the normal state to the superfluid state, where the induced supercurrent and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov gap states provide coupling of the muon moment to the superfluid. The unusual topological superconductor LaNiGa$_2$, currently modeled as non-unitary triplet, is used as a case study. Supposing that the prevailing $\mu$SR inference of a small spontaneous field within the bulk of theSC obtains, the current picture of (possibly non-unitary) triplet pairing is discussed and an attractive alternative for LaNiGa$_2$ is noted.

Title: Starch granules are instructive scaffolds for synergistic reinforcement and dissipation in hydrogel composites
Authors: Shirlaine Juliano, Jasmine Samaniego, Ian M Lillie, Geraldine Ramirez, Peter M Iovine, Rae M Robertson-Anderson
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in soft material design is the competition between rigidity and dynamicity, as stiffening mechanisms typically suppress energy dissipation. Here, we demonstrate that starch granules serve as instructive scaffolds that overcome this constraint, enabling the synergistic amplification of both elastic reinforcement and dynamic dissipation in hydrogels. We show that engineering the charge and structure of the filler-matrix interface enhances this synergistic response, which we propose arises from a dual-action physical mechanism: filler-induced polymer bundling of the polymer matrix provides structural reinforcement, while transient filler-matrix hydrogen bonding facilitates dissipation. Moreover, we reveal that binary blends of disparate filler species unexpectedly suppress these emergent properties, which we argue arises from enhanced entropic mixing. Our results provide a physical framework to overcome current design limitations in soft composites and sculpt their viscoelastic response from synergistic enhancement to strategic suppression for applications ranging from high-performance soft robotics to biomimetic tissue engineering.

Title: Effects of magnonic Kerr nonlinearity on magnon-polaritons with a soft-mode
Authors: Takahiro Chiba
Abstract: We theoretically study the effects of magnonic Kerr nonlinearity on magnon-polaritons (MPs) with a soft-mode in easy-axis ferromagnets coupled to a microwave cavity. Using an effective circuit model capable of describing MPs up to the nonperturbative strong-coupling regime, we show that chaotic and frequency-comb-like behaviors of MPs emerge at the original modes crossing point. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Kerr nonlinearity induces a finite excitation gap in the soft-mode, particularly in the strong-coupling regime.

Title: Photogalvanic Effects in Surface States of Topological Insulators under Perpendicular Magnetic Fields
Authors: Haoyu Li, Kainan Chang, Wang-Kong Tse, Jin Luo Cheng
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the nonlinear magneto-optical shift conductivity in the surface states of the prototypical topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ under a perpendicular quantizing magnetic field. By describing the electronic states as Landau levels and using a perturbative approach, we derive the microscopic expression for the shift conductivity $\sigma^{(2);\alpha\beta\gamma}(-\omega,\omega)$, where $\alpha,\beta,\gamma=\pm$ stand for the circular polarization of light and $\omega$ is the light frequency; the spectra are further decomposed into contributions from the interband and intraband optical transitions, for which the selection rules are identified. Considering that the system possesses $C_3$ point group of symmetry, the nonzero components of the conductivity tensor are $\sigma^{(2);-++}=[\sigma^{(2);+--}]^\ast$. Therefore, a pure circularly polarized light generates zero shift current. In the clean limit, the conductivities are nonzero only for discrete photon energies because of the discrete Landau levels and energy conservation, and they become Lorentzian lineshapes with the inclusion of damping, which relaxes the condition of energy conservation. The dependence of the spectra on the damping parameters, the magnetic fields, and the chemical potentials is investigated in detail. Our results reveal that the shift current is highly tunable by the chemical potential and the magnetic field. These results underscore the potential of topological insulators for tunable, strong nonlinear magneto-optical applications.

Title: Mechanism-driven CO2 Capture and Activation on Two-dimensional Transition-metal Diborides
Authors: Jakkapat Seeyangnok, Rungkiat Nganglumpoon, Joongjai Panpranot, Udomsilp Pinsook
Abstract: The urgent need to mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 levels motivates the search for stable, efficient, and tunable adsorbent materials. In this study, we employ first-principles density functional theory to investigate the adsorption of CO2 molecules on two-dimensional hexagonal transition-metal diboride monolayers, M2B2 (M = Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Nb). The adsorption energies, structural distortions, and bonding characteristics are systematically analyzed to understand how the metal center governs CO2 activation. The calculated adsorption energies range from -1.84 to -2.16 eV (or -1.98 to -4.42 eV), with Ti2B2 and Sc2B2 exhibiting the strongest CO2 binding, while Y2B2, Zr2B2, and Nb2B2 show moderately strong chemisorption. Adsorption induces significant molecular activation, evidenced by elongated C-O bonds (1.27-1.29 Angstrom) and bent O-C-O angles (129-132 degrees), compared to the linear gas-phase configuration (1.17 Angstrom, 180 degrees). Charge analysis further reveals substantial electron transfer from the monolayer to CO2, consistent with strong chemisorption and structural deformation. Correspondingly, the shift toward less negative IpCOHP(Ef) values indicates a pronounced weakening of the internal C-O bonds, reflecting increased population of antibonding pi* orbitals. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that the activated CO2 species is thermally sensitive: while most M2B2 surfaces retain stable adsorption at 300 K, Ti2B2 drives spontaneous CO2 dissociation into CO and O, revealing a temperature-assisted activation pathway. These findings highlight how the choice of transition metal tunes electronic interactions, adsorption energetics, and activation pathways on M2B2 surfaces. Overall, this work identifies two-dimensional transition-metal diborides as promising candidates for next-generation CO2 capture and activation technologies.

Title: Three-body Fermi-liquid corrections for Andreev transport through quantum dots
Authors: Akira Oguri, Masashi Hashimoto, Yoshimichi Teratani
Abstract: We study crossed Andreev reflection occurring in quantum dots connected to one superconducting lead and two normal leads at low temperatures $T$. Specifically, we derive an exact formula for the conductance up to order $T^2$ in the large superconducting gap limit, which is expressed in terms of the transmission probabilities of Cooper pairs and interacting Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Our formulation is based on the latest version of Fermi-liquid theory for the Anderson impurity model, which has clarified the quasiparticle energy shifts of order $\omega^2$ and $T^2$ -- that is, corrections of the same order as those arising from the finite lifetime of quasiparticles -- can be exactly taken into account through three-body correlations of impurity electrons. We also demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve and affect the Cooper-pair tunneling as the Andreev level moves away from the Fermi level, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The results demonstrate that the Cooper-pair contribution to the $T^2$ term of the nonlocal conductance becomes comparable to the Bogoliubov-quasiparticle contribution in the parameter region where superconducting proximity effects dominate over the Kondo effect.

Title: Strain-enhanced edge ferromagnetism and bipolar magnetic semiconducting behavior in Janus graphene nanoribbons
Authors: Ran Liu, Hongxing Liu, Junfeng Ren, Tianxing Ma
Abstract: Using first-principles density functional theory and determinant quantum Monte Carlo methods, we show that Janus graphene nanoribbons with topological defect arrays ($m=2$) exhibit robust intrinsic ferromagnetism across widths $W=2-6$, with bandgaps exceeding 200 $meV$ and stable ferromagnetic ground states. Notably, uniaxial tensile strain significantly enhances their ferromagnetic properties: at 25\% strain, the Curie temperature increases to $222K$, a fivefold improvement over unstrained systems and the highest reported for graphene-based nanoribbons. Strain also induces a reversible transition to a bipolar magnetic semiconductor, with spin-flipped valence and conduction band edges beyond 10\% strain. This dual functionality, strain-enhanced ferromagnetism and strain-induced spin flip, stems from strain-modulated $p_{z}$ orbital hybridization and strong direct exchange interaction. Among these, $W=5$ Janus graphene nanoribbons emerge as potential candidates for room-temperature spintronic devices and strain-programmable quantum transport systems.

Title: Topology and edge modes surviving criticality in non-Hermitian Floquet systems
Authors: Longwen Zhou
Abstract: The discovery of critical points that can host quantized nonlocal order parameters and degenerate edge modes relocate the study of symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs) to gapless regions. In this letter, we reveal gapless SPTs (gSPTs) in systems tuned out-of-equilibrium by periodic drivings and non-Hermitian couplings. Focusing on one-dimensional models with sublattice symmetry, we introduce winding numbers by applying the Cauchy's argument principle to generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ), yielding unified topological characterizations and bulk-edge correspondence in both gapped phases and at gapless critical points. The theory is demonstrated in a broad class of Floquet bipartite lattices, unveiling unique topological criticality of non-Hermitian Floquet origin. Our findings identify gSPTs in driven open systems and uncover robust topological edge modes at phase transitions beyond equilibrium.

Title: Anomalous electrowetting of physicochemically heterogeneous surfaces
Authors: Rumal Singh, Donjo George, Prashant Hitaishi, Samarendra P Singh, Sajal K Ghosh
Abstract: In the present work, a physiochemically heterogeneous surface has been fabricated to investigate the electrowetting behaviour of the surface. The polystyrene (PS) micro-humps with varied size are developed on the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface, which show an anomalous electrowetting behaviour. The surfaces are observed to be more electro-wettable than it is predicted by the classical Lippmann-Young equation. The observations are well understood considering the chemical heterogeneity of the surface, exhibiting a surface energy mismatch between the PS micro-humps and the PDMS layer. Further, the anomaly is comprehended by following the ridge formation around the triple-phase contact line and the varied surface roughness. A surface parameter is introduced in the Lippmann-Young equation that follows the experimental data with varied values of the parameter representing the physicochemically heterogeneous surfaces. A positive value of the surface parameter indicates strong pinning while a negative value represents depinning of the droplet. This parameter explains the faster electrowetting than predicted by the Lippmann-Young equation.

Title: Introduction to High-Temperature Superconductivity for Solid State Chemists
Authors: Zenji Hiroi
Abstract: Superconductivity is one of the most amazing properties that metallic conductors exhibit. Electrical resistance is completely eliminated below the critical temperature (Tc), which is the most important parameter in superconductivity. Since the discovery of copper oxide superconductors 39 years ago, many solid state chemists have made significant contributions to the field by discovering new compounds and producing high-quality samples for physical measurements. However, superconductivity research remains challenging for most solid state chemists because it requires knowledge of complicated solid state physics. This manuscript aims to provide a simple, intuitive introduction to superconductivity using only fundamental physics concepts that solid state chemists are familiar with. The author investigates a wide range of materials and classifies them according to the superconductivity mechanisms that may drive them. Specifically focusing on a series of copper oxide superconductors with the highest Tc at ambient conditions, the remarkable material dependence of Tc and the underlying, unconventional superconductivity mechanism that leads to the high Tc are thoroughly examined. Although our understanding of cuprate superconductivity is still fragmented, the author believes that once the branches and leaves are removed, the story will be fairly simple, similar to the phonon-based superconductivity mechanism revealed by the BCS theory. Furthermore, potential strategies for raising the Tc of cuprates and other superconductors are discussed. The author hopes that this article will pique interest in superconductors in young solid state chemists and encourage them to pursue the discovery of still unknown and unexplored room-temperature superconductors in the future.

Title: Room-Temperature Terahertz Photoconductivity Polarity Switching in High Entropy Nickelates with Implications for Photonic Synapses
Authors: Sanjeev Kumar, Brijesh Singh Mehra, Gaurav Dubey, Prakhar Vashishtha, Neeraj Bhatt, Jayaprakash Sahoo, Ravi Shankar Singh, Dhanvir Singh Rana
Abstract: High entropy oxides (HEO) hold the potential to revolutionize the conventional material paradigms by leveraging high order of chemical disorder that induces highly desirable exotic phases for advanced applications. Here, we devise a methodology to enhance the efficiency of an artificial photonic synapse using a high entropy rare earth nickelate. Combined with epitaxial strain, we show that high entropy can further manipulate the phase of these locally disordered materials. Using time-averaged and time resolved Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy as dynamic probe, for the first time we show a rare combination of i) crystal axis dependent insulator to metal THz electronic phase transition and ii) coexistence of negative and positive THz photoconductivity at room temperature. Detailed analysis within theoretical models, including density functional theory (DFT)-based band structure calculations, suggest origin of these properties as disproportionate ordering of oxygen vacancies. Based on these findings, a conceptual THz-based artificial photonic synapse is proposed. This work underlines the pivotal role of HEO in advancing diverse THz functionalities, representing a critical step toward futuristic applications like THz-based high-speed computing and communication with an emphasis in THz frequency domain.

Title: Gapped out-of-phase plasmon modes in alternating-twist multilayer graphene
Authors: Taehun Kim, Hongki Min
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the plasmon modes of alternating-twist multilayer graphene. In multilayer systems, interlayer coupling gives rise to distinctive plasmon modes, but calculations in moiré systems remain challenging due to their complex tunneling structures. Using the Kac-Murdock-Szegő Toeplitz formalism, we derive that the in-phase mode exhibits the conventional $\sqrt{q}$ behavior, while the out-of-phase modes acquire plasmon gaps determined by specific interband transitions between Dirac cones with different velocities in the long-wavelength limit. We demonstrate that these out-of-phase modes remain undamped in the weak Coulomb-interaction limit when the twist angle exceeds a critical value ($\theta \gtrsim 2.75^\circ$ for the alternating-twist trilayer case), regardless of the carrier density as long as the low-energy effective Dirac Hamiltonian remains valid. Furthermore, we consider the effect of a perpendicular electric field, and demonstrate how plasmon modes can be tuned by a gate voltage.

Title: Magnetoplasmons in $N$-layer structures
Authors: Jinu Park, Taehun Kim, E. H. Hwang, Hongki Min
Abstract: We provide a systematic framework to investigate the magnetoplasmons of multilayer two-dimensional electron systems by using the Kac--Murdock--Szegő (KMS) Toeplitz matrix to consider interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of interlayer tunneling, we show that the single-layer magnetoplasmon branch splits into $N$ collective modes -- one in-phase mode and $N-1$ out-of-phase modes -- and derive their asymptotic behaviors in the long-wavelength limit, as well as in the limit of large layer separation and strong magnetic fields. When interlayer tunneling is present, we clarify the magnetoplasmon dispersion, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by identifying the magnetoplasmon mode associated with each interband transition, as well as tunneling magnetoplasmons arising from interband transitions with the same Landau level index. Our study presents the hybridization between the modes governed by underlying symmetries, along with an enhanced tunneling magnetoplasmon gap exceeding the associated interband gap. The KMS-based analytic formalism thus provides a comprehensive physical understanding of magnetoplasmons in multilayer structures.

Title: Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene/hBN Moiré Superlattices
Authors: Jiannan Hua, Jing Ding, W. Zhu, Shui-gang Xu
Abstract: The recent discovery of robust quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has established a highly versatile platform for correlated topological matter. This review synthesizes the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these interaction-driven topological phases. Experimentally, the landscape has rapidly expanded from initial Chern insulators in trilayer systems to fully quantized QAH states in thicker systems. Theoretically, it is believed that moiré potential and electron-electron interaction cooperate and produce the QAH effect in such systems. Theoretical calculations also bring interesting questions, such as the formation of an interaction-driven topological phase known as an anomalous Hall crystal (AHC). This review comprehensively covers the experimental hallmarks, the theoretical frameworks, including continuum models and many-body approaches, and the ensuing physical picture that reconciles the roles of interactions, displacement fields, and the moiré potentials. We conclude by outlining outstanding open questions and future directions, positioning RMG/hBN systems at the forefront of topological quantum matter.

Title: Presence versus absence of charging energies in PbTe quantum dots
Authors: Yuhao Wang, Lining Yang, Wenyu Song, Li Chen, Zehao Yu, Xinchen He, Zeyu Yan, Jiaye Xu, Ruidong Li, Weizhao Wang, Zonglin Li, Shuai Yang, Shan Zhang, Xiao Feng, Tiantian Wang, Yunyi Zang, Lin Li, Runan Shang, Qi-Kun Xue, Ke He, Hao Zhang
Abstract: Charging energy ($E_C$) is essential in quantum dot (QD) devices. Previous studies on PbTe QDs have reported both the presence and absence of $E_C$. To resolve this ambiguity, we vary the QD size, i.e. the cross-sectional area of PbTe nanowires, and track the evolution of $E_C$. For large crosssectional areas ($\sim$ 16000 nm$^2$), the PbTe QDs exhibit no measurable $E_C$, while quantized levels are well resolved. Decreasing this area successively to 5000, 1500, and 500 nm$^2$, $E_C$ becomes finite and increases to 80, 160, and 210 $\mu$eV, respectively. We further demonstrate the strong tunability of local gates, which can tune the PbTe device from the QD regime to the regime of ballistic transport. These results address concerns regarding the large dielectric constant of PbTe and provide key insights in engineering advanced PbTe quantum devices.

Title: Investigating Disordered Granular Matter via Ordered Geometric Fragmentation

Abstract: The evolution of occupied volume under progressive fragmentation of granular matter is studied using a purely geometric model. Rather than modeling disorder directly, properties of disordered granular assemblies are investigated by analyzing an associated family of highly ordered reference configurations that provide sharp upper bounds on accessible volume. Grains are idealized as fragments derived from a hypothetical elongated parent prism with square cross section, sequentially sliced and reassembled into configurations that maximize the enclosed volume. Analytic expressions are derived for the maximal attainable volume at each fragmentation stage. The volume evolution is non-monotonic: initial fragmentation produces structures whose volume exceeds that of the original object, while further fragmentation leads to monotonic decrease converging to a limiting value of 5/4 times the initial volume, independent of the total number of fragments. The model reveals pairs of reassembled configurations built from geometrically indistinguishable building blocks yet enclosing different volumes. These conjugate configurations constitute purely geometric analogues of distinct phases connected by rearrangement-induced transitions. Explicit relations link the idealized construction to experimentally measurable grain parameters. Comparison with experimental data on cylindrical rods shows the predicted upper bound falls within the observed packing density range, demonstrating that the model captures essential geometric features despite its simplicity.

Title: Nonparabolic dispersion of charge carriers in CsPbI$_3$ in the orthorhombic phase

Abstract: The dispersion curves for the electrons and holes in CsPbI$_3$ in the orthorhombic phase are calculated using the density functional theory (DFT), with the spin-orbit coupling taken into account. The effective masses of the charge carriers are obtained using the parabolic approximation of the dispersion curves in different directions in the $k$-space. It is found that the dispersion curves demonstrate strong nonparabolicity at energies above 0.2 eV for electrons and above 0.1 eV for holes, available for experimental study by the means of optical spectroscopy. We propose a model that describes the dispersion dependences of charge carriers at those energies, where the effective masses of the quasiparticles depend quadratically on the wave vector. An expression is obtained according to the model, which can accurately approximate the dispersion curves for the electron and the hole in all symmetric directions from the center to the boundary of the Brillouin zone.

Title: Nanoscale Electroviscous Lift Force
Authors: Hao Zhang, Zaicheng Zhang, Thomas Guérin, Abdelhamid Maali
Abstract: About forty years ago, it has been predicted that a charged particle, moving parallel to a charged wall in an electrolyte, should experience a lift force that, contrarily to electrostatic forces, is not screened at large distances. Up to now, such electroviscous lift force has not been directly measured. Here, we use Atomic Force Microscopy to directly measure the electroviscous lift force and quantify its dependency with the distance to the wall, the translation velocity or the particle's size. Observing that existing theories exhibit large discrepancies with our experimental observations, we develop an analytical approach combining lubrication theory to a previously introduced formalism for small screening length. The experimentally observed lift forces are in good agreement with our theoretical predictions and reveal, for the first time, a saturation of the lift force for increasing velocities. Altogether, our results characterize, through direct measurements and analytical approach, the properties of electroviscous forces between charged particles in viscous electrolytes in non-equilibrium conditions.

Title: Subcycle videography of lightwave-driven Landau-Zener-Majorana transitions in graphene

Abstract: Strong light fields have unlocked previously unthinkable possibilities to tailor coherent electron trajectories, engineer band structures and shape emergent phases of matter all-optically. Unravelling the underlying quantum mechanisms requires a visualisation of the lightwave-driven electron motion directly in the band structure. While photoelectron momentum microscopy has imaged optically excited electrons averaged over many cycles of light, actual subcycle band-structure videography has been limited to small electron momenta. Yet lightwave-driven elementary processes in quantum materials often occur throughout momentum space. Here, we introduce attosecond-precision, subcycle band-structure videography covering the entire first Brillouin zone (BZ) and visualize one of the most fundamental but notoriously elusive strong-field processes: non-adiabatic Landau-Zener-Majorana (LZM) tunnelling. The interplay of field-driven acceleration within the Dirac-like band structure of graphene and periodic LZM interband tunnelling manifest in a coherent displacement and distortion of the momentum distribution at the BZ edge. The extremely non-thermal electron distributions also allow us to disentangle competing scattering processes and assess their impact on coherent electronic control through electron redistribution and thermalization. Our panoramic view of strong-field-driven electron motion in quantum materials lays the foundation for a microscopic understanding of some of the most discussed light-driven phenomena in condensed matter physics.

Title: Exploring Wetting and Optical Properties of CuAg Alloys via Surface Texture Morphology Analysis
Authors: Krzysztof Wieczerzak, Grzegorz Cios, Piotr Bała, Johann Michler, Benedykt R. Jany
Abstract: Copper-silver (CuAg) alloys are increasingly explored for applications in high-performance electrical and electronic systems, owing to their unique combination of high electrical and thermal conductivity and enhanced mechanical strength. Nevertheless, a thorough understanding of how these alloys surface characteristics fundamentally influence properties remains largely underdeveloped. Here, we explored the complex interplay between surface texture morphology, layer composition, wetting, and optical properties of Cu, Ag, and CuAg thin films deposited on textured silicon substrates via magnetron sputtering. Employing data mining and machine learning techniques, we identified robust correlations between contact angle and surface fractal dimension across all layer types promoting Cassie-Baxter surface state formation. Our analysis revealed a significant connection between layer thickness and surface topography entropy deficit, suggesting a dynamic evolution of surface order/disorder during metal film growth. Furthermore, we observed that contact angle sensitivity to layer thickness implied a correlation with microstructure evolution. Through K-Means clustering, we successfully categorized the formed surface textures morphology. Finally, a Random Forest regression model was developed to accurately predict water contact angles (Mean Absolute Error around 5 deg) using only texture and optical parameters. The model, along with accompanying Python code, is publicly available. Our findings establish a pathway towards targeted surface texture morphology engineering for tailored material performance.

Title: Lecture notes: From Gaussian processes to feature learning
Authors: Moritz Helias, Javed Lindner, Lars Schutzeichel, Zohar Ringel
Abstract: These lecture notes develop the theory of learning in deep and recurrent neuronal networks from the point of view of Bayesian inference. The aim is to enable the reader to understand typical computations found in the literature in this field. Initial chapters develop the theoretical tools, such as probabilities, moment and cumulant-generating functions, and some notions of large deviation theory, as far as they are needed to understand collective network behavior with large numbers of parameters. The main part of the notes derives the theory of Bayesian inference for deep and recurrent networks, starting with the neural network Gaussian process (lazy-learning) limit, which is subsequently extended to study feature learning from the point of view of adaptive kernels. The notes also expose the link between the adaptive kernel approach and approaches of kernel rescaling.

Title: The role of radiation-induced segregation in defect-phase formation in Ni-Ge and Ni-Si alloys
Authors: Amit Verma, Yen-Ting Chang, Marie Charpagne, Pascal Bellon, Robert S. Averback
Abstract: The interactions between chemical phase fields and structural defects play a key role in the properties of alloys. We illustrate the importance of these interactions in driven alloys, where defects are continuously being created, with particular focus on systems where radiation-induced segregation occurs. Specifically, we compare the microstructural evolution in undersaturated Ni-Si and Ni-Ge alloys during both 100 keV He and 2 MeV Ti irradiations. While the equilibrium phase diagrams of these systems are similar, and both systems show strong radiation-induced segregation, the evolving defect structures are remarkably different. Ni-Si reveals a high density of Frank loops, while Ni-Ge shows a complex array of dislocations. Moreover, a Ni3Ge precipitate shell is observed to coat He bubbles, while no segregation of Si is observed at such bubbles. We explain these differences in behaviors to solute drag by interstitial fluxes in Ni-Si vs solute drag by vacancy fluxes in Ni-Ge.

Title: Shift of the Bose-Einstein condensation transition in the presence of a second atomic species
Authors: Pedro M. Gaspar, Vanderlei S. Bagnato, Patricia C. M. Castilho
Abstract: Atomic interactions play an important role in the properties of ultracold atomic gases. In single component bosonic systems, its effect is already present at the critical point for the Bose-Einstein condensate phase transition by shifting it to lower temperatures as a consequence of effective repulsion between the atoms. When considering atomic bosonic mixtures, interesting effects arise from the competition between intra- and interspecies interactions such as the miscible-immiscible phase transition and the particular case of self-bounded quantum droplets. In such a scenario, it is natural to expect that these interactions will also affect the critical point of each species composing the mixture. In this paper, we obtain analytical expressions for the critical temperature shift of the phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate in the presence of a second species. We treat differently the cases in with the second species is above or below its own critical temperature and apply the obtained relations to the case of a $^{23}$Na-$^{39}$K bosonic mixture which can be realized in current running experimental setups. Our findings can be easily extended to other atomic mixtures trapped by arbitrary conservative traps.

Title: Dependence of the Mn sticking coefficient on Ga-rich, N-rich, and Ga/N-flux-free conditions in GaN grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy
Authors: YongJin Cho, Changkai Yu, Huili Grace Xing, Debdeep Jena
Abstract: This brief report examines the influence of Ga/N flux conditions on Mn incorporation in GaN. Mn-doped GaN layers were grown at 680$^{\circ}$C by molecular beam epitaxy on a Ga-polar GaN(0001) template substrate under Ga-rich, N-rich, and no-flux conditions (i.e., Mn $\delta$ doping). Mn incorporation was highest under N-rich condition, lowest under Ga-rich condition, and intermediate in the absence of Ga and N fluxes. For the growth conditions examined in this study, the corresponding Mn sticking coefficients, relative to that of the N-rich condition, were determined to be 0.31 for no-flux growth and 0.01 for the Ga-rich growth.

Title: A Variational Formulation for Deformable Particle Simulations and its Level Set Discrete Element Method Implementation
Authors: Thomas Henzel, Konstantinos Karapiperis
Abstract: We present a deformable Discrete Element Method (DEM) that extends the classical rigid-particle formulation through a reduced-order description of elastic grain-scale deformation. The method hinges on two developments. First, an energetic variational formulation based on the Lagrange--d'Alembert principle extends classical rigid-body dynamics to incorporate particle deformability by embedding translational, rotational, and deformation degrees of freedom within a unified energetic description. Second, particle deformation is realized within the Level Set DEM formalism through evolving level sets. The framework applies broadly to general particle geometries and topologies, and supports arbitrary deformation modes. The resulting deformable DEM retains the robustness, geometric and physical clarity, and scalability of classical DEM, while enabling physically grounded grain-scale deformability at a computational cost of the same order of magnitude as rigid DEM. Comparisons with full finite-element simulations demonstrate excellent agreement at both particle and system scales, establishing a general and extensible variational framework for modeling deformation in particulate systems.

Title: Interface-Driven Growth Mode Control of 2D GaSe on 3D GaAs Substrates with Distinct Crystallographic Orientations

Abstract: Previous studies of the growth of two-dimensional (2D) gallium selenide (GaSe) by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on a gallium arsenide (GaAs) three-dimensional (3D) substrate have reported significant differences in growth morphology, polytype, and the nature of the interface. The results differ, ranging from GaSe 2D film growth at tilted 2D planes to observed spiral structures, thereby calling for a deeper understanding of the impact of the substrate interface on the growth of GaSe films. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive reexamination of the growth mechanism of GaSe on GaAs substrates with (211)B and (001)B orientations, investigating the nature of the 2D/3D interface and the resulting morphology of the 2D GaSe films. We do this by investigating different methods of preparation of the GaAs substrate surface before the growth of GaSe by MBE, the importance of which has not been considered before. Our results resolve the mechanistic origin of tilted versus non-tilted 2D growth and establish a general interface-driven orientation selection rule linking substrate symmetry and dangling-bond coordination to layered heteroepitaxy. This framework provides a scalable interface-engineering pathway for deterministic control of layered chalcogenide heterostructures and enables wafer-scale integration with established semiconductor device platforms.

Title: Non-renormalization of the Hall viscosity of integer and Jain fractional quantum Hall phases by Coulomb interactions
Authors: Maik Selch
Abstract: We proof the non-renormalization of the Hall viscosity by Coulomb interactions for integer and fractional quantum Hall Jain states building on previous results obtained for the Hall conductivity. We employ Wigner-Weyl calculus in order to represent the Hall viscosity in terms of a topological invariant comprised of Green functions and work within the composite fermion field theory model of Jain states of the fractional quantum Hall fluid presented by Lopez and Fradkin. The topological expression is first derived within the free field theory of electrons and explicitly calculated for this case as well as in the mean field approximation of the composite fermion theory Jain states. The topological orbital spin of composite fermions distinguishes their mean field treatment from that of electrons resulting in an additional topological contribution. We then argue that the introduction of Coulomb interactions does not lead to perturbative corrections of the Hall viscosity in both integer and fractional quantum Hall fluids. The proof relies on the assumptions of homogeneity and rotational invariance of an underlying sample modulo the vector potential giving rise to the homogeneous external magnetic field. These conditions imply a Hall viscosity per emergent quasiparticle number density quantized in units of one half times the average quasiparticle orbital spin or one quarter times the Wen-Zee shift. The latter features a contribution from the composite fermion topological orbital spin relative to that of electrons.

Title: On the effect of Edge vs bulk effects in Graphene Nanoribbons
Authors: Colm Durkan, Xiao Liu, Ed Saunders
Abstract: Recent works have shown how the electrical properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) show a size-dependence in terms of resistivity, charge neutrality point (CNP) and band structure once their widths drop below approximately 50 nm. It has been observed that the CNP switches sign below a certain GNR width, and in this article, we explore this via computational modelling of the electric field and the conductance of GNRs in the presence of an AFM tip. We show that CNP is expected to shift towards lower values as GNR width reduces as a result of the significantly enhanced electric field around edges, but that a change in sign is not expected. We also show experimentally via high-resolution Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) that there does not appear to be any significant difference between the edges and the bulk of a GNR, indicating that the switch in CNP is not due to differential doping, and may instead be due to variations in the band structure as a function of size.

Title: Limits of Thermal Conductance Quantization in Chiral Topological Josephson Junctions
Authors: Daniel Gresta, Fernando Dominguez, Raffael L. Klees, Florian Goth, Laurens W. Molenkamp, Ewelina M. Hankiewicz
Abstract: We investigate thermal and non-local electrical transport in four-terminal Josephson junctions formed by a normal region coupled to two transverse chiral superconducting leads, supporting phases characterized by Chern numbers ${\cal C}=0,\,1$\,and\,2. We identify the conditions under which a single chiral Majorana mode (${\cal C}=1$) produces a robust half-quantized thermal conductance, while non-local electrical conductance remains strongly suppressed by particle-hole symmetry. Thermal conductance quantization occurs near a superconducting phase difference $\pi$, but only in the low-doping regime of the central region and in the intermediate- to long-junction limits. At finite Zeeman fields, the thermal response broadly follows the topology of the isolated superconducting leads for the $C=1$ phase while, in the ${\cal C}=2$ phase, the thermal conductance generally deviates from quantization, depending on the momentum-space location of the Majorana modes. Our results establish clear criteria for probing chiral Majorana modes in Josephson junctions and highlight the essential role of momentum-space structure, finite-size geometry, and sample parameters in thermal transport.

Title: Divergent Impact Charging of Polymer Particles
Authors: Simon Jantač, Holger Grosshans
Abstract: When a particle contacts a surface of another material, it is commonly believed that the particle acquires an impact charge that scales inversely with its pre-impact charge and whose polarity is set by the materials. We show that this belief holds for conductive particles but fails for polymers. For polymers, the impact charge increases linearly with the particle's pre-impact charge. Its polarity is not determined by the materials but by the pre-impact particle charge relative to a divergence point at which the net charge transfer reverses. We attribute this divergence to the attraction of surrounding ions to the particle surface. These attracted ions carry polarity opposite to that of the particle, and their amount scales with the particle charge. They transfer to the opposing surface during contact, thereby defining the impact charge. We propose a phenomenological model for the divergent impact charge arising from this mechanism. Finally, we reexamine previous measurements and show that they support this mechanism.

Abstract: We study the molecular beam epitaxy of self-assembled Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N nanowires on conductive TiN layers and demonstrate their application in piezoelectric nanogenerators. Wurtzite Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N nanowires with uniform Sc incorporation are grown across a wide composition range (0<x<0.35). At substrate temperatures below 700 $^\circ{}$C, these nanowires exhibit an inversely tapered morphology, whereas higher temperatures favor the nucleation of additional branches due to a phase separation of Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N into wurtzite AlN and rock-salt ScN. Phase-pure Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N nanowires are integrated into vertical nanogenerators, where the metallic TiN substrate serves as bottom electrode. The fabricated polymer-nanowire composite devices achieve effective piezoelectric charge coefficients of up to 8.5 pC N$^{-1}$ at x=0.32, thus exceeding the piezoelectric response of bulk AlN by nearly a factor of two. Although the charge response remains lower compared to Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N thin films, the reduced effective dielectric permittivity of the nanowire-polymer composites compensates the reduction in piezoelectric charge coefficient, eventually yielding a higher voltage response and comparable energy harvesting efficiency. Finally, effective medium modeling reveals that the device architecture is the primary factor limiting performance, providing general design principles for highly efficient nanowire-based piezoelectric energy harvesters.

Title: High-Tc Superconductivity in Functionalized Out-of-Plane Ordered Double Transition Metal MXenes

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) superconductors attracted growing interest in condensed-matter physics research. In this work, we explore the superconducting properties of surface-functionalized, out-of-plane ordered double transition-metal MXenes (o-MXenes), which exhibit distinctive structural and electronic characteristics. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the effects of electronic structure, electron-phonon coupling (EPC), anharmonicity, and anisotropy effect in superconductivity properties of o-MXenes. We examine a wide range of o-MXene systems, M$_{2}$M$^\prime$X$_{2}$T$_{2}$ (M = Mo, W; M$^\prime$ = Sc, Ti, V, Mo, Zr, Nb, Ta; X = C, N), functionalized with F, O, Cl, and H groups. Out of 128 candidates, 32 compounds are found to be mechanically, dynamically, and thermodynamically stable, exhibiting superconducting transition temperatures (T$_{c}$) from 0.1 K to 52 K. Notably, the Mo$_{2}$ScN$_{2}$O$_{2}$ compound achieves the highest T$_{c}$ of 52 K, with a superconducting gap of $\sim$10 meV. Solving the anisotropic Eliashberg equation reveals that Mo$_{2}$ScN$_{2}$O$_{2}$ is an anisotropic two-gap superconductor, and incorporating anharmonic effects decreases its T$_{c}$ slightly. We further analyze flat-band-induced EPC enhancement and present EPC matrix elements as functions of phonon wavevector q for distinct vibrational modes that show anharmonic behavior of these materials.

Title: Diagnosing energy gap in quantum spin liquids via polarization amplitude
Authors: Takayuki Yokoyama, Yasuhiro Tada
Abstract: Identifying whether a many-body ground state is gapped or gapless is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially in quantum spin liquids. In this work, we develop a gap-diagnostic scheme based on the polarization amplitude defined via a twist operator, evaluated within the infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) framework. As a benchmark, analysis of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain demonstrates that the polarization amplitude clearly distinguishes the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid from the gapped Néel phase. We then extend this framework to infinite cylinders of the spin-$1/2$ XY-$J_\chi$ model on the square lattice. We find that the polarization amplitude sharply detects the transition between the gapless XY phase and the gapped chiral spin liquid phase. These results show that polarization amplitudes provide a strong energy-gap diagnostic in two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum spin liquids.

Title: A molecular-spin photovoltaic device
Authors: Xiangnan Sun, Saül Vélez, Ainhoa Atxabal, Amilcar Bedoya-Pinto, Subir Parui, Xiangwei Zhu, Roger Llopis, Fèlix Casanova, Luis E. Hueso
Abstract: We fabricated a C60-based molecular spin photovoltaic device that integrated a photovoltaic response with the spin transport across the molecular layer. The photovoltaic response can be modified under the application of a small magnetic field, with a magnetophotovoltage of up to 5% at room temperature. Device functionalities include a magnetic current inverter and the presence of diverging magnetocurrent at certain illumination levels that could be useful for sensing. Completely spin-polarized currents could be created by balancing the external partially spin polarized injection with the photogenerated carriers.

Title: Quantitative Photoemission Predictions of Semiconducting Photocathodes from Many-Body Ab Initio Theory
Authors: Richard Schier, Chen Wang, Jonas Dube, Julius Kühn, Alice Galdi, Thorsten Kamps, Caterina Cocchi
Abstract: The development of high-performance electron sources requires theoretical frameworks that accurately link the microscopic electronic properties of cathode materials to their macroscopic photoemission observables. Here, we present a many-body extension of the three-step photoemission model for semiconducting photocathodes, directly integrating the $GW$ approximation and the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation on top of density functional theory (DFT). This approach overcomes the intrinsic limitations of standard DFT by explicitly accounting for quasiparticle and excitonic effects in the photoexcitation process. The quantum efficiency (QE) is evaluated by combining the ab initio absorption with an emission probability derived as an exciton-weighted average. We validate this model on representative alkali antimonides and demonstrate that a qualitative many-body description successfully captures complex spectral features that empirical models fail to reproduce. Furthermore, by incorporating macroscopic optical effects such as thin-film interference and polarization via Fresnel post-processing, we achieve quantitative agreement with experimental QE values without any adjustment. Minor discrepancies near the photoemission threshold are attributed to the idealized surface barrier adopted in the model and impurity effects in the samples, highlighting specific directions for future refinements. This work establishes a robust, parameter-free ab initio tool that bridges microscopic electronic correlation with macroscopic observables, providing a critical pathway for the rational design of next-generation electron sources.

Title: Variational study of the magnetization plateaus in the spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet: an approach from vision transformer neural quantum states
Authors: Andreas Raikos, Sylvain Capponi, Fabien Alet
Abstract: We analyze the magnetization curve of the spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg model in a magnetic field. Using state-of-the-art variational wavefunctions based on neural networks, we confirm the presence of robust magnetization plateaus at $m=1/3$, $5/9$ and $7/9$ of the saturation value, stabilized by a spontaneous symmetry breaking of lattice translations with a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ unit cell. Regarding the more challenging $m=1/9$ plateau, we find two competing valence bond crystals depending on the system size, both breaking translation as well as point group symmetries and with a larger $3\times 3$ unit cell. Such quantum states with local modulations of the magnetization average values could be observed experimentally in the near future.

Title: Modulated Anti-Ferroelectric Smectic Phases with Orthogonal and Tilted Structures
Authors: Jordan Hobbs, Calum J. Gibb, William C. Ogle, Peter Medle Rupnik, Natan Osterman, Nerea Sebastián, Alenka Mertelj, Richard J. Mandle
Abstract: The discovery of the ferroelectric nematic phase has brought with it a plethora of new polar liquid crystalline phases. One in particular is the anti-ferroelectric smectic A SmA\textsubscript{AF} phase. In this letter we show via observation and analysis of satellite peaks in the X-ray scattering pattern that the structure of the SmA\textsubscript{AF} phase involves a density modulation of $\approx$10-20 nm lateral to the smectic layer normal. Further, we demonstrate a previously undiscovered phase where the anti-ferroelectric order is maintained into a tilted smectic phase demonstrating the robustness of the underlying frustration that leads to the modulated structure. We suggest that the modulations are only in a single dimension and appear parallel to the tilt plane. This new phase also shows a significantly different and complex response to an electric field from other discovered polar LC phases due to the ability to modulate both tilt and polarisation direction.

Title: Topology of the Fermi surface and universality of the metal-metal and metal-insulator transitions: $d$-dimensional Hatsugai-Kohmoto model as an example
Authors: Gennady Y. Chitov
Abstract: The earlier theory [1] of the quantum phase transitions related to the change of the Fermi Surface Topology (FST) is advanced. For such transitions the Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold determined by the Lee-Yang zeros, the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ as the $d$-volume of the Fermi sea, and the special FST universality class were introduced in [1]. The exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) $d$-dimensional ($d=1,2,3$) model of interacting fermions is analyzed. We explore the relation between the Lee-Yang zeros, the Luttinger and the plateau (Oshikawa) theorems. The validity of the Luttinger theorem in the HK model is confirmed. It is shown that the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ and the FST universality class describe the transitions between metal and band/Mott insulators, as well as the Lifshitz and van Hove gapless-to-gapless transitions. The gapless phases are established to be the Landau Fermi liquids (metals). In addition to the conventional paradigm with a continuous order parameter, we apply the homology theory to analyze the FST transitions. They are critical points of the Morse function. To quantify FST we use the Euler characteristic, which is calculated for each phase of the HK model. We claim that the FST universality class is robust with respect to interactions and other model details, under the condition that the critical points are non-degenerate.

Title: Negative thermal expansion in ice I polytypes
Authors: Leonardo del Rosso, A. Dominic Fortes, Daniele Colognesi, Alberto Santonocito, Francesco Grazzi, Selene Berni, Milva Celli
Abstract: The fundamental properties of ice have always attracted a lot of interest due to omnipresence of ice in many different natural contexts. Since cubic ice recently become experimentally accessible from a low-density gas hydrate precursor [1, 2], it has been possible to measure its density as a function of temperature in the whole thermodynamic range of metastability. We found strong analogies with respect to the other ice I polytype, i.e., hexagonal ice Ih [3], including the presence of a negative thermal expansion behavior at low temperature. Based on these results, a new enthalpy calculation quantifies the metastable nature of the cubic form and, consequently its inaccessibility from a "normal" ice Ih precursor.

Title: Quantitative imaging of Abrikosov vortices by scanning quantum magnetometry
Authors: Clemens Schäfermeier, Ankit Sharma, Christopher Kelvin von Grundherr, Andrea Morales, Jan Rhensius, Gabriel Puebla-Hellmann, Mirko Bacani
Abstract: Understanding vortex matter in type-II superconductors is central to controlling dissipation and flux pinning in superconducting materials and devices. Here, we use cryogenic scanning nitrogen vacancy magnetometry (NVM) to image Abrikosov vortices in the cuprate superconductors BSCCO-2212 and YBCO under controlled field-cooled conditions. Measurements, which are performed using continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cw-ODMR) in a closed-cycle cryostat, yield quantitative magnetic-field maps with nanoscale spatial resolution. In BSCCO-2212 at 71 K, we resolve a well-ordered triangular vortex lattice, whose symmetry and spacing are confirmed through 2D Fourier analysis and are consistent with flux quantization. YBCO thin films imaged at 3 K exhibit a more disordered vortex arrangement reflecting stronger pinning, while maintaining quantitative agreement between measured vortex density and the applied magnetic field. These results render our cryogenic scanning NVM a reliable quantitative tool for real-space studies of vortices in high-$T_c$ superconductors, in particular since such a remarkable magnetic resolution has been achieved within relatively short acquisition times of 2 to 4 h.

Title: Mystery of the 175 cm$^{-1}$ Raman Mode in MnTe Altermagnet
Authors: Bishal Thapa K. D. Belashchenko, Igor I. Mazin
Abstract: MnTe has recently attracted exceptional attention due to its well-established altermagnetism, prompting a thorough reexamination of its properties. In particular, it was found that a Raman-active excitation at ~175 cm$^{-1}$, routinely assigned to the E2g phonon, is incompatible with this interpretation. It was further hypothesized that this mode is a "leakage", due to symmetry lowering, of an otherwise forbidden phonon. Here, using first-principles calculations, we decisively rule out this hypothesis and propose an alternative interpretation that the "mystery mode" is an electronic excitation, i.e., a plasmon, enabled by hole self-doping. The resolution of this mystery will require additional experiments and shed new light on the nature of electronic transport in MnTe.

Title: Topological Reorganization and Coordination-Controlled Crossover in Synchronization Onset on Regular Lattices
Authors: Gunn Kim
Abstract: The transition to global synchronization in coupled dynamical systems is governed by the interplay between coupling strength and structural topology. Although abrupt, first-order-like synchronization transitions have been extensively reported in heterogeneous networks, it is unclear whether comparable accelerated onset behavior can emerge purely from coordination geometry in spatially homogeneous, regular lattices. In this study, we investigate large-scale ($N=10^5$) stochastic Stuart-Landau oscillator networks defined on regular lattices with controlled coordination number. Using topological data analysis (TDA), simplicial-complex characterization, and optimal-transport-based geometric diagnostics, we identify a coordination-controlled crossover in synchronization onset dynamics at approximately $z_{c} \approx 7$ within the class of regular lattices considered. Low-coordination lattices ($z < z_{c}$) exhibit persistent $H_2$ topological features in the dynamical amplitude field that correlate with delayed coherence and surface-limited propagation. In contrast, higher-coordination lattices ($z > z_{c}$) display rapid fragmentation of these features, reduced interface roughness, and predominantly positive Ricci curvature. This is consistent with enhanced path redundancy and improved transport efficiency. In this regime, the global order parameter exhibits accelerated exponential-like growth during the onset stage. Throughout this work, abrupt synchronization refers specifically to this exponential onset behavior rather than to thermodynamic first-order hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that increasing coordination density induces a qualitative reorganization of higher-order topological structure that strongly correlates with synchronization efficiency in regular lattice systems.

Title: Turing patterns in Matrix-Weighted Networks
Authors: Anna Gallo, Wilfried Segnou, Timoteo Carletti
Abstract: Diffusion-driven instability is a fundamental mechanism underlying pattern formation in spatially extended systems. In almost all existing works, diffusion across the links of the underlying network is modeled through scalar weights, possibly complemented by cross-diffusion terms that are homogeneous across links. In this work, we investigate the emergence of Turing patterns on Matrix Weighted Networks (MWNs), a recently introduced framework in which each edge is associated with a matrix weight. Focusing on the class of coherent MWNs, we provide a novel characterization of coherence in terms of node-dependent orthonormal matrices, showing that link transformations can be written as relative rotations between nodes. This representation allows us to deal with coherent MWNs of any size and to introduce an orthonormal change of variables capable to reduce diffusion on a coherent MWN to diffusion on a standard weighted network with scalar weights. Building on this, we extend the classical Turing instability analysis to MWNs and derive the conditions under which a homogeneous equilibrium of the local dynamics loses stability due to matrix-weighted diffusion. Our results show how network topology, scalar weights, and inter-node transformations jointly shape pattern formation, and provide a constructive framework to analyze and design Turing patterns on matrix-weighted and higher-order networked systems.

Title: Physics-Informed Glass-Structure Descriptors for Assessing the Intrinsic Reactivity of Mixed Amorphous-Crystalline Precursors in Alkali-Activated Materials
Authors: Zhu Pan, Xinru Li, Yucheng Wang, Samira Hossain, Kai Gong
Abstract: Rapid and reliable assessment of the intrinsic reactivity of amorphous aluminosilicates is critical for their application in alkali-activated materials (AAMs) and blended cements. Although physics-informed glass-structure descriptors have demonstrated strong structure-reactivity relationships for predominantly amorphous systems, their extension to heterogeneous precursors with mixed crystalline-amorphous phases has been limited. Here, quantitative X-ray diffraction combined with bulk compositional analysis was used to reconstruct the effective amorphous compositions of five fly ashes (FAs) and three ground granulated blast-furnace slags (GGBSs). These compositions served as inputs for molecular dynamics simulations employing a melt-and-quench approach to generate atomic-scale structural models of the glassy phases. Based on these structures, the previously introduced descriptors, i.e., average metal oxygen dissociation energy and average metal oxygen bond strength, were refined to cover a broader compositional space spanning SiO2-Al2O3-TiO2-Fe2O3-CaO-MgO-MnO-Na2O-K2O. The refined descriptors exhibit strong inverse correlations with multiple independent reactivity indicators, including cumulative heat release from isothermal calorimetry, bound water content from thermogravimetric analysis, and compressive strength, for both single precursors and binary FA-GGBS blends activated with NaOH. These results demonstrate that physics-informed glass-structure descriptors can be extended from ideal amorphous systems to heterogeneous mixed-phase precursors and capture relative intrinsic reactivity trends in alkaline solutions. The proposed framework provides a transferable, structure-informed basis for comparative assessment of precursor reactivity that complements experimental testing and may inform precursor screening and mix designs for AAM and blended cement systems.

Title: Hierarchical quasiparticle dynamics in antiferromagnets revealed by time- and momentum-resolved X-ray scattering
Authors: Arnau Romaguera, Elizabeth Skoropata, Yun Yen, Biaolong Liu, Abhishek Nag, Shih-Wen Huang, Ludmila Leroy, Katja Sophia Moos, Gian Parusa, Serhane Zerdane, Ritwika Mandal, Celine Mariette, Matteo Levantino, Eugenio Paris, Luc Patthey, Ekaterina Pomjakushina, Urs Staub, Monica Ciomaga Hatnean, Michael Schueler, Elia Razzoli, Hiroki Ueda
Abstract: Energy flows among coupled subsystems are essential for ultrafast dynamics and high-speed technologies. In magnetic materials, spin fluctuations -- magnons -- mediate these flows in ultrafast magnetism. Yet momentum-resolved access to low-energy magnons governing the microscopic dynamics has been lacking. Using time-resolved resonant diffuse scattering alongside complementary time-resolved X-ray techniques and quantum-kinetic simulations, we unveil the hierarchical energy pathways among correlated systems in the photoexcited antiferromagnet CuO. Above-bandgap excitation triggers near-instantaneous spin disorder, generating non-thermal magnons throughout reciprocal space within femtoseconds. Real-time momentum-resolved tracking reveals picosecond magnon quasi-thermalization, followed by nanosecond recovery via momentum-selective magnon-phonon scattering. The quasiparticle dispersion mismatch creates recovery bottlenecks that control non-equilibrium lifetimes. This microscopic framework transcends phenomenological models and generalizes across materials, establishing design principles for ultrafast control of material properties.

Title: Unveiling the origin of the capacity fade in MnO$_{2}$ zinc-ion battery cathodes through an analysis of the Mn vacancy formation
Authors: Caio Miranda Miliante, Kevin J. Sanders, Liam J. McGoldrick, Nicola Seriani, Brian D. Adams, Gillian R. Goward, Drew Higgins, Oleg Rubel
Abstract: Currently explored rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion battery (RAZIB) cathode materials, such as $\alpha$-MnO$_{2}$, suffer from severe capacity fade when cycling at rates appropriate for grid-scale operation. Mn dissolution has been previously identified as the cause of $\alpha$-MnO$_{2}$ cathode degradation during RAZIB cycling, with conflicting evidence being found in support of the proposed Jahn-Teller effect-assisted charge disproportionation reaction as the mechanism behind Mn dissolution. In order to unveil the Mn dissolution mechanism in MnO$_{2}$ cathode cells under RAZIB operation conditions, the energetic feasibility for Mn vacancy formation was probed in both charged (MnO$_{2}$) and discharged (ZnMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$) phases of $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ polymorphs of MnO$_{2}$ using density functional theory. The formation of a Mn vacancy, and consequently the dissolution of Mn as Mn$^{2+}_{(aq)}$, was found to be thermodynamically feasible for the $\alpha$-ZnMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$ phase due to the energetically unfavourable Zn bent coordination formed during the Zn$^{2+}$ intercalation process, indicating that Mn dissolution is promoted by an unstable Zn coordination environment. The theoretical calculations were then corroborated by operando $^{1}$H nuclear magnetic resonance experiments which captured the Mn dissolution occurring throughout the RAZIB discharge, with subsequent electrochemical deposition of the Mn atoms on the electrode during charge. The combined computational and experimental analysis reveals the critical role of defect energetics and coordination environment in driving active material dissolution, and consequently capacity fade, with the proposed mechanism also relevant for understanding cathode degradation in other intercalating ion battery chemistries.

Authors: Binay P. Nayak, Zinnia Mallick, Wenjie Wang, Prapti Kakkar, Shan Zhou, Honghu Zhang, Dmytro Nykypanchuk, Surya K. Mallapragada, Alex Travesset, David Vaknin
Abstract: A cornerstone of advanced materials design is establishing a framework for assembling nanoparticle superstructures with tailored symmetries. A longstanding challenge has been assembling diamond-like superstructures for photonic devices. Traditionally, such open superstructures require functionalized nanoparticles with directional or anisotropic interactions, reminiscent of valence bonding in a diamond. Here, we present a robust strategy for assembling valence-free nanoparticles into a broad array of cubic superstructures. By grafting nanoparticles with oppositely charged, end-functionalized water-soluble polymers of adjustable molecular weight, we gain control over electrostatic interactions and conformational constraints. This unified approach yields lattices analogous to rock salt, CsCl, zinc-blende, diamond, and the rare simple cubic phase, with tunable lattice constants. Theoretical models and simulations elucidate the underlying interactions, providing a framework for engineering valence-free nanoparticle superlattices.

Title: Enhanced Spin Lifetime and Long-Range Spin Transport in p-Silicon using Spin Gapless Semiconductor as Ferromagnetic Injector
Authors: Nilay Maji, Subham Mohanty, Pujarani Dehuri, Garima Yadav
Abstract: Electrical spin injection and transport in silicon are central challenges for realizing semiconductor-based spintronic devices, particularly in p-type Si, where strong spin relaxation and interface effects often suppress detectable spin signals. Here, we report electrical spin injection, accumulation, and transport in lightly doped p-type silicon using the spin-gapless Heusler compound Mn$_2$CoAl as a ferromagnetic spin injector, separated from the p-Si channel by a thin MgO tunnel barrier in a lateral device geometry. Spin transport is systematically investigated through three-terminal (3-T) Hanle and four-terminal (4-T) nonlocal (NL) spin-valve and Hanle measurements. Clear Lorentzian Hanle signals are observed in the 3-T configuration from \SI{5}{K} up to room temperature, yielding a spin lifetime of approximately $\sim$\SI{0.68}{ns} at \SI{300}{K} that increases to approximately $\sim$\SI{4.11}{ns} at \SI{5}{K}. Temperature-dependent analysis reveals a weak power-law dependence of the spin lifetime, indicating a Bir--Aronov--Pikus-type spin relaxation mechanism. To validate genuine spin transport, NL spin-valve and Hanle measurements were performed, revealing well-defined spin-valve switching and controlled spin precession at \SI{5}{K}. From NL Hanle fitting, a spin lifetime of approximately $\sim$\SI{5.65}{ns} and a spin diffusion length of approximately $\sim$\SI{0.82}{\micro\meter} are extracted, confirming diffusive long-range spin transport in the p-Si channel. Although NL signals diminish at elevated temperatures due to reduced interfacial spin polarization and thermal noise, the combined 3-T and 4-T results establish spin-gapless Mn$_2$CoAl as an effective spin injector for p-type silicon. These findings highlight the potential of spin-gapless semiconductors for improving spin injection efficiency and advancing Si-compatible spintronic devices.

Title: Emergent aperiodicity in Bose-Bose mixtures induced by spin-dependent periodic potentials
Authors: Abid Ali, Pei Zhang, Hiroki Saito, Yong-Chang Zhang
Abstract: We study the ground-state and low-lying metastable phases of repulsive binary Bose-Einstein condensates confined in twisted, spin-dependent periodic optical lattices. For balanced mixtures, weak intercomponent interactions yield a fourfold momentum-space symmetry dictated by the lattice geometry. Increasing the coupling strength leads to the emergence of additional momentum peaks that combine with the lattice-induced structure to produce an eightfold rotationally symmetric pattern, signaling quasicrystalline order. At intermediate interactions, global phase separation suppresses this quasicrystalline state; however, at stronger coupling, local phase separation gives rise to a long-lived metastable phase in which the eightfold symmetry is restored. In this regime, a secondary ring of dominant momentum peaks appears at smaller wave vectors, indicating longer-wavelength density modulations and a crossover from lattice-dominated to interaction-driven quasicrystalline order. In contrast, imbalanced mixtures form partially miscible density clusters with eightfold-symmetric aperiodic patterns only at intermediate coupling, while stronger interactions drive global phase separation and permanently destroy quasicrystalline order. Real-time simulations demonstrate that these aperiodic structures are dynamically stable and experimentally accessible. Our results show that quasicrystalline order can emerge in binary condensates without explicitly aperiodic lattices and reveal population balance as a key ingredient for stabilizing quantum quasicrystals.

Title: Resonant level model coupled to a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev bath
Authors: Anastasia Enckell, Stefan Kehrein
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a resonant level model coupled to a strongly interacting electron bath modeled by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Different from the well-investigated case of a structureless non-interacting Fermi gas bath leading to a temperature-independent exponential decay of the impurity orbital occupation, we find a temperature-dependent oscillatory decay. We attribute this difference to the lack of quasiparticles in the SYK model, which is reflected in its singular density of states at the Fermi level. Our results are exact and can be obtained analytically by mapping to a suitably structured Fermi gas bath as an ancillary model for the SYK bath.

Title: Non-chiral ephemeral edge states and cascading of exceptional points in the non-reciprocal Haldane model
Authors: Aditi A. Prabhudesai, H. S. Chhabra, Suraj S. Hegde
Abstract: We study a variant of the Haldane honeycomb model that has non-reciprocal hoppings between the next-nearest neighbours. The system on a torus hosts time-reversal symmetry protected exceptional rings(ER) in the spectrum. The ERs act as Berry-curvature flux tubes i.e the Berry curvature is non-zero only inside the ERs. The system on a cylinder having zig-zag boundaries (and transverse momentum $k_x$) hosts edge-states that have zero group velocity at $k_x=\pi$ and are therefore `non-chiral'. The edge states undergo a bifurcation transition at an exceptional point(EP)in the BZ and delocalise into the bulk. As the non-reciprocity is increased, the bulk states that are approaching each other are converted into pairs of EPs due to non-Hermiticity. As the non-reciprocity is further increased, there is a `Russian doll'-like nested proliferation of pairs of EPs, leading to an EP-cascade. The proliferation of EPs takes place only at specific values of the non-hermiticity parameter, leading to a step-like structure in the EP-pair density when plotted as a function of non-Hermiticity. Further, using wave packet dynamics, we find a tunable regime where the non-chiral edge states can be dynamically stabilised for large timescales. The `self-acceleration' term in the equations of motion tends to diffuse the wave packets into the bulk, thus making them `ephemeral edge states'. But we find that for small non-hermiticity, the edge localisation is stabilised until late times for sufficiently wider wave packets. Thus, we have brought forth an intriguing phenomenology of the exceptional phase of the non-reciprocal Haldane model, which may bear direct relevance for systems such as disordered Kitaev honeycomb model, wherein such ERs have been predicted.

Title: Accuracy Comes at a Cost: Optimal Localisation Against a Flow
Authors: Till Welker, Patrick Pietzonka
Abstract: How much work does it cost for a propelled particle to stay localised near a stationary target, defying both thermal noise and a constant flow that would carry it away? We study the control of such a particle in finite time and find optimal protocols for time-dependent swim velocity and diffusivity, without feedback. Accuracy, quantified via the mean squared deviation from the target, and energetic cost turn out to be related by a trade-off, which complements the one between precision and cost known in stochastic thermodynamics. We show that accuracy better than a certain threshold requires active driving, which comes at a cost that increases with accuracy. The optimal protocols have discontinuous swim velocity and diffusivity, switching between a passive drift state with vanishing diffusivity and an active propulsion state. This study highlights how a time-dependent diffusivity enhances optimal control and sets benchmarks for cost and accuracy of artificial self-propelled particles navigating noisy environments.

Title: Absorption imaging of quantum gases near surfaces using incoherent light
Authors: Julia Fekete (1), Poppy Joshi (1), Peter Krüger (1 and 2), Fedja Oručević (1) ((1) University of Sussex, (2) Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt)
Abstract: We introduce an absorption imaging technique for ultracold gases that suppresses interference fringes and coherence-induced artifacts by reducing the transverse spatial coherence of the imaging light. The method preserves the narrow spectral bandwidth required for resonant absorption imaging and is implemented as a modular extension to standard imaging setups using a rotating diffuser. We demonstrate tunability of the illumination light's coherence without modifying the imaging optics. Using this approach, we achieve reliable imaging of ultracold atomic clouds in micron-scale proximity to complex surfaces, where standing waves, edge diffraction, and speckle severely limit conventional absorption imaging.

Ajayan
Abstract: Diamond to graphite transformation is a complex kinetically driven process which has been studied under various conditions for its fundamental importance. We report the transformation of diamond embedded ceramic matrix composites during hypersonic impact. Diamond particles embedded in cubic boron nitride matrix provide a superhard composite that was subjected to high impact collisions of metal projectiles travelling at speeds reaching Mach 8.45. Our observations suggest that the energy absorption and fracture of the composite is primarily enabled via the phase change of diamond into graphite. Characterization of the impact-fractured composite shows transformed diamond particles and provides details of the shock-induced phase transformation and the nature of diamond-graphite interfaces formed during rapid phase change. The study provides new understanding of phase transformation of diamond under extreme conditions.

Title: Disorder viscosity correction approach to calculate spinodal temperature and wavelength
Authors: Simon Divilov, Hagen Eckert, Nico Hotz, Xiomara Campilongo, Stefano Curtarolo
Abstract: Spinodal decomposition, a key mechanism to microstructure formation in materials, has long posed challenges for predictive modeling, due to the need for parameter-free approaches that accurately capture local energy landscapes. In this work, we propose an approach to predict spinodal behavior by introducing a disorder viscosity correction to bulk free energies computed from finite, small, representative cells. We approximate the energy penalty required to transition into a disordered state to enable the stabilization of locally concave bulk free energy regions - essential for interface formation - while suppressing long-range concentration fluctuations. This approximation circumvents the complexity of full ab initio parameterization of interfacial properties and is well-suited for high-throughput and machine-learning frameworks. Our approach captures the necessary physics underpinning spinodal kinetics, offering a scalable route to predict spinodal regions in compositionally complex and high-entropy materials.

Title: Matter-induced plaquette terms in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory
Authors: Matjaž Kebrič, Fabian Döschl, Umberto Borla, Jad C. Halimeh, Ulrich Schollwöck, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a powerful framework for studying confinement, topological order, and exotic quantum matter. In particular, the paradigmatic phenomenon of confinement, where dynamical matter is coupled to gauge fields and forms bound states, remains an open problem. In addition, LGTs can provide low-energy descriptions of quantum spin liquids, which is the focus of ongoing experimental research. However, the study of LGTs is often limited theoretically by their numerical complexity and experimentally in implementing challenging multi-body interactions, such as the plaquette terms crucial for the realization of many exotic phases of matter. Here we investigate a $(2+1)$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT coupled to hard-core bosonic matter featuring a global U(1) symmetry, and show that dynamical matter naturally induces sizable plaquette interactions even in the absence of explicit plaquette terms in the Hamiltonian. Using a combination of density matrix renormalization group simulations and neural quantum state calculations up to a system size of $20 \times 20$, we analyze the model across different fillings and electric field strengths. At small coupling strength, we find a large plaquette expectation value, independent of system size, for a wide range of fillings, which decreases in the presence of stronger electric fields. Furthermore, we observe signatures of a confinement-deconfinement transition at weak coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that dynamical U(1) matter can induce complex multi-body interactions, suggesting a natural route to the realization of strong plaquette terms and paving the way for realizing a topological quantum spin liquid protected by a large gap.

Title: Resource-Scalable Fully Quantum Metropolis-Hastings for Integer Linear Programming
Authors: Gabriel Escrig, Roberto Campos, M. A. Martin-Delgado
Abstract: Integer linear programming (ILP) remains computationally challenging due to its NP-complete nature despite its central role in scheduling, logistics, and design optimization. We introduce a fully quantum Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for ILP that implements a coherent random walk over the discrete feasible region using only reversible quantum circuits, without quantum-RAM assumptions or classical pre/post-processing. Each walk step is a unitary update that prepares coherent candidate moves, evaluates the objective and constraints reversibly -- including a constraint-satisfaction counter to enforce feasibility -- and encodes Metropolis acceptance amplitudes via a low-overhead linearized rule. At the logical level, the construction uses $\mathcal{O}(n\log_2 N)$ qubits to represent $n$ integer variables over the interval $[-N,\,N-1]$, and the Toffoli-equivalent cost per Metropolis step grows linearly with the total logical qubit count. Using explicit ripple-carry adder constructions, we support linear objectives and mixed equality/inequality constraints. Numerical circuit-level simulations on a broad ensemble of randomly generated instances validate the predicted linear resource scaling and exhibit progressive thermalization toward low-cost feasible solutions under the annealing schedule. Overall, the method provides a coherent, resource-characterized baseline for fully quantum constraint programming and a foundation for incorporating additional quantum speedups in combinatorial optimization.

Title: Accelerated Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation via Neural Network-Driven Importance Sampling
Authors: Michael Kim, Wei Cai
Abstract: Atomistic simulations provide valuable insights into the physical processes governing material behavior. However, their applicability is fundamentally constrained by the limited time scales accessible to brute-force simulations. This bottleneck often stems from complex energy landscapes where the systems stay trapped in metastable states for long periods of time. Yet, the long-term evolution is controlled by the transitions between the metastable states, which are rare events and difficult to observe. We present an importance sampling method designed to accelerate the time scale of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. By employing a bias potential, our approach enhances the sampling of rare transition events while preserving the relative probabilities of distinct transition pathways. The bias potential is represented by a neural network which enables the flexibility needed for high-dimensional systems. We propose a rigorous formulation to obtain the original transition rates between metastable states using transition paths obtained from the biased simulation. We further use a branching random walk (BRW) technique to enhance efficiency and to reduce variance. The proposed methodology is validated on 2-dimensional and 14-dimensional systems, demonstrating its accuracy and scalability.

Title: When Stein-Type Test Detects Equilibrium Distributions of Finite N-Body Systems
Authors: Jae Wan Shim
Abstract: Starting from the probability distribution of finite N-body systems, which maximises the Havrda--Charvát entropy, we build a Stein-type goodness-of-fit test. The Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution is exact only in the thermodynamic limit, where the system is composed of infinitely many particles as N approaches infinity. For an isolated system with a finite number of particles, the equilibrium velocity distribution is compact and markedly non-Gaussian, being restricted by the fixed total energy. Using Stein's method, we first obtain a differential operator that characterises the target density. Its eigenfunctions are symmetric Jacobi polynomials, whose orthogonality yields a simple, parameter-free statistic. Under the null hypothesis that the data follows the finite-N distribution, the statistic converges to a chi-squared law, so critical values are available in closed form. Large-scale Monte Carlo experiments confirm exact size control and give a clear picture of the power. These findings quantify how quickly a finite system approaches the classical limit and provide a practical tool for testing kinetic models in regimes where normality cannot be assumed.

Title: Symmetric Gapped States and Symmetry-Enforced Gaplessness in 3-dimension
Authors: Arun Debray, Matthew Yu, Weicheng Ye
Abstract: We establish a comprehensive framework for characterizing the infrared (IR) phases of a fermionic quantum theory in three spatial dimensions, based on its quantum anomalies associated with a finite symmetry. We uncover a fundamental dichotomy among these anomalies: the first class of anomalies can always be realized by symmetric gapped states, while the second class can never be realized by gapped states without breaking the given symmetry, establishing the phenomenon of symmetry-enforced gaplessness in these settings. Moreover, using the construction of symmetry extension, we construct the candidate gapped states that theories with the first class of anomalies can flow to in the IR. As an application, we provide concrete predictions of the candidate IR phases of (3+1)-dimensional gauge theories based on our results. Our results also suggest that systems with discrete chiral anomalies cannot be gapped out by adding arbitrary bosonic degrees of freedom.

Title: Magic and Wormholes in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model
Authors: Valérie Bettaque, Brian Swingle
Abstract: Any quantum state is fully specified by the expectation values of a complete set of Hermitian operators. For a system of Majorana fermions, such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, this set of observables can be taken to be all possible strings of Majorana fermion operators. The expectation values of these fermion strings in a thermal state depend erratically on the microscopic couplings that specify the SYK Hamiltonian, and we study their statistical properties directly in the thermodynamic limit using path integral techniques. When the underlying SYK Hamiltonian is chaotic, we find that these expectation values are well-modeled as real Gaussian random variables with zero mean and a variance that we compute. In contrast, for the integrable variant of SYK, we find that the expectation values are actually non-Gaussian. We then use these results to study measures of magic in the SYK thermal state, including the robustness of magic and the stabilizer Rényi entropy. We also show that our results can be quantitatively reproduced with a dual gravity calculation in the chaotic case at sufficiently low temperature. In this dual gravity model the variance of a given microscopic operator string is related to a wormhole geometry stabilized by a massive particle which is dual to the operator string. Our results thus provide a concrete and quantitative setting in which to study the relationship between randomness, wormholes, and closed universes as well as a holographic dual of quantum magic.

Title: Lifshitz critical points meet Zamolodchikov perturbation theory
Authors: António Antunes
Abstract: Critical points of classical and quantum lattice models are often described by scale-invariant Lifshitz theories which are anisotropic in the continuum limit, as characterized by a dynamical critical exponent $z\neq1$. This type of critical behavior can in principle be studied by deforming ordinary $z=1$ conformal field theories (CFTs) by relevant vector operators breaking the rotational/Lorentz symmetry. In this short note, we consider a two-dimensional system of coupled minimal model CFTs $\mathcal{M}_{m,m+1}$ which realizes this perspective in a controlled fashion via Zamolodchikov's large $m$ expansion. The model turns out to exhibit interesting properties, including a manifold of interacting Lifshitz fixed points and emergent rotational symmetry in the infrared.

Title: A versatile FEM framework with native GPU scalability via globally-applied AD
Authors: Mohit Pundir, Flavio Lorez, David S. Kammer
Abstract: Energy-based finite-element formulations provide a unified framework for describing complex physical systems in computational mechanics. In these energy-based methods, the governing equations can be obtained directly by considering the derivatives of a single global energy functional. While Automatic Differentiation (AD) can be used to automate the generation of these derivatives, current frameworks face a clear trade-off based primarily on the scale upon which the AD method is applied. Globally applied AD offers high expressivity but cannot currently be scaled to large problems. Locally applied AD scales well through traditional assembly methods, but the variety of physics and couplings that the framework can easily represent is more limited than the global approach. Here, we introduce an energy-centric framework tatva (this https URL) that defines the physics of a problem as a single global functional and applies AD globally to generate residual and tangent operators. By leveraging Jacobian-vector products for matrix-free solvers and coloring-based sparse differentiation for materializing sparse tangent stiffness matrices when needed, our flexible design scales linearly with the problem size on GPUs. We demonstrate that our framework can handle large problems (with millions of degrees of freedom) without memory exhaustion. Additionally, it offers a unified, fully differentiable methodology that can address a wide range of problems, including multi-point constraints, mixed-dimensional coupling, and the incorporation of neural networks, while maintaining high performance and scalability on modern GPU architectures.

Title: Fast Generation of Pipek-Mezey Wannier Functions via the Co-Iterative Augmented Hessian Method
Authors: Gengzhi Yang, Hong-Zhou Ye
Abstract: We report a $k$-point extension of the second-order co-iterative augmented Hessian (CIAH) algorithm, termed $k$-CIAH, for Pipek-Mezey (PM) localization of Wannier functions (WFs). By exploiting an efficient evaluation of the Hessian-vector product, $k$-CIAH achieves $O(N_k^2 n^3)$ scaling in both CPU time and memory, matching that of previously reported first-order $k$-space approaches while improving upon the $O(N_k^3 n^3)$ scaling of $\Gamma$-point CIAH, where $N_k$ denotes the number of $k$-points sampling the first Brillouin zone and $n$ characterizes the unit-cell size. Benchmark calculations on a diverse set of solids -- including insulators, semiconductors, metals, and surfaces -- demonstrate the fast and robust convergence of $k$-CIAH-based PMWF optimization, which yields an overall computational efficiency approximately 2-3 -fold higher than first-order $k$-space methods and orders of magnitude higher than $\Gamma$-point CIAH for localizing 1000-5000 orbitals. The quality of the resulting PMWFs is further validated by accurate electronic band structures obtained via PMWF-based Wannier interpolation.

As an application, the $n$-point correlations are studied and the two-point correlation is shown to be algebraic with rate of decay exactly $\alpha$.

Title: Computationally sufficient statistics for Ising models
Authors: Abhijith Jayakumar, Shreya Shukla, Marc Vuffray, Andrey Y. Lokhov, Sidhant Misra
Abstract: Learning Gibbs distributions using only sufficient statistics has long been recognized as a computationally hard problem. On the other hand, computationally efficient algorithms for learning Gibbs distributions rely on access to full sample configurations generated from the model. For many systems of interest that arise in physical contexts, expecting a full sample to be observed is not practical, and hence it is important to look for computationally efficient methods that solve the learning problem with access to only a limited set of statistics. We examine the trade-offs between the power of computation and observation within this scenario, employing the Ising model as a paradigmatic example. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reconstruct the model parameters for a model with $\ell_1$ width $\gamma$ by observing statistics up to an order of $O(\gamma)$. This approach allows us to infer the model's structure and also learn its couplings and magnetic fields. We also discuss a setting where prior information about structure of the model is available and show that the learning problem can be solved efficiently with even more limited observational power.

Title: Michel Talagrand and the Rigorous Theory of Mean Field Spin Glasses
Authors: Sourav Chatterjee
Abstract: Michel Talagrand played a decisive role in the transformation of mean field spin glass theory into a rigorous mathematical subject. This chapter offers a narrative account of that development. We begin with the physical origins of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model and the emergence of the TAP and Almeida-Thouless stability frameworks, culminating in Parisi's replica symmetry breaking (RSB) ansatz and its hierarchical order parameter. We then review early rigorous milestones, including high-temperature results and stability identities, and describe the consolidation of interpolation and cavity methods through the work of Guerra and of Aizenman-Sims-Starr. The central event in this narrative is Talagrand's 2006 proof of the Parisi formula for the SK model and for a broad class of mixed $p$-spin models, and his subsequent analysis of Parisi measures. We also discuss Talagrand's later program constructing pure states under extended Ghirlanda-Guerra identities and an atom at the maximal overlap, together with the structural results that followed, notably Panchenko's ultrametricity theorem and extensions of the Parisi formula. Throughout, we indicate how related contributions by many authors fit into the same long-running program across probability, analysis, and mathematical physics.

Title: Boundary mutual information in double holography
Authors: Yuxuan Liu, Yi Ling, Zhuo-Yu Xian
Abstract: We consider a composite system where AdS$_3$ gravity is coupled to a flat heat bath and investigate the mutual information between two subregions on the intersection of the AdS$_3$ and bath, referred to as the boundary mutual information (BMI). The corresponding entanglement entropy is captured via quantum extremal surfaces (QES), which holographically be computed by a surface optimization algorithm based on ``Surface Evolver''. We focus on both connected and disconnected configurations of the quantum entanglement wedge (Q-EW) in the AdS$_3$ bulk and analyze the finite corrections to the BMI. Our numerical results reveal a phase transition of the BMI as the separation between two subregions increases. Furthermore, we find that the BMI can naturally be decomposed into two distinct components: a geometric term arising from the areas of the quantum extremal surfaces, and a correction term resulting from bulk quantum fields within the Q-EW. Interestingly, the geometric contribution always exceeds the total BMI, indicating a negative correction from the bulk matter fields. This negativity can be understood as the result of subtracting a greater contribution from quantum fields in the connected Q-EW than in the disconnected one. We also reproduce the negative contribution of bulk quantum fields to BMI within a random tensor network (RTN) toy model of double holography. Modeling the bulk as a highly mixed state entangled with a large bath leads to a volume-law bulk entropy. In the large bond-dimension limit, the geometric part of the BMI remains non-negative, while the bulk entropy contribution becomes non-positive when the Q-EWs merge.

Title: Floquet implementation of a 3d fermionic toric code with full logical code space
Authors: Yoshito Watanabe, Bianca Bannenberg, Simon Trebst
Abstract: Floquet quantum error-correcting codes provide an operationally economical route to fault tolerance by dynamically generating stabilizer structures using only two-body Pauli measurements. But while it is well established that stabilizer codes in higher spatial dimensions gain additional levels of intrinsic robustness, higher-dimensional Floquet codes have hitherto been explored only in limited scope. Here we introduce a 3d generalization of a Floquet code whose instantaneous stabilizer group realizes a 3d fermionic toric code, while crucially preserving all three logical qubits throughout the entire measurement sequence. One central ingredient is the identification of a 3d lattice geometry that generalizes the features of the Kekulé lattice underlying the 2d Hastings-Haah code - specifically, a structure where deleting any one edge color yields a two-color subgraph that decomposes into short, closed loops rather than homologically nontrivial chains. This loop property avoids the collapse of logical information that plagues naive sequential two-color measurement schedules on many 3d lattices. Although, for our lattice geometry, a simple 3-round cycle that sequentially measures the three types of parity checks does not expose the full error syndrome set, we show that one can append a measurement sequence to extract the missing syndromes without disturbing the logical subspace. Beyond code design, 3d tricoordinated lattice geometries define a family of 3d monitored Kitaev models, in which random measurements of the non-commuting parity checks give rise to dynamically created entangled phases with nontrivial topology. In discussing the general structure of their underlying phase diagrams and, in particular, the existence of certain quantum critical points, we again make a connection to the general preservation of logical information in time-ordered Floquet protocols.

Title: Stokes flows in a sessile hemispherical drop due to evaporation and surface tension gradient
Authors: Peter Lebedev-Stepanov
Abstract: Viscous hydrodynamic flow in a small, slowly evaporating, sessile hemispherical droplet with a pinned contact line is considered. Analytical solutions are obtained for the Deegan outward flow, which is responsible for the coffee ring effect, as well as the Marangoni flow excited by a surface tension gradient. It is assumed that the surface tension gradient may be caused by anisotropic cooling of droplet surface or other factors, such as nonuniform illumination of an optically active surfactant. Two main types of boundary conditions, no-slip and full-slip, are considered in describing the flow-substrate interaction. It is shown that under the no-slip condition, there is a rigid relationship between the evaporation rate and the surface tension gradient, which imposes strict requirements on the temperature regime inside the droplet. This result offers a new vision of the critical Marangoni number, which describes the threshold for the transition of an evaporating droplet from capillary flow to developed Marangoni convection. The results of this work may attract the attention of experimenters to the study of the sensitivity of viscous flow in an evaporating droplet to the liquid-substrate boundary conditions, especially if the system under consideration passes into the Marangoni regime, when the no-slip condition changes to a partial or full slip condition due to the increase in viscous shear stress near the substrate.

Title: Quantum metrology with partially accessible chaotic sensors
Authors: Harshita Sharma, Sayan Choudhury, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: Most quantum metrology protocols harness highly entangled probe states and globally accessible measurements to surpass the standard quantum limit. However, it is challenging to satisfy these requirements in realistic many-body sensors. We demonstrate that both of these constraints can be overcome in quantum chaotic sensors. Crucially, we establish that even in the presence of partial measurement accessibility, chaotic dynamics enables initial unentangled states to exhibit Heisenberg scaling of the quantum Fisher information, $I_{\alpha}$ with time. In the weakly chaotic regime, we identify spin-coherent states placed at the edge of the regular islands in the mixed classical phase space as optimal initial states for enhanced sensitivity. On the other hand, in the strongly chaotic regime, $I_{\alpha}$ is insensitive to the choice of the initial state. Notably, quantum-enhanced sensitivity is achieved even when a very low fraction ($\sim 5\%$) of the qubits are accessible. These results establish quantum chaos as a robust resource for quantum-enhanced sensing under realistic accessibility constraints on accessibility.

Title: Neural Quantum States Based on Selected Configurations
Authors: Marco Julian Solanki, Lexin Ding, Markus Reiher
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) provide a flexible and highly expressive parameterization of wave functions for strongly correlated problems in quantum chemistry. Despite rapid advances in network architectures, the evaluation of electronic energies remains almost exclusively based on variational Monte Carlo (VMC). While VMC is effective for structured systems such as spin chains, its accuracy and efficiency for electronic Hamiltonians are hindered by sharply peaked distributions, stochastic gradient noise, and slow convergence with sample size. In this letter, we assess the capability of NQS-VMC to efficiently capture correlation in electronic ground states by comparing it to a recently developed NQS-based selected configuration (NQS-SC) approach. We set up a systematic comparison of the ground-state optimizations obtained with NQS-VMC and NQS-SC for molecular systems dominated by either static or dynamical correlation. The comparison demonstrates a clear advantage of NQS-SC over NQS-VMC in both energy accuracy and wave-function coefficients, particularly for statically correlated molecules. Moreover, NQS-SC exhibits robust systematic improvability, whereas NQS-VMC does not. These findings position NQS-SC as the new default approach over NQS-VMC for electronic structure calculations. We further observe that neither NQS-SC nor NQS-VMC can efficiently capture dynamical correlation, highlighting the need for future hybrid methods, such as multiconfigurational perturbation theories built on top of NQS solutions.

Title: Theory of Steady States for Lindblad Equations beyond Time-Independence: Classification, Uniqueness and Symmetry
Authors: Hironobu Yoshida, Ryusuke Hamazaki
Abstract: We present a rigorous and comprehensive classification of the asymptotic behavior of time-quasiperiodic Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equations under the assumption of Hermitian jump operators. Our main contributions are twofold: first, we establish a criterion for the uniqueness of steady states. The criterion is formulated in terms of the algebra generated by the GKSL generators and provides a necessary and sufficient condition when the generators are analytic functions of time. We demonstrate the utility of our criterion through prototypical examples, including quantum many-body spin chains. Second, we extend the concept of strong symmetry for time-dependent GKSL equations by introducing two distinct forms, strong symmetry in the Schrödinger picture and that in the interaction picture, and completely classify the asymptotic dynamics with them. More concretely, we rigorously uncover that the strong symmetry in the interaction picture is responsible for non-trivial time-dependent steady states, such as coherent oscillations, whereas that in the Schrödinger picture controls the existence of time-independent steady states. This classification not only encompasses established mechanisms underlying non-trivial oscillatory steady states, such as strong dynamical symmetry and Floquet dynamical symmetry, but also reveals symmetry-predicted, time-dependent asymptotic dynamics in a novel class of open quantum systems. Our framework thus provides a rigorous foundation for controlling dissipative quantum systems in a time-dependent manner.

Title: Deconfinement from Thermal Tensor Networks: Universal CFT signature in (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory
Authors: Adwait Naravane, Yuto Sugimoto, Shinichiro Akiyama, Jutho Haegeman, Atsushi Ueda
Abstract: Tensor networks offer a sign-problem-free approach to study lattice gauge theories, but extracting precise universal information associated with the deconfinement transition remains challenging. In this work, we study the deconfinement transition of (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories at finite temperature using a thermal tensor network approach, where the partition functions at finite temperature are formulated as three-dimensional tensor networks. These tensor networks are first contracted in the temporal direction, and the subsequent coarse-graining in the spatial directions yields a renormalized transfer matrix, the spectrum of which directly encodes the universal conformal field theory data. In particular, by numerically extracting the central charge and scaling dimensions, we verify that the universality class of the thermal deconfinement transition matches the prediction of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for $N=2,3,5$. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_5$ theory at finite temperature exhibits an intermediate phase with an emergent U(1) symmetry. Critical couplings are determined via Gu-Wen ratios and agree with existing Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, extrapolating these critical couplings at finite temperature enables us to determine the deconfinement transition points for $N=2,3$ at zero temperature.

Title: Hybrid Femtosecond Laser and Ion-Implantation Processing for Controlled, Deep, High-Efficiency Ablation in Fused Silica
Authors: Mario Garcia-Lechuga, Yoann Levy, Irene Solana, Fatima Cabello, Maria Dolores Ynsa, Nadezhda M. Bulgakova
Abstract: Femtosecond laser modification of fused silica enables precise surface tailoring for the fabrication of micro-optical components such as microlenses and diffractive elements. However, the process is governed by laser-matter interactions where the local fluence determines the processing depth, often limiting control over feature geometry and efficiency. Here, we present a hybrid approach combining localized Au implantation (1.8 MeV Au2+ ions) into SiO2 samples with femtosecond laser irradiation (250 fs), effectively tuning the laser-matter interaction and resulting morphology. At both 515 nm and 1030 nm irradiation wavelengths, single-shot femtosecond pulses produce cylindrical craters with sharp edges and flat-bottom profiles. Independently of the fluence, these craters exhibit a constant depth of 550 nm, corresponding to the region of maximum Au concentration. The effect manifests already at moderate fluence (app. 4 J/sq.cm) and yields high ablation efficiency, up to 15 cubic micrometers per microjoule. The hybrid method also works effectively at lower implantation doses that preserve the excellent transmission of fused silica, offering a promising pathway for the high-quality fabrication of flat optical components such as binary phase masks, phase lenses, or fused-silica micromolds.

Title: An Always-Accepting Algorithm for Transition Path Sampling
Authors: Magdalena Häupl, Sebastian Falkner, Peter G. Bolhuis, Christoph Dellago, Alessandro Coretti
Abstract: We present a one-way shooting algorithm for transition path sampling that accepts every proposed trajectory yet samples the correct transition path ensemble for systems with overdamped stochastic dynamics. The method is based on two key elements: a procedure to propose trajectories that are always reactive, and a reweighting scheme that corrects for the bias introduced by always accepting the proposed paths. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of transition path sampling by eliminating the cost associated with generating trajectories that are then rejected. We demonstrate the algorithm by investigating the formation of CO$_2$ clathrate hydrates along different reaction mechanisms, showing that the increased efficiency allows proper sampling of the formation of crystalline hydrates at temperatures and pressures that are difficult to access with conventional algorithms.

Title: Nuclear gradients from auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo and their application in geometry optimization and transition state search
Authors: Jo S. Kurian, Ankit Mahajan, Sandeep Sharma
Abstract: In this article, we present a method for computing accurate and scalable nuclear forces within the phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) framework. Our approach leverages automatic differentiation of the energy functional to obtain nuclear gradients at a computational cost comparable to that of energy evaluation. The accuracy of the method is validated against finite difference calculations, showing excellent agreement. We then explore several machine learning (ML) strategies for learning noisy AFQMC data. These ML potentials are subsequently used to perform geometry optimizations and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations, successfully identifying the transition state of the formamide-formimidic acid tautomerization. The resulting transition state geometry and barrier heights are in close agreement with coupled-cluster reference values. This work paves the way for highly accurate geometry optimization, molecular dynamics, or reaction path calculations.

Title: Semantic Chunking and the Entropy of Natural Language
Authors: Weishun Zhong, Doron Sivan, Tankut Can, Mikhail Katkov, Misha Tsodyks
Abstract: The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.

Title: Exact Universal Characterization of Chiral-Symmetric Higher-Order Topological Phases
Authors: Jia-Zheng Li, Xun-Jiang Luo, Fengcheng Wu, Meng Xiao
Abstract: Utilizing Bott index vectors formulated through a series of polynomials of position operators under open boundary conditions, we establish a universal, rigorous, and complete correspondence between the Bott index vector and topological zero-energy corner states in systems with chiral symmetry. Our framework covers systems of arbitrary shapes, including topological phases that are beyond the characterization by previously proposed invariants such as multipole moments or multipole chiral numbers. A key feature of our approach is its ability to capture the real-space patterns of zero-energy corner states, providing a deeper understanding of higher-order topological phases. We provide a rigorous analytical proof of its higher-order correspondence and sum rules for Bott index vectors under different boundary conditions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our theory, we examine several model systems with representative patterns of zero-energy corner states that lie outside the scope of previous classification frameworks.

Title: Generation of wave turbulence in dipolar gases driven across their phase transitions
Authors: G. A. Bougas, K. Mukherjee, S. I. Mistakidis
Abstract: Ultracold quantum gases with long-range anisotropic interactions host novel exotic phases of matter, such as supersolids, exhibiting both rigid and superfluid characteristics. The impact of this interplay on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of dipolar gases, and in particular its connection with universal turbulent behavior, remains highly unexplored. Here, upon considering a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate of dysprosium atoms being dynamically driven across the supersolid-superfluid phase transition and vice versa, we unveil the emergence of a robust nonequilibrium quasi-steady state. This state displays self-similar momentum distributions exhibiting algebraic decay at large momenta, with scaling exponents supporting the existence of wave turbulence. We demonstrate that supersolidity sustaining higher-lying momenta, associated with the roton minimum, promotes the development of turbulence. Our results provide a stepping stone toward unraveling and exploiting turbulent and self-similar behavior in anisotropically long-range interacting quantum gases amenable in current experiments.

Title: Phonon properties and unconventional heat transfer in quasi-2D $Bi_2O_2Se$ crystal
Authors: Jan Zich, Antonín Sojka, Petr Levinský, Martin Míšek, Kyo-Hoon Ahn, Jiří Navrátil, Jiří Hejtmánek, Karel Knížek, Václav Holý, Dmitry Nuzhnyy, Fedir Borodavka, Stanislav Kamba, Čestmír Drašar
Abstract: Bi2O2Se belongs to a group of quasi-2D semiconductors that can replace silicon in future high-speed/low-power electronics. However, the correlation between crystal/band structure and other physical properties still eludes understanding: carrier mobility increases non-intuitively with carrier concentration; the observed $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity lacks explanation. Moreover, a very high relative out-of-plane permittivity of about 150 has been reported in the literature. A proper explanation for such a high permittivity is still lacking. We have performed infrared (IR) reflectivity and Raman scattering experiments on a large perfect single crystal with defined mosaicity, carrier concentration and mobility. Five of the eight phonons allowed by factor group theory have been observed and their symmetries determined. The IR spectra show that the permittivity measured in the tetragonal plane is as high as ${\epsilon}_r{\approx}500$, and this high value is due to a strong polar phonon with a low frequency of ~34 $cm^{-1}$ (~1 THz). Such an unusually high permittivity allows the screening of charge defects, leading to the observation of high electron mobility at low temperatures. It also allows effective modulation doping providing a platform for high performance 2D electronics. DFT calculations suggest the existence of a very low frequency acoustic phonon ~14 $cm^{-1}$ (~0.4 THz). Both the low frequency phonons cause anomalous phonon DOS, which is reflected in the unconventional temperature dependence of the heat capacity, $c_M{\approx}T^{3.5}$. The temperature-dependent, two-component group velocity is proposed to explains the unusual temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, ${\kappa}{\approx}T^{1.5}$

Title: XDiag: Exact Diagonalization for Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Alexander Wietek, Luke Staszewski, Martin Ulaga, Paul L. Ebert, Hannes Karlsson, Siddhartha Sarkar, Leyna Shackleton, Aritra Sinha, Rafael D. Soares
Abstract: Exact diagonalization (ED) is a cornerstone technique in quantum many-body physics, enabling precise solutions to the Schrödinger equation for interacting quantum systems. Despite its utility in studying ground states, excited states, and dynamical behaviors, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size presents significant computational challenges. We introduce XDiag, an open-source software package designed to combine advanced and efficient algorithms for ED with and without symmetry-adapted bases with user-friendly interfaces. Implemented in C++ for computational efficiency and wrapped in Julia for ease of use, XDiag provides a comprehensive toolkit for ED calculations. Key features of XDiag include the first publicly accessible implementation of sublattice coding algorithms for large-scale spin system diagonalizations, efficient Lin table algorithms for symmetry lookups, and random-hashing techniques for distributed memory parallelization. The library supports various Hilbert space types (e.g., spin-1/2, electron, and t-J models), facilitates symmetry-adapted block calculations, and automates symmetry considerations. The package is complemented by extensive documentation, a user guide, reproducible benchmarks demonstrating near-linear scaling on thousands of CPU cores, and over 20 examples covering ground-state calculations, spectral functions, time evolution, and thermal states. By integrating high-performance computing with accessible scripting capabilities, XDiag allows researchers to perform state-of-the-art ED simulations and explore quantum many-body phenomena with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency.

Title: Floquet engineering spin triplet states in unconventional magnets
Authors: Pei-Hao Fu, Sayan Mondal, Jun-Feng Liu, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: We consider unconventional magnets with and without spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity and demonstrate the emergence of spin triplet states due to light drives. In particular, we find that a high-frequency linearly polarized light drive induces a spin-triplet density in $d$-wave altermagnets which does not exist in the static regime and can directly reveal the strength of the altermagnetic field. In this high-frequency regime, we also show that linearly polarized light enables the formation of odd-frequency spin-triplet superconducting correlations possessing $d$-wave and $s$-wave parities, which can be controlled by the light drive and accessed by measuring the spin density. Moreover, for low-frequency linearly and circularly polarized light drives, we obtain that the types of superconducting correlations are broadened due to the presence of Floquet bands, enabling spin-triplet pairs in $d$- and $p$-wave unconventional magnets, which are absent in the undriven phase.

Title: Ultracoherent self-assembled diamond nanomechanics reveals superfluid dynamics
Authors: Guanhao Huang, Chang Jin, Sophie Weiyi Ding, Chaoshen Zhang, Aaron M. Day, Tobias Elbs, Neil Sinclair, Sukhad Dnyanesh Joshi, Rodrick Kuate Defo, Bertrand I. Halperin, Evelyn Hu, Marko Lončar
Abstract: From gravitational-wave detection, protein force microscopy, to exploration of quantum-classical boundaries, many anticipated discoveries in fundamental science require improving measurement sensitivity limits. Through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, mechanical dissipation sets the acoustic noise for this limit. Yet, even in high-purity crystals, the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the acoustic loss remain poorly understood. Tension-induced dissipation dilution offers a route to ultralow acoustic loss, but is challenging to implement in crystalline materials including single-crystal diamond. Here we realize a strain-engineered diamond nanomechanical platform using a liquid-assisted van der Waals self-assembly process that harnesses intrinsic surface forces to apply tensile stress exceeding 1 GPa. At cryogenic temperatures these resonators achieve quality factors beyond 10 billion (intrinsic material quality factors beyond 100 million). This exceptional coherence turns them into a sensitive probe for residual dissipation, elucidating three distinct two-level-system channels and one topological dissipation channel from a surface superfluid helium film. Our work shows how advancing mechanical coherence opens access to new regimes of physics in hybrid quantum systems, precision metrology, and condensed-matter physics.

Title: Wavefunction textures in twisted bilayer graphene from first principles
Authors: Albert Zhu, Daniel Bennett, Daniel T. Larson, Mohammed M. Al Ezzi, Efstratios Manousakis, Efthimios Kaxiras
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments probing the wavefunctions of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we perform large-scale first-principles calculations of tBLG with full atomic relaxation across a wide range of twist angles down to $0.99^\circ$. Focusing on the magic angle, we compute wavefunctions of the low energy bands, resolving atomic-scale details and moiré-scale patterns that form triangular, honeycomb, and Kagome lattices. By tuning the interlayer interactions, we illustrate the formation of the flat bands from isolated monolayers and the emergence of the band inversion and fragile topology at a sufficiently large interaction strength. We identify strong indicators of a new phase transition with increasing interlayer interaction strength, achievable with external pressure or a decrease in the twist angle. When this transition occurs, the upper and lower flat bands exchange their wavefunction character and symmetry eigenvalues, which may be correlated with the appearance of superconductivity with electron doping below the magic angle. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using first-principles wavefunctions to help interpret experimental signatures of topological and correlated phases in tBLG.

Title: Atomistic modeling of uranium monocarbide with a machine learning interatomic potential
Authors: Lorena Alzate-Vargas, Kashi N. Subedi, Roxanne M. Tutchton, Michael W.D. Cooper, Tammie Gibson, Richard A. Messerly
Abstract: Uranium monocarbide (UC) is an advanced ceramic fuel candidate due to its superior uranium density and thermal conductivity compared to traditional fuels. To accurately model UC at reactor operating conditions, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using an active learning procedure to generate a comprehensive training dataset capturing diverse atomic configurations. The resulting MLIP predicts structural, elastic, thermophysical properties, defect formation energies, and diffusion behaviors, aligning well with experimental and theoretical benchmarks. This work significantly advances computational methods to explore UC, enabling efficient large-scale and long-time molecular dynamics simulations essential for reactor fuel qualification.

Title: Analysis of Spin Current Generation by Elastic Waves in $f$-wave Altermagnets
Authors: Ken Uchino, Yuuki Ogawa, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the mechanism of spin current generation induced by elastic waves in nonrelativistic magnets referred to as altermagnets. By analyzing an $f$-wave altermagnet formed by a three-sublattice noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure breaking the spatial inversion symmetry on a two-dimensional triangular lattice within the linear response theory, we show that the nonrelativistic antisymmetric spin-split band structure can give rise to spin current generation when either longitudinal or transverse elastic wave is applied. We find that the momentum dependence of the antisymmetric spin splitting leads to a characteristic direction-dependent spin current response. We also compare the present nonrelativistic magnetic-order-driven mechanism with the relativistic one in a nonmagnetic Rashba system. These findings highlight the potential of invesion-symmetry-breaking altermagnets as a spin current generator driven by elasticity without relying on the relativistic spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Entanglement entropy as a probe of topological phase transitions
Authors: Manish Kumar, Bharadwaj Vedula, Suhas Gangadharaiah, Auditya Sharma
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) provides a powerful probe of quantum phases, yet its role in identifying topological phase transitions in disordered systems remains underexplored. We introduce an exact EE-based framework that captures topological phase transitions even in the presence of disorder. Specifically, for a class of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model variants, we show that the difference in EE between half-filled and near-half-filled ground states, $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$, vanishes in the topological phase but remains finite in the trivial phase, a direct consequence of edge-state localization. This behavior persists even in the presence of quasiperiodic or binary disorder. By analyzing domain-wall configurations in the SSH chain, we further show how subsystem tuning allows one to distinguish genuine topological zero-energy eigenstates from trivial localized states. Exact phase boundaries, derived from Lyapunov exponents via transfer matrices, agree closely with numerical results from $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ and the topological invariant $\mathcal{Q}$, with instances where $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ outperforms $\mathcal{Q}$. Our results highlight EE as a robust diagnostic tool and a potential bridge between quantum information and condensed matter approaches to topological matter.

Title: Universal Crossover in the Three-Channel Charge Kondo Model at High Transparency
Authors: Nicolas Paris, Nicolas Dupuis, Christophe Mora
Abstract: Quantum impurity models provide a central framework for correlated electron physics, with quantum dots enabling controlled experimental realizations. While their weak-coupling behavior is well understood through mappings to Kondo Hamiltonians, the opposite regime of highly transparent contacts has lacked a controlled theoretical description. Using the functional renormalization group (FRG), we resolve this regime for the three-channel charge Kondo device of Ref.~\cite{iftikhar2018}, benchmarking against conformal field theory by reproducing the universal zero-frequency conductance and, crucially, going beyond it to obtain the full frequency crossover of the conductance and the full temperature crossover of the impurity entropy, together with a continuous line of fixed points for interacting leads. These results establish FRG as a powerful nonperturbative tool for quantum impurity problems in regimes inaccessible to conventional approaches, with direct implications for mesoscopic experiments.

Title: Bilayer graphene quantum dots as a quantum simulator of Haldane topological quantum matter
Authors: Daniel Miravet, Hassan Allami, Marek Korkusinski, Pawel Hawrylak
Abstract: We demonstrate here that a chain of Bilayer Graphene Quantum Dots (BLGQDs) can realize topological quantum matter by effectively simulating a spin-1 chain that hosts the Haldane phase within a specific range of parameters. We describe a chain of BLGQDs with two electrons per dot using an atomistic tight-binding model combined with exact diagonalization to solve the interacting few-electron problem. Coulomb interactions and valley-mixing effects are treated within a single microscopic framework, allowing us to systematically investigate spin and valley polarization transitions as functions of interaction strength and external tuning parameters. We calculate the low energy states for single and double QDs as a function of the number of electrons, identifying regimes of highly correlated multi-electron states. We confirm the presence of a spin-one ground state for two electrons. Then, we explore two coupled QDs with 4 electrons and extend the analysis to QD arrays. Using a mapping of the BLGQD chain to an effective bilinear-biquadratic (BLBQ) spin model, we demonstrate that BLGQD arrays can work as a quantum simulator for one-dimensional spin chains with emergent many-body topological phases.

Title: Quaking in Soft Granular Particles with Speed-dependent Friction: Effect of Inertia
Authors: Wei-Chang Lo, Jih-Chiang Tsai
Abstract: Our previous numerical simulation [C.-E. Tsai et al., Physical Review Research \textbf{6}, 023065 (2024)] has shown that, for soft granular particles under quasistatic shearing, incorporating a speed-dependent friction is essential to reproduce the rate-dependent stick-slip fluctuations that have been found in the laboratory experiment [J.-C. Tsai et al., Physical Review Letters \textbf{126}, 128001 (2021)]. As a continuation, here we employ the simulation in a wide range of driving speeds to examine the role of grain inertia in the quaking dynamics. With our Stribeck-Hertz model, we find that having the volume fraction exceeding a critical value $\phi_{\text{c}}$ is a necessary condition for the quaking to occur, and that the value of $\phi_{\text{c}}$ is determined by material parameters only, independent of the driving rate. The effect of grain inertia generally suppresses the occurrence of quaking, and we conclude by presenting the state diagrams which exhibit a progressive narrowing of the quaking regime as the driving speed increases and the disappearance of quaking at an extremely high shear rate.

Title: Structure of solutions to continuous constraint satisfaction problems through the statistics of wedged and inscribed spheres
Authors: Jaron Kent-Dobias
Abstract: The study of random landscapes has long relied on counting stationary points: metastable states and the barriers between them. However, this method is useless for describing flat regions, common in constraint satisfaction problems. We introduce a characterization of flat regions by counting the number of spheres that can be uniquely inserted into them, either by wedging spheres of fixed radius or by inscribing spheres of variable radius. The ratio of these counts constrains the topology of the solution space. We apply this characterization to the spherical perceptron and show the existence of at least two topological regimes.

Title: Nonreciprocity as a Generic Mechanism for Demixing in Flocking Mixtures
Authors: Charlotte Myin, Benoît Mahault
Abstract: We show that even weak nonreciprocal alignment leads to large-scale structure formation in flocking mixtures. By combining numerical simulations of a binary Vicsek model and the analysis of coarse-grained continuum equations, we demonstrate that nonreciprocity destabilizes the ordered phase formed by mutually aligning or anti-aligning species in a large part of the phase diagram. For aligning populations, this instability results in one species condensing in a single band that travels within a homogeneous liquid of the other species. When interactions are anti-aligning, both species self-assemble into polar clusters with large-scale chaotic dynamics. In both cases, the emergence of structures is accompanied by the demixing of the two species, despite the absence of repulsive interactions. Our theoretical analysis allows us to elucidate the origin of the instability, and show that it is generic to nonreciprocal flocks.

Title: Theory of In-Plane-Magnetic-Field-Dependent Excitonic Spectra in Atomically Thin Semiconductors
Authors: Michiel Snoeken, Paul Steeger, Robert Schmidt, Steffen Michaelis de Vasconcellos, Rudolf Bratschitsch, Andreas Knorr, Henry Mittenzwey
Abstract: The linear absorption spectrum of excitons in TMDC monolayers under the influence of an in-plane magnetic field is theoretically studied. We demonstrate that in-plane magnetic fields induce a hybridization between spin-bright and spin-dark exciton transitions, resulting in a brightening of spin-dark excitons. We analytically investigate spectral features including resonance energy shifts, broadening and amplitudes ratios. In particular, for a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with radiatively-limited linewidth, we find a complex interplay of dark-bright splitting and linewidth difference of both involved spin-bright and spin-dark excitons.

Title: Coupled dimerized alternating-bond quantum spin chains in the distorted honeycomb-lattice magnet Cu$_5$SbO$_6$

Abstract: We analyze powder-averaged inelastic neutron scattering and magnetization data for the distorted honeycomb compound Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ using a first-order dimer expansion calculation and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We show that, in contrast to the previously proposed honeycomb lattice model, Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ accommodates interacting dimerized spin chains with alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic couplings along the chain. Moreover, unlike the typical couplings observed in other Cu$^{2+}$-based distorted honeycomb magnets, the spin chains in Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ primarily couple through an antiferromagnetic coupling that arises between the honeycomb layers, rather than the expected interchain coupling in the layers. This finding reveals a different magnetic coupling scheme for Cu$_5$SbO$_6$. In addition, utilizing x-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we also refine the crystal structure and stacking-fault model of the compound.

Title: Stable Quantum Vortices in Lee-Huang-Yang Dipolar Superfluids
Authors: S. Sabari, R. Radha, Lauro Tomio, B. A. Malomed
Abstract: The nucleation and dynamics of vortices in the quasi-two-dimensional rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate are explored by taking into account the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the mean-field (MF) theory. Assuming approximate cancellation of the MF interactions, we focus on the formation of a pure LHY superfluid. The effect of rotational frequency $\Omega $ is investigated numerically by determining the corresponding number of stable vortices in the superfluid, together with the respective energy per particle $E$ and chemical potential $\mu $. The LHY superfluid provides a deep minimum of $E$ and $\mu $, indicating that it is a remarkably robust state of quantum matter. By fixing the LHY interaction strength, an exact single-vortex critical frequency is found, along with the respective chemical potential. A notable feature, observed when creating the LHY superfluid with fewer than five vortices, which is understood as being due to the superfluid's nonlinearity and trapping aspect ratio, is the large frequency ranges admitting the production of two and four vortices, as compared to the small frequency ranges to obtain one and three vortices.

Title: Dual thermal pseudocritical features in a spin-1/2 Ising chain with twin-diamond geometry
Authors: Onofre Rojas
Abstract: We study the coupled twin-diamond chain, a decorated one-dimensional Ising model motivated by the magnetic structure of $\mathrm{Cu}_{2}(\mathrm{TeO}_{3})_{2}\mathrm{Br}_{2}$. By applying an exact mapping to an effective Ising chain, we obtain the full thermodynamic description of the system through a compact transfer-matrix formulation. The ground-state analysis reveals five distinct phases, including two frustrated sectors with extensive degeneracy. These frustrated regions give rise to characteristic entropy plateaus and separate the ordered phases in the zero-temperature diagram. At low temperatures the model exhibits peculiar sharp yet continuous variations of entropy, magnetization, and response functions, reflecting clear signatures of pseudotransition behavior. The coupled twin-diamond chain thus provides an exactly solvable setting in which competing local configurations and internal frustration lead to pronounced dual pseudocritical features in one dimension.

Title: Local expression of fractional corner charges in obstructed atomic insulators and relationship with the fractional disclination charges
Authors: Hidetoshi Wada, Shuichi Murakami
Abstract: In obstructed atomic insulators, fractionally quantized charges appear at the corners of the crystals in the shapes of vertex-transitive polyhedra, and are given by the filling anomaly divided by the number of corners. Recent studies reveal that the filling anomaly for the cases with genus $0$ is universally given by the total charge at the Wyckoff position $1a$. In this study, we rewrite the formula in terms of the degree of sharpness of the corner, and show that the corner charge formula also holds for cases with arbitrary genus. We also extend our formula to vertex-transitive shell polyhedra, which are closed or open polyhedra without the bulk region, with all the vertices related by symmetry. Then, we show that the corner charges of such shell polyhedra are equal to the two-dimensional disclination charges of the corresponding disclinations. By identifying it with the disclination charge under the Wen-Zee action, we show that the coupling constant of the Wen-Zee action for a crystalline insulator is given by the total charge at the Wyckoff position at the disclination core.

Title: Why life is hot
Authors: Tanja Schilling, Patrick B. Warren, Wilson Poon
Abstract: The process of evolution by natural selection leads to phenotypes of increasing fitness. For cellular chemical reaction networks, this means optimising a variety of fitness functions such as robustness, precision, or sensitivity to external stimuli. We argue that these diverse goals can be achieved by a versatile, generic mechanism: coupling chemical reaction networks to reservoirs that are strongly out of equilibrium. Using theory and numerics we show that this mechanism of optimization comes at the price of significant heat dissipation. We compute the heat flux caused by kinetic proofreading in {\it Escherichia coli} and show that it constitutes a significant fraction of the total heat flux experimentally measured in this model organism. We then demonstrate that the degree of optimality achievable saturates, and that Nature appears to operate near saturation despite high energetic costs. We conclude that `life is hot' largely because of the need for a versatile mechanism to optimise a variety of fitness functions.

Title: Self-consistent renormalized spin-wave theory of magnetic and topological transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb ferromagnets
Authors: Jian-Lin Li, Chien-Te Wu
Abstract: We investigate finite-temperature magnetic and topological phase transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb ferromagnets using an extended self-consistent renormalized spin-wave theory (SRSWT) that incorporates higher-order corrections from the Holstein--Primakoff expansion. Focusing on the combined effects of single-ion anisotropy, Zeeman field, next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) exchange, and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction, we analyze how these parameters influence the magnetization curves and magnon spectra. This work serves two main goals. First, we critically examine the limitations of SRSWT, showing that in the absence of external or interaction tuning, the theory tends to overestimate magnon self-energy corrections, often predicting first-order magnetic transitions with multivalued magnetization and metastable solution branches (i.e., self-consistent but thermodynamically unstable states). Second, we demonstrate that topological transitions -- signaled by magnon gap closings at the Dirac points -- can be tuned to occur below the magnetic transition temperature and within the thermodynamically stable regime. In particular, we identify two practical tuning strategies: applying an external Zeeman field of appropriate sign depending on the anisotropy strength, and introducing a small antiferromagnetic NNN exchange coupling. These findings not only clarify the predictive scope and limitations of SRSWT but also provide experimentally relevant guidance for realizing thermally driven topological transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb magnetic insulators.

Title: Parameter-free prediction of irradiation defect structures in tungsten at room temperature using stochastic cluster dynamics
Authors: Sicong He, Brandon Schwendeman, George Tynan, Jaime Marian
Abstract: The foundations of irradiation damage theory were laid in the 1950s and 60s within the framework of chemical reaction kinetics. While helpful to analyze qualitative aspects of irradiation damage, the theory contained gaps that delayed its implementation and applicability as a predictive tool. The advent of computer simulations with atomistic resolution in the 80s and 90s revealed a series of mechanisms that have proved essential to understand key aspects of irradiation damage in crystalline solids. However, we still lack a comprehensive model that can connect atomic-level defect physics with experimental measurements of quantitative features of the irradiated microstructure. In this work, we present a mesoscale model that draws from our improved understanding of irradiation damage processes collected over the last few decades, bridging knowledge gained from our most sophisticated atomistic simulations with defect kinetics taking place over time scales many orders of magnitude larger than atomic interaction times. Importantly, the model contains no adjustable parameters and combines several essential pieces of irradiation damage physics: each playing an irreplaceable role in the context of the full model but of limited utility if considered in isolation. Crucially, we carry out a set of experiments carefully designed to isolate the key irradiation damage variables and facilitate validation. Using tungsten as a model material, we find exceptionally good agreement between our numerical predictions and experimental measurements of defect densities and defect cluster sizes.

Title: Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids
Authors: Subir Sachdev
Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to ultracold atom experiments on the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor. The ALM also leads to a wavefunction for the FL* state of the Hubbard model, which agrees with ultracold atom observations.

Title: Bicontinuity in active phase separation
Authors: Paarth Gulati, Liang Zhao, Michio Tateno, Omar A. Saleh, Zvonimir Dogic, M. Cristina Marchetti
Abstract: We study phase separation between coexisting active and passive fluids in three-dimensions, using numerical simulation and experiments. Chaotic flows of the active phase drive giant interfacial deformations, causing the co-existing phases to interpenetrate and generate a continuously reconfiguring bicontinuous morphology which persists over the lifetime of the active fluid. Active bicontinuous structures are dominated by sheet-like interfaces, in marked difference from passive liquid-liquid phase separation which is controlled by saddle-like surfaces. Activity and surface tension control the length scale of the bicontinuous structure. These results demonstrate how active stresses suppress the coarsening of conventional phase separation, generating steady-state reconfigurable morphologies not accessible with conventional surface-modifying agents or through quenching of transient phase separated structures.

Title: Transition Metal Dichalcogenide MoS${}_2$: oxygen and fluorine functionalization for selective plasma processing
Authors: Yury Polyachenko, Yuri Barsukov, Shoaib Khalid, Igor Kaganovich
Abstract: Low-temperature plasma processing is a promising technique for tailoring transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). For chalcogen substitution processing, a key challenge is to identify the ion energy window that enables selective chalcogen removal while preserving the metal lattice. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we demonstrate that oxygen and fluorine functionalization widen the processing window by significantly lowering the sulfur sputtering energy threshold ($E_{\text{sputt,S}}$) of MoS${}_2$ from $\sim 30$ eV to $\sim 10$ eV via formation of sputtering products such as SO${}_2$ and SF${}_n$. Additionally, we show that experimentally relevant cryogenic temperatures strongly affect $E_{\text{sputt,S}}$. The dependence is confirmed via AIMD and also predicted by a mechanistic parameter-free theory, suggesting that $E_{\text{sputt}}(T)$ generalizes to other TMDs, functionalization, and surface impacts in general. Our results highlight oxygen/fluorine functionalization, ionic impact angle, and material temperature to be key control parameters for selective, damage-controlled chalcogen removal in TMD processing.

Title: Reaching the intrinsic performance limits of superconducting strip photon detectors up to 0.1 mm wide

Abstract: Single-photon detection underpins a wide range of emerging photonic technologies, from quantum information processing and secure communications to photon-starved biomedical imaging. Among the available detector technologies, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) combine high detection efficiency, low noise, and excellent timing resolution, making them a leading platform for photon-counting applications. However, despite decades of materials and fabrication research, detector performance has never been shown to match theoretical performance expectations. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from its typical, suboptimal operation, to a regime limited only by material quality, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting "rails" placed on either side of the detector that redistribute current across its width to achieve its peak performance. This technique not only reduces the dark count rate by ten orders of magnitude, but also enables future detectors to overcome the Pearl limit for device width, paving the way for arbitrarily large detectors. We show operation at this intrinsic performance limit for devices up to 0.1 mm wide, and also demonstrate near-unity internal detection efficiency (IDE) at a wavelength of 4um for a 20um-wide detector--a factor of 20 wider than the current state of the art.

Title: Electronic Structure of Epitaxial Films of the Bilayer Strontium Ruthenate: Sr$_{3}$Ru$_2$O$_{7}$

Abstract: We report the first combined study of the low-energy electronic band structure of epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory. The complete Fermi-surface topography of the near-Fermi-level bands is determined from in-situ ARPES measurements. To investigate the effects of substrate-induced strain on the band structure, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ and (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. The combination of the measured Fermi-surfaces along with the theoretical interpretation, clearly show dramatic changes in the Fermi surface topologies that result from the underlying strain states of the films on the two substrates. We find that the Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films prepared on SrTiO$_3$ are tensile strained with tetragonal symmetry, whereas those grown on (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ are compressively strained with orthorhombic symmetry. Within $\sim15~\text{meV}$ below the Fermi level, we observe two flat bands along $\Gamma$-$X$ in the orthorhombic phase and around $\Gamma$ in the tetragonal phase. These features could be favorable for van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, and highlight the emergence of magnetic instabilities in epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films.

Title: Odd-Parity Magnetism and Gate-Tunable Edelstein Response in van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Hanbyul Kim, Chan Bin Bark, Seik Pak, Gibaik Sim, Moon Jip Park
Abstract: Odd-parity magnetism has attracted significant interest for its unconventional spin splitting. However, a concrete microscopic route for its realization remains elusive. In this work, we propose van der Waals heterostructures of stripe antiferromagnets (sAFMs) as an ideal platform for electrically controllable $p$-wave magnetism. In the sAFM/metal/sAFM structure, the leading RKKY-type exchange interaction is canceled due to the symmetry of the stacking pattern. This exposes a higher-order biquadratic interaction as a dominant contribution that drives a filling-controlled transition from a collinear phase to an orthogonal $p$-wave configuration. The resulting $p$-wave phase exhibits a gate-tunable Edelstein response, which originates from magnetic symmetry breaking rather than conventional relativistic spin-momentum locking and remains robust even under substantial spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we propose material candidates for the realization of our theory. Our results establish van der Waals heterostructures as a practical platform for non-relativistic spintronics with electric control of odd-parity spin textures.

Title: Two-photon-assisted collisions in ultracold gases of polar molecules II : Optical shielding of ultracold polar molecular collisions
Authors: Gohar Hovhannesyan, Charbel Karam, Romain Vexiau, Leon Karpa, Maxence Lepers, Nadia Bouloufa-Maafa, Olivier Dulieu
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the collisions between ultracold polar molecules in the presence of two lasers ensuring a Raman resonant transition on individual molecules to suppress photon scattering, taking the example of bosonic $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K molecules. By varying laser detunings and intensities, we enable a repulsive long-range interaction potential between molecules. After solving a set of coupled Schrödinger equations with the Hamiltonian written in the basis of laser-dressed states of the molecule pair at infinite distance, we identify quasi-resonant conditions under which elastic collisions are favored over inelastic and reactive ones, by a factor of about 2, thus demonstrating a promising pathway for efficient two-photon optical shielding of ultracold molecular collisions. The results are analyzed in terms of scattering length of the colliding laser-dressed molecules, which exhibit prominent resonances assigned to the interaction of the entrance channel with other specific channels, consistent with the existence of a quasi-bound level of the long-range molecular pair induced by the lasers.

Title: Elastoresistance as probe of strain-controlled entropy from Kondo scattering
Authors: Soumendra Nath Panja, Jacques G. Pontanel, Julian Kaiser, Anton Jesche, Philipp Gegenwart
Abstract: Heavy-fermion metals are prototype correlated electron systems for the study of Kondo entanglement and quantum criticality. We use the symmetry decomposed elastoresistance to uncover the fingerprints of strain-dependent Kondo scattering as function of temperature and magnetic field in the prototypical tetragonal Kondo lattice YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. By combining longitudinal and transverse resistance measurements under uniaxial strain applied along the tetragonal $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions, we obtain the elastoresistive responses in the $A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels. While the responses in the symmetry-breaking channels are negligible, the isotropic $A_{1g}$ elastoresistance displays characteristic sign changes and approaches huge values at low temperatures. Scaling analysis and comparison with linear thermal expansion measurements reveals that the elastoresistance probes the contribution of Kondo scattering to the strain dependence of magnetic entropy and signals strain-controlled quantum criticality upon cooling to 2 K.

Title: An optimal lower bound for the low density Fermi gas in three dimensions
Authors: Emanuela L. Giacomelli
Abstract: We consider the dilute Fermi gas in three dimensions interacting through a positive, radially symmetric, compactly supported and integrable potential in the thermodynamic limit. We establish a second order lower bound for the ground state energy density with an error term which is optimal in the sense that it matches the order of the next correction term conjectured by Huang-Yang in 1957.

Title: Nonhermitian topological zero modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions
Authors: Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence predicts the existence of boundary modes localized at the edges of topologically nontrivial systems. The wavefunctions of hermitian boundary modes can be obtained as the eigenmodes of a modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation. The bulk-boundary correspondence has also been extended to nonhermitian systems, which describe physical phenomena such as gain and loss in open and non-equilibrium systems. Nonhermitian energy spectra can be complex-valued and exhibit point gaps or line gaps in the complex plane, whether the gaps can be continuously deformed into points or lines, respectively. Specifically, line-gapped nonhermitian systems can be continuously deformed into hermitian gapped spectra. Here, we find the analytical form of the wavefunctions of nonhermitian boundary modes with zero energy localized at smooth domain boundaries between topologically distinct phases by solving the generalized Jackiw-Rebbi equation in the nonhermitian regime. Moreover, we unveil a universal relation between the scalar fields and the decay rate and oscillation wavelength of the boundary modes. This relation quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in nonhermitian line-gapped systems through physical quantities that are experimentally measurable. Furthermore, this relation is not affected by the specific spatial variations of the scalar fields. These results offer new insights into the localization properties of boundary modes in nonhermitian and topologically nontrivial states of matter.

Title: Emergent Quantum Walk Dynamics from Classical Interacting Particles
Authors: Surajit Saha
Abstract: The dynamics of a discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) can be realized within a purely classical interacting particle system composed of some boxes and a large but finite number of balls, and can, in principle, be implemented in a tabletop experimental setting. The distribution of the balls evolves under stochastic, occupation-dependent update rules at each lattice site, producing quantum-walk dynamics without invoking a wavefunction. The update parameters are fixed by the parameters of coin and shift operations of the DTQW. This framework naturally yields a generalized active spin model and provides a minimal lattice-based microscopic understanding of the emergence of quantum-like dynamics in active matter systems. This interdisciplinary approach connects the classical models to the broad range of applications where DTQWs are successfully employed.

Title: Real-time adaptive tracking of fluctuating relaxation rates in superconducting qubits

Abstract: The fidelity of operations on a solid-state quantum processor is fundamentally bounded by environmental decoherence. Characterizing environmental fluctuations is challenging because the acquisition time of nonadaptive experimental protocols limits temporal precision and can average out rapid features of the underlying dynamics. Here, we overcome this temporal-resolution limit by two orders of magnitude using a field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) powered classical controller that adaptively and continuously tracks the relaxation-time fluctuations of two fixed-frequency superconducting transmon qubits, which exhibit average relaxation times of approximately 0.17 ms and occasionally exceed 0.5 ms. We report events in which the relaxation time switches by nearly an order of magnitude over timescales of just tens of milliseconds, rather than minutes or hours as previously reported. Our real-time Bayesian estimation protocol estimates relaxation times within a few milliseconds, close to the decoherence timescale itself. Our statistical analysis further suggests that some of these fast fluctuations arise from two-level systems switching at rates up to 10 Hz, four orders of magnitude faster than earlier reports. These results redefine the timescales relevant for calibration in superconducting quantum processing units, establish a reference for rapid relaxation-rate characterization in device screening, and improve our understanding of fast relaxation dynamics.

Title: Universal properties of the many-body Lanczos algorithm at finite size
Authors: Luca Capizzi, Leonardo Mazza, Sara Murciano
Abstract: We study the universal properties of the Lanczos algorithm applied to finite-size many-body quantum systems. Focusing on autocorrelation functions of local operators and on their infinite-time behaviour at finite size, we conjecture that in the large $n$ limit, the ratios between consecutive Lanczos coefficients should have specific scalings with the size of the lattice that we make precise and that depend on the hydrodynamic tail of the autocorrelation function. The scaling associated with strong or approximate zero-modes is also discussed. We support our conjecture with a numerical study of different models.

Abstract: We study the stability of steady-state solutions of the Wave-Kinetic Equations for acoustic waves. Combining theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we characterise the time evolution of small isotropic perturbations for both 2D and 3D equilibrium Rayleigh-Jeans and non-equilibrium Kolmogorov-Zakharov solutions. In particular, we show that the stability of these solutions is ensured by different mechanisms.

Title: Quantifying the Role of Higher-Lying Excited States in Organic Emitters via Multistate Ab Initio Kinetic Modeling
Authors: Yue He, Daniel Escudero
Abstract: Higher lying excited states beyond S1 and T1 are widely recognized in many photophysical systems, including thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). However, their explicit and quantitative impact on photophysical observables such as photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and lifetimes is difficult to be attained experimentally and it has not been systematically assessed within a fully ab initio kinetic modeling framework. To address this gap, we developed KinLuv, a multistate excited state kinetic model that includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2) and all possible monomolecular interconversion processes between all the electronic states, whose rate constants were computed using Fermi golden rule explicitly including the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling effect. We applied KinLuv to prototypical multi resonance TADF (MRTADF) emitters and their derivatives, as well as other representative organic chromophores, demonstrating its broad applicability across diverse photophysical playgrounds beyond TADF. The resulting simulations quantitatively reproduce key experimental observables, including PLQY and prompt and delayed fluorescence lifetimes. Beyond its predictive power, the present results establish clear criteria for identifying when higher lying excited states influence the excited state decay and when simplified models remain adequate. This framework enables rational selection of minimal kinetic models that balance physical insight with numerical robustness, with direct implications for the in silico design of high performance organic emitters.

Title: Casimir-Lifshitz interaction between bodies integrated in a microelectromechanical/nanoelectromechanical quantum damped oscillator
Authors: Yu. S. Barash
Abstract: A theory is proposed for the component of the Casimir-like force that arises between bodies embedded in a macroscopic quantum damped oscillator. When the oscillator's parameters depend on the distance between the bodies, the oscillator-induced Casimir-like force is generally determined by a broad spectral range extending to high frequencies, limited by the frequency dispersion of the damping function. Here it is shown that there is a large class of systems in which the low-frequency range dominates the forces. This allows for the use of the Ohmic approximation, which is crucial for extending the theory to the lumped element description of fluctuation-induced forces in electrical circuits. Estimates of the circuit-induced Casimir-Lifshitz force suggest that under certain conditions it can be identified experimentally due to its dependence on various circuit elements.

Authors: Ronen M. Kroeze, Sofus Laguna Kristensen, Sebastian Pucher
Abstract: Ytterbium-171 is a versatile atomic species often used in quantum optics, precision metrology, and quantum computing. Consolidated atomic data is essential for the planning, execution, and evaluation of experiments. In this reference, we present physical and optical properties of neutral $^{171}$Yb relevant to these applications. We emphasize experimental results and supplement these with theoretical estimates. We present equations to convert values and derive important parameters. Tabulated results include key parameters for commonly used transitions in $^{171}$Yb (${}^1\mathrm{S}_0\rightarrow{}^1\mathrm{P}_1$, ${}^1\mathrm{S}_0\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2}\,$, ${}^3\mathrm{P}_{0,2}\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{S}_1$, and ${}^3\mathrm{P}_0\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{D}_1$). This dataset serves as an up-to-date reference for studies involving fermionic $^{171}$Yb.

Title: Non-Abelian interference of topological edge states
Authors: Shi Hu, Meiqing Hu, Zhoutao Lei
Abstract: Topological boundary states exhibit distinctive properties, including unidirectional propagation and noise robustness, which hold significant potential for advancing the performance of quantum science and technology. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of non-Abelian quantum interference and entanglement generation, protected by dual symmetries (time-independent inversion and time-dependent interchain), in coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains. Specifically, in a multichain system, we first achieve tunable topological transfer of a single particle, where the destination chain is selected by the permutation sequence. We then extend this to two particles, observing a non-Abelian Hong-Ou-Mandel interference that generates spatially entangled NOON states whose properties are dictated by the permutation sequence. Our work establishes an alternative pathway for exploring non-Abelian topology applied to quantum science and technology, enabled by the unique protection of time-dependent symmetry.

Title: Modeling dissipation in quantum active matter
Authors: Alexander P. Antonov, Sangyun Lee, Benno Liebchen, Hartmut Löwen, Jannis Melles, Giovanna Morigi, Yehor Tuchkov, Michael te Vrugt
Abstract: Active matter denotes a system of particles immersed in an external environment, from which the particles extract energy continuously in order to perform directed motion. Extending the paradigm of active matter to a quantum framework requires an appropriate description of the environment. In this work, we consider a driven quantum particle undergoing noise and dissipation, with external driving exhibiting characteristics of classical activity. We model the non-unitary dynamics with time-local master equations and analyze the particle motion at different time scales for different forms of the master equations, satisfying different criteria. We systematically compare predictions on the dynamics of particle trajectories and thereby we uncover how the particle motion evolves under the interplay of quantum effects, dissipation, and active-like dynamics. These results are essential for guiding possible experiments aimed at realizing quantum analogues of classical active systems.

Title: Thermodynamic Isomorphism of Transformers: A Lagrangian Approach to Attention Dynamics
Authors: Gunn Kim
Abstract: We propose an effective field-theoretic framework for analyzing Transformer attention through a thermodynamic lens. By constructing a Lagrangian on the information manifold equipped with the Fisher metric, we show that, within the Shannon--Boltzmann entropy framework, the Softmax function arises as a stationary solution minimizing a Helmholtz free energy functional. This establishes a formal correspondence between scaled dot-product attention and canonical ensemble statistics. Extending this mapping to macroscopic observables, we define an effective specific heat associated with fluctuations of the attention energy landscape. In controlled experiments on the modular addition task ($p = 19$--$113$), we observe a robust peak in this fluctuation measure that consistently precedes the onset of generalization. While no asymptotic power-law divergence is detected in this finite-depth regime, the reproducible enhancement of energy variance suggests a critical-like crossover accompanying representational reorganization. Our framework provides a unified statistical-mechanical perspective on attention scaling, training dynamics, and positional encoding, interpreting the phenomena as emergent properties of an effective thermodynamic system rather than isolated heuristics. Although the present results indicate finite-size crossover behavior rather than a strict phase transition, they motivate further investigation into scaling limits of deep architectures through fluctuation-based observables.

Title: Disturbing news about the $d=2+ε$ expansion II. Assessing the recombination scenario
Authors: Fabiana De Cesare, Slava Rychkov
Abstract: In [De Cesare, Rychkov (2025)], we revisited the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion in the $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM), emphasizing the existence of a protected operator which is a closed form with $N-1$ indices. The scaling dimension of this operator stays exactly equal to $N-1$, independently of $\epsilon$. Its existence is problematic for the identification of the NLSM fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ with the Wilson-Fisher fixed point family obtained by analytically continuing from near $d=4$, which does not possess such a protected operator. Multiplet recombination is one scenario discussed in [De Cesare, Rychkov (2025)], which could allow to connect the two families continuously (although not analytically). In this scenario, the protected dimension is lifted at some critical value of $\epsilon$, thanks to the short conformal multiplet of scaling dimension $N-1$ eating a long conformal multiplet of higher scaling dimension. In this followup work, we assess this scenario for the cases $N=3$ and $N=4$. We identify the lowest candidates for the long multiplet which could be eaten, and compute their one-loop anomalous dimensions. We find that at one loop, scaling dimensions of these candidates grow with $\epsilon$, while it should decrease down to $N$ for the recombination to occur. We conclude that multiplet recombination is unlikely.

Title: Tuning Optical Properties of FTO via Carbonaceous Al2O3 Microdot Deposition by DC plasma sputtering
Authors: Sarah Salah, Ahmed Atlam, Nagat Elkahwagy, Abdelhamid Elshaer, Mohammed Shihab
Abstract: Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is a key transparent conductive oxide for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, yet its high reflectance limits light-trapping efficiency. This work demonstrates a simple DC plasma sputtering approach to deposit carbonaceous Al2O3 microdots on FTO under controlled Ar, O2, and Ar-O2 atmospheres. For plasma discharge in the normal mode, with plasma density 10^9 cm^-3 and temperature of 2 eV, Volmer-Weber growth produced discrete microdots whose size and distribution were tuned by gas composition: dense, uniform dots in Ar (approximately 0.89 um radius), agglomerated structures in O2, and intermediate morphologies in mixed atmospheres. Structural analysis confirmed Al2O3 formation with carbon incorporation, while SEM revealed morphology-driven optical behavior. UV-Vis measurements showed that Ar-O2 coatings achieved the lowest reflectance across the visible range, outperforming bare FTO and other conditions. These findings establish a clear link between sputtering parameters, surface morphology, and optical performance, offering a scalable route to anti-reflective, light-trapping coatings for next-generation solar cells and optoelectronic devices.
