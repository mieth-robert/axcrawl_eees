Title: Double Perovskites K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6 from First-Principles: Towards Efficient Materials for Green Energy
Authors: Ouendadji Salima, Aissani Ali, El Haj Hassan Fouad, Benahmedi Lakhdar
Abstract: The structural flexibility and multifunctional nature of double perovskite oxides make them attractive for applications requiring coupled optical, mechanical, and thermal performance. Using first-principles computations, this study examines the structural, electronic, elastic, optical, and thermoelectric stability of K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6. The two compounds combine to form a cubic double perovskite structure with ordered Nb$^{5+}$ and Ta$^{5+}$ cations. The calculated elastic constants satisfy the Born stability criteria, confirming mechanical stability; however, both K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6 exhibit brittle behavior according to Pugh's ratio, reflecting limited ductility. Semiconducting behavior is revealed by band structure analysis with energy gaps of 2.79 eV for K2NbTaO6 and 2.63 eV for Rb2NbTaO6. Optical spectra show noticeable absorption in the high-energy region near the UV, indicating relevance for theoretical studies of optoelectronic and photocatalytic processes, without implying practical device efficiency.

Title: Symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces
Authors: Minho Luke Kim, Salvatore D. Pace, Shu-Heng Shao
Abstract: We identify a symmetry that enforces every symmetric model to have a Fermi surface. These symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces are realizations of a powerful form of symmetry-enforced gaplessness. The symmetry we construct exists in quantum lattice fermion models on a $d$-dimensional Bravais lattice, and is generated by the onsite U(1) fermion number symmetry and non-onsite Majorana translation symmetry. The resulting symmetry group is a non-compact Lie group closely related to the Onsager algebra. For a symmetry-enforced Fermi surface $\cal{F}$, we show that this UV symmetry group always includes the subgroup of the ersatz Fermi liquid L$_{\cal{F}}$U(1) symmetry group formed by even functions ${f(\mathbf{k})\in\mathrm{U}(1)}$ with ${\mathbf{k}\in \cal{F}}$. Furthermore, we comment on the topology of these symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces, proving they generically exhibit at least two non-contractible components (i.e., open orbits).

Title: Quantum geometry and linear orbital response in arbitrary $SU(2)$ representation
Authors: Rhonald Burgos Atencia
Abstract: We develop a unified framework to compute band-geometric quantities in multiband systems whose low-energy Hamiltonians realize arbitrary $SU(2)$ representations. Exploiting the presence of a quantization axis, we use the Wigner--Eckart theorem to identify the allowed interband matrix elements and obtain compact analytic expressions for the quantum geometric tensor, the orbital magnetic moment, and the resulting orbital transport coefficients. The formalism applies to both multifold fermions and gapped $SU(2)$ models. Its versatility is demonstrated through explicit calculations in representative $SU(3)$ and $SU(4)$ settings, where orbital Edelstein and orbital Hall responses arise naturally from the antisymmetric components of the band geometry. Our results reveal a universal link between the algebraic structure of the Hamiltonian and emergent orbitronic phenomena.

Title: Deformed LDPC codes with spontaneously broken non-invertible duality symmetries
Authors: Pranay Gorantla, Tzu-Chen Huang
Abstract: Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are a well known class of Pauli stabiliser Hamiltonians that furnish fixed-point realisations of nontrivial gapped phases such as symmetry breaking and topologically ordered (including fracton) phases. In this work, we propose symmetry-preserving deformations of these models, in the presence of a transverse field, and identify special points along the deformations with interesting features: (i) the special point is frustration-free, (ii) its ground states include a product state and the code space of the underlying code, and (iii) it remains gapped in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly. A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph. We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice. Of particular interest is the 2+1d transverse field Ising model: while there is no non-invertible duality symmetry in this case, our results, together with known numerical results, suggest the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram.

Title: Andreev Optoelectronics
Authors: Benjamin Remez, Pouyan Ghaemi, Jay D. Sau, Mohammad Hafezi
Abstract: Superconducting weak-link junctions host electron--hole hybridized excitations called Andreev bound states. These have attracted significant interest for the role they play in the device microelectronic operation and for quantum information applications. Andreev physics has so far been synonymous with the microwave range. However, the maturation of superconductor--semiconductor hybrid junctions opens the door to the characterization, and manipulation, of Andreev states by light. Here we introduce a model for light--Andreev interaction, with distinct features: Electrons transitioning into Andreev levels can sidestep Pauli exclusion, resulting in two optical absorption resonances separated by twice the bound state energy. One resonance populates the Andreev state and the other empties it; pumping both resets the junction and prevents saturation. Given their natural microwave coupling, we show how Andreev bound states can operate as optical--to--microwave transducers. We illustrate these effects with realistic device parameters. Our results highlight the possibilities in the new field of Andreev optoelectronics.

Title: 2D Helical Twist Controls Tricritical Point in an Interacting Majorana Chain
Authors: Hekai Zhao, Philip Phillips
Abstract: We analyze a series of interacting Majorana Fermion chains with finite range pair interactions with coupling strength $g$ that all exhibit a tri-critical point that separates an Ising critical phase from a supersymmetric gapped phase. We first notice that the interacting models exhibit an even-odd asymmetry depending on the number of sites, $\delta$, over which the interaction ranges. The even case exhibits competing order, thereby making it numerically untractable while the odd case exhibits an exactly solvable point at $g=-0.5$ where the entanglement entropy vanishes. By introducing a swirling geometrical twist, we map our 1D $\delta$-range chains to a series of 2D $\delta/2$-width models. Our new 2D models possess a unique helical boundary condition, constructed from 1D chains with the end of one connected to the start of another. We propose that the phase transition in the 1D system can be understood as a finite-system size transition in 2D. That is, the $g_c-\delta$ behavior is controlled by a 2D tri-critical universality class at $\delta\to\infty$ limit and is predicted by finite-size scaling theory.

Title: Phase Transitions without gap closing in monitored quantum mean-field systems
Authors: Luca Capizzi, Riccardo Travaglino
Abstract: We investigate the monitored dynamics of many-body quantum systems in which projective measurements of extensive operators are alternated with unitary evolution. Focusing on mean-field models characterized by all-to-all interactions, we develop a general framework that captures the thermodynamic limit, where a semiclassical description naturally emerges. Remarkably, we uncover novel stationary states, distinct from the conventional infinite-temperature state, that arise upon taking the infinite-volume limit. Counterintuitively, this phenomenon is not linked to the closing of the Lindbladian gap in that limit. We provide analytical explanation for this unexpected behavior.

Title: Characterizing Defect Dynamics in Silicon Carbide Using Symmetry-Adapted Collective Variables and Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Soumajit Dutta, Cunzhi Zhang, Gustavo Perez Lemus, Juan J. de Pablo, Francois Gygi, Giulia Galli, Andrew L. Ferguson
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) divacancies are attractive candidates for spin defect qubits possessing long coherence times and optical addressability. The high activation barriers associated with SiC defect formation and motion pose challenges for their study by first-principles molecular dynamics. In this work, we develop and deploy machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to accelerate defect dynamics simulations while retaining ab initio accuracy. We employ an active learning strategy comprising symmetry-adapted collective variable discovery and enhanced sampling to compile configurationally diverse training data, calculation of energies and forces using density functional theory (DFT), and training of an E(3)-equivariant MLIP based on the Allegro model. The trained MLIP reproduces DFT-level accuracy in defect transition activation free energy barriers, enables the efficient and stable simulation of multi-defect 216-atom supercells, and permits an analysis of the temperature dependence of defect thermodynamic stability and formation/annihilation kinetics to propose an optimal annealing temperature to maximally stabilize VV divacancies.

Title: Enhancing solar cell efficiency of AlxIn1-xN/Si heterojunctions using an a-Si buffer: A study of material, interface and device properties
Authors: M. Sun, R. G. Cornejo, M. de la Mata, S. I. Molina, B. Damilano, S. Valdueza-Felip, F. B. Naranjo
Abstract: This study explores the impact of an optimized amorphous silicon (a-Si) buffer layer on AlxIn1-xN-on-Si(100) heterojunction solar cells, with Al content varying from 0% (InN) to 55%. The buffer layer improves the structural quality of the AlInN layer, as evidenced by reduced full width at half maximum values in X-ray diffraction rocking curves around the AlInN (0002) peak. Atomic force microscopy reveals that the buffer layer does not alter surface roughness. The effectiveness of the a-Si buffer is demonstrated by an enhancement of the conversion efficiency under AM1.5G illumination from 3.3 % to 3.9 % for devices with 35 % Al. Looking at the effect of the Al content in devices with the a-Si buffer, the device with 22% Al shows the best photovoltaic performance, with a conversion efficiency of 4.1 % and a VOC of 0.42 V, JSC of 15.4 mA/cm2, and FF of 63.3%. However, performance declines for Al contents above 36% due to increased resistivity and reduced carrier concentration. These findings highlight the critical role of the novel a-Si buffer layer developed by RF-sputtering and the Al content in optimizing AlInN/Si heterojunction solar cell performance.

Title: Ferroelectric Hysteresis in Superconducting Bilayers
Authors: Yanfang Li, Xin-Zhi Li, Wen-Yu He
Abstract: Recently, coexisting ferroelectricity and superconductivity were reported in bilayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer graphene. Importantly, it was observed that an applied displacement field switches the superconductivity with a ferroelectric hysteresis. Such direct coupling between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity offers promising pathways for developing low-power, non-volatile memory devices. However, the coupling mechanism between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that in a superconducting bilayer, the hysteretic switching of superconductivity can arise from an interlayer pairing. By deriving the Landau Ginzburg free energy expansion for the interlayer pairing, we show that along the ferroelectric hysteresis loop, the hysteretic exceeding of the critical polarization $P_{\textrm{c}}$ that destroys the interlayer pairing leads to the hysteretic switching of superconductivity. The condition to have a ferroelectric hysteretic superconducting state is established to be $P_{\textrm{r}}<P_{\textrm{c}}<P_{\textrm{s}}$, where $P_{\textrm{r}}$ and $P_{\textrm{s}}$ denote the remanent and saturated polarization, respectively. Crucially, our scenario of interlayer pairing yields two predictions: (1) an enhancement of the upper critical displacement field with stronger interlayer coupling and (2) a pronounced, gate-tunable interlayer crossed Andreev reflection, both of which provide clear pathways for experimental verification.

Title: More is different: How chemical complexity influences stability in high entropy oxides
Authors: Ksenia Khoroshun, Mario U. González-Rivas, Alannah M. Hallas
Abstract: Tailoring the chemical composition of a high entropy oxide (HEO) is a powerful approach to enhancing desirable material properties. However, the targeted synthesis of HEO materials is often hindered by competing stabilizing and destabilizing factors, which are difficult to predict. This work examines the effects of increased configurational entropy on the phase formation and stability of four notable complex oxide families: perovskite ($AB$O$_3$}), pyrochlore ($A_2B_2$O$_7$), Ruddlesden-Popper ($A_2B$O$_4$), and zirconium tungstate ($AB_2$O$_8$). Each of these structures has a tetravalent cation site, which we attempt to substitute with an entropic mixture of four cations, benchmarked by the parallel synthesis of a non-disordered reference compound. While all four target high entropy materials can be expected to form based on ionic radii criteria, only the high entropy perovskite Ba(Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O$_3$ is successfully synthesized. In the case of the pyrochlore, an entropy-stabilized defect fluorite is formed instead, while the Ruddlesden-Popper phase co-exists with multiple competing phases. For the tungstate, an unexpected deep eutectic point between the precursors results in melting that precedes the formation of a high entropy phase. Our case studies therefore illustrate that the stability of HEOs cannot be straightforwardly predicted based on ionic radii, lattice geometry, and charge-balancing considerations alone due to the underlying complexity of the interactions between the many chemical constituents.

Title: Electrical Conductivity of Copper-Graphene (Cu-Gr) Composites: The Underlying Mechanisms of Ultrahigh Conductivity
Authors: Jiali Yao, Uschuas Dipta Das, Hamid Safari, Md Ashiqur Rahman Laskar, Junghoon Yeom, Umberto Celano, Wonmo Kang
Abstract: Copper-graphene composite (CGC) conductors are widely considered as a potential alternative to pure copper (Cu). Yet, the effect of graphene (Gr) on the electrical conductivity of CGCs remains elusive, and their electrical performance is still controversial. This work addresses these unresolved questions by unambiguously quantifying how the electrical properties of CGCs depend on the characteristics of Gr and Cu. Gr is synthesized on Cu foils, foams, and wires by utilizing a wide range of chemical vapor deposition conditions to independently control their characteristics. Then the Gr-enhanced electrical conductivity ({\Delta}{\sigma}) is characterized for CGCs with different Cu geometries and Gr qualities. This study confirms that unprecedented electrical conductivity ({\Delta}{\sigma} = 17.1%) can be achieved only when both Gr and Cu are carefully optimized. Specifically, the study reveals three key factors: (1) {\Delta}{\sigma} is positively correlated with continuity of Gr; (2) CGCs with a continuous monolayer Gr exhibit a strong {\Delta}{\sigma}-A_s linear relation where A_s is the specific surface area of a CGC; and (3) {\Delta}{\sigma} becomes more pronounced when a Cu matrix has a curved cross-section. This work reveals the fundamental mechanisms of how Gr influences the overall electrical conductivity of CGCs and, therefore, is a crucial step toward designing and manufacturing high-performance CGC conductors for emerging applications.

Title: Local expression of fractional corner charges in obstructed atomic insulators and its application to vertex-transitive polyhedra with arbitrary genus
Authors: Hidetoshi Wada, Shuichi Murakami
Abstract: In obstructed atomic insulators, fractional charges appear at the corners of the crystals in the shapes of vertex-transitive polyhedra, and are given by the filling anomaly divided by the number of corners. Recent studies reveal that the filling anomaly for the cases with genus $0$ is universally given by the total charge at the Wyckoff position $1a$. In this study, we rewrite the formula in terms of the degree of sharpness of the corner, and show that the corner charge formula also holds for cases with arbitrary genus. We also extend our formula to vertex-transitive shell polyhedra, which are closed or open polyhedra without the bulk region, with all the vertices related by symmetry. Then, we show that the corner charges of such shell polyhedra are equal to the two-dimensional disclination charges of the corresponding disclinations. By identifying it with the disclination charge under the Wen-Zee action, we show that the coupling constant of the Wen-Zee action for a crystalline insulator is given by the total charge at the Wyckoff position at the disclination core.

Title: Collective adsorption of pheromones at the water-air interface

Abstract: Understanding the phase behaviour of pheromones and other messaging molecules remains a significant and largely unexplored challenge, even though it plays a central role in chemical communication. Here, we present all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the behavior of bombykol, a model insect pheromone, adsorbed at the water-air interface. This system serves as a proxy for studying the amphiphilic nature of pheromones and their interactions with aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Our simulations reveal the molecular organization of the bombykol monolayer and its adsorption isotherm. A soft-sticky particle equation of state accurately describes the monolayer's behavior. The analysis uncovers a two-dimensional liquid-gas phase transition within the monolayer. Collective adsorption stabilises the molecules at the interface and the calculated free energy gain is approximately $2\:k_\mathrm{B}T$. This value increases under lower estimates of the condensing surface concentration, thereby enhancing pheromone adsorption onto aerosols. Overall, our findings hold broad relevance for molecular interface science, atmospheric chemistry, and organismal chemical communication, particularly in highlighting the critical role of phase transition phenomena.

Title: In-plane anomalous features in the 3D quantum Hall regime
Authors: Ming Lu, Xiao-Xiao Zhang
Abstract: Studies of the 3D quantum Hall effect (QHE) have primarily emphasized transport features that mimic the well-established 2D QHE. In this work, we show that qualitatively new features arise when an in-plane magnetic field is applied to a 3D Weyl semimetal in the quantum Hall regime. An unexpected Hall quantum oscillation, distinct from the Weyl-orbit oscillation, coexists with the QHE, along with an unquantized two-terminal magnetoresistance. Moreover, unconventional antichiral transmission enables a peculiar disorder-robust negative longitudinal resistance. Quantization tunable by the lead configuration is further found in this transport geometry. A unique type of nonlocal quantum backscattering channels underlies these phenomena. Our work demonstrates a breakdown of the topological characterization of transport even with 3D Chern numbers and reveals hidden 3D QHE transport properties. It opens a new class of transport measurements and phenomena.

Title: Evidence of a two-dimensional nitrogen crystalline structure on silver surfaces
Authors: Xuegao Hu, Haijun Cao, Zhicheng Gao, Hui Zhou, Daiyu Geng, Dong Li, Jisong Gao, Qiaoxiao Zhao, Zhihao Cai, Peng Cheng, Lan Chen, Sheng Meng, Kehui Wu, Baojie Feng
Abstract: Nitrogen, the most abundant element in Earth's atmosphere, exists as a diatomic gas under standard temperature and pressure. In the two-dimensional (2D) limit, atomically thin nitrogen, termed nitrogene, has been theoretically predicted to form crystalline materials with various polymorphic configurations, exhibiting diverse chemical and physical properties. However, the synthesis of nitrogene has remained elusive due to the strong nitrogen-nitrogen triple bonds. Here, we report experimental evidence of the formation of nitrogen-based crystalline structures compatible with nitrogene on silver surfaces via ion-beam-assisted epitaxy. Through a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the nitrogene-like structure adopts a puckered honeycomb lattice. Notably, our calculations predict a nitrogene band gap of up to 7.5 eV, positioning it as a promising candidate for ultraviolet optoelectronic devices and high-k dielectric applications.

Title: A Kinetic Criterion for Stokes-Einstein Relation Breakdown Based on Effective Collisional Geometry
Authors: Zhen-Wei Wu
Abstract: Here we propose a kinetic framework for interpreting the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation breakdown in supercooled liquids by introducing an effective collision diameter, $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$, derived from transport data. Numerical simulation of a model CuZr alloy reveal that $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ increases upon cooling but saturates near the first peak of the radial distribution function just before SE breakdown. This saturation defines a geometric upper bound for the collisional cross-section beyond which further slowdown is governed by cooperative, heterogeneous motion rather than local collisional transport. Our analysis yields a compact criterion for SE breakdown in a mean-field perspective and provides physically interpretable inputs for future data-driven models of glassy dynamics.

Title: Preparation and magnetic properties of (Ln0.2La0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2 Eu0.2)MnO3 (Ln = Dy, Ho, Er) high-entropy perovskite ceramics containing heavy rare earth elements
Authors: Jiedong Qin, Xingmin Feng, Zhiqin Wen, Li Tang, Defeng Long, Yuhong Zhao
Abstract: Equimolar ratio high-entropy perovskite ceramics (HEPCs) have attracted much attention due to their excellent magnetization intensity. To further enhance their magnetization intensities, (Ln0.2La0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Eu0.2)MnO3 (Ln = Dy, Ho and Er, labeled as Ln-LNSEMO) HEPCs are designed based on the configuration entropy Sconfig, tolerance factor t, and mismatch degree. Single-phase HEPCs are synthesized by the solid-phase method in this work, in which the effects of the heavy rare-earth elements Dy, Ho and Er on the structure and magnetic properties of Ln-LNSEMO are systematically studied. The results show that all Ln-LNSEMO HEPCs exhibit high crystallinity and maintain excellent structural stability after sintering at 1250 degree centigrade for 16 h. Ln-LNSEMO HEPCs exhibit significant lattice distortion effects, with smooth surface morphology, clearly distinguishable grain boundaries, and irregular polygonal shapes. The three high-entropy ceramic samples exhibit hysteresis behavior at T = 5 K, with the Curie temperature TC decreasing as the radius of the introduced rare-earth ions decreases, while the saturation magnetization and coercivity increase accordingly. When the average ionic radius of A-site decreases, the interaction between their valence electrons and local electrons in the crystal increases, thereby enhancing the conversion of electrons to oriented magnetic moments under an external magnetic field. Thus, Er-LNSEMO HEPC shows a higher saturation magnetization strength (42.8 emu/g) and coercivity (2.09 kOe) than the other samples, which is attributed to the strong magnetic crystal anisotropy, larger lattice distortion (0.00652), smaller average grain size (440.49 plus or minus 22.02 nm), unit cell volume (229.432 A3) and A-site average ion radius (1.24 A) of its magnet. The Er-LNSEMO HEPC has potential applications in magnetic recording materials.

Title: Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors: a review
Authors: Yuri D. Glinka
Abstract: Despite the decades that have passed since the discovery of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and its apparent simplicity, this method is still often subject to experimental errors and misinterpretations when applied to 2D semiconductors. The reason for this lies not only in the unique nature of these extremely thin samples, but also in the different experimental configurations and data processing methods used. Moreover, since this type of spectroscopy was originally used to characterize the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carriers in chemical compounds, colloidal nanostructures and gas molecules, a purely 'molecular' approach to interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors is often proposed. However, this approach is fundamentally inapplicable to thin-film semiconductors grown or mechanically exfoliated on transparent substrates. This review considers the recent experimental results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors in a wide spectral range from several THz to UV (~1000 THz) based on the 'solid-state' approach to their interpretation. We also highlight typical errors that arise in measuring, processing and interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors.

Title: From informal markets to Limit Order Book dynamics: a mean field connection
Authors: Alvaro Navarro-Rubio, Alejandro Lage-Castellanos
Abstract: We propose a unified mean-field framework that bridges the dynamics of informal financial markets and formal markets governed by Limit Order Books (LOBs). Both settings are modeled as interacting particle systems on a 1D price lattice, with temporal evolution described by master equations that account for new entries, cancellations, and executions. The key insight is the introduction of a preferential interaction parameter $\Psi$, which modulates the likelihood of transactions based on price compatibility: when $\Psi=0$, interactions are random and uncoordinated, reproducing the structure of informal markets; as $\Psi\to \infty$, only optimal (most mutually attractive) trades occur, recovering LOB-like dynamics. A grand-canonical interpretation is used to identify effective thermodynamic quantities -such as interaction energy and price-dependent chemical potentials -that underlie both systems. Most results are validated through numerical integration and simulations, although an analytical solution is shown to exist at least for the symmetric stationary case of the informal market.

Title: General spin models from noncollinear spin density functional theory and spin-cluster expansion
Authors: Tomonori Tanaka, Yoshihiro Gohda
Abstract: We present a data-efficient framework for constructing general classical spin Hamiltonians from the spin-cluster expansion (SCE) combined with fully self-consistent noncollinear spin density functional theory (DFT). The key idea is to fit an SCE model to magnetic torques rather than to total energies. Because torques are site-resolved vectors, each configuration supplies many independent constraints, which makes the regression well conditioned and sharply reduces the number of DFT calculations needed, especially in large supercells. Applied to the B20-type chiral magnets ${\rm Mn}_{1-x}{\rm Fe}_{x}{\rm Ge}$ and ${\rm Fe}_{1-y}{\rm Co}_{y}{\rm Ge}$, the resulting models nonperturbatively extract the full pairwise exchange tensor (isotropic exchange, anisotropic symmetric exchange, and the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction) and predict helical spin period via a micromagnetic mapping. The composition trends and the divergence of the period near the chirality sign change are reproduced in line with experiments. Because the SCE framework is systematic, it also enables systematic analysis of interaction order; training on increasingly disordered spin configurations shows that the lowest-order model loses torque accuracy, whereas including higher-order interactions restores predictive power. These advances enable near-DFT-accurate spin models for finite-temperature magnetism and complex textures at modest data cost, while providing a systematic, extensible, and nonperturbative route to quantitative first-principles parameterization and predictive materials design. An open-source implementation is available as the Julia package, \textit{this http URL}.

Title: Magnetocaloric effect measurements in ultrahigh magnetic fields up to 120 T
Authors: Reon Ogawa, Masaki Gen, Kazuyuki Matsuhira, Yoshimitsu Kohama
Abstract: We report proof-of-concept measurements of the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in ultrahigh magnetic fields up to 120 T for the classical spin-ice compound Ho$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Radio-frequency resistivity measurements using an Au$_{16}$Ge$_{84}$ thin-film thermometer enable us to detect a rapid change in the sample temperature associated with a crystal-field level crossing in the high-field region in addition to a giant MCE at low fields. We discuss a possible delay in the temperature response and outline prospects for more precise MCE measurements in destructive pulsed fields.

Title: A hybrid Green-Kubo (hGK) framework for calculating viscosity from short MD simulations
Authors: Akash K. Meel, Santosh Mogurampelly
Abstract: Viscosity calculation from equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations relies on the traditional Green-Kubo (GK) framework, which integrates the stress autocorrelation function (SACF) over time. While the formalism is exact in the linear response regime, the traditional approach often suffers from poor convergence and requires extensive phase space sampling, which is computationally demanding for soft matter and polymer systems. In this Letter, we introduce a hybrid Green-Kubo (hGK) framework that alleviates these limitations by partitioning the SACF into two physically meaningful regimes: (i) a short time ballistic component extracted directly from short MD simulations, and (ii) a long time relaxation tail represented using analytically motivated functions, $\phi(\tau)$, fitted only to short trajectories. This strategy bypasses the need for extensive sampling while preserving physical rigor. Benchmarking against SPC/E water confirms excellent agreement with established results, and we further demonstrate the efficacy of the method for challenging electrolyte systems (EC-LiTFSI and PEO-LiTFSI), for which the GK framework fails to converge. The computational savings are substantial, with reductions of several orders of magnitude in required sampling, achieved without compromising predictive accuracy. We also discuss the limitations of the hGK framework and outline clear avenues for refinement, including optimal tail selection and robust identification of relaxation regimes in noisy stress data. The hGK framework presented in this Letter provides a conceptually simple, broadly applicable, and computationally efficient route for viscosity prediction in molecular liquids, polymer melts, and ionically conducting soft materials.

Title: Coulomb drag driven electron-hole bifluidity in doped graphene
Authors: Dwaipayan Paul, Nakib H. Protik
Abstract: Motivated by the notion that a preponderance of Coulomb interactions might lead to hydrodynamics, we carry out an ab initio calculation of the charge carrier transport properties of the electron-hole plasma of doped graphene. We include both the phonon and Coulomb interactions within a momentum and band resolved Boltzmann transport formalism. We find that, under suitable conditions, the strong Coulomb drag effect induces effects like negative conductivity and joint electron-hole hydrodynamics (bifluidity) in the plasma. We also identify the exclusive electron or hole hydrodynamics. We find that there is a strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the low doped regimes. Our work elucidates the roles of the microscopic scattering mechanisms that drive these hydrodynamic phenomena.

Title: Phase transitions on the dark side of the Gross-Neveu model
Authors: Gabriel Osiander Rein, Fakher F. Assaad, Igor F. Herbut
Abstract: Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions exhibits a continuous transition from gapless Dirac semimetal to the gapped quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at a finite (attractive) coupling, at which the inversion and time-reversal symmetry become spontaneously broken, and the flavor O($M$) symmetry remains preserved. A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed.

Title: Hole to Electron Crossover in a (Cd,Mn)Te Quantum Well through Surface Metallization
Authors: Amadeusz Dydniański, Mateusz Raczyński, Aleksandra Łopion, Tomasz Kazimierczuk, Jacek Kasprzak, Karolina Ewa Połczyńska, Wojciech Pacuski, Piotr Kossacki
Abstract: In this work we look into how the contact material influences the local charge properties of a p-type CdTe-based quantum well. We study five metals deposited as 10 nm layers on the sample surface: Au, Ag, Cr, Ni and Ti. We use magneto-spectroscopy to discriminate their charge states through monitoring the Zeeman shifts at singlet-triplet transitions. Most tested metals retain the original p-type of the QW, while gold and nickel coverage flips the local doping to n-type. This is attributed to a robust bonding of these two metals to the semiconductor, efficiently passivating its surface and thus improving electron diffusion from the metal to the quantum well.

Title: Persson's Theory of Purely Normal Elastic Rough Surface Contact: A Tutorial Based on Stochastic Process Theory
Authors: Yang Xu, Xiaobao Li, Qi Chen, Yunong Zhou
Abstract: Persson's theory of purely normal rough surface contact was developed two decades ago during the study of tire-road interaction, and gradually became one of the dominant approaches to study the solid-solid interaction between rough surfaces. Contrary to its popular applications in various cross-disciplinary fields, the fundamental study of Persson's theory of contact attracted little attention from the tribology and contact mechanics communities. As far as the authors know, many researchers struggle to understand the derivation of the theory. Few attempts have been made to clarify the oversimplified derivation provided by Persson (Persson, 2001). The present work provides a detailed tutorial on Persson's theory, which does not simply follow the commonly adopted derivation initiated by Persson. A new derivation is given based on stochastic process theory, assuming that the variation of the random contact pressure with respect to scale is a Markov process. We revisit the essential assumptions utilized to derive the diffusion equation, boundary conditions, drift and diffusion coefficients, and closed-form results. This tutorial can serve as a self-consistent introduction for solid mechanicians, tribologists, and postgraduate students who are not familiar with Persson's theory, or who struggle to understand it.

Title: Collective cluster nucleation dynamics in 2D Ising quantum magnets
Authors: Philip Osterholz, Fabio Bensch, Shuanghong Tang, Silpa Baburaj Sheela, Igor Lesanovsky, Christian Groß
Abstract: Strongly interacting many-body systems often show collective properties that are non-trivially related to the microscopic degrees of freedom. Collectivity is responsible for intriguing ground state properties, for example, in superconductors. However, collective effects may also govern the non-equilibrium response of quantum systems, not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum field theories modeling the properties of our universe. Understanding emergent collective dynamics from first principles, in particular in non-perturbative regimes, is therefore one of the central challenges in quantum many-body physics. Here we report on the observation of collective cluster nucleation in 2D quantum Ising systems realized in an atomic Rydberg array. We observe a confined regime in which the steady-state cluster size is energy-dependent and a deconfined regime characterized by kinetically constrained dynamics of cluster nucleation. Our results mark a qualitative leap for quantum simulations with Rydberg arrays and shed light on highly collective non-equilibrium processes in one of the most important textbook models of condensed matter physics with relevance from quantum magnets and the kinetics of glass formers to cosmology.

Title: Crossover from Universal Depinning to Free Domain-Wall Dynamics in Ultrathin Iron Garnet Films
Authors: V. Jeudy, D. Gouéré, N. Beaulieu, S. Husain, R. Dıaz Pardo, A. Thiaville, J. Sampaio, J-M George, A. Anane, J. Ben Youssef
Abstract: Magnetic domain walls display universal, disorder-controlled elastic dynamics at low drive, and texture-governed free motion at high drive. Here, we establish the crossover mechanism between these two regimes. Using experiments in ultrathin epitaxial iron garnet films and Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations, including disorder, thermal, and internal texture effects, we uncover a disorder- and temperature-dependent precessional flow that bridges pinned and free dynamics. We further demonstrate that the exceptionally low pinning in garnets arises from the weak coupling between domain walls and disorder, together with a correlation length that exceeds the wall width.

Title: Fast and efficient formation of stable tetraatomic molecules from ultracold atoms via generalized stimulated Raman exact passage
Authors: Jia-Hui Zhang, Wen-Yuan Wang, Fu-Quan Dou
Abstract: The study of the conversion of ultracold atoms into molecules has long remained a hot topic in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. However, most prior research has focused on diatomic molecules, with relatively scarce exploration of polyatomic molecules. Here we propose a two-step strategy for the formation of stable ultracold tetraatomic molecules. We first suggest a generalized nonlinear stimulated Raman exact passage (STIREP) technique for the coherent conversion of ultracold atoms to tetraatomic molecules, which is subsequently followed by a chainwise-STIREP technique to transfer the resulting molecules into a sufficiently stable ground state. Through systematic numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed two-step strategy holds great potential for enabling the robust, fast, and efficient formation of stable ultracold tetraatomic molecules.

Title: Diffusive geodesics wandering in networks of rigid chains
Authors: Ulysse Marquis
Abstract: We introduce an ensemble of spatial networks built from the junctions of hindered-rotation chains, incorporating directional correlations between bonds, an aspect ignored in the standard network modeling paradigm. The emergent random networks support geodesics with a wandering exponent $\xi = 1/2$, and a travel-time fluctuation exponent $\chi = 0$, consistent with the KPZ relation, yet violating the bound~$\chi\geq1/8$ predicted in the Poissonian framework. Transverse deviations follow the Kolmogorov distribution, indicating similarities between Brownian bridge excursions and geodesics in a random medium with correlated edges orientations. These results reveal a new universality class of Euclidean first-passage percolation, where local orientational memory reshapes transport properties and challenges existing bounds for random spatial networks.

Title: Boosting the Memory Window of Memristive Stacks via Engineered Interfaces with High Ionic Mobility
Authors: José Diogo Costa, Daniel Veira-Canle, Noa Varela-Domínguez, Nicholas Davey, Victor Leborán, Rafael Ramos, Fèlix Casanova, Luis E. Hueso, Victor M. Brea, P. López, Francisco Rivadulla
Abstract: The great potential of memristive devices for real-world applications still relies on overcoming key technical challenges, including the need for a larger number of stable resistance states, faster switching speeds, lower SET/RESET voltages, improved endurance, and reduced variability. One material optimization strategy that has still been quite overlooked is interface engineering, specifically, tailoring the electrode/dielectric interface to modulate oxygen exchange. Here, we demonstrate that introducing materials with high ionic mobility can significantly expand the accessible oxygen concentration range within the dielectric layer, significantly broadening the memory window. Using SrTiO3-based memristive stacks, we integrated an ion-conducting SrCoO3 interfacial layer to facilitate oxygen transfer, increasing the number of distinguishable resistance states from 8 to 22. This modification also reduced the SET/RESET voltage by 50% and markedly improved device endurance, albeit with a trade-off of reduced state retention. To assess the practical implications of this trade-off, we trained a two-layer fully connected neural network using the experimental SrTiO3/SrCoO3 memristor characteristics on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Networks with hidden-layer sizes between 64 and 256 memristive elements achieved classification errors below 7%. The observed temporal drift means the functional state must be updated at intervals of less than 1 h to maintain reliable operation. Finally, we confirmed the transferability of this interface-engineering approach by applying it to HfOx-based devices, achieving a similarly enhanced memory window.

Title: Superconductivity onset above 60 K in ambient-pressure nickelate films
Authors: Guangdi Zhou, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yaqi Chen, Fei Peng, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Wei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
Abstract: Ambient-pressure superconductivity in nickelates has been capped at an onset transition temperature (Tc) of ~40 K, a value that remains lower than the cuprate (~133 K) and iron-based (~55 K) counterparts, despite the promise shown under high pressure. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset at ~63 K in epitaxial (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films grown under compressive strain on SrLaAlO4 substrates. This Tc leap is enabled by pushing our gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GAE) method into an extreme non-equilibrium growth regime. It leverages powerful in situ oxidation to simultaneously enhance kinetics via higher temperatures and achieve full oxygenation without post-annealing. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm that this approach yields films of large-scale crystalline purity, overcoming the inherent metastability of the strained superconducting phase. These films exhibit a systematic evolution in their normal-state resistivity-temperature curve: the power-law exponent $\alpha$ evolves from Fermi-liquid-like ($\alpha$ ~2) at lower Tc to strange-metal-like ($\alpha$ ~1) in higher Tc samples, directly linking the enhanced superconductivity to non-Fermi liquid behavior. Mapping the vortex melting phase diagram by the mutual inductance technique further reveals 2D melting limit suppressed to near zero, which demonstrates significantly stronger interlayer coupling than that of cuprates. These results identify the nickelates as an anisotropic-3D high-Tc system exhibiting strange-metal behavior, presenting an alternative framework to the quasi-2D cuprate paradigm.

Title: Demonstration of surface-engineered oxidation-resistant Nb-Nb thermocompression bonding toward scalable superconducting quantum computing architectures
Authors: Harsh Mishra, Yusuke Kozuka, Sathish Bonam, Jun Uzuhashi, Praveenkumar Suggisetti, Tadakatsu Ohkubo, Shiv Govind Singh
Abstract: Scalable quantum computing currently requires a large array of qubit integration, but present two-dimensional interconnects face challenges such as wiring congestion, electromagnetic interference, and limited cryogenic space. To overcome this challenge, implementing three-dimensional (3D) vertical architectures becomes crucial. Niobium (Nb), due to its excellent superconducting characteristics and strong fabrication process compatibility, stands out as a prime material choice. The main challenge in Nb-Nb bonding is the presence of an oxide layer at the interface, even after post-bonding annealing across various bonding methods. The native Nb oxide forms rapidly in air, creating a resistive barrier to supercurrent flow and introducing two-level system losses that degrade qubit coherence while increasing the overall thermal budget. These issues show the need for effective surface engineering to suppress oxidation during bonding. This study introduces an ultrathin gold (Au) capping layer as a passivation strategy to prevent oxygen incorporation at the Nb surface. This approach enables low-temperature Nb-Nb thermocompression bonding at 350 °C under a reduced bonding pressure of 0.495 MPa. Detailed microstructural and interfacial analyses confirm that Au passivation effectively suppresses oxide formation and hence enhances bonding uniformity and strength with keeping the superconductivity, establishing a robust route toward low-temperature, low-pressure Nb-Nb bonding for scalable 3D superconducting quantum computing architectures.

Title: Accelerating discovery of infrared nonlinear optical materials with large shift current via high-throughput screening
Authors: Aiqin Yang, Dian Jin, Mingkang Liu, Daye Zheng, Qi Wang, Qiangqiang Gu, Jian-Hua Jiang
Abstract: Discovering nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with strong shift current response, particularly in the infrared (IR) regime, is essential for next-generation optoelectronics yet remains highly challenging in both experiments and theory, which still largely relies on case by case studies. Here, we employ a high-throughput screening strategy, applying a multi-step filter to the Materials Project database (>154,000 materials), which yielded 2,519 candidate materials for detailed first-principle evaluation. From these calculations, we identify 32 NLO materials with strong shift current response ($\sigma$ > 100 $\mu A/V^2$). Our work reveals that layered structures with $C_{3v}$ symmetry and heavy $p$-block elements (e.g. Te, Sb) exhibit apparent superiority in enhancing shift current. More importantly, 9 of these compounds show shift current response peaks in the IR region, with the strongest reaching 616 $\mu A/V^2$, holding significant application potential in fields such as IR photodetection, sensing, and energy harvesting. Beyond identifying promising candidates, this work establishes a comprehensive and high-quality first-principles dataset for NLO response, providing a solid foundation for future AI-driven screening and accelerated discovery of high-performance NLO materials, as demonstrated by a prototype machine-learning application.

Title: Heat transport in superionic materials via machine-learned molecular dynamics
Authors: Wenjiang Zhou, Benrui Tang, Zheyong Fan, Federico Grasselli, Stefano Baroni, Bai Song
Abstract: Precise modeling and understanding of heat transport in the superionic phase are of great interest. Although simulations combining Green-Kubo (GK) molecular dynamics with machine-learned potentials (MLPs) stand as a promising approach, substantial challenges remain due to the crucial impact of atomic diffusion. Here, we first show that the thermal conductivity (${\kappa}$) of superionic materials calculated via conventional GK integral of the energy flux varies notably with the MLP model. Subsequently, we highlight that reliable, model-independent $\kappa$ values can be obtained by applying Onsager's reciprocal relations to correctly capture the coupled heat and mass transport. Remarkably, an anomalously invariant $\kappa$ is observed over a wide temperature range, distinct from the characteristic trends in traditional crystals and glasses. Finally, we illustrate that conventional $\kappa$ decompositions into kinetic, potential, and cross terms suffer from ambiguities in the physical interpretation, despite their mathematical rigor.

Title: Why life is hot
Authors: Tanja Schilling, Patrick Warren, Wilson Poon
Abstract: The process of evolution by natural selection leads to fitness-maximising phenotypes. On the level of cellular chemical reaction networks, maximising fitness can mean optimising a variety of fitness functions such as robustness, precision, or sensitivity to external stimuli. Using theory and numerics, we show that these diverse goals can be achieved by a versatile, generic mechanism: coupling chemical reaction networks to reservoirs that are strongly out of equilibrium. Moreover, we demonstrate that the degree of optimality achievable by this mechanism saturates, and that nature appears to operate near saturation. We find that the amount of heat generated by this mechanism constitutes a significant fraction of the total heat produced by living organisms, so that 'life is hot' largely because of the need for a versatile mechanism to optimise a variety of fitness functions.

Title: Exact and mean-field analysis of the role of Hubbard interactions on flux driven circular current in a quantum ring
Authors: Rahul Samanta, Santanu K. Maiti, Shreekantha Sil
Abstract: We investigate circular current in both ordered and disordered Hubbard quantum rings threaded by magnetic flux, employing exact diagonalization and the Hartree-Fock mean-field approach within the tight-binding framework. The influence of on-site and extended Hubbard interactions, disorder, and electron filling on the persistent current is systematically analyzed. To construct the full many-body Hamiltonian, we introduce a linear table formalism, which, to our knowledge, has been rarely used in this context. In ordered rings, the current decreases monotonically with increasing on-site repulsion, while the impact of the extended interaction depends strongly on the filling factor. At low filling, stronger extended interaction suppresses the current, whereas near half-filling, it enhances the current up to a critical ratio, half of the on-site strength, before reducing it. Disorder significantly modifies these behaviors, notably enhancing the current at less than quarter-filling with increasing extended interaction. The localization properties of eigenstates, examined via the inverse participation ratio, further support the crucial roles of filling and the interplay between on-site and extended interactions in governing persistent current.

Title: Smeared phase transition in the dissipative random quantum Ashkin-Teller model
Authors: Pedro S. Farinas, Rajesh Narayanan, José A. Hoyos
Abstract: We study the effects of dissipation in the phase diagram of the random quantum Ashkin-Teller model by means of a generalization of the strong-disorder renormalization group combined with adiabatic renormalization. This model has three phases and three quantum phase transitions. We demonstrate that the combined effect of Ohmic dissipation and quenched disorder smears two out of the three quantum phase transitions. Our analytical theory allows us to understand why one of the phase transitions remains sharp. This is due to a cancellation of the dissipation effects on the nontrivial nature of the intertwined order parameter of one of the phases.

Title: Evolution of Correlated Electrons in ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ at Ambient Pressure: a Study of Double-Counting Effect
Authors: Zhong-Yi Xie, Zhihui Luo, Wéi Wú, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: We employ cluster extension of dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) to systematically investigate the impact of double counting corrections on the correlated electronic structure of ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ under ambient pressure. By adjusting double-counting parameters, while maintaining a fixed Fermi surface, we observe a pronounced orbital-selective density of states change: the $d_{z^2}$ orbital undergoes significant variation near the Fermi level with increasing $E_{dc}^z$, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital remains essentially unchanged throughout the entire range. Analysis of renormalization factor show the monotonic dependence with double counting in both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, and it also identifies an optimal double counting window in $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with experimental values. We also find the interlayer Matsubara self energy exhibits non-monotonic dependence on $E_{dc}^z$, deviating from theoretical predictions. This anomaly is attributed to the metallization of oxygen-bridged pathways, which disrupts the prerequisite for charge transfer via apical oxygen. Our results establish $E_{dc}$ as a critical control parameter for correlated electronic structure in ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and provide a computational framework for resolving orbital-dependent correlation effects in layered materials.

Title: Bulk photovoltaic effect in MoSe$_2$ and Janus MoSSe sliding ferroelectrics
Authors: Roumita Roy, Giuseppe Cuono, Silvia Picozzi
Abstract: We present a first-principles study of the nonlinear optical properties of sliding ferroelectric bilayers based on MoSe$_2$ and Janus MoSSe. Two Janus configurations are considered: i) one bilayer where the two intralayer polarizations caused by Janus chemical asymmetry cancel each other out, yielding photocurrent spectra comparable to pristine MoSe$_2$ bilayers; ii) another bilayer where the intralayer polarizations add up, for which the photoresponses are strongly enhanced. Our results show that photocurrent generation in the polar Janus structures is predominantly governed by vertical chemical asymmetry, with limited dependence on the sliding direction. These findings highlight complementary design strategies: interlayer sliding enables sensitivity to external tuning, while the Janus intralayer polarization enhances photoresponses in the visible range. The interplay between composition and stacking therefore provides a versatile platform for tailoring light-matter interactions in 2D ferroelectric materials.

Title: Anomalous impurity-induced charge modulations in black phosphorus
Authors: Byeongin Lee, Junho Bang, Sayan Banerjee, Jõao Augusto Sobral, Young Woo Choi, Claudia Felser, Mathias S. Scheurer, Jian-Feng Ge, Doohee Cho
Abstract: We observe anomalous charge modulations induced by ionized indium impurities on the surface of the semiconductor black phosphorus by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). When the im- purities are switched into a negatively charged state by the STM tip, periodic charge modulations emerge around the impurity center, but strictly confined by the nanoscale impurity potential. These modulations form a distorted triangular pattern, whose periodicity remains unchanged in a wide range of positive bias. Furthermore, these local charge orders exhibit an anisotropy opposite to that expected based on the anisotropy of the Fermi surface, challenging a simple band-structure inter- pretation. Our experiment demonstrates the possibility of creating and manipulating macroscopic charge orders through impurity engineering.

Title: Edge spin galvanic effect in altermagnets
Authors: L. E. Golub
Abstract: The edge spin galvanic effect (ESGE) in $d$-wave altermagnets is proposed. ESGE is a creation of an electrical current flowing along the edge of the sample, which is driven by the spin orientation of charge carriers. The ESGE current is formed owing to the altermagnetic spin splitting and the scattering of carriers by the edge of the sample. The current is sensitive to the orientation of the edge in respect to the main axes of the altermagnet. The edge spin galvanic current reverses its direction upon a reversal of the non-equilibrium spin direction or the Néel vector. We also propose the pure spin edge photocurrent excited by polarized radiation and formed at the edges of a sample. Its dependence on the radiation polarization and frequency is analyzed. The application of an external magnetic field converts this pure spin photocurrent into an electric current along the edge.

Title: On Sak's criterion for statistical models with long-range interaction
Authors: Tianning Xiao, Ziyu Liu, Zhijie Fan, Youjin Deng
Abstract: Determining the threshold value $\sigma_*$ that separates the short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) universality classes in phase transitions remains a controversial issue. While Sak's criterion, $\sigma_* = 2 - \eta_{\mathrm{SR}}$, has been widely accepted, recent studies of two-dimensional (2D) models with long-range interactions have challenged it. In this work, we focus on the crossover between LR and SR criticality in several classical 2D statistical models, including the XY, Heisenberg, percolation, and Ising models, whose interactions decay as $1/r^{2+\sigma}$. Our previous simulations for the XY, Heisenberg, and percolation models consistently indicate a universal boundary at $\sigma_* = 2$. Here, we complete the picture by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D LR-Ising model, reaching lattice sizes up to $L = 8192$. By analyzing the Fortuin-Kasteleyn critical polynomial $R_p$, the Binder ratio $Q_m$, and the anomalous dimension $\eta$, we obtain convergent and self-consistent evidence that the universality class already changes sharply at $\sigma = 2$. Taken together, these results establish a unified scenario for LR interacting systems: across all studied models, the crossover from LR to SR universality occurs at $\sigma_* = 2$.

Title: Interplay between Superconductivity and Altermagnetism in Disordered Materials and Heterostructures
Authors: Rodrigo de las Heras, Tim Kokkeler, Stefan Ilić, Ilya V. Tokatly, F. Sebastian Bergeret
Abstract: We study the interplay between superconductivity and altermagnetism in disordered systems using recently derived quantum kinetic transport equations. Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$\pi$ transitions.

Title: Interfacial Synergy in Ag-Doped CuO-AgCl-g-C3N4 Composites for Efficient Charge Separation and Low-power Methylene Blue Degradation
Authors: Suresh Chandra Baral, Uttama Kumar Saint, Dilip Sasmal, Sradhanjali Lenka, Ashish Kalkal, A. Mekki, Sudhagar Pitchaimuthu, Somaditya Sen
Abstract: An Ag-doped CuO-AgCl-g-C3N4 heterostructure has been designed to achieve rapid Methylene Blue (MB) degradation through a synergistic photo-Fenton mechanism driven by low-power UV illumination. The composite integrates narrow-bandgap CuO, plasmonic Ag/AgCl, and visible-responsive g-C3N4 into a dual Z-scheme configuration that promotes efficient interfacial charge transfer while preserving strong redox potentials. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra ascertained the bandgap positions of the composite corresponding to those of its constituents: 2.9 eV (g-C3N4) and 1.42 eV (Ag-doped CuO-AgCl), indicating enhanced absorption and efficient charge carrier generation. BET analysis confirmed the presence of mesoporosity and revealed an effective surface area, ensuring the availability of abundant adsorption and reaction sites. A commercial 11 W UV irradiation was used for the photocatalytic test. Almost complete degradation of MB occurred within 10 min, following pseudo-first-order kinetics with a high apparent rate constant of 0.45/min. The remarkable activity arises from the synergistic interplay of Fenton-like redox cycling and efficient photoinduced charge carrier generation and separation. In addition, it has been demonstrated that intentionally incorporated AgCl plays an active role as a plasmonic-semiconducting interface, strengthening charge separation and catalyst stability under neutral conditions, rather than acting as a passive chloride byproduct. Overall, by linking defect engineering, heterojunction design, and photo-Fenton synergy, this study establishes a low-power, catalytic platform offering a viable pathway towards sustainable dye wastewater remediation.

Title: Interband and kinetic corrections to the electronic Boltzmann transport equation
Authors: Elena Trukhan, Nakib H. Protik
Abstract: Interband effects such as coherence/tunneling have recently been shown to give an important contribution to the charge and heat transport properties under certain conditions. These can be captured by adding corrective terms to the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation. In recent derivations of this type of transport equations that are based on the density matrix formalism, there remain, however, certain omissions. These derivations also rely on a particular type of relaxation time approximation and a band-diagonal form of the interaction self-energies. In this work we derive the interband terms of the electronic Boltzmann transport equation starting from the Keldysh formulation of the quantum kinetic equation and considering the band non-diagonality of the electron-impurity and electron-phonon self-energies. We introduce a minimally modified Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz, and find a quantum-corrected, matrix Boltzmann transport equation that is well beyond the current state of the art theory. We show that the occupations and coherences are interdependent, and that the kinetic corrections due to the included interactions cannot, in general, be ignored. This work clarifies the various approximations that must be introduced in an ab initio derivation of Boltzmann-like equations and finds a new matrix Boltzmann transport equation that is suitable for parameters-free numerical implementations.

Title: Degrees of universality in wave turbulence
Authors: Jiasheng Liu, Vladimir Rosenhaus, Gregory Falkovich
Abstract: Turbulence of weakly interacting waves displays a great deal of universality: independence of the details of the interaction and of the pumping and dissipation scales. Here we study how inverse turbulent cascades (from small to large scales) transition from weak to strong. We find that while one-loop corrections can be dependent on excitation and dissipation scales, new types of universality appear in strong turbulence. We contrast turbulence of spin waves in ferromagnets with turbulent cascades in the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NSE) and in an MMT-like model in higher dimensions having a multiplicative interaction vertex: vertex renormalization gives rise to dependence on the pumping (UV scale) in the former but not in the latter. As a result of this spectral nonlocality, spin-wave turbulence stops being weak if one is sufficiently far from the pumping scale, even when the interaction of waves with comparable wavenumbers is weak. We paraphrase this as: nonlocality enhances nonlinearity. We then describe strong turbulence in a multi-component version of these models with a large number of components. We argue that strong spin-wave turbulence is similar to turbulence of the focusing NSE, as it realizes a critical-balance state. However, UV nonlocality causes the level of spin-wave turbulence at large scales to decrease with increasing pumping level, culminating in a state that is independent of the level of pumping.

Title: Balancing information and dissipation with partially observed fluctuating signals
Authors: Giorgio Nicoletti, Ivan Di Terlizzi, Daniel Maria Busiello
Abstract: Biological systems sense and extract information from fluctuating signals while operating under energetic constraints and limited resolution. We introduce a general chemical model in which a sensor, coupled to a signaling pathway activated by hidden signals, can allosterically tune the production of a readout molecule. We propose viable strategies for the sensor to estimate, and eventually balance, information gathering on the hidden process and the associated dissipative cost relying solely on counting statistics of observed trajectories. We show that these strategies can be successfully implemented to adapt the readout production even with finite-time measurements and limited dynamic resolution, and remain effective in the presence of inhibitory regulatory mechanisms. Our study provides a plausible mechanism to actively balance information and dissipation, paving the way for an implementable design principle underpinning biological and biochemical adaptation.

Title: Isostructural phase transition and equation of state of type-I and type-VIII metallic sodium borosilicide clathrates

Abstract: Electronic properties of silicon-based clathrates can be tuned by boron incorporation into the silicon cage network. Sodium borosilicides clathrate outstands with uncommon stoichiometry and expected metallic properties, in contrast to other alcali metal semiconductive Zintl borosilicides. In this study, we report an experimental investigation of the high-pressure behavior of type-I and type-VIII sodium borosilicide clathrates. An isostructural phase transition, marked by an abrupt volume collapse at 13 GPa, is observed exclusively in type-I sodium borosilicide clathrates. This transition is attributed to the pressure-induced diffusion of silicon atoms into cationic sites. This mechanism provides the first experimental validation of a transition predicted theoretically for this class of materials. Isostructural phase transitions were only observed in type-I borosilicide. In contrast, the type-VIII borosilicide phase exhibits conventional elastic compression. The metallic character was established using reflectance spectroscopy over a wide energy range, in good agreement with crystallographic data on the boron content.

Title: Valley Splittings in Si/SiGe Heterostructures from First Principles
Authors: Lukas Cvitkovich, Tancredi Salamone, Christoph Wilhelmer, Biel Martinez, Tibor Grasser, Yann-Michel Niquet
Abstract: We compute valley splittings in Si/SiGe superlattices using ab initio density functional theory (DFT). This first-principle approach is expected to provide an excellent description of interfaces, strains, and atomistic disorder without empirically fitted parameters. We benchmark atomistic tight- binding (TB) and the ``$2k_0$'' theory within the effective mass (EM) approximation against DFT. We show that DFT supports the main conclusions of the 2$k_0$ theory, but reveals some limitations of semi-empirical methods such as the EM and TB, in particular about the description of atomistic disorder. The DFT calculations also highlight the effects of strong valley-orbit mixing at large valley splittings. Nevertheless, TB and the 2$k_0$ theory shall provide reasonable valley splitting statistics in many heterostructures of interest for spin qubit devices.

Title: Controlling Carbon Nanostructure Synthesis in Thermal Plasma Jet: Correlation of Process Parameters, Plasma Characteristics, and Product Morphology
Authors: Taki Aissou, Jerome Menneveux, Fanny Casteignau, Nadi Braidy, Jocelyn Veilleux
Abstract: Thermal plasma has emerged as an effective approach for producing carbon nanostructures without the need for specific catalysts nor substrates. While efforts have focused on the effect of process parameters such as reaction pressure, input power or carbon source, the intricate role and relationship with plasma characteristics like density and temperature are often overlooked due to the complexity of the environment. This study addresses this gap by establishing a correlation between process parameters, plasma characteristics, and product morphology, essential for controlling the growth of carbon nanostructures. We explored the impact of carbon precursor type (CH4 and C2H2), hydrogen, pressure, and flow rate on nanostructure formation. Using in situ optical emission spectroscopy (OES), we mapped the distribution of both temperature and dicarbon molecule (C2) density within the plasma jet. We demonstrate that the growth of low-density nanostructures, such as carbon nanohorns (CNHs), is favoured at dilute C2 local densities and high temperatures, while denser nanostructures, such as onion-like polyhedral graphitic nanocapsules (GNCs), are favoured at higher C2 densities and lower temperatures. The carbon density can be controlled by the flow rate and the pressure, which in turn significantly influence the nanostructure morphology, evolving from graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) to GNCs as either parameter increases. Increasing the H/C ratio from 1 to 8 resulted in a morphological transition from CNHs to GNFs. During the synthesis, the plasma jet temperature surpassed 3,000 K, with crystalline growth occurring 50 to 100 mm below the nozzle.

Abstract: The emergence of intelligent matter has sparked significant interest in next generation technologies. We report on the discovery of a reconfigurable magnetic multilayer domain structure in the van der Waals magnet CrSBr, exhibiting a unique combination of magnetic and optical properties. Applying an external magnetic field along the easy axis drives the hysteretic antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition that is not universally binary, but instead develops through a cascade of intermediate magnetic configurations whose multiplicity and stability scale systematically with thickness. This material can be considered as a prototypical intelligent matter, capable of encoding, processing, and storing information through its tunable magnetic structure. The directly linked optical properties of CrSBr, modulated by the magnetic structure, provide a readout mechanism for the stored information compatible with modern information distribution using light. With its adaptive properties, CrSBr is an attractive candidate for neuromorphic circuitries, enabling the design of brain-inspired computing architectures that can learn and evolve in response to changing environments.

Title: In search of the electron-phonon contribution to total energy
Authors: Samuel Poncé, Xavier Gonze
Abstract: The total energy is a fundamental characteristic of solids, molecules, and nanostructures. In most first-principles calculations of the total energy, the nuclear kinetic operator is decoupled from the many-body electronic Hamiltonian and the dynamics of the nuclei is reintroduced afterwards. This two-step procedure introduced by Born and Oppenheimer (BO) is approximate. Energies beyond the electronic and vibrational (or phononic) main contributions might be relevant when small energy differences are important, such as when predicting stable polymorphs or describing magnetic energy landscape. We clarify the different flavors of BO decoupling and give an exact formulation for the total energy in the basis of BO electronic wavefunctions. Then, we list contributions, beyond the main ones, that appear in a perturbative expansion in powers of $M_0^{-1/4}$, where $M_0$ is a typical nuclear mass, up to sixth order. Some of these might be grouped and denoted the electron-phonon contribution to total energy, $E^{\textrm{elph}}$, that first appears at fourth order. The electronic inertial mass contributes at sixth order. We clarify that the sum of the Allen-Heine-Cardona zero-point renormalization of eigenvalues over occupied states is not the electron-phonon contribution to the total energy but a part of the phononic contribution. The computation of the lowest-order $E^{\textrm{elph}}$ is implemented and shown to be small but non-negligible (3.8 meV per atom) in the case of diamond and its hexagonal polymorph. We also estimate the electronic inertial mass contribution and confirm the size-consistency of all computed terms.

Title: Tuning the Electronic States of Bi2Se3 Films with Large Spin-Orbit Interaction Using Molecular Heterojunctions

Abstract: An electric bias can shift the Fermi level along the Dirac cone of a topological insulator and modify its charge transport, but tuning the electronic states and spin-orbit interaction (SOI) without destroying the surface topology is challenging. Here, we show that thin film Bi2Se3/n-p (p-n) molecular diodes form ordered interfaces where charge transfer and orbital re-hybridisation result in a decrease (increase) of the carrier density and improved mobility. In Bi2Se3 the spin-orbit lifetime, t_so, is 0.13 ps, which is comparable to the strongest spin-orbit materials. This lifetime drops further to 0.06 ps (0.09 ps) with the addition of p-n (n-p) molecular diodes, at the limit of measurable values. This strengthened spin-orbit interaction occurs even though molecules are made of light elements and increase the mean free path of the charge carriers by almost 50%, indicating changes to the Berry curvature and/or Rashba splitting around the hybridisation points. Raman spectroscopy gives evidence that the coupling effect may be controlled by optical irradiation, opening a pathway towards the design of heavy-light element hybrids with optically tunable quantum transport.

Title: Tracing the horizon of tetragonal-to-monoclinic distortion in pressurized trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10

Abstract: The crux of understanding the superconducting mechanism in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates hinges on elucidating their structural phases. Under ambient conditions, the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 stabilizes in a twinned monoclinic structure with space group P21/c. Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10.

Title: A meta-GGA perspective on the altermagnetism of RuO2
Authors: Markus Meinert
Abstract: The metallic oxide RuO$_2$ hosts a fascinating edge case of magnetism: while nonmagnetic in ideal bulk material, density functional theory (DFT) predicts an altermagnetic ground state within the DFT$+U$ method. The magnetic state of strained or doped thin films remains controversial, but evidence for a nontrivial magnetic state is ample. Here, I study the altermagnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ on a higher rung of Jacob's ladder of density functional approximations, the meta-GGA level including the kinetic energy density and the density Laplacian. While the workhorse functional of solid-state physics is a generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the modern r$^2$SCAN-L functional has been established as a general-purpose functional which can replace GGA, while systematically improving solid-state properties without introducing spurious errors like erroneous magnetic ground states. Comparison of LSDA+U, GGA+U, and meta-GGA+U results on RuO$_2$ shows systematic enhancement of the exchange interaction, leading to a reduction of the onset value of the Hubbard $U$ parameter at different levels of density functional approximation. However, the magnetic ground state, studied at the experimental lattice constants, remains nonmagnetic with r$^2$SCAN-L. I demonstrate that altermagnetism is easily formed upon lattice expansion, hole doping, and uniaxial strain on the c-axis. The r$^2$SCAN-L calculations set conservative thresholds for distortions and doping levels for the onset of altermagnetism in a parameter-free framework.

Title: Suppressing metal molecule charge transfer with a phosphorus interlayer
Authors: Mattia Bassotti, Luca Floreano, Luca Schio, Sergio Salaverria, Dimas G. de Oteyza, Giacomo Giorgi, Frederik Schiller, Alberto Verdini
Abstract: Porphyrins are organic molecules that exhibit excellent opto-electronics properties, making them suitable for a variety of applications. Nevertheless, their functionality strongly depends on the surface onto which they are deposited, and on the interaction between the molecules and the substrate itself, which often leads to an undesired alteration in their electronic properties. In this study, we use a phosphorus interlayer on a Cu(110) surface as a buffer layer for the electronic decoupling of Zinc-TetraPhenylPorphyrin (ZnTPP) molecules. Using a combination of complementary techniques, such as Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS), X-ray and Ultraviolet Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS, UPS) as well as Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) techniques, it is shown how the charge transfer from the metal, responsible for quenching the ZnTPP lowest unoccupied molecular level (LUMO) levels, is effectively prevented by the presence of a phosphorus reconstruction in between.

Title: Hall-like response from anisotropic Fermi surfaces
Authors: Abhiram Soori
Abstract: We demonstrate that an anisotropic and rotated Fermi surface can generate a finite Hall-like transverse response in electron transport, even in the absence of a magnetic field or Berry curvature. Using a two-dimensional continuum model, we show that broken $k_y \to -k_y$ symmetry inherent to anistropic band structures leads to a nonzero transverse conductivity. We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the Büttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting Hall voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the Hall response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters. Our results provide a symmetry-based route to engineer Hall-like signals in low-symmetry materials without magnetic fields or topological effects.

Title: Prediction of Novel Li-AgII-F Compounds using Evolutionary Algorithms
Authors: Katarzyna Kuder, Wojciech Grochala
Abstract: This work provides a theoretical exploration of the thermodynamic stability and magnetic behaviour of previously unknown ternary Li AgII F compounds. Convex-hull analysis shows that all predicted structures lie slightly above the LiF plus AgF2 decomposition line, indicating a natural tendency toward phase separation; nevertheless, their negative formation energies relative to AgF, LiF, and F2 or F suggest that alternative synthetic pathways may be feasible for these compounds. All studied structures show preference for antiferromagnetic ground state. Notably, the triclinic LiAgF3 type2 is predicted to exhibit an exceptionally large superexchange constant, J equal to minus 358 meV, within Ag2F7 dimers, placing it above the strongest known magnetic exchange interactions reported to date.

Title: High Fidelity Qubit Control in a Natural Si-MOS Quantum Dot using a 300 mm Silicon on Insulator Wafer

Abstract: We demonstrate high-fidelity single qubit control in a natural Si-MOS quantum dot fabricated in an industrial 300 mm wafer process on a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer using electron spin resonance. A relatively high optimal Rabi frequency of 5 MHz is achieved, dynamically decoupling the electron spin from its 29-Si environment. Tracking the qubit frequency reduces the impact of low frequency noise in the qubit frequency and improves the $T^{Rabi}$ from 7 to 11 $\mu$s at a Rabi frequency of 5 MHz, resulting in Q-factors exceeding 50. Randomized benchmarking returns an average single gate control fidelity of 99.5 $\pm$ 0.3%. As a result of pulse-area calibration, this fidelity is limited by the Rabi Q-factor. These results show that a fast Rabi frequency, low charge noise, and a feedback protocol enable high fidelity in these Si-MOS devices, despite the low-frequency magnetic noise.

Title: Axionic tunneling from a topological Kondo insulator
Authors: Saikat Banerjee, Anuva Aishwarya, Fei Liu, Lin Jiao, Vidya Madhavan, Eugene J. Mele, Piers Coleman
Abstract: Discoveries over the past two decades have revealed the remarkable ability of quantum materials to emulate relativistic properties of the vacuum, from Dirac cones in graphene to the Weyl surface states of topological insulators. Yet the most elusive consequence of topology in quantum matter is the axionic $E\cdot B$ term in the electromagnetic response. Here we report a direct signature of axionic physics obtained through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Although recent STM experiments using SmB$_6$ nanowires have been interpreted as evidence for spin-polarized currents arising from topological surface states, we show that the observed spin polarization instead originates from axionic electrodynamics. Our analysis reveals a striking voltage-induced magnetization: extremely small voltages ($\sim$ 30 meV) generate tip moments of order 0.1 $\mu_B$ that reverse sign with the applied bias. The magnitude, tunability, and reversibility of this signal are consistent with an axionic $E \cdot B$ coupling, and fully account for the magnetic component of the tip density of states, ruling out static magnetism. Millivolt-scale control of spin polarization in a tunnel junction provides a new route for probing axionic electrodynamics and opens avenues for future STM and spintronics applications.

Title: Multimode RF Reflectometry for Spin Qubit Readout and Device Characterization

Abstract: We introduce a multimode superconducting inductor architecture that enables radio-frequency reflectometry at multiple discrete frequencies up to 2 GHz, addressing limitations of conventional single-mode designs. The spiral inductor's distributed inter-turn capacitance yields distinct resonant modes with varied impedance-matching conditions. By probing a quantum dot across several modes, we extract tunneling rates over a broad frequency range and identify signatures of nearby charge defects. Using one of the higher-order modes, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout via a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (RF-SET), achieving singlet-triplet readout with an integration time of 8 us and a readout fidelity of 98%. These results establish multimode inductance as a scalable and flexible component for fast spin-qubit readout and device-quality characterization.

Title: Global phase diagram of two-dimensional dirty hyperbolic Dirac liquids
Authors: Christopher A. Leong, Daniel J. Salib, Bitan Roy
Abstract: Within the framework of the canonical nearest-neighbor tight-binding model for spinless fermions, a family of two-dimensional bipartite hyperbolic lattices hosts massless Diraclike excitations near half-filling with the iconic vanishing density of states (DOS) near zero energy. We show that a collection of such ballistic quasiparticles remains stable against sufficiently weak pointlike charge impurities, a feature captured by the vanishing average [$\rho_{a}(0)$] and typical [$\rho_{t}(0)$] DOS at zero energy, computed by employing the kernel polynomial method in sufficiently large $\{ 10, 3\}$ hyperbolic lattices (Schläfli symbol) with more than $10^8$ and $10^5$ sites, respectively, with open boundary conditions. However, at moderate disorder the system enters a metallic state via a continuous quantum phase transition where both $\rho_{a}(0)$ and $\rho_{t}(0)$ become finite. With increasing strength of disorder, ultimately an Anderson insulator sets in, where only $\rho_{t}(0) \to 0$. The resulting phase diagram for dirty Dirac fermions living on a hyperbolic space solely stems from the background negative spatial curvature, as confirmed from the vanishing $\rho_{t}(0)$ for arbitrarily weak disorder on honeycomb lattices, fostering relativistic fermions on a flatland, as the thermodynamic limit is approached.

Title: Nano-capattery: Taming electron traffic for a 367% leap in biohydrogen surge through suppressing competing pathways in photo photo-fermentative system
Authors: Muhammad Shahzaib
Abstract: The electron flux diverts electrons from optimal hydrogen production pathways to competitive pathways, which overall reduces the efficiency of the photo fermentation hydrogen production (PFHP) system. For tackling electron flux and metabolic pathway regulation, a hybrid material (nano-capattery (NC)) was developed based on cobalt-iron-nitrogen doped biochar (Co-Fe-NBC). The NC possessed both the capacitor property (287.91 F/g) and battery-like charge storage 38.3 mC/g with the highest energy density of 159.95 mWh/g. These properties existed due to its Fe2+/Fe3+ and Co2+/Co3+ redox cycle ability, a highly porous surface (291.81 m2/g BET surface area) caused by the defects (AD/AG 3.13) and abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) observed through electro paramagnetic resonance. During PFHP, there is an 85% reduction in propionic acid, a 65.3% record electron management efficiency, an improved 1.34 NAD+/NADH ratio, along with a 87% increase in dehydrogenase activity, confirming the superior role of NC in efficient regulation of the metabolic pathway and electron flux management. These exceptional properties of biochar-based NC raised the cumulative hydrogen production from 151.03 mL (control) to 589.54 mL, which was an enormous increase of 367%.

Title: Dissipative Yao-Lee Spin-Orbital Model: Exact Solvability and $\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Zihao Qi, Yuan Xue
Abstract: Exactly solvable dissipative models provide an analytical tool for studying the relaxation dynamics in open quantum systems. In this work, we study an exactly solvable model based on an anisotropic variant of the Yao-Lee spin-orbital model, with dissipation acting in the spin sector. We map Liouvillian dynamics to fermions hopping in a doubled Hilbert space under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and demonstrate the model's exact solvability. We analyze the model's strong and weak symmetries, which protect an exponentially large manifold of non-equilibrium steady states, establishing the system as a physically feasible dissipative spin liquid. Furthermore, we analyze the transient dynamics in a translationally invariant sector and discover that the single-particle Liouvillian spectrum hosts an exceptional ring in momentum space. We map out a characteristic $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking transition driven by the dissipation strength, which governs the crossover from oscillatory to decaying relaxation of physical observables. Our work provides a physically motivated, solvable setting for exploring the coexistence of dissipative spin liquid physics and Liouvillian spectral singularities.

Title: Entanglement membrane in the Brownian SYK chain
Authors: Márk Mezei, Harshit Rajgadia
Abstract: There is mounting evidence that entanglement dynamics in chaotic many-body quantum systems in the limit of large subsystems and long times is described by an entanglement membrane effective theory. In this paper, we derive the membrane description in a solvable chaotic large-$N$ model, the Brownian SYK chain. This model has a collective field description in terms of fermion bilinears connecting different folds of the multifold Schwinger-Keldysh path integral used to compute Rényi entropies. The entanglement membrane is a traveling wave solution of the saddle point equations governing these collective fields. The entanglement membrane is characterised by a velocity $v$ and a membrane tension ${\cal E}(v)$ that we calculate. We find that the membrane has finite width for $v<v_B$ (the butterfly velocity), however for $v > v_B$, the membrane splits into two wave fronts, each moving with the butterfly velocity. Our results provide a new viewpoint on the entanglement membrane and uncover new connections between quantum information dynamics and scrambling.

Title: GPU-Portable Real-Space Density Functional Theory Implementation on Unified-Memory Architectures
Authors: Atsushi M. Ito
Abstract: We present a GPU-portable implementation of a real-space density functional theory (DFT) code ``QUMASUN'' and benchmark it on the new Plasma Simulator featuring Intel Xeon 6980P CPUs, and AMD MI300A GPUs. Additional tests were performed on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. In particular MI300A supports unified memory and GH200 supports coherent memory interconnect, simplifying GPU porting. A lightweight C++ lambda-based layer enables CPU, CUDA, and HIP execution without OpenMP/OpenACC preprocessor directives. For diamond (216 atoms) and tungsten (128 atoms) systems, MI300A and GH200 achieve 2.0-2.8 $\times$ and 2.3-2.4 $\times$ speedups over a 256-core Xeon node. The compute-bound kernels, which are fast Fourier transforms (FFT), dense matrix-matrix multiplications (GEMM) and eigenvalue solver, show substantial acceleration on both GPUs, indicating that the present GPU-portable approach can benefit a wide range of plasma-fusion simulation codes beyond DFT.

Title: Irreversibility condition and stability of equilibria in the inverse-deformation approach to fracture
Authors: Arnav Gupta
Abstract: We derive the irreversibility condition in fracture for the inverse-deformation approach using the second law of thermodynamics. We consider the problem of brittle failure in an elastic bar previously solved in (Rosakis et al 2021). Despite the presence of a non-zero interfacial/surface energy, the third derivative of the inverse-deformation map is discontinuous at the crack faces. This is due to the presence of the inequality constraint ensuring the inverse strain is nonnegative and the orientation of matter is preserved. A change in the material location of a crack results in negative entropy production, violating the second law. Consequently, such changes are disallowed giving the irreversibility condition. The inequality constraint and the irreversibility condition limit the space of admissible variations. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability that incorporate these restrictions. Their numerical implementation shows that all broken equilibria found in (Rosakis et al 2021) are locally stable.

Title: Exceptionally high Verdet constant in gold nanodisc arrays
Authors: Gajendra Mulay, Shraddha Choudhary, Ashwin A Tulapurkar, Daria O Ignatyeva, Vladimir I Belotelov, Shriganesh S Prabhu, Venu Gopal Achanta
Abstract: Magneto-optical effects in non-magnetic noble metals can be greatly enhanced by leveraging the in-plane Lorentz force at engineered plasmonic resonances. We demonstrate a 2D array of gold nanodiscs designed to host a hybrid resonance of localized plasmon and surface lattice modes. The structure exhibits a Verdet constant of 1.98e6 deg/T.m, corresponding to a Faraday rotation of -0.15 deg at a 1 T magnetic field. This Verdet constant represents a 15-fold enhancement over unpatterned gold and is highly competitive with many plasmon-enhanced diamagnetic nanostructures. These findings offer new opportunities for harnessing strong magneto-plasmonic effects in optoelectronic devices by patterning common non-magnetic metals.

Title: Ground state energy and phase transitions of Long-range XXZ using VQE
Authors: Mrinal Dev, Shraddha Sharma
Abstract: The variational quantum eigen solver (VQE), has been widely used to find the ground state energy of different Hamiltonians with no analytical solutions and are classically difficult to compute. In our work, we have used VQE to identify the phase transition boundary for an infinite order phase transition. We use long-range XXZ (LRXXZ) chain for our study. In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process. Consequently, the ansatz works in a certain phase where it gives relatively small random error, as it should, when compared to the error in ground state energy calculations of the other phases, where the ansatz fails. By identifying these changes in the behaviour of the error in ground state energy using VQE, we were able to determine the phase boundaries. Using exact diagonalisation, we also compare the behaviour of the energy gradient and energy gap across both the phase transition boundaries for this model. Further, by increasing the depth of the optimisation circuit, we also accurately evaluate the ground energy of the LRXXZ chain for the value of coupling constant, J equal to -1

Title: Probing false vacuum decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom array
Authors: Yu-Xin Chao, Peiyun Ge, Zhen-Xing Hua, Chen Jia, Xiao Wang, Xinhui Liang, Zongpei Yue, Rong Lu, Meng Khoon Tey, Xiao Wang, Li You
Abstract: In quantum field theory (QFT), the "vacuum" is not just empty space but the lowest-energy state of a quantum field. If the energy landscape has multiple local minima, the local ground states are the false vacuum (FV) which can tunnel towards the global ground state (true vacuum, TV). This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra. Our findings and methods open avenues for future studies of many-body tunneling in higher dimensions or more complex geometries.

Title: Probing chiral topological states with permutation defects
Authors: Yarden Sheffer, Ruihua Fan, Ady Stern, Erez Berg, Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: The hallmark of two-dimensional chiral topological phases is the existence of anomalous gapless modes at the spatial boundary. Yet, the manifestation of this edge anomaly within the bulk ground-state wavefunction itself remains only partially understood. In this work, we introduce a family of multipartite entanglement measures that probe chirality directly from the bulk wavefunction. Our construction involves applying different permutations between replicas of the ground state wavefunction in neighboring spatial regions, creating "permutation defects" at the boundaries between these regions. We provide general arguments for the robustness of these measures and develop a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically. While the standard topological field theory prescription misses the chiral contribution, our method correctly identifies it as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces. This feature is a consequence of the bulk-edge correspondence, which dictates that any regularization of the theory at the permutation defects must introduce gapless boundary modes. We numerically verify our results with both free-fermion and strongly-interacting chiral topological states and find excellent agreement. Our results enable the extraction of the chiral central charge and the Hall conductance using a finite number of wavefunction replicas, making these quantities accessible to Monte-Carlo numerical techniques and noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

Title: Modular Hamiltonian of the massive scalar field on the half line: A numerical approach
Authors: Christoph Minz, Erik Tonni
Abstract: We study the modular Hamiltonian of an interval for the ground state of a massive free scalar field on the half line with Robin boundary conditions, by employing a numerical method. When the interval is adjacent to the boundary, we find numerical evidence that the modular Hamiltonian is non-local, except for the limiting cases of the massless scalar satisfying either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. When the interval is separated from the boundary, the numerical analysis indicates that the modular Hamiltonian is non-local for all these boundary conditions and any value of the mass.

Title: Fermionic neural Gibbs states
Authors: Jannes Nys, Juan Carrasquilla
Abstract: We introduce fermionic neural Gibbs states (fNGS), a variational framework for modeling finite-temperature properties of strongly interacting fermions. fNGS starts from a reference mean-field thermofield-double state and uses neural-network transformations together with imaginary-time evolution to systematically build strong correlations. Applied to the doped Fermi-Hubbard model, a minimal lattice model capturing essential features of strong electronic correlations, fNGS accurately reproduces thermal energies over a broad range of temperatures, interaction strengths, even at large dopings, for system sizes beyond the reach of exact methods. These results demonstrate a scalable route to studying finite-temperature properties of strongly correlated fermionic systems beyond one dimension with neural-network representations of quantum states.

Title: Teaching a Transformer to Think Like a Chemist: Predicting Nanocluster Stability
Authors: João Marcos T. Palheta, Octavio Rodrigues Filho, Mohammad Soleymanibrojeni, Alexandre Cavalheiro Dias, Diego Guedes-Sobrinho, Wolfgang Wenzel, Roland Aydin, Celso R. C. Rêgo, Maurício Jeomar Piotrowski
Abstract: Atomically precise metal nanoclusters bridge the molecular and bulk regimes, but designing bimetallic motifs with targeted stability and reactivity remains challenging. Here we combine density functional theory (DFT) and physics-grounded predictive artificial intelligence to map the configurational landscape of 13-atom icosahedral nanoclusters X$_{12}$TM, with hosts X = (Ti, Zr, Hf), and Fe and a single transition--metal dopant spanning the 3$d$-5$d$ series. Spin-polarized DFT calculations on 240 bimetallic clusters reveal systematic trends in binding and formation energies, distortion penalties, effective coordination number, d-band centre, and HOMO-LUMO gap that govern the competition between core-shell (in) and surface-segregated (out) arrangements. We then pretrain a transformer architecture on a curated set of 2968 unary clusters from the Quantum Cluster Database and fine-tune it on bimetallic data to predict formation energies and in/out preference, achieving mean absolute errors of about $0.6-0.7$eV and calibrated uncertainty intervals. The resulting model rapidly adapts to an unseen Fe-host domain with only a handful of labelled examples. At the same time, attention patterns and Shapley attributions highlight size mismatch, $d$-electron count, and coordination environment as key descriptors. All data, code, and workflows follow FAIR/TRUE principles, enabling reproducible, interpretable screening of unexplored nanocluster chemistries for catalysis and energy conversion.

Title: Convergence of sample-based quantum diagonalization on a variable-length cuprate chain
Authors: L. Andrew Wray, Cheng-Ju Lin, Vincent Su, Hrant Gharibyan
Abstract: Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is an algorithm for hybrid quantum-classical molecular simulation that has been of broad interest for application with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, SQD does not always converge on a practical timescale. Here, we explore scaling of the algorithm for a variable-length molecule made up of 2 to 6 copper oxide plaquettes with a minimal molecular orbital basis. The results demonstrate that enabling all-to-all connectivity, instituting a higher expansion order for the SQD algorithm, and adopting a non-Hartree-Fock molecular orbital basis can all play significant roles in overcoming sampling bottlenecks, though with tradeoffs that need to be weighed against the capabilities of quantum and classical hardware. Additionally, we find that noise on a real quantum computer, the Quantinuum H2 trapped ion device, can improve energy convergence beyond expectations based on noise-free statevector simulations.

Title: Geometric Data Science
Authors: Olga D Anosova, Vitaliy A Kurlin
Abstract: This book introduces the new research area of Geometric Data Science, where data can represent any real objects through geometric measurements. The first part of the book focuses on finite point sets. The most important result is a complete and continuous classification of all finite clouds of unordered points under rigid motion in any Euclidean space. The key challenge was to avoid the exponential complexity arising from permutations of the given unordered points. For a fixed dimension of the ambient Euclidean space, the times of all algorithms for the resulting invariants and distance metrics depend polynomially on the number of points. The second part of the book advances a similar classification in the much more difficult case of periodic point sets, which model all periodic crystals at the atomic scale. The most significant result is the hierarchy of invariants from the ultra-fast to complete ones. The key challenge was to resolve the discontinuity of crystal representations that break down under almost any noise. Experimental validation on all major materials databases confirmed the Crystal Isometry Principle: any real periodic crystal has a unique location in a common moduli space of all periodic structures under rigid motion. The resulting moduli space contains all known and not yet discovered periodic crystals and hence continuously extends Mendeleev's table to the full crystal universe.

Title: On six-loop scaling dimensions of $(ϕ^2)^n$ operators in $d=3$
Authors: A.V. Bednyakov, M.V. Kompaniets, A.V. Trenogin
Abstract: We consider a class of singlet operators $(\phi^2)^n$ in the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model with $\lambda^2 \phi^6$ interaction. Recently, the corresponding anomalous dimensions $\gamma_{2n}$ were computed by semiclassical methods and the all-loop result for the leading-$n$ corrections in the small $\lambda$ limit was found. In this letter, we obtain the six-loop expressions not only for the leading-$n$ contribution but also for the subleading one. While the leading correction confirms the predictions of recent semiclassical calculation, the subleading one is a new result and will serve as a future welcome check for the all-loop expressions. As an important by-product of our calculation, we provide a full dependence on $n$ of the four-loop $\gamma_{2n}$ in the $O(N)$ case.

Title: Thermodynamic universality across dissipative quantum phase transitions
Authors: Laetitia P. Bettmann, Artur M. Lacerda, Mark T. Mitchison, John Goold
Abstract: We study finite-time driving across second-order dissipative quantum phase transitions described by Lindblad dynamics. We show that the nonadiabatic entropy production, which quantifies deviations from the instantaneous nonequilibrium steady state, exhibits universal power-law scaling with the ramp duration in analogy to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for closed systems. This establishes the universality of irreversible dissipation induced by driving an open quantum system near criticality. Furthermore, in systems described by bosonic Gaussian states, our scaling laws predict that the nonadiabatic entropy production is independent of driving speed to leading order, revealing a distinctive feature of Gaussian dissipative quantum phase transitions. We validate these analytical predictions in the thermodynamic limit of the driven-dissipative Dicke model and via finite-size scaling in the open Kerr model. Our results establish a general framework for understanding universal nonequilibrium response and thermodynamic irreversibility in critical open quantum systems.

Title: Anisotropic Response in Metamaterials with Elliptically Perforated Plates: Applications to Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer
Authors: J. E. P'erez-Rodr'iguez, R. Esquivel-Sirvent, A. Camacho de la Rosa
Abstract: Metamaterials with tunable optical properties provide a versatile platform for controlling electromagnetic interactions at the nanoscale. This study explores the anisotropic thermal behavior of metamaterials composed of planar plates perforated with periodic arrays of cylinders possessing elliptical cross sections. In contrast to conventional circular perforations, elliptical geometries inherently break rotational symmetry, introducing anisotropy in the effective electromagnetic and thermal response of the structure. Using a fluctuation electrodynamics framework combined with full-wave numerical simulations, we quantify the near-field radiative heat transfer between such elliptically perforated plates as a function of ellipse orientation, aspect ratio, and separation distance. The results reveal that elliptical perforations enable enhanced spectral and directional control of evanescent mode coupling and surface polariton excitation, leading to significant modulation of the near-field heat flux. These findings highlight the potential of geometrically engineered anisotropy for advanced thermal management and energy conversion applications, and offer new design strategies for the development of thermally functional metamaterials operating in the near-field regime.

Title: Comment on paper: Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry, Nature 614, 440 (2023)
Authors: V.R. Shaginyan, A.Z. Msezane, G.S. Japaridze
Abstract: We demonstrate that an absolutely flat band retains the superconducting state at $T_c\to 0$. When $T_c>0$ the flat band disappears, since it must be modified by the superconducting state. Thus, a number of the results on ultra-strong coupling superconductivity in flat band considered in the article ("Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry", Nature 614, 440 (2023)) were predicted and explained many years ago. One has to take into account that at $T_c>0$ the flat band distorts, becoming tilted. As a result, the charge carriers' velocity $v_F\propto T_c$ becomes finite, rather than being extremely slow, as it is stated in the article. Thus, the statement "the charge carriers' group velocity $v_ F$ is extremely slow" is incorrect and leads the authors to the conceptional misunderstanding, confusing the reader.

Title: Dynamic enhancement of conductance in fractional quantum Hall constriction
Authors: Sampurna Karmakar, Amulya Ratnakar, Sourin Das
Abstract: A disparity in the charge of quasi-particle excitations across a tunnel junction can trigger Andreev-like processes, creating an effect similar to that of a step-up transformer. We study such a junction in its strong coupling limit in the context of quantum Hall states. Specifically, for filling fractions $\nu=1$ and $1/3$, we show the DC gain in the transformer action is bounded by 3/2, irrespective of the interedge interaction range, while the AC gain is bounded by $\sqrt{3}$ and is sensitive to the range of the interaction. This setup presents a unique possibility of frequency-tunable resonances and anti-resonances across the QPC.

Title: Shot noise in Aharonov-Bohm interferometers: Comparison of helical and conventional setups
Authors: R. A. Niyazov, I. V. Krainov, D. N. Aristov, V. Yu. Kachorovskii
Abstract: We study tunneling transport through quantum Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometers and demonstrate that interference effects strongly modify shot noise of the current. We discuss in detail two simplest setups: conventional single-channel spinless interferometer and interferometer formed by helical edge states of two-dimensional topological insulator. We demonstrate that both in the conventional and the helical case the interference dramatically changes the Fano factor and its magnetic field dependence. For weak tunneling coupling, the Fano factor of both setups exhibits a periodic series of sharp AB peaks depending on the magnetic flux piercing the system. Our key finding is that the Fano factor in the helical interferometer provides information about the presence of backscattering defects violating topological protection. In particular, the amplitude of AB peaks in the helical setup is proportional to the strength of the defect in contrast to conventional setup, where peaks have finite amplitude even in the ballistic case.

Title: A non-magnetic mechanism of backscattering in helical edge states
Authors: I. V. Krainov, R. A. Niyazov, D. N. Aristov, V. Yu. Kachorovskii
Abstract: We study interaction-induced backscattering mechanism for helical edge states of a two-dimensional topological insulator which is tunnel-coupled to a puddle located near the edge channel. The mechanism does not involve inelastic scattering and is due to the zero-mode fluctuations in a puddle. We discuss in detail a simple model of a puddle - a cavity in the bulk of the topological insulator. Such a cavity also has helical edge states with tunneling coupling to helical states encompassing the topological insulator. We analyze effect of the edge current in the puddle. Although averaged value of this current is equal to zero, its zero-mode fluctuations act, in the presence of electron-electron interaction, similar to magnetic flux thus allowing backscattering processes, which involve tunneling through the puddle. Rectification of these fluctuations leads to a finite probability of backscattering. This effect is further enhanced due to dephasing process which is also dominated by zero-mode fluctuations. Remarkably, for temperature exceeding level spacing in the puddle, the rate of backscattering does not depend on temperature in a good agreement with recent experiments.

Title: Topological dipoles of quantum skyrmions
Authors: Sopheak Sorn, Jörg Schmalian, Markus Garst
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are spatially localized whirls of spin moments in two dimension, featuring a nontrivial topological charge and a well-defined topological charge density. We demonstrate that the quantum dynamics of magnetic skyrmions is governed by a dipole conservation law associated with the topological charge, akin to that in fracton theories of excitations with constrained mobility. The dipole conservation law enables a natural definition of the collective coordinate to specify the skymion's position, which ultimately leads to a greatly simplified equation of motion in the form of the Thiele equation. In this formulation, the skyrmion mass, whose existence is often debated, actually vanishes. As a result, an isolated skyrmion is intrinsically pinned to be immobile and cannot move at a constant velocity. In a spin-wave theory, we show that such dynamics corresponds to a precise cancellation between a highly nontrivial motion of the quasi-classical skyrmion spin texture and a cloud of quantum fluctuations in the form of spin waves. Given this quenched kinetic energy of quantum skyrmions, we identify close analogies to the bosonic quantum Hall problem. In particular, the topological charge density is shown to obey the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra that describes neutral modes of the lowest Landau level in the fractional quantum Hall problem. Consequently, the conservation of the topological dipole suggests that magnetic skyrmion materials offer a promising platform for exploring fractonic phenomena with close analogies to fractional quantum Hall states.

Title: Response of superfluid fermions at finite temperature
Authors: Sumit Bhattacharjee, Elena Litvinova
Abstract: A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete 4x4 block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Fully correlated static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. A special focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem while keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex, as well as the components of the dynamical kernel, acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.

Title: Bound states of quasiparticles with quartic dispersion in an external potential: WKB approach
Authors: E.V. Gorbar, V.P. Gusynin
Abstract: The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin semiclassical method is formulated for quasiparticles with quartic-in-momentum dispersion which presents the simplest case of a soft energy-momentum dispersion. It is shown that matching wave functions in the classically forbidden and allowed regions requires the consideration of higher-order Airy-type functions. The asymptotics of these functions are found by using the method of steepest descents and contain additional exponentially suppressed contributions known as hyperasymptotics. These hyperasymptotics are crucially important for the correct matching of wave functions in vicinity of turning points for higher-order differential equations. A quantization condition for bound state energies is obtained, which generalizes the standard Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition for particles with quadratic energy-momentum dispersion and contains non-perturbative in $\hbar$ correction. This non-perturbative correction, usually associated with tunneling effects or the presence of complex turning points, occurs even for the harmonic potential with quartic dispersion where complex turning points and tunneling are absent. The quantization condition is used to find bound state energies in the case of quadratic and quartic potentials.

Title: Matrix approach to generalized ensemble theory for nonequilibrium discrete systems
Authors: Shaohua Guan
Abstract: A universal and rigorous ensemble framework for nonequilibrium system remains lacking. Here, we provide a concise framework for the generalized ensemble theory of nonequilibrium discrete systems using matrix-based approach. By introducing an observation matrix, we show that any discrete probability distribution can be formulated as a generalized Boltzmann distribution, with observables and their conjugate variables serving as basis vectors and coordinates in a vector space. Within this framework, we identify the minimal sufficient statistics required to infer the Boltzmann distribution. The nonequilibrium thermodynamic relations and fluctuation-dissipation relations naturally emerge from this framework. Our findings provide a new approach to developing generalized ensemble theory for nonequilibrium discrete systems.

Title: Entropy Production in Non-Gaussian Active Matter: A Unified Fluctuation Theorem and Deep Learning Framework
Authors: Yuanfei Huang, Chengyu Liu, Bing Miao, Xiang Zhou
Abstract: We present a general framework for deriving entropy production rates (EPRs) in active matter systems driven by non-Gaussian active fluctuations. Employing the probability-flow equivalence technique, we rigorously obtain an entropy production (EP) decomposition formula. We demonstrate that the EP, $\Delta s_\mathrm{tot}$, satisfies a detailed fluctuation theorem, $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)/\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(-\Sigma)=e^{\Sigma}$, which holds for the distribution $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)$ defined as the probability of observing a value $\Sigma$ of the quantity $\mathcal{R}\equiv \Delta s_\mathrm{tot}-B_\mathrm{act}$, where $B_\mathrm{act}$ is a path-dependent random variable associated with active fluctuations. Moreover, an integral fluctuation theorem, $\langle e^{- \mathcal{R} } \rangle = 1$, and the generalized second law of thermodynamics, $\langle \Delta s_\mathrm{tot} \rangle \ge \langle B_\mathrm{act} \rangle$, follow directly. Our results hold under steady-state conditions and can be straightforwardly extended to arbitrary initial states. In the limiting case where active fluctuations vanish, these theorems reduce to the established results of stochastic thermodynamics. Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce a deep-learning-based methodology for efficiently computing the EP, utilizing the Lévy score we propose. To illustrate the validity of our approach, we apply it to two representative systems: a Brownian particle in a periodic active bath and an active polymer composed of an active Brownian cross-linker interacting with passive Brownian beads. Our work provides a unified framework for analyzing EP in active matter and offers practical computational tools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behavior.

Title: Exciton fractional Chern insulators in moiré heterostructures
Authors: Raul Perea-Causin, Hui Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz
Abstract: Moiré materials have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring exotic quantum phases. While recent experiments have unveiled fractional Chern insulators exhibiting the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect based on electrons or holes, the exploration of analogous many-body states with bosonic constituents remains largely uncharted. In this work, we predict the emergence of bosonic fractional Chern insulators arising from long-lived excitons in a moiré superlattice formed by twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ stacked on monolayer MoSe$_2$. Performing exact diagonalization on the exciton flat Chern band present in this structure, we provide compelling evidence for the existence of Abelian and non-Abelian phases at band filling $\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$, respectively, through multiple robust signatures including ground-state degeneracy, spectral flow, many-body Chern number, and particle-cut entanglement spectrum. The obtained energy gap of $\sim 10$ meV for the Abelian states suggests a remarkably high stability of this phase, which persists for a relatively wide range of twist angles and vertical electric fields. Our findings establish the presence of robust bosonic fractional Chern insulators in highly tunable and experimentally accessible moiré heterostructures and unveil a promising pathway for realizing non-Abelian anyons.

Title: Motion of ferrodark solitons in trapped superfluids: spin corrections and emergent oscillators
Authors: Jiangnan Biguo, Xiaoquan Yu
Abstract: We propose a framework for topological soliton dynamics in trapped spinor superfluids, decomposing the force acting on the soliton by the surrounding fluid into the buoyancy force and spin corrections arising from the density depletion at soliton core and the coupling between the orbital motion and the spin mixing, respectively. Our formulation applies to large-amplitude soliton motion in general superfluids with spin degrees of freedom under arbitrary external potentials. For ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates , the spin correction could diverge, change the direction of the total force and enable mapping the FDS motion in a harmonic trap to the atomic-mass particle dynamics in an emergent quartic potential. Initially placing a type-I FDS near the trap center, a single-sided oscillation happens, which maps to the particle moving around a local minimum of the emergent double-well potential. As the initial distance of a type-II FDS from the trap center increases, the motion exhibits three regimes: trap-centered harmonic and anharmonic oscallations followed by single-sided oscillations. Correspondingly the emergent quartic potential undergoes a transition from a single minimum to a double-well shape, where the particle motion shifts from oscillating around the single minimum to crossing between two minima via the local maximum, then the symmetry-breaking motion around one of the two minima. In a hard-wall trap with linear potential, the FDS motion maps to a harmonic oscillator.

Title: Half-ice, half-fire driven ultranarrow phase crossover in 1D decorated q-state Potts ferrimagnets: An AI-co-led exploration
Authors: Weiguo Yin
Abstract: OpenAI's reasoning model o3-mini-high was used to carry out an exact analytic study of onedimensional ferrimagnetic site- and bond-decorated q-state Potts models. We demonstrate that the finitetemperature ultranarrow phase crossover (UNPC), driven by a hidden "half-ice, half-fire" state recently discovered in the $q = 2$ case (Ising model), persists for $q > 2$. We identify unique novel features for $q > 2$, including the dome structure in the field-temperature phase diagram and for large $q$ a secondary high-temperature UNPC to the fully disordered paramagnetic state. Moreover, while the crossover temperature $T_0$ in the site-decorated Potts model is independent of the spin interaction $J$ between the backbone spins and thus remains unchanged as the UNPC quickly approaches a genuine transition -- the crossover width is narrowed exponentially -- by enhancing $J$ (referred to as Type-I UNPC), $T_0$ in the bond-decorated Potts model with $q > 2$ depends on $J$ and quickly shifts toward a finite temperature as $J$ increases (referred to as Type-II UNPC). These novel results establish a versatile framework for engineering controlled fast state-flipping switches in low-dimensional systems. Our nine-level AI-contribution rating assigns AI the meritorious status of AI-co-led discovery in this work.

Title: Parity anomaly from LSM: exact valley symmetries on the lattice
Authors: Salvatore D. Pace, Minho Luke Kim, Arkya Chatterjee, Shu-Heng Shao
Abstract: We show that the honeycomb tight-binding model hosts an exact microscopic avatar of its low-energy SU(2) valley symmetry and parity anomaly. Specifically, the SU(2) valley symmetry arises from a collection of conserved, integer quantized charge operators that obey the Onsager algebra. Along with lattice reflection and time-reversal symmetries, this Onsager symmetry has a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly that matches the parity anomaly in the IR. Indeed, we show that any local Hamiltonian commuting with these symmetries cannot have a trivial unique gapped ground state. We study the phase diagram of the simplest symmetric model and survey various deformations, including Haldane's mass term, which preserves only the Onsager symmetry. Our results place the parity anomaly in ${2+1}$D alongside Schwinger's anomaly in ${1+1}$D and Witten's SU(2) anomaly in ${3+1}$D as 't Hooft anomalies that can arise from the Onsager symmetry on the lattice.

Title: Digital Quantum Simulation of the Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid
Authors: Seongjun Park, Eun-Gook Moon
Abstract: The ground state of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid on a honeycomb lattice is an intriguing many-body state characterized by its topological order and massive entanglement. One of the significant issues is to prepare and manipulate the ground state as well as excited states in a quantum simulator. Here, we provide a protocol to manipulate the Kitaev quantum spin liquid via digital quantum simulation. A series of unitary gates for the protocol is explicitly constructed, showing its circuit depth is an order of O(N) with the number of qubits, N. We demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol on the IBM Heron r2 processor for N = 8 and 12. We further validate our theoretical framework through numerical simulations, confirming high-fidelity quantum state control for system sizes up to N = 450, and discuss the possible implications of these results.

Title: Droplet-gas phases and their dynamical formation in particle imbalanced mixtures
Authors: Jose Carlos Pelayo, George A. Bougas, Thomás Fogarty, Thomas Busch, Simeon I. Mistakidis
Abstract: We explore the ground state phase diagram and nonequilibrium dynamics of genuine two-component particle-imbalanced droplets in both isotropic and anisotropic three-dimensional confinements. A gradual transition from mixed droplet-gas to gas configurations is revealed as the average intercomponent attraction decreases or the transverse confinement becomes tighter. Within the mixed structures, a specific majority fragment binds to the minority droplet, satisfying the density ratio locking condition, while the remaining atoms are in a gas state. Our extended Gross-Pitaevskii numerical results are corroborated by a suitable variational approximation capturing the shape and characteristics of droplet-gas fragments. The tunability of the relatively low gas fraction is showcased through parametric variations of the atom number, the intercomponent imbalance, the trap aspect ratio, or the radius of a box potential. To validate the existence and probe the properties of these exotic phases, we simulate the standard time-of-flight and radio frequency experimental techniques. These allow to dynamically identify the resilience of the droplet fragment and the expansion of the gas fraction. Our results, amenable to current experimental cold atom settings, are expected to guide forthcoming investigations aiming to reveal unseen out-of-equilibrium droplet dynamics.

Title: High-Entropy Skutterudites as Thermoelectrics: Potential Synthesizability, Enhanced Stability and Band Convergence via the Cocktail Effect
Authors: Jose J. Plata, Antonio Morales-Altarejos, Elena R. Remesal, Victor Posligua, Antonio M. Márquez
Abstract: High entropy materials offer a promising avenue for thermoelectric materials discovery, design, and optimization. However, the large chemical spaces that need to be explored hamper their development. In this work, a large family of high-entropy skutterudites is explored as promising thermoelectric materials. Their potential synthesizability is screened and rationalized using the disordered enthalpy-entropy descriptor through high-throughput density functional theory calculations. In the case of high-entropy skutterudites, the thermodynamic density of states and the entropy gain parameter appear to be key factors for their stabilization. Electronic band structure analyses not only show a reduction in the band gap, which enhances carrier concentration and electrical conductivity, but also a band convergence phenomenon for some specific compositions, which is related to the "cocktail effect". Analyzing atom-projected band structures shows how band convergence is due to the simultaneous presence of Fe, Ni, and Co in the compound. The presence of Rh or Ir, while not contributing to this band convergence effect, can be directly linked to an increase in system's entropy, which enhances the thermodynamic stability of these materials. Transport properties are computed for the most promising compositions, and their dynamical, mechanical, and thermal stability are addressed. Our results demonstrates that these types of compounds open new avenues, not only to enhance thermoelectric efficiency but also to reduce costs by utilizing more abundant elements and also improving their durability.

Title: Shift current in 2D Janus Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides: the role of excitons
Authors: Yuncheng Mao, Ju Zhou, Myrta Grüning, Claudio Attaccalite
Abstract: We investigate the shift current in two-dimensional (2D) Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The shift current is evaluated using a real-time approach, where the coupling with an external field is described in terms of a dynamical Berry phase. This methodology incorporates electron-hole interactions and quasiparticle band structure renormalization through an effective Hamiltonian derived from many-body perturbation theory. We find that the shift current is strongly enhanced in correspondence with C excitons. An analysis in terms of the electron-hole pairs reveals that electron and hole are localized on different atoms, and thus, following an optical excitation, the center of the electron charge is displaced, giving rise to a significant photocurrent. Janus TMDs, with their intrinsic out-of-plane asymmetry and tunable electronic properties, are particularly appealing for next-generation optoelectronic and energy-harvesting technologies. These results highlight the role of excitons in the shift-current response of Janus TMDs and demonstrate their potential as promising building blocks for future photovoltaic devices.

Title: Residual gauge theory for quanta of surface plasmons
Authors: Ken-ichi Sasaki
Abstract: We develop a gauge-theoretical framework to investigate the quanta of surface plasmons. Our formulation, based on quantum electrodynamics, highlights the importance of residual gauge symmetry. We emphasize that residual gauge symmetry, which imposes constraint equations on physical states, is fundamentally linked to Joule heating. This framework is applied to metals, semiconductors, and quantum Hall states, suggesting the presence of a latent transverse electric mode and that the quanta have the ability to maintain light-matter entanglement.

Title: Local classical correlations between physical electrons in Hubbard systems
Authors: Gabriele Bellomia, Adriano Amaricci, Massimo Capone
Abstract: We demonstrate that the local nonfreeness, an unbiased measure of correlation between electrons at a single lattice site, can be computed as the mutual information between local natural spin orbitals. This leads us to prove a general result: local electron correlations in Hubbard-type models are fully classical since the local reduced density matrix is separable in the natural basis and no quantum correlations beyond entanglement are present. Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes. These results confirm the relation between local classical correlations within an open system and nonlocal entanglement, and they provide a clear path for the study of the relationship between traditional quantum resources and the nonfreeness, in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.

Abstract: Although one-dimensional classical spin chains do not exhibit phase transitions, we found that a phase transition does occur when they are coupled to a cavity photon mode. This provides the simplest exactly solvable examples demonstrating that finite-temperature superradiant phase transitions can emerge from long-range fully connected interactions mediated by photons and interactions within the material.

Title: Altermagnetism-induced non-collinear superconducting diode effect and unidirectional superconducting transport
Authors: F. Yang, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: Current studies of non-reciprocal superconducting (SC) transport have centered on the forward-backward asymmetry of the critical current measured along a single axis. In most realizations, this diode effect is achieved via introducing ferromagnetism or applying an external magnetic field, which drives system into an effective Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state but often at the cost of severely suppressing the SC gap and thus compromising device robustness. Here we propose and theoretically demonstrate that coupling a conventional $s$-wave SC thin film to a $d$-wave altermagnet offers a more resilient alternative. The momentum-dependent spin splitting inherent to altermagnets induces a non-collinear SC-diode effect in the BCS state, with the critical-current anisotropy exhibiting a fourfold ($C_4$) symmetry. Upon entering the FF state at large splitting, this anisotropy gradually evolves into a unidirectional ($C_1$) pattern. Crucially, the FF pairing momentum locks to the discrete crystal axes, eliminating the rotational Goldstone mode and preserving a sizable SC gap without any abrupt or significant suppression. These combined features make the altermagnetic proximity an appealing platform to engineer symmetry-protected, energy-efficient and programmable SC diodes for next-generation electronic devices.

Title: Scaling behavior of superconductors
Authors: V.R. Shaginyan, A.Z. Msezane, S.A. Artamonov
Abstract: In our brief review, we will consider the general universal scaling properties of superconductors. The physics of superconductors, represented by both conventional and unconventional superconductors, has been the main topic of high-$T_c$ superconductor physics for over thirty years, revealing some of the properties of high-$T_c$ (or unconventional) superconductors. Scaling relationships lead to the identification of fundamental laws of nature and reveal the essence of superconductor physics. Advances in experimental technology allow us to collect important data, which in turn allow us to make definitive statements about the physical processes underlying strongly correlated Fermi systems. Basing on this observation, we analyze experimental facts that reveal the general scaling properties of both high-$T_c$ and ordinary superconductors, and theoretically explain that the Homes' law $\rho_{s0}= (1/2\pi\lambda_D)^2= T_c\sigma(T_c)$ is applicable to the both types of superconductors. Here $\rho_{s0}$ is the superconducting electron density, $\lambda_D$ is the zero-$T$ penetration depth, $\sigma$ is the normal state conductivity, $T$ is temperature and $T_c$ is the temperature of superconducting phase transition. Overall, these scaling relationships lead to the identification of fundamental laws of nature and reveal the essence of superconductor physics. All these observations support the theory of fermion condensation. Our theoretical results agree well with a body of diverse and seemingly unrelated experimental facts. They show that the topological fermion condensation quantum phase transition, generating flat bands, is an intrinsic property of strongly correlated Fermi systems and can be considered as a universal agent explaining their basic physics.

Title: Relation between chiral anomaly and electric transport in $1D$ Dirac semimetal
Authors: Mustafa Bohra, M.A.Zubkov
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of chiral anomaly and dissipation in one - dimensional Dirac semimetal. For definiteness we consider the Su Schrieffer Heeger (SSH) model, which on the language of lattice field theory represents 1 D Wilson fermions. We employ the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function formalism, and calculate the chiral imbalance and electric conductivity in the presence of energy dissipation, revealing how these observables are connected to the chiral anomaly. By systematically incorporating dissipation effects into the Keldysh framework, we demonstrate how the anomaly-induced contributions manifest in both axial charge density and electric current.

Title: Electronic modes induced by spin and charge perturbations in Mott and Kondo insulators
Authors: Masanori Kohno
Abstract: Electronic band structures usually remain unaffected by doping via a chemical-potential shift or by increasing the temperature in conventional band insulators. In contrast, it has been shown that those of Mott and Kondo insulators can be altered by doping or by increasing the temperature: electronic modes are induced within the band gap, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion relations from the band edges. Here, this study demonstrates that the underlying mechanism of the remarkable strong-correlation effects can be generalized to the emergence of electronic modes caused by various spin and charge perturbations, including magnetization of spin-gapped Mott and Kondo insulators. These emergent modes can alter the band structure if a macroscopic number of spins or charges are excited by the perturbations at a given moment. The origins and dispersion relations of these emergent modes, particularly why and how the dispersion relations depend on the momentum and energy of the perturbations, are elucidated by investigating the selection rules and using the Bethe ansatz and the effective theory for weak inter-unit-cell hopping. The validity and generality of the theoretical results across different models and spatial dimensions are verified by numerical calculations for the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models, periodic Anderson models, Kondo lattice models, and ladder and bilayer Hubbard models. This study provides crucial insights into why and how spin and charge perturbations can alter the band structure in strongly correlated insulators, thereby paving the way for band-structure engineering in strong-correlation electronics, which enables previously unexplored functionalities by exploiting the unconventional characteristics revealed in this paper.

Title: Shape-specific fluctuations of an active colloidal interface
Authors: Arvin Subramaniam, Tirthankar Banerjee, Rajesh Singh
Abstract: Motivated by a recently synthesizable class of active interfaces formed by linked self--propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto--translational coupling. We enumerate all steady--state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic ''C--shaped'' topology, along with persistent self--propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family--Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.5$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super--ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.7$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady--state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings point towards a unique non--equilibrium universality class associated with self--propelled interfaces of non--standard shape.

Title: Dara: Automated multiple-hypothesis phase identification and refinement from powder X-ray diffraction
Authors: Yuxing Fei, Matthew J. McDermott, Christopher L. Rom, Shilong Wang, Gerbrand Ceder
Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a foundational technique for characterizing crystalline materials. However, the reliable interpretation of XRD patterns, particularly in multiphase systems, remains a manual and expertise-demanding task. As a characterization method that only provides structural information, multiple reference phases can often be fit to a single pattern, leading to potential misinterpretation when alternative solutions are overlooked. To ease humans' efforts and address the challenge, we introduce Dara (Data-driven Automated Rietveld Analysis), a framework designed to automate the robust identification and refinement of multiple phases from powder XRD data. Dara performs an exhaustive tree search over all plausible phase combinations within a given chemical space and validates each hypothesis using a robust Rietveld refinement routine (BGMN). Key features include structural database filtering, automatic clustering of isostructural phases during tree expansion, peak-matching-based scoring to identify promising phases for refinement. When ambiguity exists, Dara generates multiple hypothesis which can then be decided between by human experts or with further characteriztion tools. By enhancing the reliability and accuracy of phase identification, Dara enables scalable analysis of realistic complex XRD patterns and provides a foundation for integration into multimodal characterization workflows, moving toward fully self-driving materials discovery.

Title: Engineering Biquadratic Interactions in Spin-1 Chains by Spin-1/2 Spacers
Authors: Yasser Saleem, Weronika Pasek, Marek Korkusinski, Moritz Cygorek, Pawel Potasz
Abstract: Low-dimensional quantum systems host a variety of exotic states, such as symmetry-protected topological ground states in spin-1 Haldane chains. Real-world realizations of such states could serve as practical quantum simulators for quantum phases if the interactions can be controlled. However, many proposed models, such as the AKLT state, require unconventional forms of spin interactions beyond standard Heisenberg terms, which do not naturally emerge from microscopic (Coulomb) interactions. Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to induce a biquadratic term between two spin-1 sites and to tune its strength $\beta$ by placing pairs of spin-1/2 spacers in between them. $\beta$ is controlled by the ratio between Heisenberg couplings to and in between the spacer spins. Increasing this ratio increases the magnitude of $\beta$ and decreases the correlation length of edge states, but at a critical value of the ratio, we observe a quantum phase transition between two spin-liquid phases with hidden antiferromagnetic order. Detailed atomistic calculations reveal that chains of nanographene flakes with 22 and 13 atoms, respectively, which could be realized by state-of-the-art bottom-up growth technology, yield precisely the couplings required to approach the AKLT state. These findings deliver a blueprint for engineering unconventional interactions in bottom-up synthesized quantum simulators.

Title: The Geometric Origin of Time's Arrow: Loschmidt Resolved
Authors: Ira Wolfson
Abstract: We resolve Loschmidt's paradox-the 150-year-old contradiction between time-reversible microscopic dynamics and irreversible macroscopic evolution. The resolution requires both quantum mechanics and classical chaos; neither alone suffices. Quantum uncertainty without chaos produces slow, polynomial spreading-not fundamentally irreversible. Classical chaos without quantum uncertainty produces computational intractability-trajectories diverge exponentially, yet the system remains on one trajectory, reversible in principle with sufficient precision. Only together do they produce geometric impossibility: chaos exponentially amplifies irreducible $\hbar$-scale uncertainty until stable manifolds contract below quantum resolution, rendering time-reversed trajectories physically inaccessible despite being mathematically valid and equiprobable. Information is never destroyed-it becomes geometrically inaccessible. The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate is identical in both time directions, preserving microscopic symmetry while explaining macroscopic irreversibility. Three decades of Loschmidt echo experiments confirm perturbation-independent decay consistent with geometric inaccessibility. The framework unifies thermodynamic, quantum, and information-theoretic arrows of time.

Abstract: Understanding electrochemical phenomena at complex liquid solid interfaces requires linking real time structural dynamics with atomic scale interfacial chemistry. Here, we integrate operando synchrotron X-ray fluorescence and diffraction with high resolution cryogenic electron and ion multi model microscopy to provide a mechanistic understanding of Pt based alloying anodes across length scales. We directly observe the initial lithiation driven formation of Li2Pt and its evolution to a stable LiPt intermetallic phase during extended cycling via a solid solution type reaction mechanism. Simultaneously, the solid electrolyte interphase transitions from an unstable carbonate rich to a stable LiF dominated composition, confirmed by cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Crucially, cryogenic atom probe tomography reveals spatially distinct compositional regimes within the alloy anode, including lithium flux limited, heterogeneous interfacial zone and a diffusion controlled, homogeneous LiPt alloy bulk. This nanoscale compositional gradient rationalises the emergent solid solution reaction mechanism and highlights how kinetic limitations and interface dynamics govern alloy formation and electrochemical stability. Our findings demonstrate a broadly applicable correlative framework bridging operando structural dynamics with near atomic resolution interfacial chemistry, advancing the rational design of durable alloy electrodes for next generation energy storage.

Title: Distinguishing thermal versus quantum annealing using probability-flux signatures across interaction networks
Authors: Yoshiaki Horiike, Yuki Kawaguchi
Abstract: Simulated annealing provides a heuristic solution to combinatorial optimization problems. The cost function of a problem is mapped onto the energy function of a physical many-body system, and, by using thermal or quantum fluctuations, the system explores the state space to find the ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the problem. Studies have highlighted both the similarities and differences between thermal and quantum fluctuations. Nevertheless, fundamental understanding of thermal and quantum annealing remains incomplete, making it unclear how quantum annealing outperforms thermal annealing in which problem instances. Here, we investigate the many-body dynamics of thermal and quantum annealing by examining all possible interaction networks of $\pm J$ Ising spin systems up to seven spins. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that differences between thermal and quantum annealing emerge for particular interaction networks, indicating that the structure of the energy landscape distinguishes the two dynamics. We identify the microscopic origin of these differences through probability fluxes in state space, finding that the two dynamics are broadly similar, but that quantum tunnelling produces qualitative differences. Our results provide insight into how thermal and quantum fluctuations navigate a system toward the ground state in simulated annealing, and are experimentally verifiable in atomic, molecular, and optical systems. Furthermore, these insights may improve mappings of optimization problems to Ising spin systems, yielding more accurate solutions in faster simulated annealing and thus benefiting real-world applications in industry. Our comprehensive survey of interaction networks and visualization of probability flux can help to understand, predict, and control quantum advantage in quantum annealing.

Title: Twisted (co)homology of non-orientable Weyl semimetals
Authors: Thijs Douwes, Marcus Stålhammar
Abstract: The quasi-particle excitations in Weyl semimetals, known as Weyl fermions, are usually forced to emerge in charge-conjugate pairs by the Nielsen--Ninomiya theorem. When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals. Our work exemplifies the vast potential of fundamental mathematical descriptions to not only aid the corresponding physical intuition, but also predict novel and hitherto overlooked phenomena of great relevance throughout the physics research forefront.

Title: Wilson loop invariants and bulk-boundary correspondence in higher-order topological insulators with two anticommuting mirror symmetries
Authors: Suman Aich, Babak Seradjeh (IUB)
Abstract: We investigate the higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence in a family of chiral-symmetric Bloch Hamiltonians with anticommuting mirror symmetries. These models generalize the $\pi$-flux square lattice, the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, and include both separable and nonseparable models with extended and diagonal hopping. For separable systems, the product of subsystem chiral winding numbers correctly predicts the number of zero-energy corner states. However, this invariant fails in nonseparable models, motivating the development of new momentum-space diagnostics. We introduce gauge-independent mirror-filtered winding numbers for Wannier Hamiltonians, constructed by projecting mirror eigenstates onto the occupied subspace. Furthermore, by adapting periodicized Wilson lines from chiral Floquet theory to the case with momentum-dependent chiral operator, we define new invariants associated directly with Wannier gaps. These invariants provide a detailed characterization of Wannier band topology. Our results clarify the interplay between chiral symmetry, mirror symmetries, and Wilson loops in higher-order topological phases and point to open challenges in formulating momentum-space invariants for general nonseparable models.

Title: Heider balance of a square lattice in an external field
Authors: Zdzisław Burda, Maciej Wołoszyn, Krzysztof Malarz, Krzysztof Kułakowski
Abstract: We discuss the Heider model in the presence of an external social field. This field was introduced to break the symmetry between the probabilities of hostile and friendly relationships. We consider the system in the presence of fluctuations generated by thermal noise and present the results of a comparative study of two-dimensional triangular and square networks with periodic boundary conditions. The results were obtained using three different methods: exact calculations for small systems, Monte Carlo simulations of medium-sized systems, and exact calculations in the thermodynamic limit (corresponding to infinite size) of certain limiting cases for which analytical solutions are possible. In particular, we exploit the recently discovered equivalence between structurally balanced systems and the Ising model to derive an exact form of the edge magnetization susceptibility for systems in Heider equilibrium.

Title: Highly Anisotropic Charge Dynamics and Spectral Weight Redistribution in the Trilayer Nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$
Authors: Zhe Liu, Jie Li, Deyuan Hu, Bingke Ji, Haoran Zhang, Jiahao Hao, Yaomin Dai, Qing Li, Mengjun Ou, Bing Xu, Yi Lu, Meng Wang, Hai-Hu Wen
Abstract: We study the $ab$-plane and $c$-axis charge dynamics of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using optical spectroscopy. While a pronounced Drude profile, i.e. metallic response, is observed in the $ab$-plane optical conductivity $\sigma_{1}^{ab}(\omega)$, the $c$-axis optical spectra $\sigma_{1}^{c}(\omega)$ exhibit semiconducting behavior. The zero-frequency extrapolation of the optical conductivity $\sigma_{1}(\omega \rightarrow 0) \equiv 1/\rho_{\text{dc}}$ gives a resistivity anisotropy of $\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} \simeq 366$ at 300~K for La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, which is much larger than the values in iron-based superconductors but comparable to those in high-$T_{c}$ cuprates. The interband response is also highly anisotropic, showing salient orbital selectivity for light polarized in the $ab$ plane and along the $c$ axis. The interband-transition peaks in both $\sigma_{1}^{ab}(\omega)$ and $\sigma_{1}^{c}(\omega)$ are located at lower energies compared to density-functional-theory predictions, signifying considerable electronic correlations. By investigating the spectral weight transfer, we find that in the pristine phase, Coulomb correlations have a marked impact on the charge dynamics of \LNO, whereas in the density-wave state, a gap opens with the Ni-$d_{z^{2}}$ orbital being involved.

Title: Anomaly inflow and $p$-form gauge theories
Authors: Chang-Tse Hsieh, Yuji Tachikawa, Kazuya Yonekura
Abstract: Chiral and non-chiral $p$-form gauge fields have gravitational anomalies and anomalies of Green-Schwarz type. This means that they are most naturally realized as the boundary modes of bulk topological phases in one higher dimensions. We give a systematic description of the total bulk-boundary system which is analogous to the realization of a chiral fermion on the boundary of a massive fermion. The anomaly of the boundary theory is given by the partition function of the bulk theory, which we explicitly compute in terms of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer $\eta$-invariant. We use our formalism to determine the $\mathrm{SL}(2,{\mathbb Z})$ anomaly of the 4d Maxwell theory. We also apply it to study the worldvolume theories of a single D-brane and an M5-brane in the presence of orientifolds, orbifolds, and S-folds in string, M, and F theories. In an appendix we also describe a simple class of non-unitary invertible topological theories whose partition function is not a bordism invariant, illustrating the necessity of the unitarity condition in the cobordism classification of the invertible phases.

Title: Enhancement of quantum annealing via n-local catalysts
Authors: Roopayan Ghosh, Luca A. Nutricati, Natasha Feinstein, P. A. Warburton, Sougato Bose
Abstract: The potential quantum speedup in solving optimization problems via adiabatic quantum annealing is often hindered by the closing of the energy gap during the anneal, especially when this gap scales exponentially with system size. In this work, we alleviate this bottleneck by demonstrating that for the NP-complete Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, an informed choice of $n-$local catalysts (operators involving $n$ qubits) can re-open the gap during the annealing process. By analyzing first-order phase transitions in toy instances of the MWIS problem, we first identify direct-tunneling catalysts that effectively eliminate the transition and provide an analytical discussion on when the sign of the catalyst influences its impact. We then reveal that $n-$local catalysts exponentially improve gap scaling and in certain scenarios are as effective as direct tunnel coupling between two minima. Utilizing this understanding, we show that they also increase the efficiency of ground state preparation via adiabatic quantum annealing in random graphs and analytically demonstrate the necessity of their placement across unfrustrated loops in the graph for effective performance in MWIS problems. Additionally, using a circuit implementation of the $n$-local catalyst (requiring $2n$ nearest-neighbour gates), we demonstrate that both the circuit depth and the total number of gates required to solve the problem are reduced by several orders of magnitude when compared to the discrete-time version of traditional quantum annealing using local drivers. Our analysis suggests that non-local quantum fluctuations entangling multiple qubits as a catalyst are key to achieving the desired quantum advantage.

Title: D-commuting SYK model: building quantum chaos from integrable blocks
Authors: Ping Gao, Han Lin, Cheng Peng
Abstract: We construct a new family of quantum chaotic models by combining multiple copies of integrable commuting SYK models. As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal. Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity.

Title: Active Quantum Reservoir Engineering: Using a Qubit to Manipulate its Environment
Authors: Marcelo Janovitch, Matteo Brunelli, Patrick P. Potts
Abstract: Quantum reservoir engineering leverages dissipative processes to achieve desired behavior, with applications ranging from entanglement generation to quantum error correction. Therein, a structured environment acts as an entropy sink for the system and no time-dependent control over the system is required. We develop a theoretical framework for active reservoir engineering, where time-dependent control over a quantum system is used to manipulate its environment. In this case, the system may act as an entropy sink for the environment. Our framwork captures the dynamical interplay between system and environment, and provides an intuitive picture of how finite-size effects and system-environment correlations allow for manipulating the environment by repeated initialization of the quantum system. We illustrate our results with two examples: a superconducting qubit coupled to an environment of two-level systems and a semiconducting quantum dot coupled to nuclear spins. In both scenarios, we find qualitative agreement with previous experimental results, illustrating how active control can unlock new functionalities in open quantum systems.

Title: Numerical extraction of crosscap coefficients in microscopic models for (2+1)D conformal field theory
Authors: Jia-Ming Dong, Yueshui Zhang, Kai-Wen Huang, Hong-Hao Tu, Ying-Hai Wu
Abstract: Conformal field theory (CFT) can be placed on disparate space-time manifolds to facilitate investigations of their properties. For (2+1)-dimensional [(2+1)D] theories, one useful choice is the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^3$ obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary sphere of a three-dimensional ball. One-point functions of scalar primary fields on this manifold generally do not vanish and encode the so-called crosscap coefficients. These coefficients also manifest on the sphere as the overlaps between certain crosscap states and CFT primary states. Taking the (2+1)D Ising CFT as a concrete example, we demonstrate that crosscap coefficients can be extracted from microscopic models. We construct crosscap states in both lattice models defined on polyhedrons and continuum models in Landau levels, where the degrees of freedom at antipodal points are entangled in Bell-type states. By computing their overlaps with the eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonians, we obtain results consistent with those from conformal bootstrap. Importantly, our approach directly reveals the absolute values of crosscap overlaps, whereas bootstrap calculations typically yield only their ratios. Furthermore, we investigate the finite-size scaling of these overlaps and their evolution under perturbations away from criticality.

Title: Deconfined quantum criticality on a triangular Rydberg array
Authors: Lisa Bombieri, Torsten V. Zache, Gabriele Calliari, Mikhail D. Lukin, Hannes Pichler, Daniel González-Cuadra
Abstract: Fluctuations can drive continuous phase transitions between two distinct ordered phases -- so-called deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) -- which lie beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. Despite several theoretical predictions over the past decades, experimental evidence of DQCPs remains elusive. We show that a DQCP can be explored in a system of Rydberg atoms arranged on a triangular lattice and coupled through van der Waals interactions. Specifically, we investigate the nature of the phase transition between two ordered phases at 1/3 and 2/3 Rydberg excitation density, which were recently probed experimentally in [P. Scholl et al., Nature 595, 233 (2021)]. Using a field-theoretical analysis, we predict both the critical exponents for infinitely long cylinders of increasing circumference and the emergence of a conformal field theory near criticality showing an enlarged U(1) symmetry -- a signature of DQCPs -- and confirm these predictions numerically. Finally, we extend these results to ladder geometries and show how the emergent U(1) symmetry could be probed experimentally using finite tweezer arrays.

Title: Nanometer-precision tracking of adipocyte dynamics via single lipid droplet whispering-gallery optical resonances
Authors: Rok Podlipec, Ana Krišelj, Maja Zorc, Petra Matjan Štefin, Siegfried Usaar, Matjaž Humar
Abstract: Biophotonics - and more recently, biointegrated photonics - offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators - optical microcavities formed in spherical structures - have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.

Title: Frequency domain laser ultrasound for inertial confinement fusion target wall thickness measurements
Authors: Martin Ryzy, Guqi Yan, Clemens Grünsteidl, Georg Watzl, Kevin Sequoia, Pavel Lapa, Haibo Huang
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.

Title: Training-Free Active Learning Framework in Materials Science with Large Language Models
Authors: Hongchen Wang, Rafael Espinosa Castañeda, Jay R. Werber, Yao Fehlis, Edward Kim, Jason Hattrick-Simpers
Abstract: Active learning (AL) accelerates scientific discovery by prioritizing the most informative experiments, but traditional machine learning (ML) models used in AL suffer from cold-start limitations and domain-specific feature engineering, restricting their generalizability. Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches. These results demonstrate that LLM-AL can serve as a generalizable alternative to conventional AL pipelines for more efficient and interpretable experiment selection and potential LLM-driven autonomous discovery.

Title: Dynamic Modulation of Long Range Photon Magnon Coupling
Authors: Alban Joseph, Mawgan A. Smith, Martin P. Weides, Rair Macêdo
Abstract: Evidence of non-hermitian behavior has been recently demonstrated in cavity magnonics, including the emergence of mode level attraction and exceptional points in spectroscopic measurements. This work demonstrates experimental evidence of time-domain dynamics of magnon-photon systems that are coupled through a long-range interaction (i.e. remote coupling) exhibiting level attraction mediated by an auxiliary mode. We directly observe the temporal evolution of dissipatively coupled cavity-magnon modes, where heavily damped transmission line modes mediate the interaction. Our frequency-domain measurements confirm the predicted level attraction, while time-domain ring-down measurements reveal the characteristic signatures of dissipative coupling dynamics. Our approach offers in situ tunability over the dissipative coupling strength, including complete suppression, without requiring physical modifications to the experimental setup, providing a versatile platform for exploring tunable, non-Hermitian physics.

Title: Real-Time Coupled Electron-Nuclear Dynamics of Chemical Bond Formation: Hydrogen Scattering from a Semiconductor Surface
Authors: Jialong Shi, Lingjun Zhu, Florian Nitz, Oliver Bünermann, Alec M. Wodtke, Hua Guo, Bin Jiang
Abstract: A first-principles coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation based on real-time, time-dependent density functional theory and Ehrenfest dynamics quantitatively repro-duces bimodal translational energy loss and angular distributions observed in experiment for hydrogen atom scattering from Ge(111)-c(2*8). The theory elucidates a site-selective mechanism of electronically nonadiabatic energy transfer associated with the formation of different Ge-H bonds. When a hydrogen atom approaches a Ge rest-atom, it is strongly accelerated toward the potential minimum forming a transient Ge-H bond and then re-flected by the repulsive wall. This transient bond formation triggers an ultrafast electron transfer event from the rest-atom to an adjacent Ge-adatom, involving several crossings between valence and conduction bands of the substrate. Electronic equilibration is impos-sible within such a short time (Born-Oppenheimer failure) allowing the H-atom kinetic energy to be converted to inter-band electronic excitation of the substrate. H-atom colli-sions at other Ge atoms also form a transient bond but exhibit no electronic excitation, resulting in distinctly less efficient energy loss in scattered H-atoms. The nucle-ar-to-electronic energy transfer observed in this system reflects the electronic dynamics of covalent bond formation at a semiconductor surface, a mechanism that is quite distinct from previously identified nonadiabatic energy transfer mechanisms at metal surfaces mediated by electronic friction or transient negative ions.

Title: Polylogarithmic-Depth Quantum Algorithm for Simulating the Extended Hubbard Model on a Two-Dimensional Lattice Using the Fast Multipole Method
Authors: Yu Wang, Martina Nibbi, Maxine Luo, Isabel Nha Minh Le, Yanbin Chen, J. Ignacio Cirac, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: The extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional lattice captures key physical phenomena, but is challenging to simulate due to the presence of long-range interactions. In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.
