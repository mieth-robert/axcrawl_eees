Title: Static and dynamic ordering of magnetic repelling particles under confinement: disks vs bars
Authors: M. Aguilar-González, L. F. Elizondo-Aguilera, Y.D. Sobral, F. Pacheco-Vázquez
Abstract: We explored experimentally the self-organization at rest and the compression dynamics of a two-dimensional array of magnetic repelling particles, using two particle geometries, namely, disks and rectangular bars. Despite the non-contact interaction, typical static features of granular materials are observed for both particle shapes: pile formation with an angle of repose and pressure saturation (Janssen-like effect), which can be explained by considering the magnetically-induced torques that generate friction between particles and confining walls. Particle shape effects are mainly observed during compression: while disks rearrange increasing the hexagonal ordering, bars augment their orientational ordering forming larger non-contact force chains; however, in both cases, the resistance to compression rises continuously, in contrast with the fluctuating compression dynamics (stick-slip motion or periodic oscillations) that characterizes granular systems with inter-particle contacts. The continuous response to compression, and the reduction of particle wear due to non-contact interactions, are desirable features in designing magnetic granular dampers.

Title: Exploring global landscape of free energy for the coupled Cahn-Hilliard equations
Authors: Keiichiro Kagawa, Takeshi Watanabe, Yasumasa Nishiura
Abstract: Describing the complex landscape of infinite-dimensional free energy is generally a challenging problem. This difficulty arises from the existence of numerous minimizers and, consequently, a vast number of saddle points. These factors make it challenging to predict the location of desired configurations or to forecast the trajectories and pathways leading from an initial condition to the final state. In contrast, experimental observations demonstrate that specific morphologies can be reproducibly obtained in high yield under controlled conditions, even amidst noise. This study investigates the possibility of elucidating the global structure of the free energy landscape and enabling the control of orbits toward desired minimizers without relying on exhaustive brute-force methods. Furthermore, it seeks to mathematically explain the efficacy of certain experimental setups in achieving high-yield outcomes. Focusing on the phase separation of two polymers in a solvent, we conduct a one-dimensional analysis that reveals the global free energy landscape and relaxation-parameter-dependent trajectory behaviors. Two key methodologies are developed: one is a saddle point search method, akin to bifurcation tracking. This method aims to comprehensively identify all saddle points. The other is a strategy that adjusts the relaxation parameters preceding each variable's time derivative, aligning with experimental setups. This approach enables control over trajectory behaviors toward desired structures, overcoming the limitations of steepest descent methods. By tuning these relaxation parameters, uncertainties in trajectory behavior due to inevitable fluctuations can be suppressed. These methodologies collectively offer a mathematical framework that mirrors experimental high-yield phenomena, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

Title: Gigantic dynamical spreading and anomalous diffusion of jerky active particles
Authors: Hartmut Löwen
Abstract: Jerky active particles are Brownian self-propelled particles which are dominated by ``jerk'', the change in acceleration. They represent a generalization of inertial active particles. In order to describe jerky active particles, a linear jerk equation of motion which involves a third-order derivative in time, Stokes friction and a spring force is combined with activity modeled by an active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This equation of motion is solved analytically and the associated mean-square displacement (MSD) is extracted as a function of time. For small damping and small spring constants, the MSD shows an enormous superballistic spreading with different scaling regimes characterized by anomalous high dynamical exponents 6, 5, 4 or 3 arising from a competition between jerk, inertia and activity. When exposed to a harmonic potential, the gigantic spreading tendency induced by jerk gives rise to an enormous increase of the kinetic temperature and even to a sharp localization-delocalization transition, i.e. a jerky particle can escape from harmonic confinement. The transition can be either first or second order as a function of jerkiness. Finally it is shown that self-propelled jerky particles governed by the basic equation of motion can be realized experimentally both in feedback-controlled macroscopic particles and in active colloids governed by friction with memory.

Title: Sensing the binding and unbinding of anyons at impurities
Authors: Glenn Wagner, Titus Neupert
Abstract: Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional charge and statistics that arise in strongly correlated two-dimensional systems such as the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect and fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Interactions between anyons can lead to emergent phenomena, such as anyon superconductivity as well as anyon condensation which allows for a hierarchical construction of quantum Hall states. In this work, we study how quasihole anyons in a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin fractional quantum Hall state can be bound together by a sufficiently strong attractive impurity potential. The competition between the repulsive interaction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction between the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers of quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating while remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes bound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states experimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton spectroscopy. While the impurities in traditional platforms such as GaAs heterostructures are typically too weak to observe the binding of anyons, the recently discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ offer a platform which may realize the strong-impurity regime.

Title: Anyon-trions in atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures
Authors: Nader Mostaan, Nathan Goldman, Ataç İmamoğlu, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.

Title: Addressing the Infinite Variance Problem in Fermionic Monte Carlo Simulations: Retrospective Error Remediation and the Exact Bridge Link Method
Authors: Zhou-Quan Wan, Shiwei Zhang
Abstract: We revisit the infinite variance problem in fermionic Monte Carlo simulations, which is widely encountered in areas ranging from condensed matter to nuclear and high-energy physics. The different algorithms, which we broadly refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory, and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem, with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of fundamental fermion simulations.

Title: Thermodynamic Geometric Constraint on the Spectrum of Markov Rate Matrices
Authors: Guo-Hua Xu, Artemy Kolchinsky, Jean-Charles Delvenne, Sosuke Ito
Abstract: The spectrum of Markov generators encodes physical information beyond simple decay and oscillation, which reflects irreversibility and governs the structure of correlation functions. In this work, we prove an ellipse theorem that provides a universal thermodynamic geometric constraint on the spectrum of Markov rate matrices. The theorem states that all eigenvalues lie within a specific ellipse in the complex plane. In particular, the imaginary parts of the spectrum, which indicate oscillatory modes, are bounded by the maximum thermodynamic force associated with individual transitions. This spectral bound further constrains the possible values of correlation functions of two arbitrary observables. Finally, we compare our result with a previously proposed conjecture, which remains an open problem and warrants further investigation.

Title: Structural optimization of lattice-matched Sc0.14Al0.86N/GaN superlattices for photonic applications
Authors: Rajendra Kumar, Govardan Gopakumar, Zain Ul Abdin, Michael J. Manfra, Oana Malis
Abstract: ScxAl1-xN is an emerging III-nitride material known for its high piezoelectric coefficient and ferroelectric properties. Integration of wide-bandgap ScxAl1-xN with GaN is particularly attractive for quantum photonic devices. Achieving low defect complex multilayers incorporating ScxAl1-xN, though, requires precise lattice-matching and carefully optimized growth parameters. This study systematically investigates the molecular-beam epitaxy of short-period ScxAl1-xN/GaN superlattices with total thicknesses of up to 600 nm on GaN templates. X-ray diffraction reciprocal space mapping confirmed lattice-matching at x = 0.14 Sc composition regardless of the thickness of GaN interlayers, as evidenced by symmetric superlattice satellites aligned in-plane with the underlying substrate peak. Superlattices with Sc compositions deviating from this lattice-matching condition exhibited strain-induced defects ranging from crack formation to partial relaxation. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigation of the ScxAl1-xN/GaN interfaces identified temperature-dependent intermixing as a major factor in setting the nitride composition variation and implicitly band structure profile along the growth direction. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy also revealed that Sc incorporation exhibits delays relative to Al at both onset and termination. Optimal growth conditions were observed at approximately 600°C and 550°C for superlattices with thick GaN layers (6 nm), and ultra-thin GaN layers (< 2 nm), respectively.

Title: Universal scaling of microwave dissipation in superconducting circuits
Authors: Thibault Charpentier, Anton Khvalyuk, Lev Ioffe, Mikhail Feigel'man, Nicolas Roch, Benjamin Sacépé
Abstract: Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings define a fundamental limit to coherence set by intrinsic material properties and provide a predictive framework for selecting materials and the design of next-generation superconducting quantum circuits.

Title: Contact Forces in Motility-Regulated Active Matter
Authors: Quan Manh Nguyen, Alberto Dinelli, Gianmarco Spera, Julien Tailleur
Abstract: Long-range interactions are ubiquitous in nature, where they are mediated by diffusive fields at the cellular scale or by visual cues for groups of animals. Short-range forces, which are paradigmatic in physics, can thus often be neglected when modeling the collective behaviors of biological systems induced by mediated interactions. However, when self-organization leads to the emergence of dense phases, we show that excluded-volume interactions play an important and versatile role. We consider assemblies of active particles that undergo either condensation or phase-separation due to motility regulation and show that short-range repulsive forces can induce opposite effects. When motility regulation triggers an absorbing phase transition, such as a chemotactic collapse, repulsive forces opposes the formation of condensates and stabilize the coexistence between finite-density phases. In contrast, when motility regulation induces liquid-gas coexistence, repulsive forces can, counterintuitively, lead to a significant increase in the liquid density.

Title: Anisotropic magnetism of polymorphic ErAl3
Authors: Karolina Gornicka, Brenden R. Ortiz, Andrew D. Christianson, Andrew F. May
Abstract: ErAl$_3$ can form in either a trigonal ($\alpha$) or cubic ($\beta$) polymorph and this paper investigates the physical properties of these polymorphs through characterizations of single crystals grown in an aluminum flux. We demonstrate that polymorph selection can be achieved based on the nominal composition of the crystal growth. Magnetic measurements confirm that both $\beta$-ErAl$_3$ and $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ order antiferromagnetically at low temperatures. $\beta$-ErAl$_3$ undergoes AFM ordering at a Néel temperature T$_N$ = 5.1 K, and the transition is suppressed continually with applied field. $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ displays more complex behavior, with successive magnetic transitions at T$_N$ = 5.7 K and T$_2$ = 4.6 K for zero field, where heat capacity and dilatometry measurements evidence that these transitions are second- and first-order, respectively. Under magnetic field, strong anisotropy is revealed in $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$, with several step-like metamagnetic transitions observed below T$_2$ for H$\parallel$c. These transitions produce sequential magnetization plateaus near one-half of the apparent saturation magnetization. The electrical resistivity of $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ is strongly coupled to its magnetism. At $T$ = 2 K, we observe a positive magnetoresistance reaching 60\%, with distinct anomalies at the metamagnetic transitions. The results are summarized in $H$- $T$ phase diagrams that demonstrate complex magnetic behavior for $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$, suggesting an important role of competing interactions in this metallic system that possesses characteristics of Ising physics.

Title: Counterflow leads to roton spectra in locally interacting superfluids
Authors: Samuel Alperin, Eddy Timmermans
Abstract: The dynamics of strongly interacting quantum fluids such as Helium II are fundamentally distinct from those of dilute, contact-interacting atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Most dramatically, superfluids with finite-range interactions can support excitations with a roton-like dispersion, exhibiting a minimum at finite wavenumber. Here we introduce a mechanism through which roton spectra can emerge in superfluids without any nonlocal interactions, instead resulting from the collective excitations of two counterflowing, zero-range interacting condensates. As our mechanism relies only on the nonlinear dynamics of classical fields, this work opens the door to the realization of roton dynamics in the broad class of physical systems governed by coupled nonlinear-Schrödinger equations.

Title: Electrostatically Assembled Open Square and Checkerboard Superlattices
Authors: Binay P. Nayak, Wenjie Wang, Honghu Zhang, Benjamin M. Ocko, Alex Travesset, Surya K. Mallapragada, David Vaknin
Abstract: Programmable assembly of nanoparticles into structures other than hexagonal lattices remains challenging. Assembling an open checkerboard or square lattice is harder to achieve compared to a close-packed hexagonal structure. Here, we introduce a unified, robust approach to assemble nanoparticles into a diverse family of two-dimensional superlattices at the liquid-air interface. Gold nanoparticles are grafted with pH-responsive, water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminating in -COOH or -NH2 end groups, enabling control over interparticle interactions, while the grafted polymer's molecular weight dictates its conformation. This combined control crystallizes checkerboard, simple-square, and body-centered honeycomb superlattices. We find that even for identical nanoparticle core sizes, the polymer's molecular weight dictates superlattice symmetry and stability. Furthermore, tuning pH induces structural transitions between different lattice types. This method opens new avenues for the programmable fabrication of colloidal superstructures with tailored architectures.

Title: Surprisingly High Redundancy in Electronic Structure Data
Authors: Sazzad Hossain, Ponkrshnan Thiagarajan, Shashank Pathrudkar, Stephanie Taylor, Abhijeet S. Gangan, Amartya S. Banerjee, Susanta Ghosh
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models for electronic structure rely on large datasets generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory simulations. This study reveals a surprisingly high level of redundancy in such datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and complex alloys. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that large, exhaustive datasets are necessary for accurate ML predictions of electronic structure. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy, while a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data and reducing training time by threefold or more. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate seemingly redundant data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors, possibly due to the significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high degree of redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.

Title: On failure mechanisms and load-parallel cracking in confined elastomeric layers
Authors: Aarosh Dahal, Aditya Kumar
Abstract: Thin layers of elastomers bonded to two rigid plates demonstrate unusual failure response. Historically, it has been believed that strongly-bonded layers fail by two distinct mechanisms: (i) internal/external penny-shaped crack nucleation and propagation, and (ii) cavitation, that is, cavity growth leading to fibrillation and then failure. However, recent work has demonstrated that cavitation itself is predominantly a fracture process. While the equations describing cavitation from a macroscopic or top-down view are now known and validated with experiments, several aspects of the cavitation crack growth need to be better understood. Notably, cavitation often involves through-thickness crack growth parallel to the loading direction, raising questions about when it initiates instead of the more typical penny-shaped cracks perpendicular to the load. Understanding and controlling the two vertical and horizontal crack growth is key to developing tougher soft films and adhesives. The purpose of this Letter is to provide an explanation for the load-parallel crack growth through a comprehensive numerical analysis and highlight the role of various material and geometrical parameters.

Title: Molecular Arrangements in the First Monolayer of Cu-Phthalocyanine on In$_2$O$_3$(111)
Authors: Matthias Blatnik, Fabio Calcinelli, Andreas Jeindl, Moritz Eder, Michael Schmid, Jan Čechal, Ulrike Diebold, Peter Jacobson Oliver T. Hofmann, Margareta Wagner
Abstract: Well-ordered organic molecular layers on oxide surfaces are key for organic electronics. Using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) we probe the structures of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) on In$_2$O$_3$, a model for a prototypical transparent conductive oxide (TCO). These scanning-probe images allow the direct determination of the adsorption site and distortions of the molecules, which are corroborated by DFT calculations. Isolated CuPc molecules adsorb in a flat, slightly tilted geometry in three symmetry-equivalent configurations on the stoichiometric In$_2$O$_3$(111) surface. Increasing the coverage leads to densely-packed 1D chains oriented along $\langle1\bar{1}0\rangle$ directions, which dissolve into a highly ordered (2$\times$2) superstructure upon increasing the CuPc density to 3/4 per surface unit cell. At a coverage of one CuPc per surface unit cell, a densely packed (1$\times$1) superstructure fully covers the surface. The molecules still assume the same site and orientation as before, but they partially overlap to accommodate the high packing density, leading to a bending of the molecules. These results are compared to the behavior of CoPc on In$_2$O$_3$(111). In summary, we demonstrate that a uniform first layer of metal-phthalocyanine molecules can be realized on the In$_2$O$_3$(111) surface when using the proper metal atom in the molecule.

Title: Large non-saturating Nernst thermopower and magnetoresistance in compensated semimetal ScSb
Authors: Antu Laha, Sarah Paone, Niraj Aryal, Qiang Li
Abstract: Today, high-performance thermoelectric and thermomagnetic materials operating in the low-temperature regime, particularly below the boiling point of liquid nitrogen remain scarce. Most thermomagnetic materials reported to date exhibit a strong Nernst signal along specific crystallographic directions in their single-crystal form. However, their performance typically degrades significantly in the polycrystalline form. Here, we report an improved Nernst thermopower of $\sim$ 128 $\mu$V/K at 30 K and 14 T in polycrystalline compensated semimetal ScSb, in comparison to that was observed in single crystal ScSb previously. The magnetic field dependence of Nernst thermopower shows a linear and non-saturating behavior up to 14 T. The maximum Nernst power factor reaches to $\sim 240 \times 10^{-4}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ and Nernst figure of merit reaches to $\sim 11 \times 10^{-4}$ K$^{-1}$. Polycrystalline ScSb also shows a large non-saturating magnetoresistance of $\sim 940 \%$ at 2 K and 14 T. These enhanced properties originate from better electron-hole compensation, as revealed by Hall resistivity measurements. The cubic symmetry and absence of anisotropy in ScSb allow its polycrystalline form to achieve similar enhanced thermomagnetic and electromagnetic performance comparable to that of the single crystal.

Title: Unraveling Magneto-Phononic Coupling and Photoinduced Magnetic Control in Antiferromagnetic Kondo Semimetal CeBi
Authors: Xu-Chen Nie, Chen Zhang, Qi-Yi Wu, Hao Liu, Jie Pang, You-Guo Shi, Zhi-An Xu, Yan-Feng Guo, Ya-Hua Yuan, H. Y. Liu, Yu-Xia Duan, Jian-Qiao Meng
Abstract: We report an ultrafast optical spectroscopy study on the coherent phonon dynamics in the topological semimetal CeBi and its nonmagnetic isostructural compound LaBi, revealing profound insights into their electronic and magnetic interactions. Both materials exhibit prominent $A_{1g}$ longitudinal optical phonons with characteristic anharmonic temperature dependencies. However, in CeBi, the $A_{1g}$ phonon frequency and amplitude show clear anomalies near its antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering temperatures ($T_{N1}$ $\simeq$ 25 K and $T_{N2}$ $\simeq$ 12 K), which unequivocally demonstrate strong magneto-phononic coupling. Crucially, in the AFM state at 4 K, CeBi exhibits a pump fluence threshold of $F_C$ $\approx$ 44 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, above which the rate of phonon softening accelerates and the amplitude increases sharply. This unique threshold, absent in paramagnetic CeBi and LaBi, points to a photoinduced, non-thermal quenching of the AFM order. Our findings establish coherent phonons as highly sensitive probes of intertwined orders in heavy fermion systems, highlighting the transformative potential of ultrafast pulses in dynamically controlling magnetic states in correlated electron materials and paving the way for the manipulation of emergent quantum phases.

Title: Tunneling spin Hall effect induced by unconventional $p$-wave magnetism
Authors: W. Zeng
Abstract: We propose a tunneling spin Hall effect in a normal metal/$p$-wave magnet/superconductor junction. It is found that the Andreev reflection in the normal lead is spin-dependent and exhibits strong asymmetry with respect to the transverse momentum, giving rise to a pure transverse spin Hall current with zero net charge. The transverse spin conductance is analytically derived using the nonequilibrium Green's function approach, revealing that the predicted spin Hall effect is governed by the direction of the Fermi surface splitting in the $p$-wave magnet. A finite transverse spin current with a large spin Hall angle arises when the line connecting the centers of the spin-split Fermi surfaces is perpendicular to the normal direction of the junction, which indicates a highly efficient charge-to-spin conversion, suggesting potential applications in spintronic devices.

Title: Spin current generation driven by skyrmion dynamics under magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves
Authors: Seno Aji, Muhammad Anin Nabail Azhiim, Nur Ika Puji Ayu, Adam Badra Cahaya, Koichi Kusakabe, Muhammad Aziz Majidi
Abstract: We have investigated the spin-current pumped by the skyrmion-host material with the lack of inversion symmetry through the microwave resonance process. The effects of magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves are examined by micromagnetic simulations. Our results reveal two distinct skyrmion phases, designated as SkX type-I and II, which emerge at low ($K_z<0.1$ meV) and high ($K_z>0.1$ meV) magnetic anisotropy constants, respectively, having different characteristics of spin excitations. The SkX type-I exhibits spin dynamics where the resonant frequency of the breathing mode is lying in between the clockwise and counterclockwise gyration modes of Bloch-type skyrmion at a very low anisotropy, and is crossing over the counterclockwise mode at $K_z \sim 0.04$ meV. Meanwhile, the SkX type-II exhibits distinct spin excitations in which the clockwise mode is notably absent, while the counterclockwise modes exist at both low and high resonant frequencies. This suggests that the magnetic anisotropy plays an essential role in the spin dynamics. Furthermore, the resulting spin excitations induce spin currents with exotic features under the polarized microwaves. The spin currents induced, for instance, by low-lying in-plane excitations are strongly enhanced under the left-handed circularly polarized microwaves, but quenched by the right-handed circularly polarized microwaves regardless of the sign of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. These results may pave the way for understanding the non-trivial interplay between magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves in the generation of spin currents by a resonant process.

Title: Influence of thermal noise on the field-driven dynamics of the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn
Authors: Siyuan Qian, Ankit Shukla, Shaloo Rakheja
Abstract: $\mathrm{Mn_3Sn}(0\overline{1}\overline{1}0)[0001]$ experiences a tensile strain when grown epitaxially on $\mathrm{MgO}(110)[001]$, and thus the energy landscape changes from six-fold symmetry to two-fold symmetry. External magnetic field further breaks the symmetry and the \textcolor{black}{resulting energy landscape is sensitive to} the field orientation relative to the easy axis. \textcolor{black}{In the presence of thermal noise,} the relaxation of the magnetic octupole moment in \textcolor{black}{a strained Mn$_3$Sn film} is composed of four distinct escape processes involving the two saddle points and two equilibrium states in the energy landscape. Here, we apply harmonic transition-state theory to derive analytical expressions for the inter-well escape time and octupole moment relaxation time, both influenced by an external symmetry-breaking magnetic field and finite thermal noise in the intermediate-to-high damping regime. The analytical predictions are in strong agreement with comprehensive numerical simulations based on coupled LLG equations. The results presented here are crucial toward realizing Mn$_3$Sn's applications in random number generation and probabilistic computing.

Title: Time arrow in open-boundary one-dimensional stochastic dynamics
Authors: Chi-Lun Lee, Yu-Syuan Lin, Pik-Yin Lai
Abstract: We consider the finite-timestep Brownian dynamics of a single particle confined in one dimension, with a nonuniform temperature profile. In such an open-boundary scenario, one cannot observe any net probability current in the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). On the other hand, the nonequilibrium nature of this system is exhibited through the asymmetry in forward and backward transition probabilities, as is reported in this work through the stochastic simulation analysis and theoretical arguments. The irreversibility becomes prominent nearby the temperature interface. We propose that the observed irreversibility can be accounted for via a virtual-gyration scenario, while the collapse of virtual gyrations upon the one-dimensional coordinate leads to the absence of probability current.

Title: Evidence for magnetoelastic coupling and chiral magnetic ground state in quasi-van der Waals tr-Cr$_{1.22}$Te$_{2}$
Authors: S. M. Hossain, B. Rai, P. R. Baral, O. Zaharko, N. Kumar, A. K. Bera, M. Majumder
Abstract: Trigonal tr-Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_{2}$ is a well-known ferromagnetic material that has recently drawn much attention due to the discovery of zero-field skyrmion state, unusual anomalous Hall effect, topological Hall effect, and topological Nernst effect. This quasi-van der Waals (vdW) layered material with intercalated Cr atoms possesses many peculiar features that depend on the amount of Cr intercalation, although the microscopic magnetic ground state is still elusive. We reveal the structural and magnetic properties of tr-Cr$_{1.22}$Te$_{2}$ by low-temperature x-ray diffraction, magnetization, temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy, and single-crystal neutron diffraction studies. Magnetization measurements under small applied magnetic field indicate two successive magnetic transitions, one from a ferromagnetic (FM) state to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state (T$_\mathrm{C}=197$ K), and second from AFM to a paramagnetic state (T$_\mathrm{N}=211$ K). The FM transition is sharp with a strong presence of magnetoelastic coupling, but is not accompanied by any structural phase transition. The magnetic structure obtained from zero-field single crystal neutron diffraction reveals that the Cr1 and Cr2 moments are ferromagnetically aligned along the c-axis, while the Cr3 and intercalated Cr4 atoms induce an AFM component in the ab-plane leading to an umbrella-like spin structure which possesses a finite spin chirality. The presence of a finite spin chirality is responsible for the observation of the topological Hall effect (THE).

Title: A CLuP algorithm to practically achieve $\sim 0.76$ SK--model ground state free energy
Authors: Mihailo Stojnic
Abstract: We consider algorithmic determination of the $n$-dimensional Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model ground state free energy. It corresponds to a binary maximization of an indefinite quadratic form and under the \emph{worst case} principles of the classical NP complexity theory it is hard to approximate within a $\log(n)^{const.}$ factor. On the other hand, the SK's random nature allows (polynomial) spectral methods to \emph{typically} approach the optimum within a constant factor. Naturally one is left with the fundamental question: can the residual (constant) \emph{computational gap} be erased? Following the success of \emph{Controlled Loosening-up} (CLuP) algorithms in planted models, we here devise a simple practical CLuP-SK algorithmic procedure for (non-planted) SK models. To analyze the \emph{typical} success of the algorithm we associate to it (random) CLuP-SK models. Further connecting to recent random processes studies [94,97], we characterize the models and CLuP-SK algorithm via fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [98]. Moreover, running the algorithm we demonstrate that its performance is in an excellent agrement with theoretical predictions. In particular, already for $n$ on the order of a few thousands CLuP-SK achieves $\sim 0.76$ ground state free energy and remarkably closely approaches theoretical $n\rightarrow\infty$ limit $\approx 0.763$. For all practical purposes, this renders computing SK model's near ground state free energy as a \emph{typically} easy problem.

Title: Microscopic origin of shear bands in 2D amorphous solids from topological defects
Authors: Arabinda Bera, Debjyoti Majumdar, Timothy W. Sirk, Ido Regev, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: The formation of shear bands in amorphous solids such as glasses has remained an open question in our understanding of condensed matter and amorphous materials. Unlike in crystals, well-defined topological defects such as dislocations have been elusive due to the lack of a periodic ordered background at the atomic level. Recently, topological defects have been identified in the displacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids. Recent work has suggested that shear bands in amorphous solids coincide with an alignment of vortex-antivortex dipoles, with alternating topological charge +1/-1. Here we numerically confirm this hypothesis by means of well-controlled simulations in 2D. Surprisingly, we show that a chain of topological defects (TDs) pre-exists the shear band and is visible already in the non-affine displacement field of the elastic regime. This chain is activated into a flow band concomitantly with the disappearance and possibly annihilation of a dipole at a distance from the TDs chain. The possible underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a soliton-like rarefaction pulse remotely activated by dipole annihilation as observed in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates.

Title: Quantum metric-based optical selection rules
Authors: Yongpan Li, Cheng-Cheng Liu
Abstract: The optical selection rules dictate symmetry-allowed/forbidden transitions, playing a decisive role in engineering exciton quantum states and designing optoelectronic devices. While both the real (quantum metric) and imaginary (Berry curvature) parts of quantum geometry contribute to optical transitions, the conventional theory of optical selection rules in solids incorporates only Berry curvature. Here, we propose quantum metric-based optical selection rules. We unveil a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for linear polarization of light and establish valley-contrasted optical selection rules that lock orthogonal linear polarizations to distinct valleys. Tight-binding and first-principles calculations confirm our theory in two models (altermagnet and Kane-Mele) and monolayer $d$-wave altermagnet $\mathrm{V_2SeSO}$. This work provides a quantum metric paradigm for valley-based spintronic and optoelectronic applications.

Authors: Julia Kucharek, Mateusz Raczyński, Rafał Bożek, Anna Kaleta, Bogusława Kurowska, Marta Bilska, Sławomir Kret, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Piotr Kossacki, Mateusz Goryca, Wojciech Pacuski
Abstract: A three-step process was developed for growing high-quality, optically uniform WSe2 monolayers by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with advantage of using hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The process was optimized to maximize the efficiency of photoluminescence and promote formation of hexagonal WSe2 domains. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to estimate the dispersion of WSe2 hexagonal domains orientation. Monolayer character of the film was identified using optical methods and verified with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cross-section. Temperature-and-magnetic-field-dependent studies revealed the behaviour of exciton complexes to be analogical to that of exfoliated counterparts. Direct growth on hBN combined with uniform optical response proves this WSe2 superior to mechanically exfoliated WSe2 in terms of convenience of use and reproducibility. Provided results establish a significant progress in optical quality of epitaxially grown transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) monolayers and fabrication of large-scale functional devices.

Title: Spin-triplet pairing instability in a two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model
Authors: Xing-Can Liu, Yu-Feng Song, Yuan-Yao He, Tao Ying, Xueru Zhang
Abstract: The search for superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetry has been a central focus in the study of strongly correlated electron systems. In this work, we report a numerically exact study of the spin-triplet pairing in a two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, employing Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method. The model includes next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor hopping terms, and maintains spin balance. By tuning the fermion filling close to a type-II van Hove singularity (vHs) in the model, we numerically investigate the ordering tendencies of several possible pairing channels with different symmetries. Our numerical results provide clear evidence for the spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing instability approaching low temperatures, as revealed by the vertex contribution to the pairing susceptibility. This signature becomes increasingly pronounced as the interaction strength increases in the weak to intermediate regime. We further find that, near the type-II vHs, the dominant spin-spin correlations in the system are ferromagnetic, suggesting its close relation to the spin-triplet pairing instability. Our findings offer a reliable approach to realize the spin-triplet $p$-wave superfluidity in the repulsive Hubbard model, from an unbiased numerical perspective.

Title: Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Flat Bands with Paramagnetism
Authors: Yedi Shen, Sanyi You, Zhenhua Qiao, Qian Niu
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall effect has been widely explored in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.

Title: First-principles design for strain-tunable exciton dynamics in 2D materials
Authors: Amir Kleiner, Sivan Refaely-Abramson
Abstract: Controlling exciton motion in two-dimensional semiconductors is key to unlocking new optoelectronic and straintronic functionalities. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), with their tightly bound excitons, offer an ideal platform for such control due to their strong sensitivity to local strain. Here we present an ab initio framework for modeling exciton dynamics in inhomogeneously strained WS2, combining excitonic band structures derived from first principles with a semiclassical transport model operating in both real and momentum space. By analyzing idealized strain patterns, we reveal how excitons undergo drift, diffusion, and confinement without invoking empirical parameters. Our results uncover regimes of super-ballistic propagation and negative effective diffusion, governed entirely by the strain landscape. This work provides microscopic insight into strain-tunable exciton behavior and establishes design principles for engineering exciton flow in two-dimensional materials.

Title: Expansion dynamics of strongly correlated lattice bosons
Authors: Julian Schwingel, Michael Turaev, Johann Kroha, Sayak Ray
Abstract: We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of interacting bosons on a two-dimensional Hubbard lattice in the strongly interacting regime, taking into account the dynamics of condensate amplitude as well as the direct transport of non-condensed fluctuations. To that end we develop a selfconsistent density-matrix approach which goes beyond the standard Gutzwiller mean-field theory. Starting from the Liouville-von-Neumann equation we derive a quantum master equation for the time evolution of the system's local density matrix at each lattice site, with a dynamical bath that represents the rest of the system. We apply this method to the expansion dynamics of an initially prepared cloud of interacting bosons in an optical lattice. We observe a ballistic expansion of the condensate, as expected, followed by slow, diffusive transport of the normal bosons. We discuss, in particular, the robustness of the Mott insulator phase as well as its melting due to incoherent transport. The method should be applicable to various models of lattice bosons in the strongly correlated regime.

Title: Deciphering the Scattering of Polydisperse Hard Spheres using Deep Learning
Authors: Lijie Ding, Chi-Huan Tung, Wei-Ren Chen, Changwoo Do
Abstract: We introduce a deep learning approach for analyzing the scattering function of the polydisperse hard spheres system. We use a variational autoencoder-based neural network to learn the bidirectional mapping between the scattering function and the system parameters including the volume fraction and polydispersity. Such that the trained model serves both as a generator that produce scattering function from the system parameters, and an inferrer that extract system parameters from the scattering function. We first generate a scattering dataset by carrying out molecular dynamics simulation of the polydisperse hard spheres modeled by the truncated-shifted Lennard-Jones model, then analyze the scattering function dataset using singular value decomposition to confirm the feasibility of dimensional compression. Then we split the dataset into training and testing set and train our neural network on the training set only. Our generator model produce scattering function with significant higher accuracy comparing to the traditional Percus-Yevick approximation and $\beta$ correction, and the inferrer model can extract the volume fraction and polydispersity with much higher accuracy than traditional model functions.

Title: Topological in-gap chiral edge states in superconducting Haldane model with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Sajid Sekh, Andrzej Ptok
Abstract: Topological superconductivity is currently one of the prime interests, given the properties of its exotic nature of chiral edge states. A broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is an essential ingredient in the recipe of a chiral edge state. The Haldane model is one of the many factors that can break TRS in a system. Thus, we explore the possibility of topological superconductivity in the Haldane model under the influence of a conventional superconductor. The edge states originating from such recipes mostly remain outside the superconducting gap. Contrary to this, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the edge modes lie within the superconducting gap, and can lead to a gapless state for some range of parameters. Moreover, we use band inversion and projection on the real-space lattice to confirm the topological and chiral nature of the obtained edge states.

Title: Nanoscale friction of manganite superlattice films controlled by layer thickness and fluorine content
Authors: Niklas A. Weber, Miru Lee, Florian Schönewald, Leonard Schüler, Vasily Moshnyaga, Matthias Krüger, Cynthia A. Volkert
Abstract: We investigate nanoscale friction in [LaMnO3]m/[SrMnO3]n superlattice films using lateral force microscopy, focusing on the effects of fluorine doping and top-layer thickness. For all samples, friction forces scale linearly with the sum of the applied normal and adhesion forces. While friction forces vary spatially due to local adhesion fluctuations, the friction coefficient remains position independent for each specimen. It is, however, systematically influenced by fluorine concentration and top-layer thickness. Our data indicates that frictional energy dissipation extends up to 5 nm beneath the surface, demonstrating a clear dependence on subsurface structure. We attribute this to viscoelastic dissipation within the stress field and evanescent waves generated by the sliding tip, which can quantitatively account for the observed friction coefficients. These results show that, once adhesion is properly accounted for, the friction coefficient is a reproducible material property that can be tuned via controlled modifications to surface and subsurface layers.

Title: Lyapunov formulation of band theory for disordered non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Konghao Sun, Haiping Hu
Abstract: Non-Bloch band theory serves as a cornerstone for understanding intriguing non-Hermitian phenomena, such as the skin effect and extreme spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions. Yet this theory hinges on translational symmetry and thus breaks down in disordered systems. Here, we develop a real-space Lyapunov formulation of band theory that governs the spectra and eigenstates of disordered non-Hermitian systems. This framework yields universal non-Hermitian Thouless relations linking spectral density and localization to Lyapunov exponents under different boundary conditions. We further identify an exact topological criterion: skin modes and Anderson-localized modes correspond to nonzero and zero winding numbers, respectively, revealing the topological nature of the skin-Anderson transition. This transition is dictated by an essential Lyapunov exponent and gives rise to novel unidirectional critical states. Our formulation provides a unified and exact description of spectra and localization in generic one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems without translational symmetry, offering new insights into the interplay among non-Hermiticity, disorder, and topology.

Title: Variational Formulation of Local Molecular Field Theory
Authors: David M. Rogers
Abstract: In this note, we show that the Local Molecular Field theory of Weeks et. al. can be re-derived as an extremum problem for an approximate Helmholtz free energy. Using the resulting free energy as a classical, fluid density functional yields an implicit solvent method identical in form to the Molecular Density Functional theory of Borgis et. al., but with an explicit formula for the 'ideal' free energy term. This new expression for the ideal free energy term can be computed from all-atom molecular dynamics of a solvent with only short-range interactions. The key hypothesis required to make the theory valid is that all smooth (and hence long-range) energy functions obey Gaussian statistics. This is essentially a random phase approximation for perturbations from a short-range only, 'reference,' fluid. This single hypothesis is enough to prove that the self-consistent LMF procedure minimizes a novel density functional whose 'ideal' free energy is the molecular system under a specific, reference Hamiltonian, as opposed to the non-interacting gas of conventional density functionals. Implementation of this new functional into existing software should be straightforward and robust.

Title: Rare Events, Many Searchers, and Fast Target Reaching in a Finite Domain
Authors: Elisabetta Ellettari, Giacomo Nasuti, Alberto Bassanoni, Alessandro Vezzani, Raffaella Burioni
Abstract: Finding a target in a complex environment is a fundamental challenge in nature, from chemical reactions to sperm reaching an egg. An effective strategy to reduce the time needed to reach a target is to deploy many searchers, increasing the likelihood that at least one will succeed by using the statistics of rare events. When the underlying stochastic process involves broadly distributed step sizes, rare long jumps dominate the dynamics, making the use of multiple searchers particularly powerful. We investigate the statistics of extreme events for the mean first passage time in a system of $N$ independent walkers moving with jumps distributed according to a power law, where target-reaching is governed by single, large fluctuations. We show that the mean first passage time of the fastest walker scales as $\langle \tau_N \rangle \sim 1/N$, representing a dramatic speed-up compared to classical Brownian search strategies. From this, we derive a scaling law relating the number of walkers required to reach a target within a given time to the size $X$ of the search region. As an application, we model biological fertilization, predicting how the optimal number of spermatozoa scales with uterus size across species. Our predictions match empirical data, suggesting that evolution may have exploited rare-event dynamics and broadly distributed motion to optimize reproductive success. This theory applies broadly to any population of searchers operating within a region of size $X$, providing a universal framework for efficient search in disordered or high-dimensional environments.

Title: Intermediate Interaction Strategies for Collective Behavior
Authors: Y. Kikuchi, M. Iwamoto
Abstract: From bird flocks and fish schools to migrating cell sheets, collective motion is a ubiquitous biological phenomenon that inspires quantitative modeling through self-propelled particle (SPP) frameworks. Conventional SPP models prescribe either distance-based (metric) or rank-based (topological) interactions; however, empirical studies indicate that real groups may blend both types of interaction. Motivated by this graded perception, we introduce a new three-dimensional SPP model in which metric and topological alignments act simultaneously and are weighted by a single tunable mixing parameter called the interaction parameter. Large-scale simulations spanning a wide ranges of interaction parameters and densities revealed rich dynamics. Even when the global order parameter is low, cluster-level analysis with HDBSCAN shows that particles self-organize into several spatially distinct but internally well-aligned sub-flocks, exposing a hidden layer of order. Most importantly, an intermediate balance in which metric and topological cues contribute almost equally maximizes the global order parameter and markedly improves robustness to density variations. Numerical experiments supported by linear stability analysis demonstrate that activating metric and topological interactions in concert bridges the traditional modeling dichotomy and furnishes a more adaptive and resilient framework for collective motion. Therefore, the proposed model therefore provides a versatile platform for exploring mixed-interaction effects in biological and engineered multi-agent systems.

Title: Magnon Correlation Enables Spin Injection, Dephasing, and Transport in Canted Antiferromagnets
Authors: Xiyin Ye, Tao Yu
Abstract: Thermal and electrical injection and transport of magnon spins in magnetic insulators is conventionally understood by the non-equilibrium population of magnons. However, this view is challenged by several recent experiments in noncollinear antiferromagnets, which urge a thorough theoretical investigation at the fundamental level. We find that the magnon spin in antiferromagnets is described by a matrix, so even when the diagonal terms -- spins carried by population -- vanish, the off-diagonal correlations transmit magnon spins. Our quantum theory shows that a net spin-flip of electrons in adjacent conductors creates quantum coherence between magnon states, which transports magnon spins in canted antiferromagnets, even without a definite phase difference between magnon modes in the incoherent process. It reveals that the pumped magnon correlation is not conserved due to an intrinsic spin torque, which causes dephasing and strong spatial spin oscillations during transport; both are enhanced by magnetic fields. Spin transfer to proximity conductors can cause extrinsic dephasing, which suppresses spin oscillations and thereby gates spin transport.

Title: Magnetic control of nonlinear transport induced by the quantum metric
Authors: Xu Chen, Mingbo Dou, Qin Zhang, Xianjie Wang, M. Ye. Zhuravlev, A. V. Nikolaev, L. L. Tao
Abstract: The quantum geometry plays a crucial role in the nonlinear transport of quantum materials. Here, we use the Boltzmann transport formalism to study the magnetic control of nonlinear transport induced by the quantum metric in two-dimensional systems with different types of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It is shown that the nonlinear conductivity is strongly dependent on the direction of a field and reveals significant spatial anisotropy. Moreover, the field-direction dependent relations are distinct for different SOCs. In addition, it is demonstrated that the contributions from the quantum metric and Drude mechanism are distinguishable due to their opposite signs or distinct anisotropy relations. We further derive the analytical formulas for the anisotropic nonlinear conductivity, in exact agreement with numerical results. Our work shines more light on the interplay between the nonlinear transport and quantum geometry.

Title: Perfect Superconducting Diode and Supercurrent Range Controller
Authors: Cliff Sun, Alexey Bezryadin
Abstract: Diodes have a nonreciprocal voltage versus current relationship, produced by breaking the space and time reversal symmetry. However, developing high-end superconducting computers requires a superconducting analogue of the traditional semiconductor diode. Such a superconducting diode exhibits non-reciprocity, or a high asymmetry in its critical currents. We present a model of a perfect superconducting diode based on a superconducting quantum interference device made with multiple superconducting nanowires (MW-SQUID). The superconducting condensate in the nanowires is assumed to obey a linear current-phase relationship (CPR). The diode predicted by our model has a large positive critical current, while the negative critical current can be made exactly zero. Thus achieved 100\% diode efficiency ($\eta = 1$) remains stable against small changes of the magnetic field. Another important result is that under certain and quite broad conditions such devices can act as supercurrent range controllers. In such device a supercurrent can flow with zero voltage applied, but only if the supercurrent is contained in some narrow, adjustable range, which excludes zero current.

Title: Electronic and magnetic ground states of {112} grain boundary in graphene in the extended Hubbard model
Authors: Sishir Jana, Dayasindhu Dey, Manoranjan Kumar, S. Ramasesha, Rajamani Raghunathan
Abstract: We study the ground state phase diagram of the extended Hubbard model in a half-filled 5/7 skewed ladder, which is topologically equivalent to a \{112\} grain boundary in graphene and related systems. Using the mean-field method, we identify various electronic and magnetic phases in the U-V plane, by calculating the site charge and spin densities. The electronic phases include partially charge-ordered metal or insulator, and fully charge-ordered insulator. The different magnetic phases of the model are non-magnet, spin density wave, spin split compensated ferrimagnet or partial antiferromagnet. Analysis of the electronic band structure reveals that the partially charge-ordered compensated ferrimagnetic phase exhibits spin polarisation, which can be quite interesting for spintronics applications. We also compute the polarisation as a function of $U$ using the Berry phase formalism and show that the system exhibits multiferroicity with coexisting compensated ferrimagnetic spin order alongside electronic polarisations.

Title: Magnon-induced transparency of a disordered antiferromagnetic Josephson junction
Authors: A. G. Mal'shukov
Abstract: We considered a planar Josephson junction which is composed of two s-wave superconducting contacts deposited on the top of a thin antiferromagnetic (AFM) disordered metal film. In such a system noticeable Josephson currents may be observed, if contacts are just nanometers away from each other. It is shown that the excitation of AFM by magnons results in a strong enhancement of the stationary current through much longer junctions, whose length may be comparable to the coherence length of superconducting correlations in a nonmagnetic metal. Such a current is calculated at the weak tunneling amplitude of electrons between superconducting contacts and AFM. The problem is considered for nonequilibrium Green functions in the second-order perturbation theory with respect to the electron-magnon interaction. A spin-orbit torque oscillator was taken as a possible source of long-wavelength classic magnetic waves. This work predicts a strong effect of magnons on superconducting proximity effect in AFM, with promising applications in superconducting spintronics.

Title: Unlocking Altermagnetism in Antiferromagnetic 2D Films via Adsorption
Authors: Dong Liu, Sike Zeng, Ji-Hai Liao, Yu-Jun Zhao
Abstract: Altermagnets, characterized by zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin splitting, have recently garnered significant attention due to their potential applications in a variety of fields. Here, we propose a symmetry-engineering strategy to unlock altermagnetism in two dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic systems via surface adsorption of atoms or molecules. By employing spin group theory, we systematically demonstrate that selectively breaking symmetry operations, specifically those protecting spin degeneracy in momentum space, enables the emergence of nonrelativistic spin-split electronic states. Meanwhile, preserving rotation or mirror symmetries connecting opposite sublattices ensures zero net magnetization. Through a comprehensive classification of all symmetry operations across 80 layer groups, we identify 63 antiferromagnetic spin point groups (SPGs) describing 2D materials and further isolate 15 groups that can host altermagnetic characteristics through surface adsorption. Exemplified with monolayer antiferromagnetic VPS_3 and MnPSe_3, we show that oxygen adsorption on VPS_3 and NH_3 adsorption on MnPSe_3 selectively disrupt PT symmetry while retaining the [C2||m] symmetry. This engineered symmetry reduction induces pronounced spin splitting in their band structures without spin-orbit coupling, as confirmed by first-principles calculations. Furthermore, adsorption energy analysis and thermal stability phase diagrams under varying coverage regimes reveal optimal configurations for experimental feasibility. Our work establishes a universal symmetry-engineering framework to expand the family of altermagnetic materials, offering a versatile pathway to tailor spin-split functionalities in two-dimensional antiferromagnets for advanced quantum applications.

Title: Quantum interference among vortex bound states in superconductors
Authors: Yi-Ming Fu, Da Wang, Qiang-Hua Wang
Abstract: In a recent experiment (Hou et al Phys. Rev. X 15, 011027), a new type of necklace-like vortex bound state (VBS) was observed and attributed to disorder induced interference among different Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states within one single vortex. In this work, we further investigate the possibilities of quantum interference among the CdGM states from different vortices in clean superconductors, which may become significant near the upper critical field. We find a series of interference patterns in the local density of states (LDOS) due to the overlap between spatially separated individual CdGM states. On a vortex lattice, the interference can also lead to a necklace-like LDOS, hence, providing an alternative and intrinsic mechanism to observe the novel necklace-like, or other spatially modulated VBS more generally, in experiments. These results can be understood quite well within an effective tight-binding model constructed from the individual CdGM states, and can be checked in future experiments.

Title: Correlating synthesis, structure and thermal stability of CuBi nanowires for spintronic applications by electron microscopy and in situ scattering methods

Abstract: Bi-doped copper (Cu1-xBix) nanowires (NWs), promising candidates for spintronic applications due to their potential for a giant spin Hall effect (SHE), were synthesized and their structural properties and thermal stability were investigated. Using template-assisted electrodeposition, Cu1-xBix nanowires with varying bismuth (Bi) content (x=0, 2, 4, and 7%) and different crystalline domain sizes were fabricated. Structural analysis by advanced electron microscopy and X-ray scattering techniques revealed the influence of synthesis conditions on the resulting NW crystal structure and microstructure, including Bi localization (within the lattice or in the grain boundaries), crystallite domain dimensions, and lattice distortions. While NWs with larger crystalline domains allow homogeneous Bi incorporation into the Cu lattice, NWs with smaller crystalline domains exhibit noticeable Bi accumulation at grain boundaries. The thermal stability of the NWs was examined using variable temperature X-ray diffraction and total scattering. Upon heating, lattice distortions consistent with Bi diffusion out of the Cu lattice were observed, with subsequent crystallization of rhombohedral metallic Bi upon cooling. These findings establish a foundation for optimizing the SHE performance of Cu1-xBix nanowires for spintronic devices by correlating synthesis parameters with microstructural features and thermal behavior.

Title: How to Fix Silver for Plasmonics
Authors: Björn Ewald, Leo Siebigs, Cheng Zhang, Jonas Graf, Achyut Tiwari, Maximilian Rödel, Sebastian Hammer, Vladimir Stepanenko, Frank Würthner, Bruno Gompf, Bert Hecht, Jens Pflaum
Abstract: Silver (Ag) is considered an ideal material for plasmonic applications in the visible wavelength regime due to its superior optical properties, but its use is limited by the poor chemical stability and structural quality of thermally evaporated thin films and resulting nanostructures. In this study, we present a simple approach to enhance the structural and optical quality as well as the chemical stability of Ag thin films by alloying with gold (Au) through thermal co-evaporation. We investigate Ag$_{100-x}$Au$_x$ thin films with Au contents ranging from 5 to 20 at% analyzing their surface morphology, crystallite structure, optical properties, and chemical stability. Our results show that low Au concentrations significantly reduce the roughness of co-evaporated thin films (down to 0.4 nm RMS), and significantly enhance the resistance to oxidation, while maintaining a defined crystallite growth. Importantly, these improvements are achieved without the need for template stripping, metallic wetting layers, or epitaxial substrates, enabling direct deposition on glass. Among the compositions studied, Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ thin films exhibit the highest chemical stability, lowest optical losses in the visible spectral range, and excellent plasmonic properties even outcompeting pure Ag. As a proof-of-concept, we fabricate high-quality Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ optical antennas that exhibit long-term durability under ambient conditions. Our approach provides a practical solution to overcome the limitations of Ag for plasmonic device applications.

Title: Leakage at interfaces: a comprehensive study based on Persson contact mechanics theory
Authors: R. Xu, L. Gil, J. Singer, L. Gontard, W. Leverd, B.N.J. Persson
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of gas leakage at interfaces based on Persson contact mechanics theory. A prototype syringe system consisting of a rubber stopper and a glass barrel is selected, where surface roughness is characterized using measurements from stylus profilometry and atomic force microscopy, and contact pressure distributions are obtained from Finite Element Method (FEM) calculations. Leakage prediction is performed using Multiscale Contact Mechanics (MCM) software. The predicted results show good agreement with experimental measurements under controlled dry conditions. Sensitivity analyses indicate that small variations in elastic modulus and contact pressure can significantly influence leakage, particularly near the percolation threshold. This work provides a generalized and validated framework for leakage prediction and offers practical guidance for the design of sealing systems in pharmaceutical and engineering applications.

Title: Pseudogap in the lightly hole-doped triangular-lattice moiré Hubbard model
Authors: V. I. Kuz'min, M. A. Visotin, S. G. Ovchinnikov
Abstract: The electronic structure of the lightly hole-doped triangular-lattice moiré Hubbard model is studied within cluster perturbation theory (CPT) using 13-site clusters for a fixed doping concentration $p=1/13$ varying the Coulomb parameter $U$ and the hopping phase parameter $\phi$ related to the spin-orbital interaction. We have also developed a rather simple generalized mean-field approximation (GMFA) containing the amplitude of the spin correlations as a free parameter to fit the CPT this http URL evolution of the Fermi surface and the pseudogap with the parameters $\phi$ and $U$ is explained from the viewpoint of the short-range magnetic order. The geometric frustration and the additional model parameter related to the spin-orbital interaction result in a more rich physics of the pseudogap state compared to the case of a more conventional square lattice.

Abstract: The analytical model of a glass-forming system is formulated within the formalism analogous to gauge theory constructions in quantum field theory. This work explores the scope of the proposed approach and investigates the equilibrium behavior of the model under the mean-field approximation. The analysis reveals three possible equilibrium scenarios, only one of which exhibits strong glass-forming ability. Additionally, an upper limit for the initial temperature is identified, beyond which quenching into the glassy state becomes impossible.

Title: Nonequilibrium magnetic dynamics of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model
Authors: Hui Tan, Jianmin Yuan, Yongqiang Li
Abstract: A central challenge in strongly interacting many-body systems is understanding the far-from-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we study the many-body magnetic dynamics of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model by developing a two-component extension of nonequilibrium bosonic dynamical mean-field theory. Using this numerical method, we uncover rich quantum spin dynamics via inter-species interaction quenches. A sudden ramp-up of interactions induces slow thermalization, leading to a long-lived metastable state, whereas quenching to weak interactions results in rapid thermal equilibrium, featuring a two-step relaxation behavior through distinct exponential decays. Furthermore, under periodic modulation of the inter-species interactions, emergent Floquet dynamics drives a transition from a magnetic to an unordered phase.

Title: Vertically Coupled Double Quantum Dots Connected In Parallel
Authors: Shinichi Amaha, Tsuyoshi Hatano, Takashi Nakajima, Seigo Tarucha
Abstract: We report charge transport measurements in a ring-shaped quadruple quantum dot system, composed of two vertically coupled double quantum dots connected in parallel. The vertical coupling introduces an isospin degree of freedom tied to the layer index, and the parallel configuration enables independent access to each quantum dot pair. This design allows us to observe Coulomb diamonds and evaluate the interlayer energy offset. By extending this platform to triangular and hexagonal artificial lattices, we explore correlation effects such as isospin frustration. These results highlight the system's potential for studying interaction-driven quantum phases.

Title: Study of surface roughness modulation on the adhesion behavior of PDMS elastomer
Authors: Susheel Kumar, Krishnacharya Khare, Manjesh K. Singh
Abstract: Adhesion control at the interface of two surfaces is crucial in various applications, including the design of micro- and nanodevices such as microfluidic devices, triboelectric nanogenerators, biochips, and electronic sensors. Several factors influence adhesion, including sample preparation, surface energy, mechanical properties such as modulus of elasticity, and surface texture or roughness. This study specifically investigates the effect of surface roughness on the adhesion behavior of the elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), focusing on a complementary interface with identical roughness. To create surface roughness, sandpapers with grit sizes ranging from N = 120 to N = 2000 were used during the molding process. The surface roughness of the PDMS elastomer was then characterized using a stylus profilometer. Interfacial adhesion was evaluated through wedge test experiments, which enabled the analysis of the relationship between surface roughness, work of adhesion, and equilibrium crack length. Furthermore, the study also explores the correlation between the real area of contact and the work of adhesion.

Title: Quantum Hall-like effect for neutral particles with magnetic dipole moments in a quantum dot
Authors: Carlos Magno O. Pereira, Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: We predict a new class of quantum Hall phenomena in completely neutral systems, demonstrating that the interplay between radial electric fields and dipole moments induces exact $e^2/h$ quantization without the need for Landau levels or external magnetic fields. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our theory reveals that: (i) the singularity of line charges does not destroy topological protection, (ii) spin-control of quantization emerges from boundary conditions alone, and (iii) the effect persists up to 25 K, surpassing typical neutral systems. These findings establish electric field engineering as a viable route to topological matter beyond magnetic paradigms.

Title: On-the-fly machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD to design new routes from glassy carbon to quenchable amorphous diamond with low pressure and temperature
Authors: Meng-Qi Cheng, Wei-Dong Luo, Hong Sun
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have enabled large-scale atomic simulations with first-principles accuracy, allowing precise modeling of disordered materials such as glassy carbon (GC). However, conventional ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) cannot effectively capture anisotropic stress effects, which are believed to play a key role in the transformation of GC into amorphous diamond under extreme conditions. In this work, we present an on-the-fly machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD (ML-augmented CAIMD) approach by modifying VASP 6.3.2. Our simulations not only reproduce major experimental features of GC but also provide restrictive synthesis conditions and microscopic insights. We show that GC exhibits unexpectedly high plasticity, with its compressive and shear strengths enhanced by large strains. Under pressure, increasing annealing temperature promotes the formation of quenchable amorphous diamond via enhanced sp3 preservation, but this trend reverses above 2900 K due to thermal graphitization. Under non-hydrostatic compression, GC transforms into a superhard structure sustaining large stress differences, which sharply increase when confining pressure exceeds 40 GPa. Finally, severe rotational shear at 30 GPa induces sp3 fractions up to 80 percent at 300 to 1000 K. A hardened amorphous carbon retaining 64 percent sp3 content is achieved by decompression at 300 K, marking the lowest pressure-temperature route ever predicted. Our ML-augmented CAIMD provides a general framework for modeling structural transformations in disordered materials under anisotropic stresses.

Title: A Novel Surface-confined Spiral State With The Double Period In The Cubic Chiral Helimagnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$
Authors: Priya R. Baral, Oleg I. Utesov, Samuel H. Moody, Matthew T. Littlehales, Pierluigi Gargiani, Manuel Valvidares, Robert Cubitt, Nina-Juliane Steinke, Chen Luo, Florin Radu, Arnaud Magrez, Jonathan S. White, Victor Ukleev
Abstract: The chiral magnetoelectric insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ hosts a rich and anisotropic magnetic phase diagram that includes helical, conical, field-polarized, tilted conical, and skyrmion lattice phases. Using resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS), we uncover a new spiral state confined to the surface of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. This surface-confined spiral state (SSS) displays a real-space pitch of $\sim$120 nm, which remarkably is twice the length of the incommensurate structures observed to-date in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. The SSS phase emerges at temperatures below 30~K when the magnetic field is applied near the $\langle110\rangle$ crystallographic axis. Its surface localization is demonstrated through a combination of REXS in reflection and transmission geometries, with complementary small-angle neutron scattering measurements suggesting its absence from the bulk. We attribute the stabilization of the SSS to competing anisotropic interactions at the crystal surface. The discovery of a robust, surface-confined spiral paves the way for engineering energy-efficient, nanoscale spin-texture platforms for next-generation devices.

Authors: Deep Mondal, Sujoy Datta, Debnarayan Jana
Abstract: Carbon nitride research has reached a promising point in today's research endeavours with diverse applications including photocatalysis, energy storage, and sensing due to their unique electronic and structural properties. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have opened new avenues for exploring and optimizing the potential of these materials. This study presents a comprehensive review of the integration of ML techniques in carbon nitride research with an introduction to CN classifications and recent advancements. We discuss the methodologies employed, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, in predicting material properties, optimizing synthesis conditions, and enhancing performance metrics. Key findings indicate that ML algorithms can significantly reduce experimental trial-and-error, accelerate discovery processes, and provide deeper insights into the structure-property relationships of carbon nitride. The synergistic effect of combining ML with traditional experimental approaches is highlighted, showcasing studies where ML driven models have successfully predicted novel carbon nitride compositions with enhanced functional properties. Future directions in this field are also proposed, emphasizing the need for high-quality datasets, advanced ML models, and interdisciplinary collaborations to fully realize the potential of carbon nitride materials in next-generation technologies.

Title: Bulk Ferroelectric Heterostructures for High Temperature Lead-Free Piezoelectrics
Authors: Yizhe Li, Ziqi Yang, Ying Chen, Zhenbo Zhang, YunLong Tang, Matthew Smith, Matthew Lindley, Xuezhen Cao, David G. Hopkinson, Andrew J. Bell, Steven J. Milne, Antonio Feteira, Sarah J. Haigh, Alexander S. Eggeman, Juncheng Pan, Jiajun Shi, David A. Hall
Abstract: Remarkable exploitation of valence and lattice mismatch in epitaxial ferroelectric heterostructures generates physical effects not classically expected for perovskite oxides, such as 2D electron gas and polar skyrmions. However the widespread application of these interfacial properties and functionalities is impeded by the ultrathin layered structure and essential presence of underlying lattice-matched substrates for the deposition of epitaxial thin films. Here, we report a bottom-up pathway to synthesize bulk ferroelectric heterostructures (BFH) with periodic composition fluctuation (8 nm in wavelength) using elemental partitioning by cation diffusion, providing opportunities to exploit novel characteristics of hetero-epitaxial oxide thin films in bulk materials. Exemplar monolithic BiFeO3-BaTiO3 BFH ceramics described herein share common features with their thin film heterostructure counterparts, which facilitates control and stabilisation of ferroelectric polarisation along with a significant enhancement in Curie temperature, Tc, and functionality. BFH ceramics exhibit a record Tc (up to 824 °C) and a piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 115 pC N-1 ), in comparison with other perovskite or non-perovskite solid solutions, providing sustainable solutions for emergent high temperature piezoelectric sensing, actuation and energy conversion applications. By creating BFH ceramics using different electromechanical boundary conditions, distinct morphologies of aliovalent A-site cation segregated regions along with different types of ferroelectric order are achieved. This formation mechanism provides unprecedented control over local ferroelectric ordering and domain stabilisation in BFH ceramics; it also paves the way to explore new types of functionality, beyond those achievable in both bulk ferroelectrics and thin film heterostructures.

Title: Emergent Distance from Mutual Information in the Critical 1D XXZ Spin Chain
Authors: Beau Leighton-Trudel
Abstract: The possibility that spatial geometry may emerge from the entanglement structure of a quantum many-body system is a subject of fundamental interest. Here, we propose and numerically test a candidate distance metric in 1D, d_E, defined purely from quantum mutual information (I) via the relation d_E = K_0 / sqrt(I). Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute this emergent distance for the ground state of the 1D spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a canonical model system. Our simulations show that in the quantum critical phase at anisotropy $\Delta = 1.0$, the mutual information exhibits a power-law decay consistent with the emergence of a valid metric space. In stark contrast, within the gapped, antiferromagnetic phase ($\Delta = 2.0$), where mutual information decays exponentially, the emergent distance grows exponentially, a behavior inconsistent with the triangle inequality. These results provide numerical evidence that this information-theoretic definition can yield a well-behaved geometry in critical systems, offering a quantitative tool for probing quantum phases and motivating further analytical investigation into the foundations of emergent space.

Title: Distinct Uniaxial Stress and Pressure Fingerprint of Superconductivity in the 3D Kagome Lattice Compound CeRu2
Authors: O. Gerguri, D. Das, V. Sazgari, H.X. Liu, C. Mielke III, P. Kràl, S.S. Islam, J.N. Graham, V. Grinenko, R. Sarkar, T. Shiroka, J.-X. Yin, J. Chang, R. Thomale, H.H. Klauss, R. Khasanov, Y. Shi, H. Luetkens, Z. Guguchia
Abstract: The exploration of tunable superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems is a central pursuit in condensed matter physics, with implications for both fundamental understanding and potential applications. The Laves phase CeRu$_{2}$, a pyrochlore compound, exhibits a three-dimensional (3D) Kagome lattice type geometry giving rise to flat bands and degenerate Dirac points, where band structure features intertwine with strong multi-orbital interaction effects deriving from its correlated electronic structure. Here, we combine muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR), uniaxial in-plane stress, and hydrostatic pressure to probe the superconducting state of CeRu$_{2}$. Uniaxial stress up to 0.22 GPa induces a dome-shaped evolution of the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, with an initial plateau, successively followed by enhancement and suppression without any structural phase transition. Stress is further found to drive a crossover from anisotropic to isotropic $s$-wave pairing. In contrast, hydrostatic pressure up to 2.2 GPa leaves $T_{\rm c}$ largely unchanged but alters the superfluid density from exponential to linear behavior at low temperatures, indicative of nodal superconductivity under hydrostatic pressure. Taken together, these results indicate that CeRu$_{2}$ occupies an ideal position in parameter space, enabling highly responsive and multifold tunability of superconductivity in this three-dimensional correlated electronic system. This warrants further quantitative analysis of the interplay between lattice geometry, electronic correlations, and pairing symmetry.

Title: Observation of Quantum Coulomb Blockade Facilitated by P-Donor Molecules in Silicon Nano-Transistor
Authors: Soumya Chakraborty, Pooja Sudha, Hemant Arora, Daniel Moraru, Arup Samanta
Abstract: Multi-donor architecture developed on the base of silicon technology holds significant potential towards room-temperature qubit and other single-electron tunneling (SET) functionalities. However, within such architecture, the overlap of multiple donor wave-functions results in a complex internal electronic configuration with discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete states, observed as multiple conductance peaks, is essential for understanding inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards coherent electron transfer. In this direction, we have experimentally demonstrated one-by-one electron filling within multiple-donor molecules with the fundamental analysis of clear and sustained quantum Coulomb blockade (QCB) effect. Moreover, the underlying physics of molecular orbitals, where the increasing energy leads to a larger spatial extent of the corresponding orbital, has been reflected by the systematic decrement of the respective charging-energies. The molecular energy levels, resulting from the orbital hybridization of individual donors, are also confirmed through first-principles simulations using density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations based on the orthodox theory of Coulomb blockade support the observed QCB characteristics.

Title: Learning a potential formulation for rate-and-state friction
Authors: Shengduo Liu, Kaushik Bhattacharya, Nadia Lapusta
Abstract: Empirical rate-and-state friction laws are widely used in geophysics and engineering to simulate interface slip. They postulate that the friction coefficient depends on the local slip rate and a state variable that reflects the history of slip. Depending on the parameters, rate-and-state friction can be either rate-strengthening, leading to steady slip, or rate-weakening, leading to unsteady stick-slip behavior modeling earthquakes. Rate-and-state friction does not have a potential or variational formulation, making implicit solution approaches difficult and implementation numerically expensive. In this work, we propose a potential formulation for the rate-and-state friction. We formulate the potentials as neural networks and train them so that the resulting behavior emulates the empirical rate-and-state friction. We show that this potential formulation enables implicit time discretization leading to efficient numerical implementation.

Title: From Spheres to Cones: Structural Instabilities and Acidity at Conical Regions in Trivalent Metal Ion Nano-clusters
Authors: Jihong Shi, Han Nguyen, Mateo Pescador Arboleda, Styliani Consta
Abstract: Sub-nanometer aqueous clusters containing a single trivalent metal cation can exhibit charge-induced structural instabilities. Here, we present computational evidence that clusters containing a single \ce{Fe^{3+}}, \ce{Lu^{3+}}, or \ce{La^{3+}} ion undergo continuous geometric transformations as a consequence of this instability. These clusters dynamically evolve across their potential energy landscape, adopting triangular, elongated two-point, single-point, and more spherical configurations often with distinct conical surface protrusions. The manifestation of this instability differs from that observed in mesoscopic and microscopic droplets containing macroions, where stable ``star-like'' structures form, characterized by a specific number of conical protrusions that varies with the droplet size. In the present study, we find that the orientation of the \ce{H2O} molecules surrounding the metal ion is influenced not only by the electric field of the trivalent ion but also by the local conical protrusions. To further investigate the local acidity in the conical protrusions, we employ a proxy model system consisting of an aqueous nano-cluster containing three \ce{H3O+} ions, simulated using ab initio molecular dynamics. Within the conical regions of the cluster, protons exhibit diffusion across several water molecules, in contrast to the more localized proton delocalization observed in the compact body of the cluster. These findings suggest that local geometry can significantly modulate acidity in highly charged nano-clusters, with potential implications for understanding charge-transfer and ionization mechanisms in techniques such as electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and complement interpretations from infrared spectroscopic data.

Title: Field-effect transistors based on charged domain walls in van der Waals ferroelectric α-In$_2$Se$_3$
Authors: Shahriar Muhammad Nahid, Haiyue Dong, Gillian Nolan, Andre Schleife, SungWoo Nam, Pinshane Y. Huang, Nadya Mason, Arend M. van der Zande
Abstract: Charged domain walls (CDW) in ferroelectrics are emerging as functional interfaces with potential applications in nonvolatile memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing. However, CDWs in conventional ferroelectrics are vertical, buried, or electrically inaccessible interfaces that prevent their use in functional devices. Here, we overcome these challenges by stacking two opposite polar domains of van der Waals ferroelectric $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ to generate artificial head-head (H-H) CDWs and use edge contact to fabricate charged domain wall-based field-effect transistors (CDW-FET). We relate the atomic structure to the temperature-dependent electrical and magneto-transport of the CDW-FET. CDW-FETs exhibit a metal-to-insulator transition with decreasing temperature and enhanced conductance and field-effect mobility compared to single domain $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$. We identify two regimes of transport: variable range hopping due to disorder in the band edge below 70 K and thermally activated interfacial trap-assisted transport above 70 K. The CDW-FETs show room-temperature resistance down to 3.1 k$\Omega$ which is 2-9 orders of magnitude smaller than the single CDW in thin-film ferroelectrics. These results resolve longstanding challenges with high CDW resistance and their device integration, opening opportunities for gigahertz memory and neuromorphic computing.

Title: Enhancement of superconductivity outside Abrikosov vortex core in a tightly bound Cooper pair superconductor
Authors: Eugene B. Kolomeisky, Mia Kyler, Ishaan U. Patel
Abstract: Abrikosov vortices play a central role in the disruption of superconductivity in type-II superconductors. It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from the vortex's axis, the density of superconductive electrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we demonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature limit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are sufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density of superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This phenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and there exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge density of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the generation of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core and turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global neutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic screening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a universal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined by the London penetration depth.

Title: Thermodynamic adsorption potential of superconductors
Authors: Jiu Hui Wu, Jiamin Niu, Kejiang Zhou
Abstract: Based on the general thermodynamic analysis of Polanyi adsorption potential, the adsorption potential condition for superconductors is obtained exactly by using the quantum state equation we presented. Because this adsorption potential results in changes of electron concentration, temperature and pressure in a certain volume (adsorption space) adjacent to the surface of the lattice, the composition and structure of superconductors are of course decisive for the adsorption potential. Then we calculate the molar adsorption potentials for those typical superconductors, and find that it is positively correlated to the superconductivity temperature , which reveals that those high-superconductors are mainly determined by the higher molar adsorption potentials. In addition, the adsorption potential at still works despite the disappearance of the energy gap of the BCS theory. This shows that beyond the electron-phonon interaction mechanism, the Cooper-paired electrons are mainly formed by this physical adsorption potential for high-superconductors. This adsorption potential theory could explain almost all common facts about high-temperature superconductors, including many anomalies of the normal and superconducting states.

Title: Intertwined charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom under electronic correlations in the one-dimensional Fe$^{3+}$ chalcogenide chain
Authors: Yang Zhang, Pontus Laurell, Gonzalo Alvarez, Adriana Moreo, Thomas A. Maier, Ling-Fang Lin, Elbio Dagotto
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the study of quasi-one-dimensional iron systems with Fe$^{2+}$, we comprehensively study the Fe$^{3+}$ chalcogenide chain system. Based on first-principles calculations, the Fe$^{3+}$ chain has a similar electronic structure as discussed before in the iron 2+ chain, due to similar Fe$X_4$ ($X$ = S or Se) tetrahedron chain geometry. Furthermore, a three-orbital electronic Hubbard model for this chain was constructed by using the density matrix renormalization group method. A robust antiferromagnetic coupling was unveiled in the chain direction. In addition, in the intermediate electronic correlation $U/W$ region, we found an interesting orbital-selective Mott phase with the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons ($U$ is the on-site Hubbard repulsion, while $W$ is the electronic bandwidth). Furthermore, we do not observe any obvious pairing tendency in the Fe$^{3+}$ chain in the electronic correlation $U/W$ region, where superconducting pairing tendencies were reported before in iron ladders. This suggests that superconductivity is unlikely to emerge in the Fe$^{3+}$ systems. Our results establish with clarity the similarities and differences between Fe$^{2+}$and Fe$^{3+}$ iron chains, as well as iron ladders.

Title: Emerging kinetic-exchange for the enhanced metallic ferromagnetism in CrGeTe$_3$ under pressure
Authors: Jiaming Liu, Xuefeng Zhang, Hongbin Qu, Xiaoqun Wang, Hai-Qing Lin, Gang Li
Abstract: The microscopic origin of ferromagnetism in correlated materials remains heavily debated, particularly for the competing mechanisms governing insulating versus metallic phases. In this work, we theoretically study the electronic structure evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and provide a consistent explanation to three unique features of this system, i.e. the semiconducting ferromagnetism at low pressure, the metallic ferromagnetism at high pressure, and the enhanced Curie temperature in the metallic phase. We propose that it is the reduced electronic correlation and enhanced $d$-$p$ hybridization that universally drive the continuous evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and glue the three distinct experimental observations. Central to our discovery is the dual role of metallicity -- it simultaneously establishes kinetically driven exchange via $d$-$p$ hybridization and enables Stoner-type magnetic instability, with the contribution also from the residual super-exchange. Our analyses reveal that {\it intraband} excitations dominate the pressure-enhanced $\omega_p^2$ and $T_c$ correlation. These findings establish $d$-$p$ hybridization and electronic correlation as the bridge between localized and itinerant magnetism, at least, in CrGeTe$_{3}$.

Title: The electronic and transport properties in the Haldane-Hubbard with odd-parity altermagnetism
Authors: Minghuan Zeng, Zheng Qin, Ling Qin, Shiping Feng, Dong-Hui Xu, Rui Wang
Abstract: The sublattice current is recently proposed as a feasible scheme to realize the odd-parity altermagnetism(ALM) by breaking the nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry. We first adopt the spin group method to analyze why the broken nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry(TRS) is the sufficient condition for the odd-parity ALM, and find that it is the symmetry $[\bar{C}_2||\bar{E}]$ that allows the appearance of the odd-parity ALM where $\bar{C}_2$ represents a $180^\circ$ rotation around an axis perpendicular to the spins combined with the spin-space inversion, and $\bar{E}$ is the inversion in real space. As a representative example with the presence of sublattice currents, the optical conductivity of Haldane-Hubbard model is further studied using the Kubo formula. It is shown that there is no spin-polarized electrical current in both the longitudinal and traverse directions because of TRS in the odd-parity ALM, and they display a significant peak in the vicinity of the single-particle direct energy gap which reflects that both the longitudinal and traverse optical conductivities are dominated by the quasiparticle excitations around the Dirac points. We also study the hole doping dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$ as well as the staggered magnetization $M$, and find that they display opposite behaviors, i.e., $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$ in the ALM CI state is diminished monotonically from its initial value $C=2$ at half-filling as the hole doping is increased, while in the ALMI state exhibits a non-monotonous behavior.

Title: Observation of Integer and Fractional Chern insulators in high Chern number flatbands
Authors: Jingwei Dong, Le Liu, Jundong Zhu, Zitian Pan, Yu Hong, Zhengnan Jia, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Luojun Du, Dongxia Shi, Wei Yang, Guangyu Zhang
Abstract: The intertwined electron correlation and topology give birth to emergent quantum phenomena with fractionalized phases in condensed matter physics. Recently, Chern insulators and fractional ones with C smaller than one have been observed in twisted MoTe2 and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene-hBN moire systems at zero magnetic fields, resembling the fractional quantum Hall phases at high magnetic fields. Here, we target topological phases with high Chern number C > 1 by designing a new moire system, i.e. twisted rhombohedral trilayer-bilayer graphene. We observe Chern insulators with C = 3 at both v = 1 and v = 3. In particular, quantized anomalous Hall effect with C = -3 is observed at v = 3 for device D2. Most importantly, by fractionally filling the high Chern number flat band, we observe evidence of a fractional Chern insulator with C = -3/2 developing from even-denominator fractional filling v = 5/2 at zero magnetic fields, which reaches a fractionally quantized Hall effect with C = -3/2 (a quantization accuracy of 96%) at B = 4T. We have observed another FCI with C = -6/5 at v = 12/5, supported by the Streda formula and anomalous Hall effects induced time reversal symmetry breakings. In addition, we observe Chern insulators with C = 1 and 2 at even-denominator fractional filling v = 1/2 and 3/2, respectively, and strikingly, the signatures of anomalous Hall crystal phases with high Chern numbers (C > 1) that develops continuously from v = 1 to the even-denominator v = 3/2 at zero magnetic fields in device D1 and D3. Our results demonstrate the tRTBG, which can be naturally extended to other twisted graphene moire superlattices based on rhombohedral graphene multilayers, as a novel platform for hosting unconventional high Chern number correlated topology in the ultra-strong correlated regime that is beyond the paradigm of the fractional phases with C < 1.

Title: An analytical model for the remote epitaxial potential
Authors: Jason K Kawasaki, Quinn T Campbell
Abstract: We propose an analytical model for the remote bonding potential of the substrate that permeates through graphene during remote epitaxy. Our model, based on a Morse interatomic potential, includes the attenuation due to (1) the increased separation between film and substrate and (2) free carrier screening from graphene. Compared with previous slab density functional theory calculations, which use the electrostatic potential as a proxy for bonding, our analytical model provides a more direct description of bonding, explicitly includes screening (which is often ignored), and is based on simple, interpretable, and well benchmarked parameters. We show that the magnitude of $|\phi_{remote}|$ for typical semiconductor and oxide substrates is few meV, similar to the van der Waals potential of graphene. This suggests interference between the graphene and remote substrate potentials, plus interfacial reconstructions, must be considered when interpreting experiments on remote epitaxy. We use our model to interpret previous experiments from the remote epitaxy and related literature, highlighting connections to moire epitaxy and to the ordering of graphite intercalation compounds. Our model also points to tests, based on tunable screening and spatial extent of the substrate potential, that may increase the strength of the remote potential towards the more idealized picture.

Title: First-Principles Theory of Five- and Six-Phonon Scatterings
Authors: Yi Xia
Abstract: Higher-order phonon scatterings beyond fourth order remain largely unexplored despite their potential importance in strongly anharmonic materials at elevated temperatures. We develop a theoretical formalism for first-principles calculation of five- and six-phonon scatterings using Green's function techniques based on a diagrammatic formalism, and systematically investigate multi-phonon interactions in Si, MgO, and BaO from room temperature to near melting points. Our calculation reveals dramatically different material-dependent behaviors: while five- and six-phonon processes remain negligible in Si, they become increasingly important in MgO and dominant in BaO near its melting point, where they surpass three- and four-phonon scattering intensity and significantly reduce lattice thermal conductivity. We demonstrate that the strength of higher-order interactions is primarily governed by interatomic force constants, with BaO exhibiting five- and six-phonon scattering rates over one order of magnitude stronger than MgO despite identical crystal structures, due to large scattering phase space arising from softened harmonic interactions. Our work establishes the theoretical foundation for understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials and at elevated temperatures.

Title: Hypergraph-Based Models of Random Chemical Reaction Networks: Conservation Laws, Connectivity, and Percolation
Authors: Shesha Gopal Marehalli Srinivas, Massimiliano Esposito, Nahuel Freitas
Abstract: Random graph models have been instrumental in characterizing complex networks, but chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are better represented as hypergraphs. Traditional models of random CRNs often reduce CRNs to bipartite graphs, representing species and reactions as distinct nodes, or simpler derived graphs, which can obscure the relationship between the statistical properties of these representations and the physical characteristics of the CRN. We introduce a straightforward model for generating random CRNs that preserves their hypergraph structure as well as atomic composition, enabling the direct study of chemically relevant features. Notably, our approach distinguishes two notions of connectivity that are equivalent in graphs but differ fundamentally in hypergraphs. These notions exhibit percolation-like phase transitions, which we analyze in detail. The first type of connectivity has relevance to steady-state synthesis and transduction, determining the effective reactions an open CRN can perform at steady state. The second type is suitable to identify which species can be produced from a given initial set of species in a closed CRN. Our findings highlight the importance of hypergraph-based modeling for uncovering the complex behaviors of CRNs.

Title: Crossover in the Ordered Phase in the Non-Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg Regime of Spin Models with Long-Range Coupling
Authors: Jiewei Ding, Jiahao Su, Ho-Kin Tang, Wing Chi Yu
Abstract: Continuous spin models with long-range interactions of the form $r^{-\sigma}$, where $r$ is the distance between two spins and $\sigma$ controls the decay of the interaction, exhibit enhanced order that competes with thermal disturbances, leading to a richer variety of phases and types of phase transitions. In-depth research in this area not only aids in comprehending the complex behaviors in theoretical models but also provides valuable insights into the diverse phase transitions observed in real materials. Here, we identify that the true long-range ordered phase encompasses distinct scaling regimes, which we term Enhance Long-Range Ordered (EnLRO) and Reduce Long-Range Ordered (ReLRO) regimes. In the one-dimensional XY model, the crossover from EnLRO to ReLRO regimes occurs around $\sigma \approx 1.575$, while in two dimensions, the crossover happens near $\sigma \approx 3.2$. Applying finite-size scaling analysis, we extract the critical exponents that characterize the order-to-disorder phase transitions in the EnLRO and ReLRO regimes, constructing comprehensive phase diagrams. The analysis is further extended to the 1D and 2D long-range Heisenberg models, where we find the EnLRO-ReLRO crossover at $\sigma \approx 1.575$ and $\sigma \approx 3.22$, respectively. The similar crossover points suggest that the distinction between EnLRO and ReLRO regimes is a generic feature in continuous spin models with long-range interactions.

Abstract: An optical phonon at 2.5 meV is observed in a thin film of the chiral metal halide (R-MBA)$_2$PbI$_4$, but is absent in the racemic counterpart, as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. This experimental result indicates the chiral origin of the 2.5 meV mode and supports recent theoretical predictions of chirality transfer from the organic to the inorganic layers, with implications for the spin polarization properties of hybrid metal halides and perovskites.

Title: Eight-fold classification of superconducting orders
Authors: Alexander V. Balatsky, Saikat Banerjee
Abstract: We present a thorough symmetry-based classification of superconducting order parameters that is independent of their microscopic origins. Our approach involves classifying pairing states through the pairwise permutation of spatial, temporal, spin, and orbital indices, focusing on the parities of the relative coordinates and times of the paired fields. This framework leads to the emergence of new classes of superconducting states, which we visualize as a multidimensional cube representing the relative parities in space and time, referred to as the Berezinskii-Abrahams hypercube. While some predicted states, such as odd-frequency superconductors, have been previously discussed, our symmetry analysis also reveals states that have yet to be explored, including odd-frequency Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states. Furthermore, we draw parallels to the classification of particle-hole states, and reiterate the possibility of new states, such as odd-frequency density waves.

Title: Evidence of rotational and tilting disorder of ReO6 octahedra in single crystals of a 5d1 double perovskite Ba2CaReO6
Authors: Alasdair Nicholls, Jian-Rui Soh, Yikai Yang, Alessandro Bombardi, Daigorou Hirai, Henrik M. Ronnow, Ivica Zivkovic
Abstract: We present results of an experimental study on single crystals of a 5d1 double perovskite Ba2CaReO6. Magnetization measurements reveal a weak splitting between zero-field-cooled and field-cooled protocols below 12 K. At magnetic fields above 1 T the splitting is absent and the magnetic susceptibility is featureless. A detailed specific heat study in a wide temperature range and comprising different heat pulses did not reveal any indication of a thermodynamic phase transition. At low temperatures we do observe specific heat deviating from a phonon background, leading to a total electronic entropy release of ~Rln2. Resonant and non-resonant x-ray diffraction of characteristic Bragg peaks indicates a significant presence of disorder, potentially related to random tilts and rotations of rigid ReO6 octahedra.

Title: Active anisotropic diffusion of microparticles in nematic lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal powered by light
Authors: Patrycja Kadzialka, Lech Sznitko, Pawel Karpinski
Abstract: We explore the diffusion dynamics of a Brownian microparticle in a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (LCLC). In the planarly oriented nematic phase, the microparticle exhibits levitation and anisotropic two-dimensional diffusion. Upon illumination with light resonant with the absorption spectrum of the solution, we observe a transition to active anisotropic diffusion, driven by the disruption of the molecular stacking in the liquid crystal. Notably, while light absorption increases both the molecular kinetic energy and the overall temperature of the solution, it manifests at the microscopic level as anisotropic active diffusion of the microparticles, revealing a novel light-driven non-equilibrium transport mechanism.

Title: Temperature dependence of surface superconductivity in t-PtBi$_2$
Authors: Julia Besproswanny, Sebastian Schimmel, Yanina Fasano, Grigory Shipunov, Saicharan Aswartham, Danny Baumann, Bernd Büchner, Christian Hess
Abstract: The Weyl semimetal trigonal PtBi$_2$ has recently been identified as a promising candidate material for intrinsic topological surface superconductivity emerging from the Fermi arc states of the material with a sizeable superconducting gap. We report the temperature evolution of the superconducting excitation spectrum using scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the range of $8-45\,$K. A large low-temperature gap in the order of $\Delta \approx 9\,$meV and a closing of the gap around $T_c \approx 45\,$K is observed. Thus, our results confirm the previously indicated high $T_c$-like superconductivity in t-PtBi$_2$.

Title: The Effect of Pearl Vortices on the Shape and Position of Néel-Type Skyrmions in Superconductor--Chiral Ferromagnet Heterostructures
Authors: S. S. Apostoloff, E. S. Andriyakhina, I. S. Burmistrov
Abstract: This review presents recent work carried out at the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences on the study of the effect of superconducting vortices on the shape and position of Néel-type skyrmions in superconductor--chiral ferromagnet heterostructures. Based on analytical and numerical approaches, a number of effects caused by the inhomogeneous magnetic field of the vortex have been predicted: a significant increase in the skyrmion radius, a change in its chirality in the case of a coaxial configuration of the vortex and skyrmion, and modification of the skyrmion shape in the case of an eccentric configuration. Recent experiments studying these effects are discussed.

Title: Bulk spin-orbit torque-driven spin Hall nano-oscillators using PtBi alloys
Authors: Utkarsh Shashank, Akash Kumar, Tahereh Sadat Parvini, Hauke Heyen, Lunjie Zeng, Andrew B. Yankovich, Mona Rajabali, Eva Olsson, Markus Münzenberg, Johan Åkerman
Abstract: Spin-orbit-torque-driven auto-oscillations in spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) offer a transformative pathway toward energy-efficient, nanoscale microwave devices for next-generation neuromorphic computing and high-frequency technologies. A key requirement for achieving robust, sustained oscillations is reducing the threshold current ($I_{\text{th}}$), strongly governed by spin Hall efficiency ($\theta_{\text{SH}}$). However, conventional strategies to enhance $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ face trade-offs, including high longitudinal resistivity, interfacial effects, and symmetry-breaking torques that limit performance. Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement of the bulk spin Hall effect in PtBi alloys, achieving over a threefold increase in $\theta_{\text{SH}}$, from 0.07 in pure Pt to 0.24 in Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$ and 0.19 in Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$, as extracted from DC-bias spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance. The enhanced $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ originates from bulk-dominated, extrinsic side-jump scattering across all PtBi compositions. Correspondingly, we observe a 42\% and 32\% reduction in $I_{\text{th}}$ in 100 nm SHNOs based on Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$(4 nm) and Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$(4 nm), respectively. Structural characterization reveals reduced Pt crystallinity, along with emergence of preferred crystallographic orientations upon introducing higher Bi concentrations. Together, these results position PtBi alloys as a compelling alternative to conventional 5$d$ transition metals, enabling enhanced $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ and significantly lower $I_{\text{th}}$, thus opening new avenues for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing and magnetic random access memory.

Title: Unveiling the Self-Orthogonality at Exceptional Points in Driven $\mathcal{PT}$-Symmetric Systems
Authors: Alexander Fritzsche, Riccardo Sorbello, Ronny Thomale, Alexander Szameit
Abstract: We explore the effect of self-orthogonality at exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian Parity-Time-symmetric systems. Using a driven three-band lattice model, we show that the Rabi frequency diverges as the system approaches an EP due to the coalescence of eigenstates. We demonstrate that this divergence manifests in experimentally accessible power oscillations, establishing a direct observable for self-orthogonality. Our results provide a pathway for probing EP physics in various metamaterial platforms.

Title: Quantum-Annealing Enhanced Machine Learning for Interpretable Phase Classification of High-Entropy Alloys
Authors: Diego Ibarra Hoyos, Gia-Wei Chern, Israel Klich, Joseph Poon
Abstract: High entropy alloys (HEAs) offer unprecedented compositional flexibility for designing advanced materials, yet predicting their crystallographic phases remains a key bottleneck due to limited data and complex phase formation behavior. Here, we present a quantum-enhanced machine learning framework that leverages quantum annealing to enhance phase classification in HEAs. Our pipeline integrates Quantum Boosting (QBoost) for interpretable feature selection and classification, with Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) that use quantum-enhanced kernels to capture nonlinear relationships between physical descriptors. By reformulating both models as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, we exploit the efficient sampling capabilities of quantum annealers to achieve rapid training and robust generalization, demonstrating notable runtime reductions relative to classical baselines in our setup. We target six key phases: FCC, BCC, Sigma, Laves, Heusler, and AlXY B2, and benchmark model performance using both cross-validation and a rigorously curated test set of prior experimentally synthesized HEAs. The results confirm strong alignment between predicted and measured phases. Our findings demonstrate that quantum-enhanced classifiers match or exceed classical models in accuracy and offer insights grounded in interpretable physical descriptors. This work constitutes an important step toward practical quantum acceleration in materials discovery pipelines.

Title: Rigid-Body Anisotropy in Noncollinear Antiferromagnets
Authors: Zheng Liu, Yang Gao, Qian Niu
Abstract: Characterizing the anisotropic structure in noncollinear antiferromagnets is essential for antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we provide a microscopic theory linking the anisotropy effects induced by the rigid-body rotation of spin order to spin-orbit coupling. Our method goes beyond the conventional magnetic group theory, offering a concise yet powerful tool to characterize diverse anisotropy effects in complex magnetic systems. Using the group representation theory of the spin group, we obtain a set of basis functions formed from tensor elements of spin-orbit vector--which originates from spin-orbit coupling and is tied to the rigid-body rotation of the spin order--to systematically describe the structure of anisotropy effects. As a concrete example, we apply our framework to coplanar antiferromagnets Mn$_3$Sn and Mn$_3$Ir, demonstrating that the corresponding basis functions can well capture both the geometric and magnitude dependencies of the magnetic anisotropy energy and anomalous Hall conductivity. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our framework to broader classes of anisotropy phenomena in magnetic systems.

Title: Electric-Field Induced Spin Wave Nonreciprocity in Noncoplanar Magnets
Authors: Xiao-Hui Li, Yuan-Ming Lu, Yuan Wan
Abstract: We show that an electric field can induce nonreciprocal spin wave dispersion in magnetic insulators with negligible spin-orbit coupling. The electric field controls the direction and magnitude of nonreciprocity through a nonlinear magnetoelectric effect without switching the magnetic ground state. By deriving spin space group symmetry constraints, we find only a subset of noncoplanar magnets exhibits this property, and identify a few candidates. For the example of hexagonal lattice tetrahedral antiferromagnet, our effective field theory analysis and microscopic model calculation yield results that are fully consistent with the symmetry analysis.

Abstract: Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3DED) is a powerful technique providing for crystal structure solutions of sub-micron sized crystals too small for structure determination via X-ray techniques. The entry requirement, however, of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) adapted with bespoke software for coordinated sample stage rotation and continuous electron diffraction data acquisition has generally inhibited the wider uptake of 3DED. To address this limitation, we present novel software GiveMeED appropriate for controlled 3DED data acquisition. The collection of useable reflections beyond 0.8 Å makes 3DED crystallographic processing effectively routine, using standard software and workflows derived from single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) techniques. A full experimental workflow for 3DED on a conventional TEM is described in practical terms, in combination with direct imaging, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), for the return of comprehensive correlative descriptions of crystal morphologies and sample compositions, with due regard for the quantification of electron flux at each stage of the characterisation process. The accuracy and effectiveness of GiveMeED is demonstrated through structure solutions for case study paracetamol, copper(II) phthalocyanine, and percholorocoronene samples, characterised in their near-native states under controlled low dose conditions at either room or cryogenic temperatures, with determined unit cell parameters and atomic connectivity matching accepted literature X-ray structures for these compounds. To promote the wider adoption of 3DED, we make GiveMeED freely available for use and modification, in support of greater uptake and utilisation of structure solution procedures via electron diffraction.

Title: Dissipation induced Majarona $0$- and $π$-modes in a driven Rashba nanowire
Authors: Koustabh Gogoi, Tanay Nag, Arnob Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and $\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes (TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We study the topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.

Title: Dislocation-enhanced piezoelectric catalysis of KNbO3 crystal for water splitting
Authors: Hanyu Gong, Jiawen Zhang, Yan Zhao, Shan Xiang, Xiang Zhou, Oliver Preuß, Wenjun Lu, Yan Zhang, Xufei Fang
Abstract: Dislocations in oxides with ionic/covalent bonding hold the potential of harnessing versatile functionalities. Here, high-density dislocations in a large plastic zone in potassium niobate (KNbO3) crystals are mechanically introduced by room-temperature cyclic scratching to enhance piezocatalytic hydrogen production. Unlike conventional energy-intensive, time-consuming deformation at high temperature, this approach merits efficient dislocation engineering. These dislocations induce local strain and modify the electronic environment, thereby improving surface reactivity and charge separation, which are critical for piezocatalysis. This proof-of-concept offers a practical and sustainable alternative for functionalizing piezoelectric ceramics. Our findings demonstrate that surface-engineered dislocations can effectively improve the piezocatalysis, paving the way for efficient and scalable piezocatalytic applications.

Title: High Resolution Temperature-Resolved Spectroscopy of the Nitrogen Vacancy $^{1}E$ Singlet State Ionization Energy
Authors: Kristine V. Ung, Connor A. Roncaioli, Ronald L. Walsworth, Sean M. Blakley
Abstract: The negatively charged diamond nitrogen-vacancy ($\mathrm{{NV}^-}$) center plays a central role in many cutting edge quantum sensing applications; despite this, much is still unknown about the energy levels in this system. The ionization energy of the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ singlet state in the $\mathrm{{NV}^-}$ has only recently been measured at between 2.25 eV and 2.33 eV. In this work, we further refine this energy by measuring the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ energy as a function of laser wavelength and diamond temperature via magnetically mediated spin-selective photoluminescence (PL) quenching; this PL quenching indicating at what wavelength ionization induces population transfer from the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ into the neutral $\mathrm{{NV}^0}$ charge configuration. Measurements are performed for excitation wavelengths between 450 nm and 470 nm and between 540 nm and 566 nm in increments of 2 nm, and for temperatures ranging from about 50 K to 150 K in 5 K increments. We determine the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ ionization energy to be between 2.29 and 2.33 eV, which provides about a two-fold reduction in uncertainty of this quantity. Distribution level: A.

Title: Electro-optic Kerr Effect Induced by Nonlinear Transport in monolayer WTe2
Authors: He-Lin Li, Zhen-Gang Zhu, Gang Su
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) can induce optical anisotropy by modifying a material's dielectric tensor, presenting opportunities for novel characterization and device applications. While the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) probes the linear Hall effect (LHE) in magnetic materials, an analogous optical probe for NLHE in non-magnetic, time-reversal symmetric systems remains highly desirable. Here, we theoretically propose and investigate an NLHE-induced Electro-optic Kerr Effect (EOKE) as such a probe. Focusing on monolayer (ML) WTe$_2$, a prototypical NLHE material, our analysis considers contributions from Berry curvature dipole (BCD), Drude, injection, and shift mechanisms. We demonstrate that the EOKE signal in WTe$_2$ is predominantly governed by the BCD. Furthermore, the Kerr angle exhibits temporal oscillations at different optical frequencies, suggesting EOKE as a promising route for the time-resolved detection of NLHE and the dynamic investigation of material topology.

Title: Inertial antiferromagnetic resonance driven by spin-orbit torques
Authors: Peng-Bin He, Ri-Xing Wang, Zai-Dong Li, Mikhail Cherkasskii
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the handedness of a resonant mode is an intrinsic property. We show that, by tailoring the polarization and handedness of alternating spin-orbit torques used as the driving force, the polarization state and handedness of inertial resonant modes in an antiferromagnet can be actively controlled. In contrast to ferromagnets, whose resonant-mode polarization is essentially fixed, antiferromagnetic inertial modes can continuously evolve from elliptic through circular to linear polarization as the driving polarization is varied. We further identify an inertia-dependent critical degree of driving polarization at which the mode becomes linearly polarized while its handedness reverses.

Title: Single-site diagonal quantities capture off-diagonal long-range order
Authors: M. Sanino, I. D'Amico, V. V. França, I. M. Carvalho
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are typically marked by changes in quantum correlations across various spatial scales within the system. A key challenge lies in the fact that experimental probes are generally restricted to diagonal quantities at the single-site scale, which are widely believed to be insufficient for detecting phases with off-diagonal long-range order, such as superconducting states. In a striking departure from conventional expectations, we show that single-site diagonal descriptors -- charge and spin fluctuations, occupation probabilities, and entanglement -- can capture the emergence of off-diagonal long-range order in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at half-filling. These single-site quantities display clear critical signatures of the superconducting transition, preceded by a continuous breaking of particle-hole symmetry, consistent with a second-order phase transition. While this symmetry breaking has a negligible effect on single-site descriptors, it allows a direct connection between local fluctuations and nonlocal correlations.

Title: Beyond-mean-field fluctuations for the solution of constraint satisfaction problems
Authors: Niklas Foos, Bastian Epping, Jannik Grundler, Alexandru Ciobanu, Ajainderpal Singh, Tim Bode, Moritz Helias, David Dahmen
Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) lie at the heart of complexity theory and find application in a plethora of prominent tasks ranging from cryptography to genetics. Classical approaches use Hopfield networks to find approximate solutions while recently, modern machine-learning techniques like graph neural networks have become popular for this task. In this study, we employ the known mapping of MAX-2-SAT, a class of CSPs, to a spin-glass system from statistical physics, and use Glauber dynamics to approximately find its ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the underlying problem. We show that Glauber dynamics outperforms the traditional Hopfield-network approach and can compete with state-of-the-art solvers. A systematic theoretical analysis uncovers the role of stochastic fluctuations in finding CSP solutions: even in the absense of thermal fluctuations at $T=0$ a significant portion of spins, which correspond to the CSP variables, attains an effective spin-dependent non-zero temperature. These spins form a subspace in which the stochastic Glauber dynamics continuously performs flips to eventually find better solutions. This is possible since the energy is degenerate, such that spin flips in this free-spin space do not require energy. Our theoretical analysis leads to new deterministic solvers that effectively account for such fluctuations, thereby reaching state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Hole distribution and self-doping enhanced electronic correlation in hole-doped infinite-layer nickelates
Authors: Hongbin Qu, Guang-Ming Zhang, Gang Li
Abstract: The minimal model for infinite-layer nickelates remains under debate, particularly regarding the hybridization between itinerant interstitial-$s$ and the correlated Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as the interaction between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other $3d$ orbitals. Additionally, how the doped holes in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ are distributed among different orbitals remain unresolved. Motivated by recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we theoretically study the electronic structure of infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at various doping levels. We find that, unlike the expectation from a rigid band shift, holes are equally distributed to Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and interstitial-$s$ orbitals. The role of interstitial-$s$ orbital is further confirmed from the renormalization of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band, for which the coupling between interstitial-$s$ and Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ exerts a non-negligible impact on the orbital-selective renormalization observed in ARPES. We also discuss the implication of our results to the single-band model, where the interstitial-$s$ orbital in the normal state of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ acts as charge donator enhancing the correlation of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ by increasing its concentration close to half-filling.

Title: Dynamics of fractional quantum Hall Liquids with a pulse at the edge
Authors: Jie Li, Chen-Xin Jiang, Zi-Xiang Hu
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental advancements in scanning optical stroboscopic confocal microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, which have facilitated exceptional energy-space-time resolution for investigating edge and bulk dynamics in fractional quantum Hall systems, we formulated a model for the pump-probe process on the edge. Starting with a ground state, we applied a tip potential near the fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, which was subsequently turned off after a defined time duration. By examining how the specific nature of the tip potential influences the evolution of the wave function and its distribution in energy spectrum, we identify that quench dynamics of the edge pulse leads to excitations that spread both along the edge and perpendicularly into the bulk. Moreover, magnetoroton excitations are predominant among the bulk excitations. These results align well with the experimental observations. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of the tip's position, intensity, and duration on the dynamics.

Title: High-throughput prediction of thermodynamically stable 1D magnetic transition-metal chalcogenides and halides
Authors: Canbo Zong, Deping Guo, Renhong Wang, Weihan Zhang, Jiaqi Dai, Zhongqin Zhang, Cong Wang, Xianghua Kong, Wei Ji
Abstract: The search for novel one-dimensional (1D) materials with exotic physical properties is crucial for advancing nanoelectronics and spintronics. Here, we perform a comprehensive high-throughput, first-principles study to explore the vast landscape of 1D transition-metal chalcogenides and halides. Starting with 6,832 candidate structures derived from 28 metals and 8 non-metals, we systematically evaluated their thermodynamic stability by comparing the formation energies of 1D chains against competing 2D phases, mimicking thermodynamic selectivity during nucleation. This screening identified 210 stable 1D magnetic chains. Furthermore, representation learning models revealed that chemical stoichiometry and the electron affinity of the non-metal element are key factors governing 1D stability. The stable materials exhibit a rich spectrum of properties, including diverse magnetic orders (FM, AFM) and Luttinger compensated antiferromagnetism in MnTe. We discovered 20 ferroelastic chains, with FeTe showing a giant magnetostriction of -5.57%. Other emergent phenomena include Charge Density Wave (CDW) chains in FeTe and NiSe. Finally, our findings propose concrete platforms for quantum applications, such as the predicted realization of Majorana zero modes in a ferromagnetic CrCl2 chain on a superconducting NbSe2 substrate.

Title: Dynamical stability for dense patterns in discrete attractor neural networks
Authors: Uri Cohen, Máté Lengyel
Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.

Title: Hollow cylindrical droplets in a very strongly dipolar condensate
Authors: S. K. Adhikari
Abstract: A harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) leads to topologically trivial compact states. Because of the long-range nonlocal dipole-dipole interaction, a strongly dipolar BEC revealed many novel phenomena. Here we show that in a strongly dipolar BEC one can have a hollow cylindrical quasi-one-dimensional metastable droplet with ring topology while the system is trapped only in the $x$-$y$ plane by a harmonic potential and a Gaussian hill potential at the center and untrapped along the polarization $z$ axis. In this numerical investigation we use the imaginary-time propagation of a mean-field model where we include the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction, suitably modified for dipolar systems. Being metastable, these droplets are weakly stable and we use real-time propagation to investigate its dynamics and establish stability.

Title: Enhanced superconductivity in the compressively strained bilayer nickelate thin films by pressure
Authors: Qing Li, Jianping Sun, Steffen Boetzel, Mengjun Ou, Zhe-Ning Xiang, Frank Lechermann, Bosen Wang, Yi Wang, Ying-Jie Zhang, Jinguang Cheng, Ilya M. Eremin, Hai-Hu Wen
Abstract: The discovery of high temperature superconductivity in the nickelate system has stimulated enormous interest in the community of condensed matter physics. Recently, superconductivity with an onset transition temperature (Tc^onset) over 40 K was achieved in La3Ni2O7 and (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films at ambient pressure due to in-plane compressive strain. This observation has sparked enormous attention because measurements on superconducting properties can be accessible with many commonly used experimental tools. On the other hand, the Tc in these thin films is much lower than that of the bulk bilayer nickelates under pressure. Here we report the enhancement of Tc^onset to over 60 K by applying hydrostatic pressure on the compressively strained superconducting bilayer nickelate thin films. The Tc^onset firstly ramps up with pressure, then it slightly drops down after reaching the maximum Tc^onset at about 61.5 K under a pressure of 9 GPa, showing a dome-like phase diagram. Hall effect measurements reveal that the dominant charge carriers are hole-like with a slight enhancement of charge carrier density with pressure in accompanying with the increase of Tc. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the enhancement of Tc arises from a cooperative amplification of magnetic fluctuations within and between the layers and increased metallicity under pressure. However, this enhancement exhibits saturation at higher pressures. These findings highlight the critical role of the interplay between interlayer and intralayer electronic correlations in bilayer nickelate superconductors and point to the potential of tuning Tc through controlled manipulation of the electronic structure and interactions.

Title: Relaxation dynamics of a mobile impurity injected in a one-dimensional Bose gas
Authors: Saptarshi Majumdar, Aleksandra Petković
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum impurity immersed with a finite velocity in a one-dimensional system of weakly interacting bosons is studied. We uncover and characterize different regimes of relaxation dynamics. We find that the final impurity velocity remains constant in a large interval of sufficiently big and realistic initial velocities. The underlying physical mechanism is the emission of the dispersive density shock waves that carry away the excess of the initial impurity momentum, while locally the system remains in the same stationary state. In contrast, a heavy impurity with the same coupling constant relaxes differently and the regime of constant final velocity disappears. Furthermore, a fast heavy impurity exhibits damped velocity oscillations in time before reaching a stationary state. This process is accompanied by the oscillations of the local depletion of the boson density around the impurity, until their positions coincide and they continue the motion together. Decreasing the impurity-boson coupling or increasing the strength of repulsion between bosons, the oscillations get amplified. In the case of a heavy impurity with the mass bigger than the critical one, the ground state energy as a function of momentum exhibits cusps and metastable branches. We show that they manifest themselves by a soliton emission, a considerable slowing down of the relaxation, and a change of the impurity direction of motion with respect to the initial one.

Title: Polaritonic Machine Learning for Graph-based Data Analysis
Authors: Yuan Wang, Stefano Scali, Oleksandr Kyriienko
Abstract: Photonic and polaritonic systems offer a fast and efficient platform for accelerating machine learning (ML) through physics-based computing. To gain a computational advantage, however, polaritonic systems must: (1) exploit features that specifically favor nonlinear optical processing; (2) address problems that are computationally hard and depend on these features; (3) integrate photonic processing within broader ML pipelines. In this letter, we propose a polaritonic machine learning approach for solving graph-based data problems. We demonstrate how lattices of condensates can efficiently embed relational and topological information from point cloud datasets. This information is then incorporated into a pattern recognition workflow based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leading to significantly improved learning performance compared to physics-agnostic methods. Our extensive benchmarking shows that photonic machine learning achieves over 90\% accuracy for Betti number classification and clique detection tasks - a substantial improvement over the 35\% accuracy of bare CNNs. Our study introduces a distinct way of using photonic systems as fast tools for feature engineering, while building on top of high-performing digital machine learning.

Title: X-raying Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O: disentangling elemental contributions in a prototypical high-entropy oxide

Abstract: We employ several X-ray based techniques, including X-ray diffraction, absorption and resonant inelastic scattering, to disentangle the contributions of individual chemical species to the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of high-entropy oxides. In the benchmark compound Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O and related systems, we unambiguously resolve a sizable Jahn-Teller distortion at the Cu sites, more pronounced in the absence of Ni2+ and Mg2+, suggesting that these ions promote positional order, whereas Cu2+ ions act to destabilize it. Moreover, we detect magnetic excitations and estimate the strength of the interactions between pairs of different magnetic elements. Our results provide valuable insights into the role of the various chemical species in shaping the physical properties of high-entropy oxides.

Title: Graphene Design with Parallel Cracks: Abnormal Crack Coalescence and Its Impact on Mechanical Properties
Authors: Suyeong Jin, Jung-Wuk Hong, Chiara Daraio, Alexandre F. Fonseca
Abstract: Graphene is a material with potential applications in electric, thermal, and mechanical fields, and has seen significant advancements in growth methods that facilitate large-scale production. However, defects during growth and transfer to other substrates can compromise the integrity and strength of graphene. Surprisingly, the literature suggests that, in certain cases, defects can enhance or, at most, not affect the mechanical performance of graphene. Further research is necessary to explore how defects interact within graphene structure and affect its properties, especially in large-area samples. In this study, we investigate the interaction between two preexisting cracks and their effect on the mechanical properties of graphene using molecular dynamics simulations. The behavior of zigzag and armchair graphene structures with cracks separated by distances ($W_\text{gap}$) is analyzed under tensile loading. The findings reveal that crack coalescence, defined as the formation of a new crack from two existing crack tips, occurs for lower values of the distance between cracks, $W_\text{gap}$, resulting in a decline in the strength of structures. As $W_\text{gap}$ increases, the stress-strain curves shift upward, with the peak stress rising in the absence of crack coalescence. The effective stress intensity factor formulated in this study exhibits a clear upward trend with increasing $W_\text{gap}$. Furthermore, an increase in $W_\text{gap}$ induces a transition in fracture behavior from crack coalescence to independent propagation with intercrack undulation. This shift in fracture behavior demonstrates a brittle-to-ductile transition, as evidenced by increased energy absorption and delayed failure. A design guideline for the initial crack geometry is suggested by correlating peak stress with the $W_\text{gap}$, within a certain range.

Title: Sustainable Pre-reduction of Ferromanganese Oxides with Hydrogen: Heating Rate-Dependent Reduction Pathways and Microstructure Evolution
Authors: Anurag Bajpai, Barak Ratzker, Shiv Shankar, Dierk Raabe, Yan Ma
Abstract: The reduction of ferromanganese ores into metallic feedstock is an energy-intensive process with substantial carbon emissions, necessitating sustainable alternatives. Hydrogen-based pre-reduction of manganese-rich ores offers a low-emission pathway to augment subsequent thermic Fe-Mn alloy production. However, reduction dynamics and microstructure evolution under varying thermal conditions remain poorly understood. This study investigates the influence of heating rate on the hydrogen-based direct reduction of natural Nchwaning ferromanganese ore and a synthetic analog. Non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis revealed a complex multistep reduction process with overlapping kinetic regimes. Isoconversional kinetic analysis showed increased activation energy with reduction degree, indicating a transition from surface-reaction to diffusion-controlled reduction mechanisms. Interrupted X-ray diffraction experiments suggested that slow heating enables complete conversion to MnO and metallic Fe, while rapid heating promotes Fe- and Mn-oxides intermixing. Thermodynamic calculations for the Fe-Mn-O system predicted the equilibrium phase evolution, indicating Mn stabilized Fe-containing spinel and halite phases. Microstructural analysis revealed that slow heating rate yields fine and dispersed Fe particles in a porous MnO matrix, while fast heating leads to sporadic Fe-rich agglomerates. These findings suggest heating rate as a critical parameter governing reduction pathway, phase distribution, and microstructure evolution, thus offering key insights for optimizing hydrogen-based pre-reduction strategies towards more efficient and sustainable ferromanganese production.

Title: Resonant Valance Bond and Bethe Ansatz on Quasi-1D Lattices
Authors: Zhao Zhang
Abstract: The Hubbard model at $U\to\infty$ has recently been shown to have resonant valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. In an effort to further generalize those results, I study how the ground state is modified when not all corners are shared between two tetrahedra as in the quasi-1D lattices of a pyrochlore stripe, and how to approach the problem in the case of finite doping. Using a non-Abelian version of the flux inequality, the tetrahedron chain is shown to have degenerate RVB-like ground states. The Bethe ansatz (BA) is adapted to solve the sawtooth chain with spinless or spin-polarized fermions and multiple holons, which is the first example of applying BA to a quasi-1D lattice.

Title: Large Interconnected Thermodynamic Systems Nearly Minimize Entropy Production
Authors: Kyle J. Ray, Alexander B. Boyd
Abstract: Many have speculated whether nonequilibrium systems obey principles of maximum or minimum entropy production. In this work, we use stochastic thermodynamics to derive the condition for the minimum entropy production state (MEPS) for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs), even far from equilibrium. We show that real nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) generally violate both the MINEP and MAXEP principles. However, through numerical sampling of large interconnected CTMCs, we find that as system size increases, the steady-state entropy production tends to converge toward the minimum. This suggests that large nonequilibrium systems may self-organize to make efficient use of thermodynamic resources, offering a nuanced perspective on the longstanding debate between MAXEP and MINEP.

Title: Strain and Correlation Modulated Magnetic Anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya Interaction in 2D H-FeTe$_2$
Authors: Dimple Rani, B. R. K. Nanda, Prasanjit Samal
Abstract: In the ongoing research on two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic materials with strong intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (DMI), most efforts have focused on doping, Janus engineering, or heterostructure formation to break inversion symmetry and enhance spin--orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we demonstrate that a pristine 2D material, monolayer H-FeTe$_2$, can naturally host robust DMI and magnetic anisotropy due to its intrinsic broken inversion symmetry and the strong SOC of Te atoms. We explore the effect of biaxial strain and electron correlation on H-FeTe$_2$ using first-principles DFT+$U$ calculations. We systematically investigate the Heisenberg exchange interaction, magnetic anisotropy, and DMI in the space spanned by strain and correlation. Our results reveal a distinct, non-monotonic strain dependence of both magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and DMI, including a strain-tunable crossover between in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic easy axes. A remarkable enhancement of the in-plane DMI is observed under the combined influence of strain and strong correlations, which is unusual for pristine 2D materials and suggests a favorable regime for spintronic this http URL, even in the absence of strain, H-FeTe$_2$ exhibits finite DMI and considerable anisotropy, which is rare for a pure 2D material. Through these findings, we present H-FeTe$_2$ as a unique pristine 2D system with robust and tunable spin interactions for exploring fundamental spin--orbit-driven magnetic phenomena.

Title: Topological phases and Edge states in an exactly solvable Gamma matrix model
Authors: Akhil Pravin Furtado, Kusum Dhochak
Abstract: We study the phases of an exactly solvable one dimensional model with $4-$dimensional $\Gamma-$matrix degrees of freedom on each site. The $\Gamma-$matrix model has a large set of competing interactions and displays a rich phase diagram with critical lines and multi-critical points. We work with the model with certain $Z_2$ symmetries and identify the allowed symmetry protected topological phases using the winding number as the topological invariant. The model belongs to the CII-class of the $10-$fold classification and allows for integer values of the winding number. We confirm that the system also hosts localized zero energy Majorana edge modes, consistent with the integer value of the winding number of the corresponding phase. We further study scaling and universality behaviour of the various topological phase transitions.

Title: Statistics of stochastic entropy for recorded transitions between ENSO states
Authors: Sílvio M. Duarte Queirós
Abstract: We analyse the transitions between established phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) by surveying the daily data of the Southern Oscillation Index from an entropic viewpoint using the framework of stochastic Statistical Physics. We evaluate the variation of entropy produced due to each recorded path of that index during each transition as well as taking only into consideration the beginning and the end of the change between phases and verified both integral fluctuation relations. The statistical results show that these entropy variations have not been extreme entropic events; only the transition between the strong $1999-2000$ La Niña to the moderate $2002-2003$ El Niño is at the edge of being so. With that, the present work opens a long and winding avenue of research over the application of stochastic Statistical Physics to Climate Dynamics.

Title: Closure of superstatistics
Authors: Sergio Davis
Abstract: Plasmas and other systems with long-range interactions are commonly found in non-equilibrium steady states that are outside traditional Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, but can be described using generalized statistical mechanics frameworks such as superstatistics, where steady states are treated as superpositions of canonical ensembles under a temperature distribution. In this work we solve the problem of inferring the possible steady states of a composite system $AB$ where subsystem $A$ is described by superstatistics and $E_{AB} = E_A + E_B$. Our result establishes a closure property of superstatistics, namely that $A$ is described by superstatistics if and only if $AB$ and $B$ are also superstatistical with the same temperature distribution. Some consequences of this result are discussed, such as the impossibility of local thermal equilibrium (LTE) for additive subsystems in non-canonical steady states.

Title: Density Functional Theory Study of Th-doped LiCAF and LiSAF for Nuclear Clock Applications
Authors: Martin Pimon, Tobias Kirschbaum, Thorsten Schumm, Adriana Pálffy, Andreas Grüneis
Abstract: Thorium-doped LiCaAlF$_6$ and LiSrAlF$_6$ (Th:LiCAF and Th:LiSAF) are promising crystals for a solid-state nuclear clock based on the 8 eV transition in $^{229}$Th; however, their complex crystal structures complicate understanding the atomic arrangement of the thorium defects. In this work, density functional theory simulations are employed to systematically investigate these systems, including temperature-dependent effects and environmental conditions of fluorine saturation and deficiency. We investigated 20 distinct charge compensation schemes for each material, revealing lower defect formation energies in Th:LiSAF than in Th:LiCAF. This suggests that the former may attain a higher concentration of thorium nuclei. Furthermore, we calculated the electric field gradient for the lowest energy structure per compensation pathway. Our investigation shows that results previously reported in the literature apply only to a subset of experimental conditions.

Title: Gaussian pseudo-Orthogonal Ensemble of Real Random Matrices
Authors: Sachin Kumar, Amit Kumar, S M Yusuf
Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct Gaussian pseudo-orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \altmathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ elements independently drawn from a Gaussian random population and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently, all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \altmathcal{D}^t \zeta \altmathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to a pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.

Title: A new method to find exact solution of nonlinear ordinary differential equations: Application to derive thermophoretic waves in graphene sheets
Authors: Prakash Kumar Das
Abstract: This article proposes a novel approach for determining exact solutions to nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The recommended iterative method provides the solution via a rapidly converging series that readily approaches a closed form solution. The proposed approach is very efficient and essentially perfect for determining exact solutions of nonlinear equations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we examined the extended (2 + 1) dimensional equation for thermophoretic motion, which is based on wrinkle wave movements in graphene sheets supported by a substrate. The implementation of the suggested approach effectively yielded closed-form solutions in terms of exponential functions, hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, algebraic functions, and Jacobi elliptic functions, respectively. Three generated solutions illustrated to examine the characteristics of thermophoretic waves in graphene sheets. The proposed method's benefits and drawbacks are also examined. Consequently, unlike previous solutions obtained via the variation of parameters method for nonlinear issues, the solutions presented here are exact and unique.

Title: Regularized Fluctuating Lattice Boltzmann Model
Authors: Marco Lauricella, Andrea Montessori, Adriano Tiribocchi, Sauro Succi
Abstract: We introduce a regularized fluctuating lattice Boltzmann model (Reg-FLBM) for the D3Q27 lattice, which incorporates thermal fluctuations through Hermite-based projections to ensure compliance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. By leveraging the recursive regularization framework, the model achieves thermodynamic consistency for both hydrodynamic and ghost modes. Compared to the conventional this http URL BGK-FLBM, the Reg-FLBM provides improved stability and a more accurate description of thermal fluctuations. The implementation is optimized for large-scale parallel simulations on GPU-accelerated architectures, enabling systematic investigation of fluctuation-driven phenomena in mesoscale and nanoscale fluid systems.

Title: Variational subspace methods and application to improving variational Monte Carlo dynamics
Authors: Adrien Kahn, Luca Gravina, Filippo Vicentini
Abstract: We present a formalism that allows for the direct manipulation and optimization of subspaces, circumventing the need to optimize individual states when using subspace methods. Using the determinant state mapping, we can naturally extend notions such as distance and energy to subspaces, as well as Monte Carlo estimators, recovering the excited states estimation method proposed by Pfau et al. As a practical application, we then introduce Bridge, a method that improves the performance of variational dynamics by extracting linear combinations of variational time-evolved states. We find that Bridge is both computationally inexpensive and capable of significantly mitigating the errors that arise from discretizing the dynamics, and can thus be systematically used as a post-processing tool for variational dynamics.

Title: Robust Chiral Edge Dynamics of a Kitaev Honeycomb on a Trapped Ion Processor
Authors: Ammar Ali, Joe Gibbs, Keerthi Kumaran, Varadharajan Muruganandam, Bo Xiao, Paul Kairys, Gábor Halász, Arnab Banerjee, Phillip C. Lotshaw
Abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, then apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a nonzero Chern number -- a hallmark of topological order -- which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.

Title: Spontaneous symmetry and antisymmetry breaking in a ring with two potential barriers
Authors: Hidetsugu Sakaguchi, Boris A. Malomed, T. J. Taiwo
Abstract: We propose a fundamental setup for the realization of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and spontaneous antisymmetry breaking (SASB) in the framework of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation with the self-attractive and repulsive cubic term, respectively, on a one-dimensional ring split in two mutually symmetric boxes by delta-functional potential barriers, placed at opposite points. The system is relevant to optics and BEC. The spectrum of the linearized system is found in analytical and numerical forms. SSB and SASB are predicted by dint of the variational approximation, and studied in the numerical form. A particular stable solution, which demonstrates strong asymmetry, is found in an exact form. In the system with the attractive nonlinearity, the SSB of the symmetric ground state is initiated by the modulational instability. It creates stationary asymmetric states through a supercritical bifurcation. In the self-repulsive system, SASB makes the lowest antisymmetric excited state unstable, transforming it into an antisymmetry-breaking oscillatory mode.

Title: Theoretical evaluation of decay mode of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ in solid samples
Authors: Ryotaro Masuda, Tomoya Naito, Masashi Kaneko, Hiroyuki Kazama, So Hashiba, Kosuke Misawa, Yoshitaka Kasamatsu
Abstract: The excitation energy of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ is extremely low at $ 8.4 \, \mathrm{eV} $; thus, this isotope exhibits changes in its decay modes depending on the chemical state, specifically the outermost electronic states. However, the reported half-lives of $ \gamma $-ray transition are not consistent among the previous experiments. In this study, we investigate the chemical states of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ by DFT calculations. Based on these results, we evaluate the relationship between the experimental half-life for each sample and the electronic state of $ \mathrm{Th} $. The calculation results indicate that ion trap method, $ \mathrm{Ca} \mathrm{F}_2 $ model and $ \mathrm{Mg} \mathrm{F}_2 $ one decay only via the $ \gamma $-ray transition, whereas $ \mathrm{Li} \mathrm{Sr} \mathrm{Al} \mathrm{F}_6 $ decay via the $ \gamma $-ray transition and has a possibility of decay via internal conversion, and electron bridge.

Title: A General, Automated Method for Building Structural Tensors of Arbitrary Order for Anisotropic Function Representations
Authors: Ravi G. Patel, Reese E. Jones, D. Thomas Seidl, Brian N. Granzow, Jan N. Fuhg
Abstract: We present a general, constructive procedure to find the basis for tensors of arbitrary order subject to linear constraints by transforming the problem to that of finding the nullspace of a linear operator. The proposed method utilizes standard numerical linear algebra techniques that are highly optimized and well-behaved. Our primary applications are in mechanics where modulus tensors and so-called structure tensors can be used to characterize anisotropy of functional dependencies on other inputs such as strain. Like modulus tensors, structure tensors are defined by their invariance to transformations by symmetry group generators but have more general applicability. The fully automated method is an alternative to classical, more intuition-reliant methods such as the Pipkin-Rivlin polynomial integrity basis construction. We demonstrate the utility of the procedure by: (a) enumerating elastic modulus tensors for common symmetries, and (b) finding the lowest-order structure tensors that can represent all common point groups/crystal classes. Furthermore, we employ these results in two calibration problems using neural network models following classical function representation theory: (a) learning the symmetry class and orientation of a hyperelastic material given stress-strain data, and (b) representing strain-dependent anisotropy of the stress response of a soft matrix-stiff fiber composite in a sequence of uniaxial loadings. These two examples demonstrate the utility of the method in model selection and calibration by: (a) determining structural tensors of a selected order across multiple symmetry groups, and (b) determining a basis for a given group that allows the characterization of all subgroups. Using a common order in both cases allows sparse regression to operate on a common function representation to select the best-fit symmetry group for the data.

Title: Connecting boundary entropy and effective central charge at holographic interfaces
Authors: Evangelos Afxonidis, Ignacio Carreño Bolla, Carlos Hoyos, Andreas Karch
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of intervals in $1+1$ interface CFTs is modified in two ways compared to a CFT without interface: there is a finite boundary entropy contribution, and, for an interval with an endpoint at the interface, the coefficient of the logarithmically divergent contribution -- which is usually proportional to the central charge of the CFT -- is modified to an effective central charge. We show that the latter modification can be understood as a limit of the former using holographic duals of interface CFTs. Furthermore, we show that a finite "boundary entropy" contribution also appears in intervals that do not cross the interface and it is needed to ensure strong subbaditivity of the entanglement entropy.

Title: Dual-circular Raman optical activity of axial multipolar order
Authors: Hikaru Watanabe, Rikuto Oiwa, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: Multipolar order, such as octupolar order, is one of the key concepts of condensed matter physics, particularly in light of elusive hidden orders. However, its experimental identification remains challenging due to the absence of direct coupling to conventional external stimuli. In this study, we propose that dual-circular Raman scattering serves as a detection of multipolar anisotropies. By combining symmetry analysis with microscopic tight-binding calculations, we demonstrate that both time-reversal-even ($\theta$-even) and time-reversal-odd ($\theta$-odd) axial multipolar phases exhibit the Raman optical activity as a direct consequence of mirror symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we find that the Stokes and anti-Stokes spectra encode the time-reversal parity of the multipolar order, providing an all-optical means to distinguish multipolar phases. Our findings open a pathway for identifying multipolar orders in various materials through dual-circular Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and versatile probe.

Title: Pseudo-gauge invariant non-equilibrium density operator
Authors: F. Becattini, C. Hoyos
Abstract: We obtain a form of the local thermodynamic equilibrium density operator which is invariant under pseudo-gauge transformations of the stress-energy and the spin tensors. This operator is an excellent candidate to describe the dynamics of a system which is assumed to achieve local equilibrium from a pseudo-gauge invariant quantum state, a situation which is believed to occur, for instance, in nuclear collisions at very high energy. As a consequence of pseudo-gauge invariance, the ambiguity affecting the predictions of mean values of observables from a local equilibrium state can be removed.

Title: Defects and their Time Scales in Quantum and Classical Annealing of the Two-Dimensional Ising Model
Authors: Phillip Weinberg, Na Xu, Anders W. Sandvik
Abstract: We investigate defects in the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising ferromagnet on periodic $L\times L$ lattices after quantum annealing from high to vanishing field. With exact numerical solutions for $L \le 6$, we observe the expected critical Kibble-Zurek (KZ) time scale $\propto L^{z+1/\nu}$ (with $z=1$ and $1/\nu \approx 1.59$) at the quantum phase transition. We also observe KZ scaling of the ground-state fidelity at the end of the process. The excitations evolve by coarsening dynamics of confined defects, with a time scale $\propto L^2$, and interface fluctuations of system-spanning defects, with life time $\propto L^3$. We build on analogies with classical simulated annealing, where we characterize system-spanning defects in detail and find differences in the dynamic scales of domain walls with winding numbers $W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ (horizontal/vertical) and $W=(1,1)$ (diagonal). They decay on time scales $\propto L^3$ (which applies also to system-spanning domains in systems with open boundaries) and $\propto L^{3.4}$, respectively, when imposed in the ordered phase. As a consequence of $L^{3.4}$ exceeding the classical KZ scale $L^{z+1/\nu}=L^{3.17}$ the probability of $W=(1,1)$ domains in SA scales with the KZ exponent even in the final $T=0$ state. In QA, also the $W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ domains are controlled by the KZ time scale $L^{2.59}$. The $L^3$ scale can nevertheless be detected in the excited states, using a method that we develop that should also be applicable in QA experiments.

Title: Similarity networks of ordinal-pattern transitions classify falling paper trajectories
Authors: Angelo A. Flores, Leonardo G. J. M. Voltarelli, Andre S. Sunahara, Haroldo V. Ribeiro, Arthur A. B. Pessa
Abstract: Paper fragments in free fall constitute a simple yet paradigmatic mechanical system exhibiting remarkably complex motions. Despite a long history of investigation, this system has defied comprehensive first-principles modeling, motivating the development of phenomenological and experimental approaches to classify the free-fall dynamics of small paper fragments. Here we apply the Bandt-Pompe symbolization method to extract high-dimensional features corresponding to ordinal-pattern transitions (so-called ordinal networks) from observed area time series of video-recorded falling papers shaped as circles, squares, hexagons, and crosses. We then represent each trajectory as a node in a weighted similarity network, with edges encoding pairwise dynamical similarity, and identify motion classes via community detection. Our method automatically clusters trajectories into tumbling and chaotic falls in excellent agreement with expert visual classification. Notably, it outperforms previous approaches based on classical physical features derived from complete three-dimensional trajectories -- especially for cross-shaped papers -- and requires no prior specification of the number of motion classes. We further find that trajectories diverging from expert classifications occupy more central positions in the similarity network, suggesting more complex and ambiguous dynamic behavior.

Title: Bounds on the Uniaxial Effective Complex Permittivity of Two-phase Composites and Optimal or Near Optimal Microstructures
Authors: Kshiteej J. Deshmukh, Graeme W. Milton
Abstract: Electromagnetic materials with a uniaxial effective permittivity tensor, characterized by its transverse ($\epsilon_\perp$) and axial ($\epsilon_\parallel$) components, play a central role in the design of advanced photonic and electromagnetic materials including hyperbolic metamaterials, and biological imaging platforms. Tight bounds on the complex effective permittivity of such metamaterials are critical for predicting and optimizing their macroscopic electromagnetic response. While rigorous tight bounds exist for isotropic two-phase composites, corresponding results for uniaxial composites remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the attainable range of $\epsilon_\perp$ and $\epsilon_\parallel$ in the quasistatic regime for two-phase metamaterials with isotropic homogeneous phases. By analyzing known microgeometries and constructing hierarchical laminates (HLs), we demonstrate that the classical bounds on $\epsilon_\perp$ are not optimal. We conjecture improved bounds based on numerically fitted circular arcs derived from convex hulls of $\epsilon_\perp$ values obtained from HLs, and we identify optimal rank-4 HL structures that achieve all points on the conjectured bounds. Additionally, we quantify the correlation between $\epsilon_\perp$ and $\epsilon_\parallel$ for fixed volume fractions, and propose a design algorithm to construct HL microstructures achieving prescribed values of $\epsilon_\perp$. Leveraging the Cherkaev-Gibiansky transformation and the translation method, we extend recent techniques developed for isotropic composites by Kern-Miller-Milton to derive translation bounds on the uniaxial complex effective permittivity tensor. Finally, bounds on the sensitivity of the effective permittivity tensor of low-loss composites are obtained and their optimality is shown in two-dimensions.

Title: Linear Resistivity from Spatially Random Interactions and the Uniqueness of Yukawa Coupling
Authors: Sang-Jin Sin, Yi-Li Wang
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a spatially random Yukawa-type interaction between a Fermi surface and critical bosons can produce linear-in-temperature resistivity, the defining signature of strange metals. In this article, we systematically classify all scalar couplings of the form $(\psi^{\dagger}\psi)^n\phi^m$ in arbitrary dimensions to identify possible candidates for strange-metal behaviour within this disordered framework. We find that only the Yukawa-type interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions yields linear resistivity. Combined with previous results showing that spatially random QED-type couplings also produce such linearity, we conclude that spatially random Yukawa and QED-type interactions exhaust the class of random couplings capable of producing linear resistivity.

Title: Topological Magneto-optical Kerr Effect without Spin-orbit Coupling in Spin-compensated Antiferromagnet
Authors: Camron Farhang, Weihang Lu, Kai Du, Yunpeng Gao, Junjie Yang, Sang-Wook Cheong, Jing Xia
Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the differential reflection of oppositely circularly polarized light, has traditionally been associated with relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which links a particle's spin with its orbital motion. In ferromagnets, large MOKE signals arise from the combination of magnetization and SOC, while in certain coplanar antiferromagnets, SOC-induced Berry curvature enables MOKE despite zero net magnetization. Theoretically, large MOKE can also arise in a broader class of magnetic materials with compensated spins, without relying on SOC - for example, in systems exhibiting real-space scalar spin chirality. The experimental verification has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such a SOC- and magnetization-free MOKE in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2. Using a Sagnac interferometer microscope, we image domains of scalar spin chirality and their reversal. Our findings establish experimentally a new mechanism for generating large MOKE signals and position chiral spin textures in compensated magnets as a compelling platform for ultrafast, stray-field-immune opto-spintronic applications.

Title: Exploiting emergent symmetries in disorder-averaged quantum dynamics
Authors: Mirco Erpelding, Adrian Braemer, Martin Gärttner
Abstract: Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at the level of super operators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large system.

Title: Dynamics of quantum Fisher and Wigner-Yanase skew information following a noisy quench
Authors: J. Naji, R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, M. Abdi
Abstract: We study the influence of noise on the dynamics of a transverse field Ising model when quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin correlations properties, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the absence of noise, despite the entanglement, both QFI and WYSI increase monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. When noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change dramatically: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with time scale of a ramp quench, with the exponent depending on the noise intensity. Furthermore, the maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum, scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy quantum annealing.

Title: Tunable Nanophotonic Devices and Cavities based on a Two-Dimensional Magnet
Authors: Ahmet Kemal Demir, Luca Nessi, Sachin Vaidya, Connor A. Occhialini, Marin Soljačić, Riccardo Comin
Abstract: Central to the field of nanophotonics is the ability to engineer the flow of light through nanoscale structures. These structures often have permanent working spectral ranges and optical properties that are fixed during fabrication. Quantum materials, with their correlated and intertwined degrees of freedom, offer a promising avenue for dynamically controlling photonic devices without altering their physical structure. Here, we fabricate photonic crystal slabs from CrSBr, a van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor, and demonstrate unprecedented in situ control over their optical properties. Leveraging the combination of the exceptionally large refractive index of CrSBr near its excitonic resonances and its tunability via external fields, we achieve precise manipulation of photonic modes at near-visible and infrared wavelengths, showcasing a new paradigm for nanophotonic device design. The resulting guided resonances of the photonic crystal are tightly packed in the spectrum with very small mode volumes, are highly tunable via external magnetic fields, and exhibit high Q-factors exceeding 500. These resonances self-hybridize with the excitonic degrees of freedom, resulting in intrinsic strong light-matter coupling. Our findings underscore the potential of quantum materials for developing in situ tunable photonic elements and cavities.

Title: DLPNO-MP2 with Periodic Boundary Conditions
Authors: Arman Nejad, Andrew Zhu, Kesha Sorathia, David P. Tew
Abstract: We present domain-based local pair natural orbital Møller--Plesset second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) with Born--von K{á}rm{á}n boundary (BvK) conditions. The approach is based on well-localised Wannier functions in a LCAO formalism and extends the molecular DLPNO-MP2 implementation Tubromole program package to periodic systems. The PNOs are formed through a PAO-OSV-PNO cascade, using BvK projected atomic orbitals and orbital specific virtuals as intermediaries in an analogous manner to the molecular scheme. Our chargeless and surface-dipole corrected local density fitting approach is shown to be numerically stable and to ensure convergent lattice summations over the periodic images for the two- and three-index Coulomb integrals. Through careful benchmarking, we show that the DLPNO approximations in the BvK-DLPNO-MP2 methods are entirely consistent with those of molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations, and with an alternative periodic approach Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, reported in Paper II of this series. Smooth convergence to the canonical correlation energy with tightening PNO threshold is observed. Reference MP2 correlation energies are provided for a set of 2D and 3D periodic systems using a triple-zeta basis and supercell sizes up to 11$\times$11 and 7$\times$7$\times$7.

Title: DLPNO-MP2 for Periodic Systems using Megacell Embedding
Authors: Andrew Zhu, Arman Nejad, Poramas Komonvasee, Kesha Sorathia, David P. Tew
Abstract: We present a domain-based local pair natural orbital Møller--Plesset second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) for periodic systems, working within an LCAO formalism within the Tubromole program package. This approach, Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, embeds a supercell correlation treatment within a megacell and does not involve periodic image summation for the Coulomb integrals. Working in a basis of well-localised Wannier functions, periodicity is instead imposed through rigorous translational symmetry of Hamiltonian integrals and wavefunction parameters. The accuracy of the method is validated through comparison with a complementary periodic DLPNO-MP2 method that employs Born--von K{á}rm{á}n boundary conditions, described in paper I of this series. The PNO approximations are shown to be equivalent in the two approaches and entirely consistent with molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations. The Megacell-DLPNO-MP2 method displays sub-linear scaling with respect to supercell size at the asymptotic limit and example calculations are presented with up to 15000 basis functions in the correlation treatment.

Title: Cryogen-free variable-temperature Kelvin probe force microscopy for probing local chemical potential in a graphene heterostructure
Authors: Namkyung Lee, Seungwon Jung, Baeksan Jang, Sangwook Ha, Joonho Jang
Abstract: We report the development of a variable-temperature Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) system capable of stable and highly sensitive operation over a wide temperature range based on a GM-cooler-based cryogen-free cryostat. The system incorporates a custom-designed phase-locked loop and automatic gain control, along with passive vibration isolation, enabling precise measurements of local chemical potential even under cryogenic conditions. We demonstrate the performance of this setup by measuring hBN encapsulated monolayer graphene (MLG), revealing spatially resolved electronic inhomogeneities and charge puddles. Our measurements clearly capture temperature-dependent variations in the chemical potential near the charge neutrality point (CNP), consistent with the linear band dispersion of MLG and interaction-driven renormalization of Fermi velocity. This work highlights the robust sensitivity and stability of our system, making it a versatile local probe of quantum phases in van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Quantum measurement of work in mesoscopic systems
Authors: Anant Vijay Varma, Doron Cohen
Abstract: Heat and work in thermodynamics refer to the measurement of changes in energy content of external bodies (baths and agents). We discuss the implications of quantum mechanics on the possibility to measure work in a mesoscopic context. The agent is a quantum entity (say an oscillator) that is used to drive the system. An obvious limitation is related to back-reaction, leading to a classical-like restriction. We find that in order to resolve fingerprints of interference an additional quantum uncertainty limitation should be taken into account in the design of the agent. The quantum limitation is fundamental, and cannot be relaxed by super-resolution techniques.

Title: Effects of structural properties of neural networks on machine learning performance
Authors: Yash Arya, Sang Hoon Lee
Abstract: In recent years, graph-based machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, have garnered significant attention. While some recent studies have started to explore the relationship between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive performance, they often limit themselves to a narrow range of model networks, particularly lacking mesoscale structures such as communities. Our work advances this area by conducting a more comprehensive investigation, incorporating realistic network structures characterized by heterogeneous degree distributions and community structures, which are typical characteristics of many real networks. These community structures offer a nuanced perspective on network architecture. Our analysis employs model networks such as random and scale-free networks, alongside a comparison with a biological neural network and its subsets for more detailed analysis. We examine the impact of these structural attributes on the performance of image classification tasks. Our findings reveal that structural properties do affect performance to some extent. Specifically, networks featuring coherent, densely interconnected communities demonstrate enhanced learning capabilities. The comparison with the biological neural network emphasizes the relevance of our findings to real-world structures, suggesting an intriguing connection worth further exploration. This study contributes meaningfully to network science and machine learning, providing insights that could inspire the design of more biologically informed neural networks.

Title: Testing APS conjecture on regular graphs
Authors: Wenxuan Tao, Fen Zuo
Abstract: The maximum energy of the EPR model on a weighted graph is known to be upper-bounded by the sum of the total weight and the value of maximum-weight fractional matching~(MWFM). Recently, Apte, Parekh and Sud~(APS) conjecture that the bound could be strengthened by replacing MWFM with maximum weight matching~(MWM). Here we test this conjecture on a special class of regular graphs that Henning and Yeo constructed many years ago. On this class of regular graphs, MWMs achieve tight lower bounds. As for the maximum energy of the EPR model, we have recently devised a new algorithm called Fractional Entanglement Distribution~(FED) based on quasi-homogeneous fractional matchings, which could achieve rather high accuracy. Applying the FED algorithm to the EPR model on Henning-Yeo graphs, we could thus obtain energy as high as possible and matching value as low as possible, and then make high-precision tests of the APS conjecture. Nevertheless, our numerical results do not show any evidence that the APS conjecture could be violated.

Title: Davies equation without the secular approximation: Reconciling locality with quantum thermodynamics for open quadratic systems
Authors: Koki Shiraishi, Masaya Nakagawa, Takashi Mori
Abstract: We derive a thermodynamically consistent quantum master equation that satisfies locality for quadratic systems coupled to independent and identical baths at each site. We show that the quasi-local Redfield equation coincides exactly with the Davies equation, which satisfies the detailed-balance condition, due to cancellation of quantum coherence generated by each bath. This derivation does not rely on the secular approximation, which fails in systems with vanishing energy-level spacings. We discuss generalizations of our result to slowly driven quadratic systems and generic quantum many-body systems. Our result paves the way to a thermodynamically consistent description of quantum many-body systems.

Title: Distributions of consecutive level spacings of circular unitary ensemble and their ratio: finite-size corrections and Riemann $ζ$ zeros
Authors: Shinsuke M. Nishigaki
Abstract: We compute the joint distribution of two consecutive eigenphase spacings and their ratio for Haar-distributed $\mathrm{U}(N)$ matrices (the circular unitary ensemble) using our framework for Jánossy densities in random matrix theory, formulated via the Tracy-Widom system of nonlinear PDEs. Our result shows that the leading finite-$N$ correction in the gap-ratio distribution relative to the universal sine-kernel limit is of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-4})$, reflecting a nontrivial cancellation of the $\mathcal{O}(N^{-2})$ part present in the joint distributions of consecutive spacings. This finding suggests the potential to extract subtle finite-size corrections from the energy spectra of quantum-chaotic systems and explains why the deviation of the gap-ratio distribution of the Riemann zeta zeros $\{1/2+i\gamma_n\}, \gamma_n\approx T\gg1$ from the sine-kernel prediction scales as $\left(\log(T/2\pi)\right)^{-3}$.

Title: Non-smooth optimization meets automated material model discovery
Authors: Moritz Flaschel, Trevor Hastie, Ellen Kuhl
Abstract: Automated material model discovery disrupts the tedious and time-consuming cycle of iteratively calibrating and modifying manually designed models. Non-smooth L1-norm regularization is the backbone of automated model discovery; however, the current literature on automated material model discovery offers limited insights into the robust and efficient minimization of non-smooth objective functions. In this work, we examine the minimization of functions of the form f(w) + a ||w||_1, where w are the material model parameters, f is a metric that quantifies the mismatch between the material model and the observed data, and a is a regularization parameter that determines the sparsity of the solution. We investigate both the straightforward case where f is quadratic and the more complex scenario where it is non-quadratic or even non-convex. Importantly, we do not only focus on methods that solve the sparse regression problem for a given value of the regularization parameter a, but propose methods to efficiently compute the entire regularization path, facilitating the selection of a suitable a. Specifically, we present four algorithms and discuss their roles for automated material model discovery in mechanics: First, we recapitulate a well-known coordinate descent algorithm that solves the minimization problem assuming that f is quadratic for a given value of a, also known as the LASSO. Second, we discuss the algorithm LARS, which automatically determines the critical values of a, at which material parameters in w are set to zero. Third, we propose to use the proximal gradient method ISTA for automated material model discovery if f is not quadratic, and fourth, we suggest a pathwise extension of ISTA for computing the regularization path. We demonstrate the applicability of all algorithms for the discovery of hyperelastic material models from uniaxial tension and simple shear data.

Title: Thermal rectification in a qubit-resonator system
Authors: Luca Magazzù, Elisabetta Paladino, Jukka P. Pekola, Milena Grifoni
Abstract: A qubit-oscillator junction connecting as a series two bosonic heat baths at different temperatures can display heat valve and diode effects. In particular, the rectification can change in magnitude and even in sign, implying an inversion of the preferential direction for the heat current with respect to the temperature bias. We perform a systematic study of these effects in a circuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of current and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling. While at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the sub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique, highly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the detuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the nonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the current scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the rectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or negative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the current and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect to changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate formulas.

Title: Quantum i.i.d. Steady States in Open Many-Body Systems
Authors: Takanao Ishii, Masahito Ueda
Abstract: Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.

Title: Quark model of nucleon based on an analogy with polaron
Authors: S.S. Afonin, A.V. Tulub
Abstract: We demonstrate that the polaron theory from solid state physics can serve as an interesting analogue model for non-perturbative QCD, at least in the description of nucleons and related low-energy physics of strong interactions. By drawing explicit analogies between polaron physics, arising for an electron moving in an ionic crystal, and physics of pion-nucleon interactions, certain rules for the "polaron/QCD correspondence" are proposed. In polaron theory, the effective fermion mass as a function of the coupling constant is known both in the weak and strong coupling limits. The conjectured "polaron/QCD correspondence" translates these results into strong interactions. It is then shown how application of these rules leads to unexpectedly good quantitative predictions for the nucleon mass and the pion-nucleon sigma term. The polaron approach also predicts that the quark degrees of freedom in the form of the constituent quark account for one-third of the nucleon mass, consistent with lattice predictions. We discuss possible physical reasons underlying the observed quantitative similarity between polaron physics and non-perturbative QCD.

Title: Inference of time delay in stochastic systems
Authors: Robin A. Kopp, Sabine H. L. Klapp, Deepak Gupta
Abstract: Time delay is ubiquitous in many experimental and real-world situations. It is often unclear whether time delay plays a significant role in observed phenomena, and if it does, how long the time lag really is. This would be invaluable knowledge when analyzing and modeling such systems. Hitherto, no universal method is available by which the time delay can be inferred. To address this problem, we propose and demonstrate two different methods to infer time delay in overdamped Langevin systems with delayed feedback. In the first part, we focus on the power spectral density based on the positional data and use a characteristic signature of the time delay to infer the delay time. In limiting cases, we establish a direct relation of the observations made for nonlinear time-delayed feedback forces to analytical results obtained for the linear system. In other situations despite the absence of this direct relation, the characteristic signature remains and can be exploited by a semiautomatic method to infer the delay time. Furthermore, it may not always desirable or possible to observe a system for a long time to infer dependencies and parameters. Thus, in the second part, we propose for the first time a probing method combined with a neural network to infer the delay time, which requires only short observation time series. These proposed methods for inferring time delays in stochastic systems may prove to be valuable tools for gaining deeper insight into the role of delay across a wide range of applications -- from the behavior of individual colloidal particles under feedback control to emergent collective phenomena such as flocking and swarming.

Title: Short range intervortex forces
Authors: Martin Speight, Thomas Winyard
Abstract: An explicit formula for the interaction energy of $n$ vortices in the abelian Higgs (or Ginzburg-Landau) model is derived, valid in the regime where all vortices are close to one another. An immediate consequence of this formula is that the interaction energy of a vortex pair with separation $d$ varies as $d^4$, not $d^2$. The formula contains $n-1$ real coefficients which are fixed by certain spectral data of the Jacobi operator of the cocentred $n$-vortex. The coefficients are computed numerically for $n=2$ and $n=3$ for couplings $0.1\leq \lambda\leq 2.5$. The resulting short range interaction potentials are compared with the results of full field theory simulations for $\lambda=0.5$ and $\lambda=2$, with excellent agreement at small to moderate vortex separation.

Title: What is the diatomic molecule with the largest dipole moment?
Authors: Ahmed Elhalawani, Ruiren Shi, Mateo Londoño Castellanos, Michal Tomza, Jesús Pérez Ríos
Abstract: We present a machine learning model for predicting the electric dipole moment of diatomic molecules using only the atomic properties of the constituent atoms. Our model can screen the entire periodic table and identify the molecules with the largest dipole moment for applications in cold molecular sciences, or find the molecule with the largest dipole moment that contains a given atom. Similarly, our model identifies useful trends that explain the dipole moment of molecules, improving our intuition in chemical physics. Finally, we condense our model into an analytical expression to predict the dipole moment in terms of atomic properties.

Authors: Sebastian Pucher, Sofus Laguna Kristensen, Ronen M. Kroeze
Abstract: Strontium-88 is a versatile atomic species often used in quantum optics, precision metrology, and quantum computing. Consolidated atomic data is essential for the planning, execution, and evaluation of experiments. In this reference, we present physical and optical properties of neutral $^{88}$Sr relevant to these applications. Here we focus on experimental results and supplement these with theoretical values. We present equations to convert values and derive important parameters. Tabulated results include key parameters for commonly used transitions in $^{88}$Sr ($^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow \, ^1\mathrm{P}_1$, $^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow \, ^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2}$, and $^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2} \rightarrow \, ^3\mathrm{S}_1$). This dataset serves as an up-to-date reference for studies involving bosonic $^{88}$Sr.

Title: Modeling the Behavior of Complex Aqueous Electrolytes Using Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: The Case of Sodium Sulfate
Authors: Ademola Soyemi, Tibor Szilvasi
Abstract: Understanding the structure and thermodynamics of solvated ions is essential for advancing applications in electrochemistry, water treatment, and energy storage. While ab initio molecular dynamics methods are highly accurate, they are limited by short accessible time and length scales whereas classical force fields struggle with accuracy. Herein, we explore the structure and thermodynamics of complex monovalent-divalent ion pairs using Na2SO4(aq) as a case study by applying a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained on density functional theory (DFT) data. Our MLIP-based approach reproduces key bulk properties such as density and radial distribution functions of water. We provide the hydration structure of the sodium and sulfate ions in 0.1-2 M concentration range and the one-dimensional and two-dimensional potentials of mean force for the sodium-sulfate ion pairing at the low concentration limit (0.1 M) which are inaccessible to DFT. At low concentrations, the sulfate ion is strongly solvated, leading to the stabilization of solvent-separated ion pairs over contact ion pairs. Minimum energy pathway analysis revealed that coordinating two sodium ions with a sulfate ion is a multistep process whereby the sodium ions coordinate to the sulfate ion sequentially. We demonstrate that MLIPs allow the study of solvated ions beyond simple monovalent pairs with DFT-level accuracy in their low concentration limit (0.1 M) via statistically converged properties from ns long simulations.

Title: Spectral properties of the zero temperature Edwards-Anderson model
Authors: Mriganka Basu Roy Chowdhury, Shirshendu Ganguly
Abstract: An Ising model with random couplings on a graph is a model of a spin glass. While the mean field case of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model is very well studied, the more realistic lattice setting, known as the Edwards-Anderson (EA) model, has witnessed rather limited progress. In (Chatterjee,'23) chaotic properties of the ground state in the EA model were established via the study of the Fourier spectrum of the two-point spin correlation. A natural direction of research concerns fractal properties of the Fourier spectrum in analogy with critical percolation. In particular, numerical findings (Bray, Moore,'87) seem to support the belief that the fractal dimension of the associated spectral sample drawn according to the Fourier spectrum is strictly bigger than one. Towards this, in this note we introduce a percolation-type argument, relying on the construction of ``barriers'', to obtain new probabilistic lower bounds on the size of the spectral sample.

Title: Quantitative central limit theorems for exponential random graphs
Authors: Vilas Winstein
Abstract: Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are nonlinear exponential tilts of Erdős-Rényi models, under which the presence of certain subgraphs such as triangles may be emphasized. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like new Erdős-Rényi models themselves, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for the overall edge count as well as all subgraph counts. However, the microscopic fluctuations of these quantities remained elusive for some time. Building on a recent breakthrough by Fang, Liu, Shao and Zhao [FLSZ24] driven by Stein's method, we prove quantitative central limit theorems (CLTs) for these quantities and more in metastable wells under ferromagnetic ERGMs. One main novelty of our results is that they apply also in the supercritical (low temperature) regime of parameters, which has previously been relatively unexplored. To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique based on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the ERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the method developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of subgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count. This was first shown for the triangle count by Sambale and Sinulis [SS20] in the Dobrushin (very high temperature) regime via functional-analytic methods. We feel our technique clarifies the underlying mechanisms at play, and it also supplies improved bounds on the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the observables at hand and the limiting Gaussians, as compared to the results of [FLSZ24] in the subcritical (high temperature) regime beyond the Dobrushin regime. Moreover, our technique is flexible enough to also yield quantitative CLTs for vertex degrees and local subgraph counts, which have not appeared before in any parameter regime.

Title: Non-conservation of the valley density and its implications for the observation of the valley Hall effect
Authors: Alexander Kazantsev, Amelia Mills, Eoin O'Neill, Hao Sun, Giovanni Vignale, Alessandro Principi
Abstract: We show that the conservation of the valley density in multivalley insulators is broken in an unexpected way by the electric field that drives the valley Hall effect. This implies that time-reversal-invariant fully gapped insulators, in which no bulk or edge state crosses the Fermi level, can support a valley Hall current in the bulk and yet show no valley density accumulation at the edges. Thus, the valley Hall effect cannot be observed in such systems. If the system is not fully gapped then valley density accumulation at the edges is possible. The accumulation has no contribution from undergap states and can be expressed as a Fermi surface average, for which we derive an explicit formula. We demonstrate the theory by calculating the valley density accumulations in an archetypical valley-Hall insulator: a gapped graphene nanoribbon. Surprisingly, we discover that a net valley density polarization is dynamically generated for certain edge terminations.

Title: Kondo $s$-$d$ exchange in the CuO$_2$ plane as the long sought interaction determining $T_c$ in cuprates
Authors: Todor M. Mishonov, Nedeltcho I. Zahariev, Hassan Chamati, Albert M. Varonov
Abstract: The well-known Pavarini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 047003 (2001)] correlation between the critical temperature $T_{c,\,\mathrm{max}}$ and the shape of the Fermi contour of the optimally hole-doped cuprates is explained within the framework of the BCS theory with Kondo exchange interaction incorporated as a pairing mechanism. The strong influence of the relative position of the Cu4$s$ level with respect to the Cu3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ level on the critical temperature $T_c$ reveals the importance of the $s$-$d$ hybridization of the conduction band. This hybridization is proportional to the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering amplitude between the conduction electrons -- the mechanism of $d$-wave pairing in the CuO$_2$ plane. In other words the Kondo interaction considered as a pairing mechanism in the CuO$_2$ plane gives a natural explanation of the correlation between the critical temperature and the shape of the Fermi contour. This result suggests that the long-sought pairing mechanism in high-$T_c$ superconducting cuprates has possibly been found and that the Kondo exchange interaction as a property of strongly correlated quantum matter deserves further attention in the physics of layered cuprates. To test the developed theoretical scheme, we explored in detail the recent results of the scanned Josephson modulation microscopy experiment of the modulation of the order parameter due to apex distance super-modulation. Our analysis shows a satisfactory agreement between our theory and the named experiment.

Title: Revealing the intrinsic electronic structure and complex fermiology of YRu2Si2 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
Authors: Anup Pradhan Sakhya, Sabin Regmi, Milo Sprague, Mazharul Islam Mondal, Iftakhar Bin Elius, Nathan Valadez, Andrzej Ptok, Dariusz Kaczorowski, Madhab Neupane
Abstract: We performed a detailed study of the intrinsic electronic structure of YRu2Si2 employing angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density-functional theory (DFT) based firstprinciples calculations. Electrical and magnetic measurements were conducted on well-oriented highquality single crystals. Bulk physical measurements indicate that the compound exhibits slightly enhanced Pauli paramagnetic behavior, accompanied by electrical transport properties reminiscent of metals. Our ARPES data reveal four fold symmetric Fermi surface with weakly-dispersing bands around the N point originating from Ru d orbitals. We observed the anisotropic characteristics of the band near the N point, showing weak dispersion in the XNX direction and minimal dispersion along the NGN direction. The electronic band structure near the Fermi level is primarily governed by the Ru d orbital, with minor contributions from the Y d and Si p orbitals. Polarization-dependent ARPES results indicate the multi-band and multi-orbital band-character of YRu2Si2. Due to the negligible correlation effect, the observed ARPES data is found to be in good agreement with the DFT results.

Title: Ultra-delayed material failure via shear banding after straining an amorphous material
Authors: Henry A. Lockwood, Emily S. Carrington, Suzanne M. Fielding
Abstract: We predict a phenomenon of catastrophic material failure arising suddenly within an amorphous material, with an extremely long delay time since the material was last deformed. By simulating a mesoscopic soft glassy rheology model in one dimension (1D), a mesoscopic elastoplastic model in 1D and 2D, and a continuum fluidity model in 1D, we demonstrate the basic physics to involve a dramatic ultra-delayed shear banding instability, in which strain suddenly strongly localises within the material and the stress drops precipitously. The delay time after the long historical shear strain was applied before failure occurs increases steeply with decreasing strain amplitude, decreasing working temperature, and increasing sample annealing prior to shear. In demonstrating the same physics -- which is directly testable experimentally and in particle simulations -- to obtain within three different constitutive models, we suggest it may be generic across amorphous materials. The counter-intuitive prediction of catastrophic material failure long after any deformation was last applied could have important consequences for material processing and performance.

Title: A unified realization of electrical quantities from the quantum International System of Units
Authors: Linsey K. Rodenbach, Jason M. Underwood, Ngoc Thanh Mai Tran, Alireza R. Panna, Molly P. Andersen, Zachary S. Barcikowski, Shamith U. Payagala, Peng Zhang, Lixuan Tai, Kang L. Wang, Dean G. Jarrett, Randolph E. Elmquist, David B. Newell, Albert F. Rigosi, David Goldhaber-Gordon
Abstract: In the revised International System of Units (SI), the ohm and the volt are realized from the von Klitzing constant and the Josephson constant, and a practical realization of the ampere is possible by applying Ohm's law directly to the quantum Hall and Josephson effects. As a result, it is possible to create an instrument capable of realizing all three primary electrical units, but the development of such a system remains challenging. Here we report a unified realization of the volt, ohm, and ampere by integrating a quantum anomalous Hall resistor (QAHR) and a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) in a single cryostat. Our system has a quantum voltage output that ranges from 0.24 mV to 6.5 mV with combined relative uncertainties down to 3 $\mu$V/V. The QAHR provides a realization of the ohm at zero magnetic field with uncertainties near 1 $\mu\Omega$/$\Omega$. We use the QAHR to convert a longitudinal current to a quantized Hall voltage and then directly compare that against the PJVS to realize the ampere. We determine currents in the range of 9.33 nA to 252 nA, and our lowest uncertainty is 4.3 $\mu$A/A at 83.9 nA. For other current values, a systematic error that ranges from -10 $\mu$A/A to -30 $\mu$A/A is present due to the imperfect isolation of the PJVS microwave bias.

Title: Fokker-Planck approach to wave turbulence
Authors: Daniel Schubring
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Zakharov stationary states for weak wave turbulence involve solving a leading-order kinetic equation. Recent calculations of higher-order corrections to this kinetic equation using the Martin-Siggia-Rose path integral are reconsidered in terms of stationary states of a Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian. A non-perturbative relation closely related to the quantum mechanical Ehrenfest theorem is introduced and used to express the kinetic equation in terms of divergences of two-point expectation values in the limit of zero dissipation. Similar equations are associated to divergences in higher-order cumulants. It is additionally shown that the ordinary thermal equilibrium state is not actually a stationary state of the Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian, and a non-linear modification of dissipation is considered to remedy this.

Title: Electronic structure in a rare-earth based nodal-line semimetal candidate PrSbTe

Abstract: Nodal line semimetals feature topologically protected band crossings between the bulk valence and conduction bands that extend along a finite dimension in the form of a line or a loop. While ZrSiS and similar materials have attracted extensive research as hosts for the nodal line semimetallic phase, an alternative avenue has emerged in the form of isostructural rare-earth (RE) based RESbTe materials. Such systems possess intriguing potentialities for harboring elements of magnetic ordering and electronic correlations owing to the presence of 4f electrons intrinsic to the RE elements. In this study, we have carried out angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and thermodynamic measurements in conjunction with first principles computations on PrSbTe to elucidate its electronic structure and topological characteristics. Magnetic and thermal characterizations indicate the presence of well-localized 4f states with the absence of any discernible phase transition down to 2 K. The ARPES results reveal the presence of gapless Dirac crossings that correspond to a nodal-line along the XR direction in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone. Furthermore, Dirac crossing that makes up nodal line, which forms a diamond-shaped nodal plane centered at the center of the Brillouin zone is also identified within the experimental resolution. This study on the electronic structure of PrSbTe contributes to the understanding of the pivotal role played by spin-orbit coupling in the context of the RESbTe family of materials

Title: Probing the Fermi surface with Quantum Oscillation Measurements in the Dirac semimetal TaNiTe$_5$
Authors: Maximilian Daschner, Bruno Gudac, Mario Novak, Cheng Liu, Friedrich Malte Grosche, Ivan Kokanović
Abstract: We report a detailed investigation of the Fermi surface in the layered Dirac semimetal TaNiTe$_5$. We probed the magnetization, magnetic torque and magnetoresistance in high-quality single crystals. Pronounced Shubnikov - de Haas (SdH) and de Haas - van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations are observed in magnetic fields above 3T and at temperatures of up to 22K. Multiple fundamental frequencies and light effective quasiparticle masses are obtained by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) formula fits. The high resolution of the low-temperature FFT spectra allows us to investigate individual peaks in detail for the magnetic fields applied along all three crystallographic axes and the planes in between. Our investigation can confirm the density functional theory (DFT) calculated band structure and its corresponding Fermi surface.

Title: Simulating Spin Dynamics of Supersolid States in a Quantum Ising Magnet
Authors: Yi Xu, Juraj Hasik, Boris Ponsioen, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy
Abstract: Motivated by a recent experimental study on the quantum Ising magnet $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$ that presented spectroscopic evidence of zero-field supersolidity (Chen et al., arXiv:2402.15869), we simulate the excitation spectrum of the corresponding microscopic $XXZ$ model for the compound, using the recently developed excitation ansatz for infinite projected entangled-pair states. We map out the ground state phase diagram and compute the dynamical spin structure factors across a range of magnetic field strengths, focusing especially on the two supersolid phases found near zero and saturation fields. Our simulated excitation spectra for the zero-field supersolid "Y" phase are in excellent agreement with the experimental data - recovering the low-energy branches and integer quantized excited energy levels $\omega_n=nJ_{zz}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the nonlocal multi-spin-flip features for modes at $\omega_2$, indicative of their multi-magnon nature. Additionally, we identify characteristics of the high-field supersolid "$\Psi$" phase in the simulated spectra, which should be compared with future experimental results.

Title: Power-law relaxation of a confined diffusing particle subject to resetting with memory
Authors: Denis Boyer, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: We study the relaxation of a Brownian particle with long range memory under confinement in one dimension. The particle diffuses in an arbitrary confining potential and resets at random times to previously visited positions, chosen with a probability proportional to the local time spent there by the particle since the initial time. This model mimics an animal which moves erratically in its home range and returns preferentially to familiar places from time to time, as observed in nature. The steady state density of the position is given by the equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, as in standard diffusion, while the transient part of the density can be obtained through a mapping of the Fokker-Planck equation of the process to a Schrödinger eigenvalue problem. Due to memory, the approach at late times toward the steady state is critically self-organised, in the sense that it always follows a sluggish power-law form, in contrast to the exponential decay that characterises Markov processes. The exponent of this power-law depends in a simple way on the resetting rate and on the leading relaxation rate of the Brownian particle in the absence of resetting. We apply these findings to several exactly solvable examples, such as the harmonic, V-shaped and box potentials.

Title: Destabilisation of local magnetic anisotropy in heavy-fermion compounds
Authors: Ewan Scott, Michal Kwasigroch
Abstract: The local magnetic anisotropy of a typical crystalline compound is usually attributed to the combined effect of crystal electric fields and spin-orbit coupling. We show that this simple local picture is transformed in heavy-fermion compounds by the development of coherent electron scattering from local spin degrees of freedom. Provided the dominance of the coherence energy scale over the magnetic energy scale is strong enough, the fractionalisation and delocalisation of the spins destabilises their single-ion anisotropy by generating an opposing anisotropy in the exchange. Experimentally, this can manifest as competing splittings in the Curie-Weiss constants and effective moments. We show that the destabilisation of the anisotropy can result in either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order that is perpendicular to the high-temperature easy axis. In the absence of destabilisation, we show that the order is more likely to be antiferromagnetic. In agreement with our theory -- an extension of Read-Newns theory to the underscreened Kondo lattice -- we observe in a wide range of actinide and lanthanide compounds that the temperature at which the anisotropy of the uniform magnetic response changes tracks the coherence energy scale. We also notice that in some compounds the destabilisation of local crystalline anisotropy can be the beginning of a cascade of decreasing energy scales. Once the anisotropy changes, further growth of magnetic correlations with cooling can lead to a rapid quenching of the hard-axis susceptibility, and at even lower temperatures, the high-temperature easy axis is revealed via a metamagnetic jump when a high magnetic field is applied along it.

Title: The Mechanics of Nucleation and Growth and the Surface Tensions of Active Matter
Authors: Luke Langford, Ahmad K. Omar
Abstract: Homogeneous nucleation, a textbook transition path for phase transitions, is typically understood on thermodynamic grounds through the prism of classical nucleation theory. However, recent studies have suggested the applicability of classical nucleation theory to systems far from equilibrium. In this Article, we formulate a purely mechanical perspective of homogeneous nucleation and growth, elucidating the criteria for the properties of a critical nucleus without appealing to equilibrium notions. Applying this theory to active fluids undergoing motility-induced phase separation, we find that nucleation proceeds in a qualitatively similar fashion to equilibrium systems, with concepts such as the Gibbs-Thomson effect and nucleation barriers remaining valid. We further demonstrate that the recovery of such concepts allows us to extend classical theories of nucleation rates and coarsening dynamics to active systems upon using the mechanically-derived definitions of the nucleation barrier and surface tensions. Three distinct surface tensions -- the mechanical, capillary, and Ostwald tensions -- play a central role in our theory. While these three surface tensions are identical in equilibrium, our work highlights the distinctive role of each tension in the stability of active interfaces and the nucleation and growth of motility-induced phases.

Title: Macroscopic Thermalization for Highly Degenerate Hamiltonians After Slight Perturbation
Authors: Barbara Roos, Shoki Sugimoto, Stefan Teufel, Roderich Tumulka, Cornelia Vogel
Abstract: We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium (MATE) if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach and stay there most of the time (``thermalize'') if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in MATE. Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta^{fF}$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0^{fF}$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0^{fF}$. Here, we first point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds, i.e., if every eigenbasis lies in MATE, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0^{fF}$. Inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0^{fF}$ for which MATE can be proved more easily than for the others, with smaller error bounds, and also in higher spatial dimensions, we show for any given $H_0$ that the existence of one eigenbasis in MATE implies quite generally that most eigenbases of $H_0$ lie in MATE. We also show that, as a consequence, after adding a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$, for most perturbations $V$ the perturbed Hamiltonian $H$ satisfies ETH and all states thermalize.

Title: Quick design of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization
Authors: Hyakka Nakada, Kotaro Tanahashi, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to enable fast solving of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, their limitations in fidelity and the number of qubits prevent them from handling real-world problems. Recently, a quantum-inspired solver using tensor networks has been proposed, which works on classical computers. Particularly, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. We showed mathematically that such feasible tensor networks can be constructed to accommodate various types of constraints. For the principle verification, we numerically constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem, to find much faster construction than conventional methods. Then, by performing imaginary time evolution, feasible solutions were always obtained, ultimately leading to the optimal solution.

Title: Simulation of charged nanotubes self-assembly during evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate
Authors: Konstantin S. Kolegov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya, Andrei V. Eserkepov, Ludia T. Khusainova
Abstract: The ability to control the morphology of the nanotube deposit formed during the evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate is of theoretical and practical interest. Such deposits are required for various applications including nanotechnology, medicine, biotechnology, and optronics. In the experiment of Zhao et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 440, 68 (2015)], an annular deposit was formed near the contact line. The deposition geometry is caused by the coffee ring effect. This deposit is unusual in its morphology. It changes gradually in space from a disordered structure in the inner part of the ring to an aligned structure of nanotubes close to the periphery. To understand the mechanisms that lead to this, we have developed a mathematical model that takes into account the effects of advection, diffusion, and electrostatic interactions on particle transport. Results of numerical calculations have confirmed that all these factors together have an influence on the formation of such a variable morphology. Qualitative agreement with the experiment is shown for some values of the model parameters.

Title: Instability of metals with respect to strong electron-phonon interaction
Authors: Emil A. Yuzbashyan, Boris L. Altshuler, Aniket Patra
Abstract: We show that thermal equilibrium between conduction electrons and phonons becomes kinetically unstable when the renormalized electron-phonon coupling exceeds a certain threshold. We prove that negative electronic specific heat, $C_\mathrm{el} < 0$, is sufficient to trigger the instability. Specifically, the instability sets in as soon as the quasiparticle weight becomes negative over a range of energies, even before $C_\mathrm{el}$ turns negative. This is an inherently nonequilibrium phenomenon, occurring prior to the formation of any equilibrium phase. Depending on the system, it can proceed along different pathways, ultimately resulting in a structural transition to an insulating or metallic state.

Title: Re-orientational dynamics of ring polymers in dilute solutions
Authors: Prabeen Kumar Pattnayak, Aloke Kumar, Gaurav Tomar
Abstract: Advances in controlled polymerization have enabled the synthesis of mechanically interlocked polymers like molecular knots and linear[n]catenane. These aesthetic macromolecules with unique topological constraints in the form of mechanical bonds are well known for their fascinating transport and rheological properties in the development of molecular machines and in knotted protein dynamics in biological applications. The diffusion dynamics of such macromolecular structures with large internal degrees of freedom are generally studied by using an equivalent size parameter, i.e., hydrodynamic radius, defined using Zimm theory. Although diffusion rates are expected to depend strongly on the molecular topological constraints in macromolecules, their explicit effects on translational and reorientational dynamics are still unknown. Here, we perform an in silico study on the diffusion dynamics of seven topologically distinct polymer chains in the limit of infinite dilution using multi-particle collision dynamics. The modeled polymers are linear, ring, linear[2]catenane, trefoil knot, linear[3]catenane, cyclic[3]catenane, and Borromean ring. The molecular weights of these macromolecules are selected such that the resulting hydrodynamic radius is approximately equal to each other. We show that while the translational diffusion coefficients of these topologically distinct polymer chains are approximately equal to each other in agreement with the Zimm theory, there are significant differences among the values of the corresponding rotational diffusion coefficients. We show that the presence of mechanical bonds in the polymer chains slows down the rotational diffusion significantly, thus suggesting the role of molecular topology on reaction kinetics of macromolecules.

Title: Determination of Magnetic Symmetries by Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction
Authors: O. Zaiets, C. Timm, J. Rusz, J.-Á. Castellanos-Reyes, S. Subakti, A. Lubk
Abstract: Convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED) is a well-established probe for spatial symmetries of crystalline samples, mainly exploiting the well-defined mapping between the diffraction groups (symmetry group of CBED patterns) and the point-group symmetries of the crystalline sample. In this work, we extend CBED to determine magnetic point groups. We construct all magnetic CBED groups, of which there exist 125. Then, we provide the complete mapping of the 122 magnetic point groups to corresponding magnetic CBED groups for all crystal orientations. In order to verify the group-theoretical considerations, we conduct electron-scattering simulations on antiferromagnetic crystals and provide guidelines for the experimental realization. Based on its feasibility using existing technology, as well as on its accuracy, high spatial resolution, and small required sample size, magnetic CBED promises to be become a valuable alternative method for magnetic structure determination.

Title: Coexistent topological and chiral phonons in chiral RhGe: An ab initio study
Authors: P. V. Sreenivasa Reddy, Guang-Yu Guo
Abstract: The CoSi-family of materials (CoSi, CoGe, RhSi and RhGe) forms a cubic chiral structure and hosts unconventional multifold chiral fermions, such as spin-1 and spin-3/2 fermions, leading to intriguing phenomena like long Fermi arc surface states and exotic transport properties. Recent interest on the phonon behavior in chiral materials is growing due to their unique characteristics, including topological phonons, protected surface states and the chiral phonons with non-zero angular momentums. In this study, we explore the topological and chiral phonon behavior in RhGe, using first-principles density functional theory calculations as well as the symmetry and topological analysis. In particular, we uncover six spin-1 triply degenerate nodal points at the $\Gamma$ point and six charge-2 double Weyl points at the R point in the Brillouin zone (BZ). Interestingly, these topological features are identical to that in the electronic band structure without the electron spin-orbit coupling, of the same material. We expect that this finding not only applies to the CoSi family but also is universal. Secondly, we find that chiral crystal RhGe hosts chiral phonon modes with a phonon angular momentum (PAM) and an associated phonon magnetic moment (PMM), everywhere in the BZ except at high symmetry points such as $\Gamma$, R, X and M. The PAM and PMM are large along the chiral rotation axis and also in the vicinity of the topological nodes. Our study also reveals that all the topological phonon modes are chiral. However, the reverse is not always true. Among other things, our finding of the coexistence of topological and chiral phonon modes in chiral RhGe not only deepens our understanding of the phonon behavior in the CoSi-family but also opens new pathways for developing advanced materials and devices.

Title: Tightly bound solitons and vortices in three-dimensional bosonic condensates with the electromagnetically-induced gravity
Authors: Zibin Zhao, Guilong Li, Huanbo Luo, Bin Liu, Guihua Chen, Boris A. Malomed, Yongyao Li
Abstract: The $1/r$ long-range interaction, induced by laser illumination, offers a mechanism for the implementation of stable self-trapping in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in the three-dimensional free space. Using the variational approximation and numerical solutions, we find that self-trapped states in this setting , with attractive nonlocal and repulsive local interactions, resemble tightly-bound compactons. However, these are not true compactons but rather \textit{tightly self-trapped modes} (TSTMs), with small-amplitude nonvanishing tails. The structure of the self-trapped states is explained by an analytical solution for their tails. Further, we demonstrate that stable % TSTMs with embedded vorticity, exist in the same setting, with winding numbers up to $S=6$ (at least). Addressing two-TSTM interactions, we find that pairs of ground states (GSs, with $S=0$), as well as vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex pairs (with $S_1=S_2$ and $S_1=-S_2$, respectively), form stably rotating bound states. Head-on collisions between vortex TSTMs, set in slow motion by kicks, are inelastic, resulting in their merger into a GS soliton, that may either remain at the collision position or move aside, shedding the angular momentum with emitted radiation, or, alternatively, lead to the formation of a vortex that also moves aside.

Title: Deep Learning Accelerated Quantum Transport Simulations in Nanoelectronics: From Break Junctions to Field-Effect Transistors
Authors: Jijie Zou, Zhanghao Zhouyin, Dongying Lin, Yike Huang, Linfeng Zhang, Shimin Hou, Qiangqiang Gu
Abstract: Quantum transport simulations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices, yet the long-standing trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency has limited their practical applications. We present DeePTB-NEGF, an integrated framework combining deep learning tight-binding Hamiltonian prediction with non-equilibrium Green's Function methodology to enable accurate quantum transport simulations in open boundary conditions with 2-3 orders of magnitude acceleration. We demonstrate DeePTB-NEGF through two challenging applications: comprehensive break junction simulations with over $10^4$ snapshots, showing excellent agreement with experimental conductance histograms; and carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FET) at experimental dimensions, reproducing measured transfer characteristics for a 41 nm channel CNT-FET ($\sim 8000$ atoms, $3\times10^4$ orbitals) and predicting zero-bias transmission spectra for a 180 nm CNT ($\sim 3\times 10^4$ atoms, $10^5$ orbitals), showcasing the framework's capability for large-scale device simulations. Our systematic studies across varying geometries confirm the necessity of simulating realistic experimental structures for precise predictions. DeePTB-NEGF bridges the longstanding gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a scalable tool for high-throughput and large-scale quantum transport simulations that enables previously inaccessible nanoscale device investigations.

Title: Anisotropic, multiband, and strong-coupling superconductivity of the Pb0.64Bi0.36 alloy
Authors: Sylwia Gutowska, Karolina Górnicka, Paweł Wójcik, Tomasz Klimczuk, Bartlomiej Wiendlocha
Abstract: This paper presents theoretical and experimental studies on the superconductivity of Pb${_{0.64}}$Bi$_{0.36}$ alloy, which is a prototype of strongly coupled superconductors and exhibits one of the strongest coupling under ambient pressure among the materials studied so far. The critical temperature, the specific heat in the superconducting state, and the magnetic critical fields are experimentally determined. Deviations from the single-gap s-wave BCS-like behavior are observed. The electronic structure, phonons and electron-phonon interactions are analyzed in relation to the metallic Pb, explaining why the Pb-Bi alloy exhibits such a large value of the electron-phonon coupling parameter $\lambda \simeq 2$. Superconductivity is studied using the isotropic Eliashberg formalism as well as the anisotropic density functional theory for superconductors. We find that while Pb is a two-gap superconductor with well-defined separate superconducting gaps, in the Pb-Bi alloy an overlapped three-gap-like structure is formed with a strong anisotropy. Furthermore, the chemical disorder, inherent to this alloy, leads to strong electron scattering, which is found to reduce the critical temperature.

Title: Dynamic self-loops in networks of passive and active binary elements
Authors: Paul Baconnier, Margot H. Teunisse, Martin van Hecke
Abstract: Models of coupled binary elements capture memory effects in complex dissipative materials, such as transient responses or sequential computing, when their interactions are chosen appropriately. However, for random interactions, self-loops - cyclic transition sequences incompatible with dissipative dynamics - dominate the response and undermine statistical approaches. Here we reveal that self-loops originate from energy injection and limit cycles in the underlying physical system. We furthermore introduce interaction ensembles that strongly suppress or completely eliminate self-loops, allowing statistical studies of memory in large dissipative systems. Our work opens a route towards a unified description of passive and active multistable materials using hysteron models.

Title: Anomalous Continuous Translations
Authors: Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories where the Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantum theory by an Adler-Bell-Jackiw-like anomaly. In particular, the continuous translation symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the quantum theory to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.

Title: Elastic tensor-derived properties of composition-dependent disordered refractory binary alloys using DFPT
Authors: Surya T. Bijjala, Susan R. Atlas, Pankaj Kumar
Abstract: The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Traditional stress-strain methods have made it possible to compute elastic constants for ordered structures and individually tailored alloy compositions. However, this approach depends on predetermined or iteratively-chosen strain tensors. This poses a significant challenge for systematic, composition-dependent studies of disordered materials with low symmetry. DFPT provides a compelling alternative to stress-strain methods: it allows for an unbiased determination of the elastic tensor, as well as access to local field data derived from the underlying general response function framework. Despite its intrinsic flexibility and efficiency, DFPT has seen limited application to the study of disordered systems. At the same time, there is a growing need for expanded quantum mechanical data to improve predictive modeling of complex disordered material properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using DFPT, for a comprehensive set of structural refractory BCC binary alloys of Mo, Nb, Ta, and W. We map the quantum-driven heterogeneity in elastic constants and shear modulus, and associated relaxation fields at each disordered structure lattice site, by computing the force response internal strain tensor and displacement response internal strain tensors. Derived properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), Pugh's ratio ($B/G$), Cauchy pressure and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all refractory binaries. The DFPT-computed mechanical properties data for the refractory binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data.

Title: Magnetic phases of the periodic Anderson model in two dimensions
Authors: Imre Hagymási
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the periodic Anderson model on the square lattice across various band fillings. Employing the infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) technique, we can determine the magnetic ground states accurately and compare them to mean-field predictions to highlight the effects of quantum fluctuations. At half-filling, we analyze the transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic (Kondo singlet) phases as a function of hybridization and $f$-level energy, finding excellent agreement with existing quantum Monte Carlo studies in the case of hybridization. For $n = 1.5$ electrons per site, we identify a novel correlated antiferromagnetic diagonal stripe phase as the ground state, which competes with its ferromagnetic partner state.

Title: Soft ULC Microgels at the Interface Interact and Flow as Hertzian-Like Colloids
Authors: José Ruiz-Franco, Tom Höfken, Maximilian M. Schmidt, Steffen Bochenek, Emanuela Zaccarelli, Andrea Scotti
Abstract: Soft pair potentials predict a reentrant liquid phase for high concentrations, a behavior not observed experimentally. Here, very soft microgels confined at an oil-water interface are used as a model system of particles interacting via a soft potential in 2D. Interfacial rheology measurements demonstrate the existence of different flow regimes that depend on the compression of the monolayer. Such a compression also leads to a non-monotonic variation of the elastic moduli and of the yield stress of the monolayer. These results, together with the equilibrium phase behavior of the monolayer, are reproduced in molecular dynamics simulations of a 2D system of particles interacting with a Hertzian-like potential. Remarkably, due to the non-monotonic variation of the elastic moduli, we observe \textit{isoelastic} points where the monolayer shows the same stiffness at very different concentrations. These points are the experimental manifestation of the predicted reentrant liquid phase.

Title: Critical Dynamics of Spin Boson Model
Authors: M. G. Vasin, S. V. Remizov, A. A. Elistratov
Abstract: In this work, we study the low-energy properties of the spin-boson model (SBM), which describes the dynamics of a 1/2 spin associated with a thermostat characterized by a power law spectral density, $f(\omega)\propto \omega^s$. The theoretical description is constructed in the Schwinger--Keldysh technique, based on the representation of the 1/2-spin by Majorana spinors. We study the critical dynamics of the system near the quantum phase transition by constructing and analyzing the system of renormalization group equations. Our theoretical approach is more universal, contrary to the one based on quantum-classical mapping, since it is applicable for $s\leq 1$. We show that in both the ohmic case $s=1$, and the weakly subohmic case $s\lesssim 1$, the second order quantum phase transition is observed in the model considered, and the critical magnetization exponent agrees with the exact hyperscaling result, $1/\delta=(1-s)/(1+s)$. Furthermore, we obtain the dependence of the critical value of the spin-boson coupling constant on the temperature of the ohmic bosonic thermal bath.

Title: Two-dimensional spectroscopy of bosonic collective excitations in disordered many-body systems
Authors: Alex Gómez Salvador, Ivan Morera, Marios H. Michael, Pavel E. Dolgirev, Danica Pavicevic, Albert Liu, Andrea Cavalleri, Eugene Demler
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical approach for computing and analyzing two-dimensional spectroscopy of bosonic collective excitations in disordered many-body systems. Specifically, we employ the Keldysh formalism to derive, within a non-pertubative treatment of disorder effects, the third-order nonlinear response and obtain two-dimensional spectroscopy maps. In the weak nonlinear regime of our formalism, we demonstrate the ability of the echo peak to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes, in perfect agreement with the intuition developed in isolated two-level systems. Furthermore, we discuss unique many-body effects on the echo peak signature arising from interaction induced quantum fluctuations. In particular, we show that these quantum fluctuations induce a finite nonrephasable broadening and examine how the echo peak is influenced by the attractive or repulsive nature of the collective excitations.

Title: Deep Spin Defects in Zinc Oxide for High-Fidelity Single-Shot Readout
Authors: Shimin Zhang, Taejoon Park, Erik Perez, Kejun Li, Xingyi Wang, Masoud Mansouri, Yanyong Wang, Jorge D Vega Bazantes, Ruiqi Zhang, Jianwei Sun, Kai-Mei C. Fu, Hosung Seo, Yuan Ping
Abstract: Wide-band gap oxides such as ZnO offer a favorable environment for spin defect qubits due to their dilute nuclear spin background and potential for ultra-high purity. Identifying deep-level defect qubits is essential for room-temperature optical initialization and quantum emission, robust against environmental noise. In this work, we theoretically design deep-level point defects in ZnO with optimal physical properties for optically-addressable spin qubits. By employing first-principles calculations, we predict that the molybdenum-vacancy complex has promising spin and optical properties, including a spin-triplet ground state, optically-allowable transition in the visible range with a high quantum yield, and an exceptionally small Huang-Rhys factor around 5, compared to 10-30 in known defects in ZnO. In particular, we found a long spin decoherence T2 time at 4 ms after considering both nuclear spin baths and paramagnetic impurity baths' interactions, with the latter dominant at impurity concentration above 0.035 ppm. Finally, we predict the energy diagram with spin-selective intersystem crossing for a spin-photon interface, and suggest the protocols for efficient optical readout. With a strong spin-orbit coupling and the absence of Jahn-Teller distortion in the proposed defect, we reveal that it supports high-fidelity single-shot readout of electron-spin at high temperature and a wide range of magnetic field.

Title: Counterflow of lattice polarons in harmonically confined optical lattices
Authors: Felipe Isaule, Abel Rojo-Francàs, Luis Morales-Molina, Bruno Juliá-Díaz
Abstract: We study a mobile impurity in a one-dimensional harmonically confined optical lattice interacting repulsively with a bosonic bath. The behavior of the impurity across baths with superfluid and Mott-insulator domains is examined, including its full back-action effect on the bath. We characterize the bath-impurity phase diagram and reveal the appearance of a correlated counterflow phase, which we support with an analytical model for a mobile impurity-hole pair. This phase shows an extended combined insulator domain of unity filling but no independent domain of constant density. The transition to this phase features a sudden orthogonality and the change of the shape of the impurity's profile to that of a free particle in an infinite square well. The findings of this work suggest the appearance of unconventional counterflow in trapped imbalanced atomic mixtures.

Title: Energy diffusion in the long-range interacting spin systems
Authors: Hideaki Nishikawa, Keiji Saito
Abstract: We investigate energy diffusion in long-range interacting spin systems, where the interaction decays algebraically as $V(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $r$ between the sites. We consider prototypical spin systems, the transverse Ising model, and the XYZ model in the $D$-dimensional lattice with finite $\alpha >D$ which guarantees the thermodynamic extensivity. In one dimension, both normal and anomalous diffusion are observed, where the anomalous diffusion is attributed to anomalous enhancement of the amplitude of the equilibrium current correlation. We prove the power-law clustering property of arbitrary orders of joint cumulants in general dimensions. Applying this theorem to equal-time current correlations, we further prove several theorems leading to the statement that the sufficient condition for normal diffusion in one dimension is $\alpha > 3/2$ regardless of the models. The fluctuating hydrodynamics approach consistently explains Lévy diffusion for $\alpha < 3/2$, which implies the condition is optimal. In higher dimensions of $D \geq 2$, normal diffusion is indicated as long as $\alpha > D$.

Title: Sliding ferroelectric control of unconventional magnetism in stacked bilayers
Authors: Yongqian Zhu, Mingqiang Gu, Yuntian Liu, Xiaobing Chen, Yuhui Li, Shixuan Du, Qihang Liu
Abstract: The control of unconventional magnetism, which displays ferromagnetism-like properties with compensated magnetization, has drawn intense attention for advancing antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, through symmetry analysis, we propose a general stacking rule, characterized by a connection operator linking two stacked bilayers, for controlling unconventional magnetism via sliding ferroelectricity. Such rule enables the simultaneous switching of both electric polarization and nonrelativistic spin splitting or anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets, a class of collinear unconventional magnets. By comprehensively surveying the 80 layer groups, we identify all the stacking orders that allow for such two types of simultaneous switching. Furthermore, we extend the stacking rule to collinear compensated ferrimagnets, where the opposite-spin sublattices are not connected by any symmetry operator, yet the net magnetization remains zero. Combined with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the sliding ferroelectric control of spin polarization and anomalous Hall effect in the altermagnetic AgF2 and Fe2MoSe4 bilayers. Our work provides a symmetry strategy for achieving ferroelectric control of unconventional magnetism in bilayer systems and opens avenues for exploring new types of magnetoelectric coupling.

Železný, A.-L. Barra, C. Faugeras, J. Volný, K. Uhlířová, L. Nádvorník, M. Veis, K. Výborný, M. Orlita
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic resonance in a bulk $\alpha$-MnTe crystal is investigated using both frequency-domain and time-domain THz spectroscopy techniques. At low temperatures, an excitation at the photon energy of $(3.5\pm 0.1)$~meV is observed and identified as a magnon mode through its distinctive dependence on temperature and magnetic field. This behavior is reproduced using a simplified model for antiferromagnetic resonance in an easy-plane antiferromagnet. The results of our experiments, when compared to exchange constants established in the literature, allow us to extract the out-of-plane component of the single-ion magnetic anisotropy reaching $(40\pm10)$~$\mu$eV.

Title: Elongated vortex quantum droplets in binary Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Guilong Li, Zibin Zhao, Rui Zhang, Zhaopin Chen, Bin Liu, Boris A. Malomed, Yongyao Li
Abstract: Stability of elongated (``slender") quantum droplets (QDs) with embedded unitary and multiple vorticity is a problem that was not solved previously. In this work, we propose a solution which relies upon the use of the spatial modulation of the inter-species scattering length in the binary Bose-Einstein condensates, in the form of a two-dimensional axisymmetric Gaussian, shaped by means of the optical Feshbach resonance. The corresponding effective nonlinear trapping potential supports completely stable elongated QDs with vorticity $S=0$ and partly stable families of elongated QDs with $S=1,2,3,4$ (other nonlinear systems do not maintain stability of vortex droplets with $\geq 2$). We systematically analyze effects of the amplitude and width of the Gaussian modulation, as well as the total number of atoms, on the shape and stability of the QDs, some effects being explained analytically. Collisions between identical QDs with $% S=1$ moving in opposite directions along the central axis leads to their merger into still more elongated breathing QDs with the same vorticity, while collisions between QDs with $S=\pm 1$ are quasi-elastic. Moving modulation profiles are able to adiabatically rotate the trapped elongated QDs. Application of a torque to the vector QD sets in the gyroscopic regime of robust precession, which realizes a macroscopic spin-orbit-coupling effect.

Title: Volume dependence of microwave induced excess quasiparticles in superconducting resonators
Authors: Steven A. H. de Rooij, Jochem J. A. Baselmans, Juan Bueno, Vignesh Murugesan, David J. Thoen, Pieter J. de Visser
Abstract: The presence of quasiparticles typically degrades the performance of superconducting microwave circuits. The readout signal can generate non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which lead to excess microwave loss and decoherence. To understand this effect quantitatively, we measure quasiparticle fluctuations and extract the quasiparticle density across different temperatures, readout powers, and resonator volumes. We find that microwave power generates a higher quasiparticle density as the active resonator volume is reduced and show that this effect sets a sensitivity limit on kinetic inductance detectors. We compare our results with theoretical models of direct microwave photon absorption by quasiparticles and conclude that an unknown, indirect mechanism plays a dominant role in quasiparticle generation. These results provide a route to mitigate quasiparticle generation due to readout power in superconducting devices.

Title: Extended Fractional Chern Insulators Near Half Flux in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Above the Magic Angle
Authors: Joe Finney, Aaron L. Sharpe, Linsey K. Rodenbach, Jian Kang, Xiaoyu Wang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Marc A. Kastner, Oskar Vafek, David Goldhaber-Gordon
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) -- the lattice analog of fractional quantum Hall states -- form as fractionalized quasiparticles emerge in a partially-filled Chern band. This fractionalization is driven by the interplay of electronic interaction and quantum geometry of the underlying wavefunctions. Bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist near the magic angle of 1.1\textdegree\ hosts diverse correlated electronic states at zero magnetic field. When the twist angle exceeds 1.3\textdegree, the electronic bandwidth is sufficient to suppress the zero-field correlated states. Yet applying a magnetic field can restore the importance of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report strongly-correlated phases when a 1.37\textdegree\ twisted bilayer graphene sample is tuned to near half a magnetic flux quantum per moiré cell, deep into the Hofstadter regime. Most notably, well-quantized odd-denominator FCI states appear in multiple Hofstadter subbands over unusually large ranges of density. We also observe a bending and resetting of the Landau minifan reminiscent of behavior commonly seen in magic-angle samples near integer filling at low magnetic field.

Title: Interaction-Induced Higher-Order Topological Insulator via Floquet Engineering
Authors: Chun-Ping Su, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.

Title: Elasticity of a Freely Jointed Chain with Quenched Disorder
Authors: Minsu Yi, Panayotis Benetatos
Abstract: We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.

Title: Intermediate phases in $α$-RuCl$_3$ under in-plane magnetic field via interlayer spin interactions
Authors: Jiefu Cen, Hae-Young Kee
Abstract: $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has attracted significant attention as a prime candidate for the spin-1/2 Kitaev spin liquid in two-dimensional honeycomb lattices. Although its ground state is magnetically ordered, the order is suppressed under a moderate in-plane magnetic field. The intermediate regime of the field has exotic behaviors, some of which are claimed to originate from a Kitaev spin liquid. In resolving debates surrounding these behaviors, interlayer interactions in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have been largely overlooked due to their perceived weakness in van der Waals materials. However, near the transition, they may become significant as the field energy approaches the interlayer coupling scale. Here we investigate the effects of interlayer couplings in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with $R\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ structures. We first examine their effects on the transition temperature ($T_N$) using classical Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the interlayer couplings have minimal effects on $T_N$, and the different $T_N$ between the two structures are mainly due to the anisotropy in intralayer interactions. Focusing on the $R{\bar 3}$ structure, we show that the nearest neighbor interlayer interaction is the XXZ type due to the symmetry, and the next nearest neighbor interaction of the Kitaev type is crucial for the transition between two zigzag orders under an in-plane field. Furthermore, an intermediate phase with a large unit cell emerges due to the interlayer interactions. Our findings provide insights into the exotic behaviors and sample dependence reported in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

Title: Multiparty entanglement loops in quantum spin liquids
Authors: Liuke Lyu, Deeksha Chandorkar, Samarth Kapoor, So Takei, Erik S. Sørensen, William Witczak-Krempa
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) give rise to exotic emergent particles by weaving intricate entanglement patterns in the underlying electrons. Bipartite measures between subregions can detect the presence of anyons, but little is known about the full entanglement structure of QSLs. Here, we study the multiparty entanglement of QSLs via entanglement microscopy. We find that in contrast to conventional matter, the genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) between spins is absent in the smallest subregions, a phenomenon we call "entanglement frustration". Instead, GME is more collective, and arises solely in loops. By exploiting exact results and large-scale numerics, we confirm these properties in various gapped and gapless QSLs realised in physically motivated Hamiltonians, as well as with string-net wavefunctions hosting abelian or non-abelian anyons. Our results shed new light on the phase diagram of Kitaev's honeycomb model in a Zeeman field, and the Kagome Heisenberg model under various perturbations. Going beyond QSLs, we provide evidence that entanglement loops are a universal property of quantum gauge theories. This leads to a new understanding of fractionalization, and the means by which gauge bosons encode quantum information.

Title: Ferroelastic Altermagnetism
Authors: Rui Peng, Shibo Fang, Pin Ho, Tong Zhou, Junwei Liu, Yee Sin Ang
Abstract: Synergizing altermagnetism and other ferroic orders, such as ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 106801 (2025) and ibid. 106802 (2025)], offers an effective route to achieve nonvolatile switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. In this work, by synergizing altermagnetism and ferroelasticity, we propose the concept of ferroelastic altermagnets in which the ferroelastic crystal reorientation can drive multistate nonvolatile switching of the altermagnetic spin splitting via altermagnetoelastic effect. Using monolayers RuF4 and CuF2 as material candidates, we demonstrate 2-state and 3-state altermagnetic spin splitting switching as driven by ferroelastic strain states. Transport calculation shows that multistate spin conductivities can be ferroelastically encoded in an ferroelastic altermagnet, thus suggesting the potential of ferroelastic altermagnetic as nonvolatile nanomechanical spin switches. The proposed concept of ferroelastic altermagnetism enriches the emerging landscape of multiferroic altermagnetism, paving a way towards altermagnetic-based straintronic device applications.

Title: Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: Saeid Ansari, R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, Mehdi Abdi
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.

Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r$^2$SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r$^2$SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r$^2$SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX uses different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX enhances the r$^2$SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+$U$. The O$_2$ overbinding in r$^2$SCAN (~0.3 eV/O$_2$) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN50, minimizing r$^2$SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r$^2$SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r$^2$SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN, which is 10 to 300x faster than r$^2$SCAN10.

Title: A Rigorous Foundation for Stochastic Thermodynamics via the Microcanonical Ensemble
Authors: Xiangjun Xing (Wilczek Quantum Center, School of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China)
Abstract: We consider a small Hamiltonian system strongly interacting with a much larger Hamiltonian system (the bath), while being driven by both a time-dependent control parameter and non-conservative forces. The joint system is assumed to be thermally isolated. Under the assumption of time-scale separation (TSS)--where the bath equilibrates much faster than the system and the external driving--the bath remains in instantaneous equilibrium, described by the microcanonical ensemble conditioned on the system state and the control parameter. We identify a decomposition of the total Hamiltonian that renders the bath energy an adiabatic invariant under slow evolution. This same decomposition defines the system Hamiltonian as the Hamiltonian of mean force, and ensures that neither the system nor the control parameter does reactive work on the bath. Using time-reversal symmetry and TSS, and without invoking any model details, we rigorously prove that the reduced dynamics of the system is Markovian and satisfies a form of local detailed balance (LDB) which involves transition probabilities but not path probabilities. By working entirely within the microcanonical framework and adopting a precise decomposition of the total energy, we provide rigorous definitions of bath entropy as the Boltzmann entropy, and of heat as the negative change of the bath energy. Our approach bypasses the ambiguities associated with conventional definitions of thermodynamic variables and path probabilities, and establishes a rigorous and thermodynamically consistent foundation for stochastic thermodynamics, valid even under strong system-bath coupling.

Title: Scaling, Fractal Dynamics and Critical Exponents: Application in a non-integer dimensional Ising model
Authors: Henrique A. de Lima, Ismael S. S. Carrasco, Marcio Santos, Fernando A. Oliveira
Abstract: Moving beyond simple associations, researchers need tools to quantify how variables influence each other in space and time. Correlation functions provide a mathematical framework for characterizing these essential dependencies, revealing insights into causality, structure, and hidden patterns within complex systems. In physical systems with many degrees of freedom, such as gases, liquids, and solids, a statistical analysis of these correlations is essential. For a field $\Psi(\vec{x},t)$ that depends on spatial position $\vec{x}$ and time $t$, it is often necessary to understand the correlation with itself at another position and time $\Psi(\vec{x}_0,t_0)$. This specific function is called the autocorrelation function. In this context, the autocorrelation function for order--parameter fluctuations, introduced by Fisher, provides an important mathematical framework for understanding the second-order phase transition at equilibrium. However, his analysis is restricted to a Euclidean space of dimension $d$, and an exponent $\eta$ is introduced to correct the spatial behavior of the correlation function at $T=T_c$. In recent work, Lima et al demonstrated that at $T_c$ a fractal analysis is necessary for a complete description of the correlation function. In this study, we investigate the fundamental physics and mathematics underlying phase transitions. In particular, we show that the application of modern fractional differentials allows us to write down an equation for the correlation function that recovers the correct exponents below the upper critical dimension. We obtain the exact expression for the Fisher exponent $\eta$. Furthermore, we examine the Rushbrooke scaling relation, which has been questioned in certain magnetic systems, and, drawing on results from the Ising model, we confirm that both our relations and the Rushbrooke scaling law hold even when $d$ is not an integer.

Title: Searching for evidence of strengthening from short-range order in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy
Authors: Novin Rasooli, Matthew Daly
Abstract: The coupling of strength to short-range order (SRO) in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy remains debated, with conflicting reports supporting and opposing SRO-induced strengthening continuing to emerge. A direct observation of this effect is elusive, due to difficulties in the quantification of SRO. Here, we deliver a structurally agnostic analysis that instead searches for unusual patterns in crystal size effects as evidence of SRO-induced strengthening. For this purpose, we assemble a large dataset of strengthening measurements drawn from a range of thermomechanical processing conditions known to produce SRO. Based on a comparative analysis with pure metal benchmarks, we find no evidence for significant coupling of SRO to strengthening in CrCoNi, and that patterns suggesting a positive finding may be explained by cross-study measurement scatter. Nevertheless, we leverage our analysis to provide an upper bound estimate of SRO-induced strengthening in the unlikely scenario where other sources of scatter are negligible.

Title: Longitudinal magnon transport properties in the easy-axis XXZ Heisenberg ferromagnet on the face-centered cubic lattice
Authors: M. R. Parymuda
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in the $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-axis exchange anisotropy ($\Delta>1$) on a face-centered cubic lattice consisting of four sublattices. We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.

Title: Gate Voltage-Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy Effect on Pt-Porphyrin functionalized single-layer graphene
Authors: Ambika Shanker Shukla, Abhishek Erram, Heston Alfred Mendonca, Deepak Kumar, Akanksha Chouhan, Ashwin A. Tulapurkar
Abstract: We report a novel approach to engineering large voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) and enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at the interface of single-layer graphene (SLG) and NiFe (Py) through non-covalent functionalization with Platinum (II) 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl porphyrin (Pt-porphyrin). Using chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown SLG, we demonstrate that Pt-porphyrin functionalization significantly increases the SOC and enables robust voltage modulation of interfacial magnetic anisotropy, as confirmed by spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements. A substantial VCMA coefficient of 375.6 (fJ/(V-m)) is achieved, accompanied by an order-of-magnitude enhancement in spin torque efficiency ({\theta}sh) compared to pristine SLG. The resonance field exhibits a clear, reversible shift under applied gate voltage, confirming robust electric-field modulation of interfacial magnetic anisotropy. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirm the structural integrity and effective charge transfer at the functionalized interface. Electrical characterization of back-gated graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) further reveals tunable electronic properties upon functionalization. Our results establish functionalized graphene/ferromagnet interfaces as a promising platform for low-power, voltage-controlled spintronic devices, paving the way for scalable, energy-efficient memory and logic technologies

Title: Periodic Drive Induced Half-Metallic Phase in Insulators and Correlated Metals
Authors: Suryashekhar Kusari, Arnab Das, H. R. Krishnamurthy, Arti Garg
Abstract: Non-equilibrium control of electronic properties in condensed matter systems can result in novel phenomena. In this work, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize half-metallic phases. We explore the periodically driven Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a periodic drive can transform a weakly interacting metal into a ferrimagnetic half-metal. We consider a Fermi-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbour hopping and stabilize the elusive phase simply by driving the site potentials periodically. The drive induces staggered second and third-neighbor hopping and a staggered potential between two sublattices in the Floquet Hamiltonian, whose ground state is explored in this work. Close to the dynamical freezing point, due to the suppression of nearest neighbor hopping in the driven system, an effective enhancement of various terms in the Floquet Hamiltonian, including the e-e interactions, occurs. This helps in stabilizing a broad ferrimagnetic half-metallic phase for a wide range of system parameters. The half-metallic phase achieved in the presence of high drive frequency should be stable for exponentially large time scales in drive frequency and could be perpetually stable beyond a strong enough drive amplitude owing to dynamical freezing. It can hence have potential applications in stable spintronics and other upcoming quantum technologies.

Title: Strange metal and Fermi arcs from disordering spin stripes
Authors: Xu Zhang, Nick Bultinck
Abstract: We revisit the effective theory for fluctuating spin stripes coupled to a Fermi surface, and consider the parameter regime where a spin nematic phase intervenes between the spin density wave state and the symmetric state. It is shown that adding potential disorder to this theory, which acts as an unconventional type of random-field disorder, naturally gives rise to the universal theory of strange metals with spatial disorder in both the magnitude and sign of the electron-boson coupling term [A.A. Patel, H. Guo, I. Esterlis and S. Sachdev, Science 381, 790 (2023)]. One difference compared to the original theory, however, is that at non-zero temperatures the disordered spin-stripe model automatically self-averages over the sign of the coupling. We also study the effects of thermal fluctuations in a phenomenological model for the disordered spin density wave state, and find from Monte Carlo simulations that a short anti-ferromagnetic correlation length (order 4-5 lattice constants) already leads to pronounced Fermi arcs in the electronic spectral weight.

Title: Enhanced superconductivity via layer differentiation in trilayer Hubbard model
Authors: Xun Liu, Mi Jiang
Abstract: Motivated by the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in multilayer cuprates,we investigated the trilayer Hubbard model by adopting the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Focusing on the systems with hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) higher than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL are generically beneficial for global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the possibility of $d$-wave superconductivity solely hosted in the IL. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.

Title: Rate Function Modelling of Quantum Many-Body Adiabaticity
Authors: Vibhu Mishra, Salvatore Manmana, Stefan Kehrein
Abstract: The quantum adiabatic theorem is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics, with a multitude of applications, both theoretical and practical. Here, we investigate the dynamics of adiabatic processes for quantum many-body systems %in detail by analysing the properties of observable-free, intensive quantities. In particular, we study the adiabatic rate function $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in dependence of the ramp time $T$, which gives us a complete characterization of the many-body adiabatic fidelity as a function of $T$ and the strength of the parameter displacement $\Delta \lambda$. $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ quantifies the deviation from adiabaticity for a given process and therefore allows us to control and define the notion of adiabaticity in many-body systems. First we study $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ for the 1D transverse field Ising model and the Luttinger liquid, both of which are quadratic systems and therefore allow us to look at the thermodynamic limit. For ramps across gapped phases, we relate $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ to the transition probability of the system and for ramps across a gapless point, or gapless phase we relate it to the excitation density of the relevant quasiparticles. Then we investigate the XXZ model which allows us to see the qualitative features that survive when interactions are turned on. Several key results in the literature regarding the interplay of the thermodynamic and the adiabatic limit are obtained as inferences from the properties of $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in the large $T$ limit.

Title: Quantum master equation for many-body systems: Derivation based on the Lieb-Robinson bound
Authors: Koki Shiraishi, Masaya Nakagawa, Takashi Mori, Masahito Ueda
Abstract: The local Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) quantum master equation is a powerful tool for the study of open quantum many-body systems. However, its microscopic derivation applicable to many-body systems is available only in limited cases of weak internal couplings, and it has yet to be fully understood under what microscopic conditions the local GKSL equation is valid. We derive the local GKSL equation on the basis of the Lieb-Robinson bound, which provides an upper bound of the propagation of information in quantum many-body systems. We numerically test the validity of the derived local GKSL equation for a one-dimensional tight-binding fermion chain.

Abstract: A universal quantum computer can simulate diverse quantum systems, with electronic structure for chemistry offering challenging problems for practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. While current quantum processors have reached this size, deep circuits and large number of measurements lead to prohibitive runtimes for quantum computers in isolation. Here, we demonstrate the use of classical distributed computing to offload all but an intrinsically quantum component of a workflow for electronic structure simulations. Using a Heron superconducting processor and the supercomputer Fugaku, we simulate the ground-state dissociation of N$_2$ and the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, with circuits up to 77 qubits and 10,570 gates. The proposed algorithm processes quantum samples to produce upper bounds for the ground-state energy and sparse approximations to the ground-state wavefunctions. Our results suggest that, for current error rates, a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture can tackle challenging chemistry problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization.

Title: Chern-Simons modification of Fluid Mechanics
Authors: P.B. Wiegmann
Abstract: We show that the hydrodynamics of a perfect fluid admits a natural modification that incorporates a chiral gravitational anomaly (also known as a mixed gauge-gravity anomaly) alongside the chiral current anomaly. This modification introduces in parallel a gravitational and gauge Chern-Simons terms in a manner analogous to the Jackiw-Pi Chern-Simons modification of gravity, and features an axion in fluid mechanics. As a result, flows of a spinless perfect fluid acquire spin through motion, with the spin being equal to the fluid helicity. Furthermore, spacetime curvature induces an analogue of the Mathisson-Papapetrou force and a geometric counterpart of the chiral magnetic effect.

Title: Deep learning lattice gauge theories
Authors: Anuj Apte, Anthony Ashmore, Clay Cordova, Tzu-Chen Huang
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods have led to profound insights into the strong-coupling behaviour of lattice gauge theories and produced remarkable results such as first-principles computations of hadron masses. Despite tremendous progress over the last four decades, fundamental challenges such as the sign problem and the inability to simulate real-time dynamics remain. Neural network quantum states have emerged as an alternative method that seeks to overcome these challenges. In this work, we use gauge-invariant neural network quantum states to accurately compute the ground state of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in $2+1$ dimensions. Using transfer learning, we study the distinct topological phases and the confinement phase transition of these theories. For $\mathbb{Z}_2$, we identify a continuous transition and compute critical exponents, finding excellent agreement with existing numerics for the expected Ising universality class. In the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ case, we observe a weakly first-order transition and identify the critical coupling. Our findings suggest that neural network quantum states are a promising method for precise studies of lattice gauge theory.

Title: Probing quantum complexity via universal saturation of stabilizer entropies
Authors: Tobias Haug, Leandro Aolita, M.S. Kim
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on Rényi index $\alpha$. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of $\alpha$. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for $\alpha>1$, while is a constant for $\alpha<1$. This highlights that $\alpha$-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on $\alpha$: $\alpha$-SREs with $\alpha<1$ relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while $\alpha>1$ probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE. Our results opens up new approaches to characterize the complexity of quantum systems.

Title: Anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order
Authors: Ken Kikuchi, Kah-Sen Kam, Fu-Hsiang Huang
Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected étale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.

Title: Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. II: Dispersive phonons
Authors: Michael K.-H. Kiessling, Boris L. Altshuler, Emil A. Yuzbashyan
Abstract: The standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied, in which the effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by generally dispersive phonons, with Eliashberg spectral function $\alpha^2 F(\omega)\geq 0$ that is $\propto\omega^2$ for small $\omega>0$ and vanishes for large $\omega$. The Eliashberg function also defines the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda:= 2 \int_0^\infty\frac{\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega$. Setting $\frac{2\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega =: \lambda P(d\omega)$, formally defining a probability measure $P(d\omega)$ with compact support, and assuming as usual that the phase transition between normal and superconductivity coincides with the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, it is shown that $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ is a graph of a function $\Lambda(P,T)$ that is determined by a variational principle: if $(\lambda,P,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{k}(P,T)$, where $\mathfrak{k}(P,T)>0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences constructed in the paper. Given $P$, sufficient conditions on $T$ are stated under which the map $T\mapsto \lambda = \Lambda(P,T)$ is invertible. For sufficiently large $\lambda$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c$ as function of $\lambda$ and $P$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $T_c(\lambda,P)$ that converges to $T_c(\lambda,P)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,P)$. It agrees with the asymptotic form $T_c(\lambda,P) \sim C \sqrt{\langle \omega^2\rangle} \sqrt{\lambda}$ valid for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $P$, though with a constant $C$ that is a factor $\approx 2.034$ larger than the sharp constant. Here, $\langle\omega^2\rangle := \int_0^\infty \omega^2 P(d\omega)$.

Title: A Counterdiabatic Route to Entanglement Steering and Dynamical Freezing in the Floquet Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model
Authors: Nakshatra Gangopadhay, Sayan Choudhury
Abstract: Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Intriguingly, CD driving generates spin squeezing and its associated metrologically useful multipartite entanglement at the mid-point of every drive cycle, when the system is initially prepared in a fully x-polarized state. The CD driving induced non-ergodic dynamics is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.

Authors: Álvaro Perales-Eceiza, Toby Cubitt, Mile Gu, David Pérez-García, Michael M. Wolf
Abstract: The study of undecidability in problems arising from physics has experienced a renewed interest, mainly in connection with quantum information problems. The goal of this review is to survey this recent development. After a historical introduction, we first explain the necessary results about undecidability in mathematics and computer science. Then we briefly review the first results about undecidability in physics which emerged mostly in the 80s and early 90s. Finally we focus on the most recent contributions, which we divide in two main categories: many body systems and quantum information problems.

Title: Multipartite entanglement structures in quantum stabilizer states
Authors: Vaibhav Sharma, Erich J Mueller
Abstract: We develop a method for visualizing the internal structure of multipartite entanglement in pure stabilizer states. Our algorithm graphically organizes the many-body correlations in a hierarchical structure. This provides a rich taxonomy from which one can simultaneously extract many quantitative features of a state including some traditional quantities such as entanglement depth, k-uniformity and entanglement entropy. Our method also presents an alternative computational tool for extracting the exact entanglement depth and all separable partitions of a stabilizer state. Our construction is gauge invariant and goes beyond traditional entanglement measures by visually revealing how quantum information and entanglement is distributed. We use this tool to analyze the internal structures of prototypical stabilizer states (GHZ state, cluster state, stabilizer error correction codes) and are able to contrast the complexity of highly entangled volume law states generated by random unitary operators and random projective measurements.

Title: Order in disorder: increased carrier mobility of downscaled amorphous semiconductors for high-speed thin film transistors in flexible electronics
Authors: Yuezhou Luo, Andrew John Flewitt
Abstract: Amorphous semiconductors are important channel semiconductors in thin film transistors (TFTs) which serve not only active-matrix displays, but also flexible electronics for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, a great limitation of amorphous semiconductors is their low carrier mobilities relative to their monocrystalline counterparts. Based on a recently established band fluctuation framework [Y. Luo and A. Flewitt, Phys. Rev. B 109, 104203 (2024)], this paper shows that the intrinsic carrier mobility of amorphous semiconductors can significantly increase simply through device downscaling, without any material-level optimizations. Specifically, it is revealed that the intrinsic electron mobility of hydrogenated amorphous silicon in a 10-nm long gap can increase by around 12 times, and does not compromise device-to-device uniformity. This mobility improvement is a result of reduced localized band tail states due to the ultra-short gap length relative to the band fluctuation length scale before downscaling; the latter is determined by the short- and medium-range structural order of the amorphous semiconductor.

Title: Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction
Authors: Filippo Masi, Itai Einav
Abstract: The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate-and-state, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.

Title: Interface Energy and Phase Transformations: A Comparative Analysis of Cahn-Hilliard and CALPHAD-based Models in Ternary Substitutional Alloys
Authors: Wolfgang Flachberger, Thomas Antretter, Swaroop Gaddikere-Nagaraja, Silvia Leitner, Manuel Petersmann, Jiri Svoboda
Abstract: There are various methods for modeling phase transformations in materials science, including general classes of phase-field methods and reactive diffusion methodologies, which most importantly differ in their treatment of interface energy. These methodologies appear mutually exclusive since the respective numerical schemes only allow for their primary use case. To address this issue, a novel methodology for modeling phase transformations in multi-phase, multi-component systems, with particular emphasis on applications in materials science and the study of substitutional alloys is introduced. The fundamental role of interface energy in the evolution of a material's morphology will be studied by example of binary and ternary systems. Allowing full control over the interface energy quantity enables more detailed investigations and bridges the gaps between known methods. We prove the thermodynamic consistency of the derived method and discuss several use cases, such as vacancy-mediated diffusion. Furthermore a scheme for relating Onsager and Diffusion coefficients is proposed, which allows us to study the intricate coupling that is observed in multicomponent systems. We hope to contribute to the development of new mathematical tools for modeling complex phase transformations in materials science.

Title: Matchgate circuits deeply thermalize
Authors: Mircea Bejan, Benjamin Béri, Max McGinley
Abstract: We study the ensemble of states generated by performing projective measurements on the output of a random matchgate (or free-fermionic) quantum circuit. We rigorously show that this `projected ensemble' exhibits deep thermalization: For large system sizes, it converges towards a universal ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As well as proving moment-wise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale $t \sim L^2$ set by the diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.

Title: Fluctuations and the limit of predictability in protein evolution
Authors: Saverio Rossi, Leonardo Di Bari, Martin Weigt, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time scales. In analogy with disordered systems in statistical physics, this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations happening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven energy landscape as a proxy for protein fitness. By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions developed in the context of disordered physical systems, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the initial condition, i.e. the ancestral sequence from which the evolutionary process originated, from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales. This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself. Overall, our results reveal that the properties of ancestral sequences - particularly their epistatic constraints - influence the initial evolutionary dynamics and the performance of standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithms.

Title: Design and construction of the multiplexing cold neutron spectrometer BOYA with double-column Rowland focusing analyzers
Authors: Jinchen Wang, Daye Xu, Juanjuan Liu, Wei Luo, Peng Cheng, Hongxia Zhang, Wei Bao
Abstract: Developing neutron spectrometers with higher counting efficiency has been an essential pursuit in neutron instrumentation. In this work, we present BOYA, a multiplexing cold neutron spectrometers designed and implemented at the China Advanced Research Reactor. Equipped with 34 angular analyzing channels spanning 119°, each containing 5 inelastic channels and 1 diffraction channel, BOYA enhances the measurement efficiency by two orders of magnitude over a traditional triple-axis spectrometer. To optimize both intensity and energy resolution, innovative double-column Rowland focusing analyzers have been developed. By filling the crystal gaps in the traditional Rowland focusing geometry, our design enhances the neutron beam coverage without introducing appreciable double-scattering. Our commissioning results on vanadium and MnWO4 have confirmed the success of the design, establishing BOYA as a successful multiplexing instrument for neutron spectroscopy.

Title: Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements
Authors: Yaoling Yang, Victor Montenegro, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.

Title: Interaction-Induced Second-Order Skin Effect
Authors: Wen-Zheng Ling, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu
Abstract: In contrast to the conventional (first-order) non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a $d$-dimensional system with linear size $L$, the $n$th-order (higher-order) NHSE is characterized by skin modes localized at lower-dimensional boundaries of dimension $(d-n)$. The total number of these modes scales linearly with the system size $L$. Significant progress has been made in understanding higher-order NHSE in non-interacting systems. In this work, we demonstrate the many-body interaction induced second-order skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian bosonic system. Specifically, we construct a square lattice that incorporates nonreciprocal single-boson hopping, onsite many-body interactions and two-boson pairing hopping. In the absence of interactions, no second-order NHSE is observed. However, with the inclusion of interactions, we identify interaction-induced skin modes for in-gap doublon states (i.e., bound pairs of bosons) localized at the corners of the lattice, while the bulk doublon states remain extended. These corner-localized skin modes arise from the interplay between interaction-induced edge states, localized along one-dimensional boundaries, and the nonreciprocal hopping along these boundaries. Furthermore, the number of corner skin modes scales linearly with the system size, confirming the presence of second-order NHSE in this interacting system. Our findings introduce a novel approach to realizing higher-order skin effects by leveraging interactions.

Title: Soft gravitons as Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries in de Sitter spacetimes
Authors: Martin S. Sloth
Abstract: I demonstrate that soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes are the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetry group of de Sitter space. I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter spacetimes are, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. As a consequence, a small Hubbled-sized local region initially in the symmetric state will, after a time-scale corresponding to the Page time of de Sitter space, have expanded to a large region in the broken state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes.

Title: Dirac's variational approach to semiclassical Kramers problem in Smoluchowski limit
Authors: Choon-Lin Ho
Abstract: Kramers escape from a metastable state in the presence of both thermal and quantum fluctuations under strong damping is treated as a thermally activated process in a quantum modified semiclassical potential. Dirac's time-dependent variational method together with the Jackiw-Kerman function is employed to derive the semiclassical potential. Quantum correction is incorporated in the drift potential, and is determined by quasi-stationary conditions and minimal uncertainty relation. The semiclassical rate obtained here is consistent in form with those from the quantum Smoluchowski equations deduced heuristically by modifying the diffusion coefficient using the path-integral method. Unlike approaches using the path-integral, which involves continuation into imaginary time, the approach here is simpler and more easily understood in terms of classical picture.

Title: Mesons in a quantum Ising ladder
Authors: Yunjing Gao, Yunfeng Jiang, Jianda Wu
Abstract: When two transverse-field Ising chains (TFICs) with magnetic order are coupled, the original free excitations become confined, giving rise to meson-like bound states. In this work, we study such bound states systematically. The mesons are characterized by their fermion number parity and chain-exchanging properties, which lead to distinct sets of mesonic states. The meson masses are determined by solving the Bethe-Salpter equation. An interesting observation is the additional degeneracy in the chain-exchanging odd sectors. Beyond the two particle approximation, we exploit the truncated free fermionic space approach to calculate the spectrum numerically. Corrections to the meson masses are obtained, and the degeneracy is further confirmed. The characterization and degeneracy can be connected to the situation when each chain is tuned to be quantum critical, where the system is described by the Ising$_h^2$ integrable model, a sine-Gordon theory with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. Here we establish a clear correspondence between the particles in the bosonized form and their fermionic counterparts. Near this point, the stability of these particles is analyzed using the form factor perturbation scheme, where four particles are always present. Additionally, we calculate the evolution of the dominant dynamical structure factor for local spin operators, providing further insight into the low-energy excitations and their role in the system's behavior. The two-particle confinement framework as well as the parity classifications may inspire the study for other coupled bi-partite systems.

Title: Ballistic electron transport described by a fourth-order Schrödinger equation
Authors: Giulia Elena Aliffi, Giovanni Nastasi, Vittorio Romano
Abstract: A fourth-order Schrödinger equation for the description of charge transport in semiconductors in the ballistic regime is proposed with the inclusion of non-parabolic effects in the dispersion relation in order to go beyond the simple effective mass approximation. Similarly to the standard (second order) Schrödinger equation, the problem is reduced to a finite spatial domain with appropriate transparent boundary conditions to simulate charge transport in a quantum coupler (Lent and Kirkner in J Appl Phys 67:6353, 1990; Ben Abdallah et al. in ZAMP 48:135-155, 1997; Ben Abdallah in J. Math. Phys. 41:4241-4261, 2000), where an active region representing an electron device is coupled to leads which take the role of reservoirs. Some analytical properties are investigated, and a generalized formula for the current is obtained. Numerical results show the main features of the solutions of the new model. In particular, an effect of interference appears due to a richer wave structure than that arising for the second-order Schrödinger equation in the effective mass approximation.

Title: Quantum Coherence of Topologically Frustrated Spin Chains
Authors: S. B. Kožić, G. Torre, K. Delić, F. Franchini, S. M. Giampaolo
Abstract: The study of entanglement and magic properties in topologically frustrated systems suggests that, in the thermodynamic limit, these quantities decompose into two distinct contributions. One is determined by the specific nature of the model and its Hamiltonian, and another arises from topological frustration itself, resulting in being independent of the Hamiltonian's parameters. In this work, we test the generality of this picture by investigating an additional quantum resource, namely quantum coherence, in two different models where topological frustration is induced through an appropriate choice of boundary conditions. Our findings reveal a perfect analogy between the behavior of quantum coherence and that of other quantum resources, particularly magic, providing further evidence in support of the universality of this picture and the topological nature of this source of frustration.

Title: Maximum entropy for dynamic processes on networks
Authors: Noam Abadi, Franco Ruzzenenti
Abstract: Dynamic processes on networks are fundamental to understanding modern-day phenomena such as information diffusion and opinion polarization on the internet or epidemics spreading through society. However, such processes are notoriously difficult to study broadly as small changes in initial conditions, the process, or the network can lead to very different evolution trajectories. Here we apply the information-theoretic framework of maximum caliber to study the statistics of such systems analytically, focusing on processes that can be interpreted as driven by interactions between populations of different types of individuals in the network. We verify the dynamics deduced from maximum caliber by using simulations of different processes on different networks, introduce an approximation of the dynamics that significantly simplifies the problem, and show that the approximation can be used to recover well-established models of population dynamics that are typically not thought of as taking place on networks.

Title: Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos
Authors: Naga Dileep Varikuti, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.

Title: Three-Dimensional Hieratical Twists in Polar Fluids: Chirality Regulation by Ultra-Low Electric Field
Authors: Hiroya Nishikawa, Dennis Kwaria, Atsuko Nihonyanagi, Fumito Araoka
Abstract: Recently discovered helical polar fluid adopts a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) driven by polarization escape and conformational chirality. Ferroelectric nematic and smectic phases are intrinsically chiral in the ground state and can be stabilized in an extrinsic twisted configuration through surface anchoring. Herein, we introduce extrinsic CSB as a novel technique in chiral engineering. To demonstrate this concept, we constructed the extrinsic structure of a helielectric conical mesophase (HEC)-three-dimensional chiral system. Considering the challenges of controlling chirality at the macroscopic scale owing to magnetic fields, light, and fluid vortex motion, the proposed three-dimensional chiral system enables chirality (twist) modulation through an ultralow electric field, thereby controlling unique diffraction pattern and circular polarized light-switching capabilities.

Title: Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits
Authors: Beatrice Magni, Xhek Turkeshi
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.

Title: Ion Track Formation via Electric-Field-Enhanced Energy Deposition
Authors: Zikang Ge, Jinhao Hu, Shengyuan Peng, Wei Kang, Xiaofei Shen, Yanbo Xie, Jianming Xue
Abstract: High-energy ion irradiation deposits extreme energy in a narrow range (1-10 nm) along ion trajectories in solid through electronic energy loss, producing unique irradiation effects such as ion tracks. However, intrinsic velocity effects impose an upper limit on electronic energy loss that cannot be overcome by adjusting irradiation parameters. We introduce a method using electric fields during irradiation to enhance nanoscale energy deposition by accelerating ion-excited electrons within sub-picosecond this http URL extended thermal spike model quantitatively describes this enhancement and predicts a significant reduction in the electronic energy loss required for ion track formation in amorphous SiO2, which is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. This work provides a new approach to control energy deposition during irradiation and boosts the wide application of ion tracks in material modification and nanoengineering to much broader extents.

Title: Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization for Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics
Authors: Kenric P. Nelson
Abstract: Evidence is presented that the accuracy of Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics framework is improved using the coupled entropy, which carefully establishes the physical measures of complex systems. While Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful toolset, questions have persisted as to how to evaluate whether its proposed solutions properly characterize the uncertainty of heavy-tailed distributions. The entropy of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) is $1+\kappa+\ln\sigma$, where $\kappa$ is the shape or nonlinear coupling and $\sigma$ is the scale. A generalized entropy should retain the uncertainty due to the scale, while minimizing the dependence of the nonlinear coupling. The Tsallis entropy of the GPD instead subtracts a function of the inverse-scale and converges to one as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. Colloquially, the Tsallis entropy is too cold. The normalized Tsallis entropy (NTE) rectifies the positive dependence on the scale but introduces a nonlinear term multiplying the scale and the coupling, making it too hot. The coupled entropy measures the uncertainty of the GPD to be $1+\ln_\frac{\kappa}{1+\kappa}\sigma=1+\frac{1+\kappa}{\kappa}(\sigma^\frac{\kappa}{1+\kappa}-1)$, which converges to $\sigma$ as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. One could say, the coupled entropy allows scientists, engineers, and analysts to eat their porridge, confident that its measure of uncertainty reflects the mathematical physics of the scale of non-exponential distributions while minimizing the dependence on the shape or nonlinear coupling. The training of the coupled variational autoencoder is an example of the unique ability of the coupled entropy to improve the performance of complex systems.

Title: Resonating Kagome Dimer coverings in Rydberg atom arrays
Authors: Xicheng Wang, Erich J Mueller
Abstract: Motivated by experiments on Rydberg atom arrays, we explore the properties of uniform quantum superpositions of kagome dimer configurations and construct an efficient algorithm for experimentally producing them. We begin by considering the thin cylinder limit, where these states have simple descriptions. We then develop a matrix product representation of the states on arbitrary cylinders, which leads to a natural protocol to efficiently grow them. We explain how our approach can be adapted to other quantum computing hardware.

Title: Continuous-time parametrization of neural quantum states for quantum dynamics
Authors: Dingzu Wang, Wenxuan Zhang, Xiansong Xu, Dario Poletti
Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schrödinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.
