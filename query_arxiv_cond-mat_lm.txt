Title: Physics-Informed Neural Operators for Generalizable and Label-Free Inference of Temperature-Dependent Thermoelectric Properties
Authors: Hyeonbin Moon, Songho Lee, Wabi Demeke, Byungki Ryu, Seunghwa Ryu
Abstract: Accurate characterization of temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties (TEPs), such as thermal conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient, is essential for reliable modeling and efficient design of thermoelectric devices. However, their nonlinear temperature dependence and coupled transport behavior make both forward simulation and inverse identification difficult, particularly under sparse measurement conditions. In this study, we develop a physics-informed machine learning approach that employs physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for solving forward and inverse problems in thermoelectric systems, and neural operators (PINO) to enable generalization across diverse material systems. The PINN enables field reconstruction and material property inference by embedding governing transport equations into the loss function, while the PINO generalizes this inference capability across diverse materials without retraining. Trained on simulated data for 20 p-type materials and evaluated on 60 unseen materials, the PINO model demonstrates accurate and label-free inference of TEPs using only sparse field data. The proposed framework offers a scalable, generalizable, and data-efficient approach for thermoelectric property identification, paving the way for high-throughput screening and inverse design of advanced thermoelectric materials.

Title: Comparison between the diffusion properties of different small-scale fractional transport models
Authors: Paolo Cifani, Franco Flandoli
Abstract: Stochastic transport due to a velocity field modeled by the superposition of small-scale divergence free vector fields activated by Fractional Gaussian Noises (FGN) is numerically investigated. We present two non-trivial contributions: the first one is the definition of a model where different space-time structures can be compared on the same ground: this is achieved by imposing the same average kinetic energy to a standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck approximation, then taking the limit to the idealized white noise structure. The second contribution, based on the previous one, is the discover that a mixing spatial structure with persistent FGN in the Fourier components induces a classical Brownian diffusion of passive particles, with suitable diffusion coefficient; namely, the memory of FGN is lost in the space complexity of the velocity field.

Title: Domain Switching on the Pareto Front: Multi-Objective Deep Kernel Learning in Automated Piezoresponse Force Microscopy
Authors: Yu Liu, Utkarsh Pratiush, Kamyar Barakati, Hiroshi Funakubo, Ching-Che Lin, Jaegyu Kim, Lane W. Martin, Sergei V. Kalinin
Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning, but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex, non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging modalities.

Title: Emblems of pair density waves: dual identity of topological defects and their transport signatures
Authors: Omri Lesser, Chunli Huang, James P. Sethna, Eun-Ah Kim
Abstract: The pair density wave (PDW) exemplifies intertwined orders in strongly correlated systems. A recent discovery of superconductivity in a quarter-metal state offers the first experimental system where a pure PDW without uniform superconductivity is suspected, offering a unique opportunity to examine the consequences of intertwined orders. A pure two-dimensional PDW supports an unusual fractional excitation as its topological defect (TD). A TD simultaneously winds the phase of the Cooper pair and distorts the amplitude modulation -- a dual role reflecting its intertwined character. As a vortex, a TD carries fractional vorticity of $\frac{1}{3} h/2e$, whose movement would cause resistance. As a crystalline defect, a TD can be sourced by charge disorder in the system. We show that experimentally observed resistive switching can originate from mobile TDs, while a small magnetic field will restore zero resistance by blocking their motion. The resulting resistive state exhibits extreme anisotropy and a Hall response, with the Hall angle determined by the angle between the current and the TD's Burgers vector. These features will serve as confirmation of the dual identity of topological defects as emblems of PDW order.

Title: Altermagnet-Superconductor Heterostructure: a Scalable Platform for Braiding of Majorana Modes
Authors: Themba Hodge, Eric Mascot, Stephan Rachel
Abstract: Topological quantum computation, featuring qubits built out of anyonic excitations known as Majorana zero modes (MZMs), have long presented an exciting pathway towards scalable quantum computation. Recently, the advent of altermagnetic materials has presented a new pathway towards localized MZMs on the boundary of two-dimensional materials, consisting of an altermagnetic film, subject to a superconducting proximity effect from a superconducting substrate. In this work, we demonstrate the possibility for an altermagnet-superconductor heterostructure, to not only harbor MZMs, but also freely manipulate their position along the topological boundary of the material, via rotation of the Néel vector. Using this mechanism, on a square platform, we utilize a time-dependent method to simulate the Z-gate via braiding, and then extend this to a larger H-junction, where we implement the $\sqrt{X}$ and $\sqrt{Z}$ gate on a single-qubit system. Further, this structure is eminently scalable to many-qubit systems, thus providing the essential ingredients towards universal quantum computation.

Title: Composite Superconducting Orders and Magnetism in CeRh$_2$As$_2$
Authors: Fabian Jakubczyk, Julia M. Link, Carsten Timm
Abstract: Locally noncentrosymmetric materials are attracting significant attention due to the unique phenomena associated with sublattice degrees of freedom. The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has emerged as a compelling example of this class, garnering widespread interest for its remarkable temperature-magnetic-field phase diagram, which features a field-induced first-order superconductor-to-superconductor phase transition with nontrivial dependence on the field direction and high critical fields, as well as antiferromagnetic and potentially higher multipole orders. To investigate the complex interplay of the ordered phases in CeRh$_2$As$_2$, we develop a theoretical framework based on symmetry analysis combined with Bogoliubov--de Gennes and Landau methods. This approach allows us to propose probable symmetries of the superconducting states and elucidate their close relationship with magnetism. Intriguingly, we find that the first-order transition can be interpreted as a transition between coexistence phases of the same symmetry but with distinct admixtures of individual superconducting order parameters. This line may end in a critical endpoint below the superconducting critical temperature. Our approach accurately reproduces current experimental phase diagrams for varying temperature as well as out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic field, both if the transition to a magnetic phase occurs below the superconducting critical temperature and if it occurs above. Furthermore, we calculate the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat and compare these quantities to recent experimental results.

Title: Defect complexes in CrSBr revealed through electron microscopy and deep learning
Authors: Mads Weile, Sergii Grytsiuk, Aubrey Penn, Daniel G. Chica, Xavier Roy, Kseniia Mosina, Zdenek Sofer, Jakob Schiøtz, Stig Helveg, Malte Rösner, Frances M. Ross, Julian Klein
Abstract: Atomic defects underpin the properties of van der Waals materials, and their understanding is essential for advancing quantum and energy technologies. Scanning transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for defect identification in atomically thin materials, and extending it to multilayer and beam-sensitive materials would accelerate their exploration. Here we establish a comprehensive defect library in a bilayer of the magnetic quasi-1D semiconductor CrSBr by combining atomic-resolution imaging, deep learning, and ab-initio calculations. We apply a custom-developed machine learning work flow to detect, classify and average point vacancy defects. This classification enables us to uncover several distinct Cr interstitial defect complexes, combined Cr and Br vacancy defect complexes and lines of vacancy defects that extend over many unit cells. We show that their occurrence is in agreement with our computed structures and binding energy densities, reflecting the intriguing layer interlocked crystal structure of CrSBr. Our ab-initio calculations show that the interstitial defect complexes give rise to highly localized electronic states. These states are of particular interest due to the reduced electronic dimensionality and magnetic properties of CrSBr and are furthermore predicted to be optically active. Our results broaden the scope of defect studies in challenging materials and reveal new defect types in bilayer CrSBr that can be extrapolated to the bulk and to over 20 materials belonging to the same FeOCl structural family.

Title: Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state

Abstract: Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover otherwise undetectable amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.

Title: Wave-function microscopy: Derivation and anatomy of exact algebraic spinful wave functions and full Wigner-molecular spectra of a few highly correlated rapidly rotating ultracold fermionic atoms
Authors: Constantine Yannouleas, Uzi Landman
Abstract: Exploring strongly correlated spinful states of few fermionic ultracold atoms in a rapidly rotating trap, an example of which was recently realized for two fermionic $^6$Li atoms in an optical tweezer, we derive analytical (algebraic) total-spin-eigenstate wavefunctions through the development and employment of a theoretical platform that integrates exact numerical diagonalization (full configuration interaction, FCI) with symbolic language processing. For such rapid rotations, where the atoms occupy the lowest Landau level (LLL), the obtained algebraic expressions can address the full LLL spectrum in all its complexity, demonstrating that their spatial, spectral, and spin characteristics manifest formation of collectively rotating and vibrating Wigner molecules. The explicitly exhibited analytic wavefunctions (for two and three spinful $^6$Li atoms) reproduce precisely the corresponding numerical FCI results, and they are shown to reach beyond the limited range of applicability of previous Jastrow-type treatments. These results, and their extension to bosonic systems, provide the impetus and analysis tools for future experimental and theoretical simulations of larger mesoscopic systems

Title: On a structure preserving closure of Langevin dynamics
Authors: Travis Leadbetter, Prashant K. Purohit, Celia Reina
Abstract: Given a particle system obeying overdamped Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate that it is always possible to construct a thermodynamically consistent macroscopic model which obeys a gradient flow with respect to its non-equilibrium free energy. To do so, we significantly extend the recent Stochastic Thermodynamics with Internal Variables (STIV) framework, a method for producing macroscopic thermodynamic models far-from-equilibrium from the underlying mesoscopic dynamics and an approximate probability density of states parameterized with so-called internal variables. Though originally explored for Gaussian probability distributions, we here allow for an arbitrary choice of the approximate probability density while retaining a gradient flow dynamics. This greatly extends its range of applicability and automatically ensures consistency with the second law of thermodynamics, without the need for secondary verification. We demonstrate numerical convergence, in the limit of increasing internal variables, to the true probability density of states for both a multi-modal relaxation problem, a protein diffusing on a strand of DNA, and for an externally driven particle in a periodic landscape. Finally, we provide a reformulation of STIV with the quasi-equilibrium approximations in terms of the averages of observables of the mesostate, and show that these, too, obey a gradient flow.

Title: Pilot-waves and copilot-particles: A novel approach to objective collapse
Authors: Axel van de Walle
Abstract: We propose an extension of Schrödinger's equation that incorporates the macroscopic measurement-induced wavefunction collapse phenomenon. Our approach relies on a hybrid between Bohm-de Broglie pilot-wave and objective collapse theories. The Bohmian particle is guided by the wavefunction and, conversely, the wavefunction gradually localizes towards the particle's position. As long as the particle can visit any state, as in a typical microscopic system, the localization effect does not favor any particular quantum state and, on average, the usual Schrödinger-like time evolution results. However, when the wavefunction develops spatially well-separated lobes, as would happen during a macroscopic measurement, the Bohmian particle can remain trapped in one lobe, and the wavefunction eventually localizes there. The end result, in macroscopic systems, is a wavefunction collapse that is consistent with Born's rule. We illustrate the theory with a simple double-slit experiment simulation.

Title: Anomaly, Class Division, and Decoupling in Wealth Dynamics
Authors: Jaeseok Hur, Meesoon Ha, Hawoong Jeong
Abstract: Economic inequality is shaped by the agent-network structure, the interaction between agents, and the individual agent's ability. We provide a comprehensive picture of anomalous diffusion, economic class division, and bimodal wealth distribution in an agent-based model, where the allocation of heterogeneous agent abilities/growth rates is tuned in sparse regular this http URL particular, we focus on the statistical characteristics of logarithmic scaled normalized wealth distributions with two ability parameters, assortativity $\mathcal{A}$ and concentration $\mathcal{R}$. For the set of $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{R})$, temporal behaviors of log-wealth distributions reveal that the decoupling between different ability groups depends primarily on $\mathcal{R}$ and long-term inequality depends mainly on $\mathcal{A}$. In other words, class division and decoupling are driven by $\mathcal{R}$, while the super-diffusive nature in the leading class is driven by $\mathcal{A}$. Our findings highlight that hierarchical segregation of abilities, rather than ability differences alone, is a key driver of economic class stratification. Finally, our model provides a minimal, yet powerful framework for understanding the bimodal global income distribution observed over the past half century and highlights the critical role of network-level segregation in shaping economic inequality.

Title: Visualizing a Terahertz Superfluid Plasmon in a Two-Dimensional Superconductor

Abstract: The superconducting gap defines the fundamental energy scale for the emergence of dissipationless transport and collective phenomena in a superconductor. In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, where the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional copper-oxygen planes, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at sub-gap millielectronvolt energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers. However, within the copper-oxygen planes the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, two-dimensional superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply sub-diffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near-field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance-absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase-and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum- and frequency dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions. These results establish a new platform for investigating superfluid phenomena at finite momenta and THz frequencies, highlighting the potential to engineer and visualize superconducting devices operating at ultrafast THz rates.

Title: Dimerization of Ag adatoms on Si(100) at surprisingly low temperature due to adatom migration on top of Si-dimer rows
Authors: Alejandro Peña-Torres, Michail Stamatakis, Hannes Jónsson
Abstract: The puzzling experimental observations of Ag addimer formation on the Si(100) surface upon vapor deposition at low temperature, even as low as 140 K, reported by Huang et al. [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2021, 23, 4161], is explained by facile thermal migration on top of the Si dimer rows, while diffusion is inactive once an Ag adatom lands in one of the optimal binding sites in between dimer rows. The previously hypothesized transient mobility due to the hot spot formed as an Ag atom lands on the Si surface is found not to contribute significantly to mobility and dimer formation. The experimental conditions are simulated by a combination of classical dynamics calculations of the deposition events, systematic searches of saddle points representing transition states for thermally activated events and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of long timescale evolution of the system over a temperature range from 100 K to 300 K. While the calculated energy barriers for diffusion parallel and perpendicular to the Si dimer rows are found to be nearly equal, indicating isotropic diffusion, the simulations show highly anisotropic diffusion, as the optimal migration mechanism involves multiple hops of Ag adatoms on top of Si dimer rows. Impinging Ag atoms are found to have a 90% chance of landing on top of a dimer row and while the hot spot created cools down too fast for transient mobility to play an important role, the energy barrier for thermally activated hops along the dimer row is low enough for migration to be active even at 100 K. A migrating Ag adatom can dimerise with another Ag adatom sitting at a stable binding site in between rows or another adatom on top of the same row. The simulations for deposition at 140 K show that most of the deposited Ag atoms end up forming dimers.

Title: Influence of atomic-scale defects on coherent phonon excitations by THz near fields in an STM
Authors: Vibhuti N. Rai, Junyoung Sim, Florian Faaber, Nils Bogdanoff, Sergey Trishin, Paul Wiechers, Tom S. Seifert, Tobias Kampfrath, Christian Lotze, Katharina J. Franke
Abstract: Coherent phonons describe the collective, ultrafast motion of atoms and play a central role in light-induced structural dynamics. Here, we employ terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) to excite and detect coherent phonons in semiconducting 2H-MoTe$_{2}$ and resolve how their excitation is influenced by atomic-scale defects. In a THz pump-probe scheme, we observe long-lived oscillatory signals that we assign to out-of-plane breathing and in-plane shear modes, which are both forbidden in the bulk. Remarkably, the relative excitation strength of these modes varies near defects, indicating that local band bending modulates the coupling to the THz field. This defect-tunable coupling offers new opportunities to control material properties via selective excitation of vibrational modes at the nanoscale.

Title: AI-Assisted Rapid Crystal Structure Generation Towards a Target Local Environment
Authors: Osman Goni Ridwan, Sylvain Pitié, Monish Soundar Raj, Dong Dai, Gilles Frapper, Hongfei Xue, Qiang Zhu
Abstract: In the field of material design, traditional crystal structure prediction approaches require extensive structural sampling through computationally expensive energy minimization methods using either force fields or quantum mechanical simulations. While emerging artificial intelligence (AI) generative models have shown great promise in generating realistic crystal structures more rapidly, most existing models fail to account for the unique symmetries and periodicity of crystalline materials, and they are limited to handling structures with only a few tens of atoms per unit cell. Here, we present a symmetry-informed AI generative approach called Local Environment Geometry-Oriented Crystal Generator (LEGO-xtal) that overcomes these limitations. Our method generates initial structures using AI models trained on an augmented small dataset, and then optimizes them using machine learning structure descriptors rather than traditional energy-based optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LEGO-xtal by expanding from 25 known low-energy sp2 carbon allotropes to over 1,700, all within 0.5 eV/atom of the ground-state energy of graphite. This framework offers a generalizable strategy for the targeted design of materials with modular building blocks, such as metal-organic frameworks and next-generation battery materials.

Title: Spin-split superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled hybrid nanowires with ferromagnetic barriers
Authors: J. Zhao, A. Mazanik, D. Razmadze, Y. Liu, P. Krogstrup, F. S. Bergeret, S. Vaitiekėnas
Abstract: We report transport studies of hybrid Josephson junctions based on semiconducting InAs nanowires with fully overlapping epitaxial ferromagnetic insulator EuS and superconducting Al partial shells. Current-biased measurements reveal a hysteretic superconducting window with a sizable supercurrent near the coercive field of the ferromagnetic insulator, accompanied by multiple Andreev reflections. Tunneling spectroscopy shows a superconducting gap characterized by three peaks, which we attribute to tunneling between exchange-split superconductors. A theoretical model reproduces the observed features and indicates that spin mixing, driven by sizable spin-orbit coupling, is essential to their formation. Our results demonstrate proximity-induced superconductivity through a ferromagnetic insulator and establish a new platform for exploring spin-triplet pairing.

Title: Bound States at Semiconductor -- Mott Insulator Interfaces
Authors: Jan Verlage, Peter Kratzer
Abstract: Utilizing the hierarchy of correlations in the context of a Fermi-Hubbard model, we deduce the presence of quasi-particle bound states at the interface between a Mott insulator and a semiconductor, as well as within a semiconductor-Mott-semiconductor heterostructure forming a quantum well. In the case of the solitary interface, the existence of bound states necessitates the presence of an additional perturbation with a minimal strength depending on the spin background of the Mott insulator. Conversely, within the quantum well, this additional perturbation is still required to have bound states while standing-wave solutions even exist in its absence.

Title: A non-local exchange potential for electronic structure calculations
Authors: G. Schiwietz, P.L. Grande
Abstract: In this work we describe a model for the exchange interaction of electrons, as it follows from the Pauli exclusion principle. Starting from Hartree-Fock theory and making use of the free electron-gas model we propose a simple scheme to calculate the exchange-potential for atoms as well as simple molecules and solids. This method assures the correct asymptotic long-range behavior of the potential, contrary to local-density approximations that rely on a strongly simplified generalization of the well-known Kohn-Sham or Slater exchange interaction. Furthermore, our results approach the Kohn-Sham results in the interstitial space of solids. As a benchmark test, total energies and eigenenergies for atoms from He to Xe computed within our model are compared to other calculations as well as to experimental data.

Title: Spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in the interacting Kane-Mele model
Authors: Minghuan Zeng, Junjie Zeng, Ling Qin, Shiping Feng, Donghui Xu, Rui Wang
Abstract: The essential properties of the half-filled interacting Kane-Mele model on a hexagon lattice is studied using the slave rotor approach. It is shown clearly that a long-range charge-order state with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry emerges in the weak and moderate interaction regimes, as well as a presumed site-selected topological Mott insulator state in the stronger interaction regime with U < UMott, where UMott is the critical interaction strength, and in the case of U > UMott, the system is transited into the usual topological Mott state. This new charge-order state has lower energy compared to the usual topological band insulator (TBI) state with chiral symmetry, and thus is named as non-chiral TBI state. More specifically, in this non-chiral TBI state without any long-range magnetic order, a long-range charge order with different electron occupation on two sublattices appears in the absence of external sublattice field. The spontaneously broken chiral symmetry gives rise to a special helical edge state, which has different spin accumulation on opposite edges of the cylinder with periodic boundary condition in the zigzag direction, and thus leads to a net spin current across the system. This net spin current would be further strengthened if the nearest neighbor electron Coulomb interaction is taken into account as well, because it is favorable for the long-range charge order with different electron occupation on sublattices.

Title: Diffusive spreading of a polydisperse polymer solution in a channel
Authors: Hanyang. Wang, Gary W Slater
Abstract: Long DNA molecules can be mapped by cutting them with restriction enzymes inside a narrow channel. Once cut, the individual fragments thus produced move away from each other due to diffusion and entropic effects. We investigate how long it takes for these fragments to travel distances large enough for an experimental device to distinguish them and (possibly) estimate their size. In essence, this is a single-file diffusion process in which molecules of different sizes and hence different diffusion coefficients spread out from an initially dense configuration. We use Monte Carlo methods to investigate this class of problems and define the time taken to reach the required final state as a first-passage \textit{spreading time}. Our results demonstrate that the stochastic nature of the diffusion process is as significant as the specifics of the molecular size distribution in determining the spreading time. We examine the relationship between the spreading time and the final space occupied by the fragments as a function of the experimental parameters and determine the fundamental length scale governing this process. We introduce a molecular sequence randomness parameter, $Z$, which is linearly correlated with the final spreading time. Finally, we show that the distribution function of spreading times follows a well-known form for first-passage time problems, and that its variance decreases linearly with the number of fragments.

Title: Neuralized Fermionic Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Si-Jing Du, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: We describe a class of neuralized fermionic tensor network states (NN-fTNS) that introduce non-linearity into fermionic tensor networks through configuration-dependent neural network transformations of the local tensors. The construction uses the fTNS algebra to implement a natural fermionic sign structure and is compatible with standard tensor network algorithms, but gains enhanced expressivity through the neural network parametrization. Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.

Title: Developing a Neural Network Machine Learning Interatomic Potential for Molecular Dynamics Simulations of La-Si-P Systems
Authors: Ling Tang, Weiyi Xia, Gayatri Viswanathan, Ernesto Soto, Kirill Kovnir, Cai-Zhuang Wang
Abstract: While molecular dynamics (MD) is a very useful computational method for atomistic simulations, modeling the interatomic interactions for reliable MD simulations of real materials has been a long-standing challenge. In 2007, Behler and Perrinello first proposed and demonstrated an artificial neural network machine learning (ANN-ML) scheme, opening a new paradigm for developing accurate and efficient interatomic potentials for reliable MD simulation studies of the thermodynamics and kinetics of materials. In this paper, we show that an accurate and transferable ANN-ML interatomic potential can be developed for MD simulations of La-Si-P system. The crucial role of training data in the ML potential development is discussed. The developed ANN-ML potential accurately describes not only the energy versus volume curves for all the known elemental, binary, and ternary crystalline structures in La-Si-P system, but also the structures of La-Si-P liquids with various compositions. Using the developed ANN-ML potential, the melting temperatures of several crystalline phases in La-Si-P system are predicted by the coexistence of solid-liquid phases from MD simulations. While the ANN-ML model systematically underestimates the melting temperatures of these phases, the overall trend agrees with experiment. The developed ANN-ML potential is also applied to study the nucleation and growth of LaP as a function of different relative concentrations of Si and P in the La-Si-P liquid, and the obtained results are consistent with experimental observations.

Title: Micro-Macro Modeling of Polymeric Fluids with Multi-Bead Polymer Chain
Authors: Xuelian Bao, Lidong Fang, Huaxiong Huang, Zilong Song, Shixin Xu
Abstract: This work extends the classical dumbbell (two-bead) model of polymer chains to a more detailed multi-bead representation, where each polymer chain consists of $N$ beads connected by $N-1$ springs. We develop a thermodynamically consistent micro-macro model based on the energy variational method to describe the coupled dynamics of polymer configurations and fluid flow. The resulting framework captures complex microscopic behaviors, such as bond stretching and alignment under flow, and links them to macroscopic stress responses.

Title: Exploring the energy landscape of the Thomson problem: local minima and stationary states
Authors: Paolo Amore, Victor Figueroa, Enrique Diaz, Jorge A. López, Trevor Vincent
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive numerical investigation of the energy landscape of the Thomson problem for systems up to $N=150$. Our results show the number of distinct configurations grows exponentially with $N$, but significantly faster than previously reported. Furthermore, we find that the average energy gap between independent configurations at a given $N$ decays exponentially with $N$, dramatically increasing the computational complexity for larger systems. Finally, we developed a novel approach that reformulates the search for stationary points in the Thomson problem (or similar systems) as an equivalent minimization problem using a specifically designed potential. Leveraging this method, we performed a detailed exploration of the solution landscape for $N\leq24$ and estimated the growth of the number of stationary states to be exponential in $N$.

Title: Exciton condensation from level repulsion: application to bilayer graphene
Authors: Harley D. Scammell, Oleg P. Sushkov
Abstract: Exciton condensation in semiconductors and semimetals has long been predicted but remains elusive. In a semiconductor, condensation occurs when the exciton binding energy matches the band gap. This binding energy results from a balance between Coulomb attraction, which enhances it, and kinetic energy, which suppresses it. However, reducing kinetic energy typically increases screening, weakening Coulomb attraction. Empirically, in most candidate materials, the binding energy remains below the band gap, with few external parameters capable of altering this balance. Here, we propose an in-plane electric field as a control parameter. This field induces hybridisation between even- and odd-parity excitons, and the resulting level repulsion effectively enhances binding energy. We argue that this mechanism is generic to excitons in semiconductors and illustrate it with a model of biased bilayer graphene. Bilayer graphene is chosen since it has a tunable band gap, making it an excitonic condensate candidate and moreover, the Zener tunnelling rate contains, in addition to the usual exponential decay, a non-standard oscillating component -- thanks to details of the electron dispersion. Analogous to quantum oscillations, we propose that Fourier spectrum of the current-voltage data allows for a novel test of exciton condensation. Finally, we show that the is a large excitonic gap to critical temperature ratio -- a clear prediction for STM studies.

Title: Rogue waves collision under incident momentum modulation in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Zhihao Zhang, Tiantian Li, Xiao-Dong Bai, Yunbo Zhang, Denglong Wang
Abstract: The collision dynamics of two first-order rogue waves (RWs) with opposite incident momentum in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) is studied by solving the two-component one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. It is demonstrated that the introduction of appropriate incident momentum successfully promotes the generation of second-order RWs in the case of relatively weaker interspecies interactions compared to intraspecific interactions. The range of incident momentum that can facilitate the generation of second-order RWs under different interspecies interaction strengths is determined, and machine learning is employed to find and analyze relationships among the interspecies interaction, the incident momentum, and the offset that can lead to the generation of second-order RWs. It shows that any two parameters above exhibit a positive or negative correlation when the third parameter is fixed. These findings provide additional possibilities for generating and controlling high-order RWs.

Abstract: Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems, benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation. Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization. Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth and standardized workflows. All related code is available at GitHub: this https URL

Title: Revealing the Dominance of the Orbital Hall Effect over Spin in Transition Metal Heterostructures
Authors: J. L. Costa, E. Santos, J. B. S. Mendes, A. Azevedo
Abstract: We study inverse spin and orbital Hall effects in 19 transition metals using spin-pumping driven by ferromagnetic resonance. Spin-to-charge conversion was measured in YIG/X(5), while orbital-to-charge conversion was probed in YIG/Pt(2)/X(5) heterostructures. Here, X represents the different transition metals. Surprisingly, the orbital contribution overwhelmingly dominates over the spin response, clarifying the challenge of disentangling these effects. Our results largely agree with first-principles predictions for spin and orbital Hall conductivities but reveal discrepancies in select materials. These findings emphasize the fundamental role of the orbital Hall effect, and position orbitronics as a pivotal frontier in condensed matter physics.

Title: Theory of Semi-Deterministic Quantum Dot Placement in Heteroepitaxy
Authors: Zihang Wang, Dirk Bouwmeester
Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.

Title: Quasi-periodic flat-band model constructed by molecular-orbital representation
Authors: Tomonari Mizoguchi, Yasuhiro Hatsugai
Abstract: We construct a tight-binding model that hosts both a quasi-periodic nature and marcoscopically-dengenerate zero-energy modes. The model can be regarded as a counterpart of the Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model, which is a paradigmatic example of the quasi-periodic tight-binding model. Our main focus is on the many-body state where the flat-band-like degenerate zero-energy modes are fully occupied. We find a characteristic sublattice dependence of the particle density distribution. Further, by analyzing the hyperuniformity of the particle density distribution, we find that it belongs to the class-I hyperuniform distribution, regardless of the model parameter. We also show that, upon changing the parameter, the finite-energy modes exhibit the same extended-to-localized transition as that for the original AAH model.

Title: Vortices in Two-Dimensional Chiral Superfluids
Authors: Yan He, Wenxing Nie
Abstract: We study the orbital angular momentum (OAM) $L_z$ of two-dimensional chiral $(p_x+ip_y)^{\nu}$-wave superfluids (SFs) in the presence of an axisymmetric multiply quantized vortex (MQV) with vorticity $k$ on a disk at zero temperature, in the framework of Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) theory. Focusing on spectral asymmetry (or spectral flow), we find that $L_z=(k+\nu)N/2$ for any integer $\nu$ and $k$ in the Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) regime, where $N$ is the total number of fermions. While in the weak-pairing Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) regime, only for chiral $p+ip$-wave SF with $k=\pm 1$, $L_z=(k+\nu)N/2$ still holds. For chiral SFs with $\nu\ge2$ or $|k|\ge2$ in the BCS regime, the OAM $L_z$ is remarkably reduced from its ``full" value in the BEC regime. However, the deviations differ in these two cases. For chiral SFs with $\nu\ge2$, $L_z$ is sharply suppressed in this ideal setting with a specular wall, while the suppression caused by the $|k| \ge 2$ vortex is moderate, which is core-size dependent. Furthermore, for $p+ip$-wave SF with $k=-1$, the total OAM $L_z$ is zero, but the distribution $L_z(r)$ is nontrivial compared with that of vortex-free $s$-wave SF, in which the total OAM is zero as well. For chiral SFs with $\nu\ge2$ and $|k|\ge2$, the effects of circulation due to vortex and chiral pairing can coexist, and hence depress the OAM simultaneously. These observations can be explained by spectral asymmetry and unpaired fermions in the ground state of the BdG Hamiltonian. We also investigate the spatial distribution of particle density, OAM, by solving the BdG equation.

Title: Bridging Electrostatic Screening and Ion Transport in Lithium Salt-Doped Ionic Liquids
Authors: Hyungshick Park, Bong June Sung, Jeongmin Kim
Abstract: Alkali salt-doped ionic liquids are emerging as promising electrolyte systems for energy applications, owing to their excellent interfacial stability. To address their limited ionic conductivity, various strategies have been proposed, including modifying the ion solvation environment and enhancing the transport of selected ions (e.g., Li$^+$). Despite the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions in determining key physicochemical properties, their influence on ion transport in such systems has received relatively little attention. In this work, we investigate the connection between ion transport and electrostatic screening using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([pyr$_{14}$][TFSI]) doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at molar fractions x$_{LiTFSI}$ $\le$ 0.3. We find that the charge-charge and density-density correlation functions exhibit oscillatory exponential decay, indicating that LiTFSI doped [pyr$_{14}$][TFSI] is a charge- and mass-dense system. The electrostatic screening length decreases with increasing LiTFSI concentration, whereas the decay length of the density-density correlation functions remains nearly unchanged. Notably, we find that the x$_{LiTFSI}$-sensitive screening length serves as a central length scale for disentangling species-specific contributions of ion pairs to collective ion transport upon LiTFSI doping. This framework provides a unifying perspective on the interplay between structure and transport in ionic liquid systems.

Title: Non-Equilibrium Origin of Native Ring Anisotropy in Amorphous Systems
Authors: Zihang Wang, Dirk Bouwmeester
Abstract: Native ring structures within amorphous networks play a critical role in determining structural and optical properties, in part due to their ability to host dopants such as rare earth ions in silicate systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the universal features of structural anisotropy in amorphous networks can be efficiently simulated using a model based on stochastically deformed, edge sharing N member native ring structures. This model isolates and characterizes the structural anisotropy generated during the annealing quenching process that is independent of any constituent specific interactions. We refer to this computational framework as Indistinguishable Simulated Folding (ISF), a stochastic process that mimics a simulated annealing quenching procedure. Formulated as a Markov process, ISF is governed by two physically meaningful parameters: the number of Markov steps, representing the mean duration of each ring folding event, and the stochastic deformation magnitude, which quantifies thermally induced structural changes per event. Furthermore, we show that the logarithm of any positive valued anisotropy measure generated by ISF is a skewed random variable, reflecting the growing entropy production rate during the Markov evolution. ISF provides both a conceptual framework for understanding the universal stochastic origin of structural anisotropy in amorphous networks and a practical tool for simulating constituent independent features, without requiring full scale molecular dynamics simulations.

Title: Observation of Uniform Supercurrent Flow in Polycrystalline K-doped Ba122 by Combined Magneto-optical Imaging and Finite-element Modeling
Authors: Shota Ishiwata, Sunseng Pyon, Tsuyoshi Tamegai, Mark D. Ainslie, Akiyasu Yamamoto
Abstract: Macroscopic current uniformity in a (Ba,K)Fe2As2 bulk sample produced by a process that demonstrated high trapped magnetic fields was evaluated through a comparative experimental and modeling approach. The bulk sample, with a well-defined square geometry, exhibited ideal roof-top patterns in magneto-optical (MO) images. Comparison of the magnetic moment, MO images, and finite element modeling results showed good agreement for the critical current density, suggesting that the supercurrent circulates uniformly throughout the sample on the order of MO resolution. These results highlight the importance of enhancing flux pinning strength and microstructural control at the submicron and grain boundary scale in iron-based superconducting polycrystalline materials.

Title: Nucleation kinetics in phase transformations with spatially correlated nuclei
Authors: M. Tomellini
Abstract: Phase transitions ruled by nucleation and growth can occur by nonrandom arrangement of nuclei. This is verified, for instance, in thin film growth at solid surfaces by vapor condensation or by electrodeposition where, around each nucleus, a depletion zone of reactants sets up within which nucleation is prevented. In this contribution, a theoretical approach for the kinetics of phase transition with spatially correlated nuclei by progressive nucleation is developed. The work focuses on the rate of formation of the actual nuclei, a quantity that is necessary for describing the transformation kinetics. The approach is based on correlation functions and applied to treat hard-sphere interaction between nuclei. Computations have been performed for 2D and 3D growths by truncation of the series expansion in correlation functions up to second order terms. It is shown that the nucleation kinetics undergoes a transition from a typical Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) behavior to one that is like the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (KJMA) kinetics. The time evolution of the volume fraction of the new phase is found to depend slightly on correlation radius. Such behavior is explained by the partial balancing between the reduction in nucleation density and the decrease in impingement events, which have opposite effects on the kinetics.

Authors: Tlek Tapani, Jonas M. Pettersson, Nils Henriksson, Erik Zäll, Nils V. Hauff, Lakshmi Das, Gianluca Balestra, Massimo Cuscunà, Aitor De Andrés, Tommaso Giovannini, Denis Garoli, Nicolò Maccaferri
Abstract: Nanoporous metals have emerged as promising functional architectures due to their tunable optical and electronic properties, high surface areas, and versatile use in real-life applications such as sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine. While the optical and morphological properties of nanoporous metals have been extensively studied, their electronic properties at ultrafast timescales remain largely unexplored. Here, we study the transient response of a nanoporous gold metamaterial and compare it with the ultrafast dynamics of a continuous gold film. We unravel that the nanoporous sample supports lower energy interband transitions, due to a much higher electron temperature in the nanoporous material, which causes an enhanced redistribution of electron density around the Fermi level. The experimental results are consistent with the two-temperature model, which highlights the role of nanoscale porosity in enabling the more efficient generation of hot carriers, thus allowing lower energy photons to induce interband transitions. Our findings demonstrate that nanoporosity affects fundamental ultrafast electronic processes and introduces this platform as temporal metamaterial allowing the emergence of tunable electronic properties not supported by the bulk counterpart. Furthermore, we present new insights into ultrafast electronic properties of nanoporous metals, which can impact several areas, from photochemistry and catalysis to energy harvesting and opto-electronics.

Title: Andreev spin qubit protected by Franck-Condon blockade
Authors: P. D. Kurilovich, T. Vakhtel, T. Connolly, C. G. L. Bøttcher, B. van Heck
Abstract: Andreev levels localized in a weak link between two superconductors can trap a superconducting quasiparticle. If there is a spin-orbit coupling in the link, the spin of the quasiparticle couples to the Josephson current. This effect can be leveraged to control and readout the spin of the quasiparticle thus using it as a qubit. One of the factors limiting the performance of such an Andreev spin qubit is spin relaxation. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that the relaxation lifetime can be enhanced by utilizing the coupling between the Andreev spin and the supercurrent in a transmon circuit. The coupling ensures that the flip of the quasiparticle spin can only happen if it is accompanied by the excitation of multiple plasmons, as dictated by the Frank-Condon principle. This blocks spin relaxation at temperatures small compared to plasmon energy.

Title: Diffusion model for analyzing quantum fingerprints in conductance fluctuation
Authors: Naoto Yokoi, Yuki Tanaka, Yukito Nonaka, Shunsuke Daimon, Junji Haruyama, Eiji Saitoh
Abstract: A conditional diffusion model has been developed to analyze intricate conductance fluctuations called universal conductance fluctuations or quantum fingerprints appearing in quantum transport phenomena. The model reconstructs impurity arrangements and quantum interference patterns in nanometals by using magnetoconductance data, providing a novel approach to analyze complex data based on machine learning. In addition, we visualize the attention weights in the model, which efficiently extract information on the non-local correlation of the electron wave functions, and the score functions, which represent the force fields in the wave-function space.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo study of artificial triangular graphene quantum dots
Authors: E. Bulut Kul, Gökhan Öztarhan, M. N. Çınar, A. D. Güçlü
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic phases of triangular graphene quantum dots (TGQDs) with zigzag edges using variational and quantum Monte Carlo methods. These systems serve as quantum simulators for bipartite lattices with broken sublattice symmetry, providing a platform to study the extended Hubbard model's emergent magnetic phenomena, including Lieb's magnetism at half-filling, edge depolarization upon single-electron addition, and Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Our non-perturbative quantum Monte Carlo simulations, performed for lattices of up to 61 sites, reveal that TGQDs transition from metallic to insulating regimes as a function of site radius size, while retaining edge-polarized ground states at half-filling. Notably, edge depolarization occurs upon single-electron doping in both metallic and insulating phases, contrasting with the Nagaoka ferromagnetism observed in hexagonal armchair geometries.

Abstract: Quasi-particle dynamics in interacting systems in the presence of disorder challenges the notion of internal thermalization, but proves difficult to investigate theoretically for large particle numbers. Engineered quantum systems may offer a viable alternative, as witnessed in experimental demonstrations in a variety of physical platforms, each with its own capabilities and limitations. Semiconductor gate-defined quantum dot arrays are of particular interest since they offer both a direct mapping of their Hamiltonian to Fermi-Hubbard and Heisenberg models and the in-situ tunability of (magnetic) interactions and onsite potentials. In this work, we use an array of germanium quantum dots to simulate the dynamics of both single-spin excitations (magnons) and two-spin excitations (triplons). We develop a methodology that combines digital spin qubit operations for state preparation and readout with analog evolution under the full system Hamiltonian. Using these techniques, we can reconstruct quantum walk plots for both magnons and triplons, and for various configurations of Heisenberg exchange couplings. We furthermore explore the effect of single-site disorder and its impact on the propagation of spin excitations. The obtained results can provide a basis for simulating disorder-based solid-state phenomena such as many-body localization.

Title: Ramanujan, Landau and Casimir, divergent series: a physicist point of view
Authors: Gilles Montambaux
Abstract: It is a popular paradoxical exercise to show that the infinite sum of positive integer numbers is equal to -1/12, sometimes called the Ramanujan sum. Here we propose a qualitative approach, much like that of a physicist, to show how the value -1/12 can make sense and, in fact, appears in certain physical quantities where this type of summation is involved. At the light of two physical examples, taken respectively from condensed matter -- the Landau diamagnetism -- and quantum electrodynamics -- the Casimir effect -- that illustrate this strange sum, we present a systematic way to extract this Ramanujan term from the infinity.

Title: Light-induced localized vortices in multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Y. Braver, D. Burba, S. S. Nair, G. Žlabys, E. Anisimovas, Th. Busch, G. Juzeliūnas
Abstract: We study continuous interaction of a trapped two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with light fields in a $\Lambda$-type configuration. Using light beams with orbital angular momentum, we theoretically show how to create a stable, pinned vortex configuration, where the rotating component is confined to the region surrounded by the second, non-rotating component. The atoms constituting this vortex can be localized in volumes much smaller than the volume occupied by the second component. The position of the vortex can be robustly changed by moving the laser beams as long as the beam movement speed is below the speed of sound.

Title: Non-Abelian Gauge Effect for 2-D Non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson Model in Cylinder Type
Authors: Yiming Zhao, Yazhuang Miao, Yihang Xing, Tianhui Qiu, Hongyang Ma, Xiaolong Zhao
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge offers a powerful route to engineer novel topological phenomena. Here, we systematically investigate a two-dimensional (2-D) non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson model incorporating SU(2) non-Abelian gauge, demonstrating the emergence of Hopf-link bulk braiding topology in the complex energy spectrum solely with x-direction nearest-neighbor couplings. Because of the limitations of exceptional point (EP) topology in fully capturing the rich non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under non-Abelian influence, we introduce a novel polarization parameter derived from the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). This parameter quantitatively discerns left-, right-, and notably, bipolar skin modes, with its accuracy corroborated by directly encoding real-space eigenstate. Our findings reveal that non-Abelian gauge provides unprecedented influence over NHSE, compared with Abelian gauge and without gauge cases. Furthermore, we uncover unique characteristics of zero-imaginary-energy eigenstates at these topological boundaries, including pronounced degeneracy and bipolar localization which is unaffected by size effects, investigated via dynamical evolution and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR). This work establishes a new paradigm for synthesizing and manipulating non-Hermitian topological phases driven by non-Abelian structures, opening avenues for topological engineering and holding promise for experimental realization in synthetic dimensional platforms.

Title: Frequency as a Clock: Synchronization and Intrinsic Recovery in Graphene Transistor Dynamics
Authors: Victor Lopez-Richard, Igor Ricardo Filgueira e Silva, Gabriel L. Rodrigues, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Alisson R. Cadore
Abstract: Hysteresis and memory effects in graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) offer unique opportunities for neuromorphic computing, sensing, and memory applications, yet their physical origins remain debated due to competing volatile and nonvolatile interpretations. Here, we present a unified dynamic model that captures the essential physics of the GFET response under periodic gate modulation, accounting for both intrinsic relaxation processes and externally driven charge transfer. By modeling non-equilibrium carrier dynamics as a competition between injection and reabsorption rates, we uncover two distinct regimes: one governed by intrinsic, frequency-independent relaxation and another exhibiting frequency-locked behavior where the response is tied to the external drive. This distinction resolves apparent nonvolatile effects and explains loop invariance in floating-gate structures via displacement current-driven charge injection. Our framework predicts the evolution of the hysteresis loop shape, amplitude, and direction across a wide range of driving conditions, offering a versatile tool for interpreting experimental results and guiding the design of next-generation graphene-based electronic systems.

Authors: Qiu Yang, Min Wu, Jingyi Duan, Zhijie Ma, Lingxiao Li, Zihao Huo, Zaizhe Zhang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Xiaoxu Zhao, Yi Chen, Youguo Shi, Wei Jiang, Kaihui Liu, Xiaobo Lu
Abstract: The kagome lattice provides a playground to explore novel correlated quantum states due to the presence of flat bands in its electronic structure. Recently discovered layered kagome compound Nb3Cl8 has been proposed as a Mott insulator coming from the half-filled flat band. Here we have carried out systematic transport study to uncover the evidence of Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8 thin flakes. Bipolar semiconducting property with Fermi level close to conduction band has been revealed. We have further probed the chemical potential of Nb3Cl8 by tracing the charge neutrality point of the monolayer graphene proximate to Nb3Cl8. The gap of Nb3Cl8 flakes is approximately 1.10 eV at 100 K and shows pronounced temperature dependence, decreasing substantially with increasing temperature to ~0.63 eV at 300 K. The melting behavior of the gapped state is in consistent with theoretically proposed Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8. Our work has demonstrated Nb3Cl8 as a promising platform to study strongly correlated physics at relatively high temperature.

Title: Enhanced superconducting gap in the outer CuO$_2$ plane of the trilayer cuprate (Hg,Re)Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+δ}$
Authors: M. Horio, M. Miyamoto, Y. Mino, S. Ishida, B. Thiagarajan, C. M. Polley, C. H. Lee, T. Nishio, H. Eisaki, I. Matsuda
Abstract: We report the first observation of a momentum-resolved superconducting gap in the Hg-based trilayer cuprate, which holds the highest record of superconducting transition temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) at ambient pressure. By angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy utilizing a micro-focused beam, clear quasiparticle dispersions originating from the inner and outer CuO$_2$ planes (IP and OP, respectively) were separately identified. The magnitude of the superconducting gap for the IP was comparable to that of the Bi-based trilayer cuprate with a lower $T_\mathrm{c}$. In contrast, the superconducting gap for the OP was significantly larger than that of the Bi-based one. While strong pairing in the IP has been highlighted as the key element of trilayer cuprates, the present results suggest that the enhanced pairing energy in the OP is essential for the highest $T_\mathrm{c}$ at ambient pressure realized in the Hg-based trilayer cuprate.

Title: Full ab initio atomistic approach for morphology prediction of hetero-integrated crystals: A confrontation with experiments
Authors: Sreejith Pallikkara Chandrasekharan, Sofia Apergi, Chen Wei, Federico Panciera, Laurent Travers, Gilles Patriarche, Jean-Christophe Harmand, Laurent Pedesseau, Charles Cornet
Abstract: Here, we propose a comprehensive first-principle atomistic approach to predict the Wulff-Kaischew equilibrium shape of crystals heterogeneously integrated on a dissimilar material. This method uses both reconstructed surface and interface absolute energies, as determined by density functional theory, to infer the morphology and wetting properties of Volmer-Weber islands over the whole range of accessible chemical potentials. The predicted equilibrium shapes of GaP crystals heterogeneously grown on Si, are found to be in good agreements with experimental observations performed by Transmission Electron Microscopy. Such method provides a tool for optimization of hetero-structured, multifunctional and smart materials and devices.

Title: Atomic to mesoscale hierarchical structures and magnetic states in an anisotropic layered ferromagnet FePd2Te2
Authors: Shuo Mi, Manyu Wang, Bingxian Shi, Songyang Li, Xiaoxiao Pei, Yanyan Geng, Shumin Meng, Rui Xu, Li Huang, Wei Ji, Fei Pang, Peng Cheng, Jianfeng Guo, Zhihai Cheng
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials have predominantly exhibited easy-axis or easy-plane anisotropy and display a high sensitivity to the underlying crystal structure and lattice symmetry. Recently, an in-plane anisotropic 2D ferromagnet of FePd2Te2 has been discovered with intriguing structure and quasi-one-dimensional spin system. Here, we report a real-space investigation of its twinning structure and magnetic states using atomic/magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The atomic to mesoscale hierarchical structures with the orthogonal and corrugated compressive /tensile(C/T) regions are directly observed due to the intrinsic twinning-domain characteristic. The structure-related intact ferromagnetic (FM), field-induced polarized-FM states and their transitions are comparatively discussed at the mesoscale with the corresponding macroscopic magnetic measurements. Temperature- and field-dependent evolution of magnetic phase are further investigated at the FM and PM states, and summarized to obtain a unique H-T phase diagram of FePd2Te2. Our work provides key results for understanding the complicated magnetic properties of FePd2Te2, and suggests new directions for manipulating magnetic states through the atomic and mesoscale structure engineering.

Title: Dissipationless tune-out trapping for a lanthanide-alkali quantum gas mixture
Authors: Alexandre De Martino, Florian Kiesel, Jonas Auch, Kirill Karpov, Christian Gross
Abstract: Quantum gas mixtures offer a wide field of research, ranging from few-body physics of impurities to many-body physics with emergent long-range interactions and ultracold molecular gases. Achieving precision control of mixtures is much harder than for single-component gases and, consequently, the respective techniques are less developed. Here we report on a decisive step forward in this direction by realizing dissipationless and fully differential optical control of the motional degrees of freedom of one of the species without affecting the other. This is achieved in a novel Bose-Fermi mixture with extreme mass imbalance, erbium-166 and lithium-6. Our experiments pave the way to a new generation of precision many-body experiments with quantum gas mixtures with unprecedented long lifetimes and low temperatures.

Title: Aging of amorphous materials under cyclic strain
Authors: Dor Shohat, Paul Baconnier, Itamar Procaccia, Martin van Hecke, Yoav Lahini
Abstract: Amorphous materials driven away from equilibrium display a diverse repertoire of complex, history-dependent behaviors. One striking feature is a failure to return to equilibrium after an abrupt change in otherwise static external conditions. Instead, amorphous materials often exhibit physical aging: an ever-slowing, nonexponential relaxation that can span a huge range of timescales. Here we examine the aging behavior of three different amorphous materials subjected to slow periodic driving. The results reveal a generic aging phenomenon characterized by a logarithmic decay of dissipation per cycle. This observation is evaluated against several mesoscopic models of amorphous matter that successfully capture aging under static conditions: (i) a collection of noninteracting relaxation processes (ii) a noisy hysteron model with random pairwise interactions, and (iii) a structural model consisting of a random network of bi-stable elastic bonds. We find that only the latter model reproduces all experimental findings and relate its success to its persistent, slow exploration of a complex energy landscape with clear signatures of replica symmetry breaking. Thus, cyclic driving emerges as a simple yet powerful protocol to characterize amorphous materials, probe their complex energy landscapes, and distinguish between different models.

Title: Hydrogen diffusion in ceria: solid state NMR, combined scattering and spectroscopic studies, and ab initio calculations
Authors: Zhichao Zhu, Xin Li, Ziru Ma, Yuanhua Xia, Ruizhi Qiu, Baijiang Lv, Guanyun Yan, Jianrong Zeng, Long Yang, Jianbo Ma, Benqiong Liu, Guangai Sun
Abstract: Ceria has been extensively studied since it has many applications in diverse research fields. However, the mechanism of the hydrogen dynamics, especially the diffusion kinetics on a microscopic level is still unclear as the experimental data has been very limited. In this work, the CeO$_2$-H interaction has been comprehensively studied by a combination of $^1$H NMR transverse relaxation time ($T_2$) measurement, neutron powder diffraction, quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS), X-ray total scattering, and ab initio calculations. Based on QENS measurements, the first direct evidence for hydrogen jump diffusions of the Chudley-Elliot type in the bulk ceria has been given, with a jump distance of ~3.98 angstrom. The theoretically calculated activation energy barriers $E_a$ for hydrogen diffusion are relatively low (less than 0.1 eV), further supporting that such hopping can readily occur. A larger barrier value of $E_a$ ~0.2 eV is directly estimated by $T_2$ NMR data, suggesting possible slower hydrogen dynamics with the pre-exponential factor $D_0$ of diffusion coefficient ~10$^{-11}$ m$^2/$s.

Abstract: The nature of the band-gap in PbI2 (i.e. direct or indirect) is crucial for its applications. Here we directly image, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, its thickness-dependent crossover from an indirect to a direct band-gap. We experimentally probe a large shift of the valence band maximum towards the center of the Brillouin zone, when the thickness of PbI2 films is greater than a monolayer. Our experimental results, accompanied by density functional theory calculations, suggest that the band-gap crossover is driven by interlayer interactions and the hybridization of iodine pz orbitals. These findings demonstrate the tunable electronic properties of PbI2, highlighting its potential for applications in optoelectronics.

Title: Ferromagnetic Two-dimensional Electron Gases with Magnetic Doping and Proximity Effects
Authors: Zixin Fan, Jiale Chen, Qiangtao Sui, Haoming Ling, Zihao Wang, Lingyuan Kong, Dingyi Li, Fang Yang, Run Zhao, Hanghui Chen, Pan Chen, Yan Liang, Jiandi Zhang
Abstract: The advent of magnetic two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at oxide interfaces has provided new opportunities in the field of spintronics. The enhancement of magnetism in 2DEGs at oxide interfaces continues to be a significant challenge, as exemplified by the relatively weak magnetism observed in the classical LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. Here, we present ferromagnetic (FM) 2DEGs at the interface fabricated between the FM insulator EuTiO3 (ETO) and the strong spin-orbit coupled (SOC) perovskite insulator KTaO3 (KTO). With the combined effects of magnetic atom doping and magnetic proximity from ETO films, the coercive field of 2DEGs can be significantly enhanced. Magnetoresistance (MR) curve with a high coercive field of 1000 Oe has been observed, in conjunction with a temperature-dependent unambiguous hysteresis loop in the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Furthermore, within the 2DEGs, we have identified a synergetic interplay between magnetic scattering and the weak antilocalization (WAL) effect on transport. This study provides fresh insights into the formation of FM 2DEGs at ETO/KTO interfaces, and introduce an innovative pathway for creating high-performance magnetic 2DEGs at oxide interfaces.

Title: Crystal Nucleation in Eutectic Al-Si Alloys by Machine-Learned Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Quentin Bizot, Noel Jakse
Abstract: Solidification control is crucial in manufacturing technologies, as it determines the microstructure and, consequently, the performance of the final product. Investigating the mechanisms occurring during the early stages of nucleation remains experimentally challenging as it initiates on nanometer length and sub-picoseconds time scales. Large scale molecular dynamics simulations using machine learning interatomic potential with quantum accuracy appears the dedicated approach to complex, atomic level, multidimensional mechanisms with local symmetry breaking. A potential trained on a high-dimensional neural network on density functional theory-based ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories for liquid and undercooled states for Al-Si binary alloys enables us to study the nucleation mechanisms occurring at the early stages from the liquid phase near the eutectic composition. Our results indicate that nucleation starts with Al in hypoeutectic conditions and with Si in hypereutectic conditions. Whereas Al nuclei grow in a globular shape, Si ones grow with polygonal faceting, whose underlying mechanisms are further discussed.

Title: Phonon- and magnon-mediated decoherence of a magnonic qubit
Authors: Vemund Falch, Arne Brataas, Jeroen Danon
Abstract: We investigate the decoherence of magnonic qubits in small ferromagnetic insulators and compute the relaxation and dephasing rates due to magnon-phonon and magnon-magnon interactions. We combine a Bloch--Redfield description with Keldysh non-equilibrium field theory to find explicit expressions for the rates. For a quadratic dispersion and assuming a uniform mode defines the qubit, we find that decay into two phonons is the only allowed relaxation process at zero temperature. The low resonance frequency and heavy unit cell strongly suppress this process in yttrium-iron-garnet. We also find that the dephasing rate scales with the inverse of size and damping of the magnet, and could become large for small and clean magnets. Our calculation thus provides additional insight into the viability of magnon-based quantum devices.

Title: Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition
Authors: Fan Zhang, Haowei Li, Wei Yi
Abstract: We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place after the system becomes superradiant at a finite pumping strength. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.

Title: A multi-physics model for dislocation driven spontaneous grain nucleation and microstructure evolution in polycrystals
Authors: Izzet Tarik Tandogan, Michael Budnitzki, Stefan Sandfeld
Abstract: The granular microstructure of metals evolves significantly during thermomechanical processing through viscoplastic deformation and recrystallization. Microstructural features such as grain boundaries (GBs), subgrains, localized deformation bands, and non-uniform dislocation distributions critically influence grain nucleation and growth during recrystallization. Traditionally, modeling this coupled evolution involves separate, specialized frameworks for mechanical deformation and microstructural kinetics, typically used in a staggered manner. Nucleation is often introduced ad hoc, with nuclei seeded at predefined sites based on criteria like critical dislocation density, stress or strain. This is a consequence of the inherent limitations of the staggered approach, where newly formed GBs or grains have to be incorporated with additional processing. In this work, we propose a unified, thermodynamically consistent field theory that enables spontaneous nucleation driven by stored dislocations at GBs. The model integrates Cosserat crystal plasticity with the Henry-Mellenthin-Plapp orientation phase field approach, allowing the simulation of key microstructural defects, as well as curvature- and stored energy-driven grain boundary migration. The unified approach enables seamless identification of GBs that emerge from deformation and nucleation. Nucleation is activated through a coupling function that links dislocation-related free energy contributions to the phase field. Dislocation recovery occurs both at newly formed nuclei and behind migrating GBs. The model's capabilities are demonstrated using periodic bicrystal and polycrystal simulations, where mechanisms such as strain-induced boundary migration, subgrain growth, and coalescence are captured. The proposed spontaneous nucleation mechanism offers a novel addition to the capabilities of phase field models for recrystallization simulation.

Title: Packing3D: An Open-Source Analytical Framework for Computing Packing Density and Mixing Indices Using Partial Spherical Volumes
Authors: Freddie Barter, Christopher R. K. Windows-Yule
Abstract: Accurate quantification of local packing density and mixing in simulations of particulate systems is essential for many industrial applications. Traditional methods which simply count the number of particle centres within a given volume of space (cell) introduce discontinuities at cell boundaries, leading to unreliable measurement of packing density. We introduce this http URL, an open-source Julia package providing analytic, partial-volume calculations for spheres intersecting Cartesian and cylindrical meshes. Our goals were to (1) eliminate boundary-artifact jumps, (2) maintain high throughput on large datasets, and (3) deliver standard mixing metrics via a unified API. We derive closed-form solutions for single, double and triple spherical-cap intersections, plus sphere-cylinder overlaps. A short-circuit bounding-sphere test shortens computations: fully inside or outside spheres are handled in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time, and only near-boundary spheres invoke the analytic kernels. We implement efficient mesh-generation routines, principal-cell indexing, and data-splitting functions for time-series analyses. Performance and accuracy were validated against simple cubic and face-centered cubic lattices and via boundary-shift continuity tests. this http URL converges exactly to theoretical lattice densities, eliminates discontinuities at sub-particle resolution, and processes up to $10^8$ sphere-cell intersections per second in single-threaded Julia with linear scaling in particle count. Memory usage remains modest (40 B per particle, 48 B per cell). this http URL provides researchers with continuous, reproducible volume-fraction fields and robust mixing indices at high performance, facilitating sensitivity analyses and optimization in granular process engineering. The package is freely available at this https URL

Title: Strain dependent viscous response describes the mechanics of cohesionless soft granular materials
Authors: Chandan Shakya, Luca Placidi, Anil Misra, Lars Kool, Anke Lindner, Jasper van der Gucht, Joshua A. Dijksman
Abstract: Granular materials are ubiquitous in nature and are used extensively in daily life and in industry. The modeling of these materials remains challenging; therefore, finding models with acceptable predictive accuracy that at the same time also reflect the complexity of the granular dynamics is a central research theme in the field. Soft particle packings present additional modeling challenges, as it has become clear that soft particles also have particle-level relaxation timescales that affect the packing behavior. We construct a simple one-dimensional, one-timescale model that replicates much of the essence of compressed hydrogel packing mechanics. We verify the model performance against both 3D and 2D packings of hydrogel particles, under both controlled strain and stress deformation conditions. We find that the modification of a Standard Linear Solid model with a strain dependent prefactor for the relaxation captures the time-history and rate dependence, as well as the necessary absence of cohesion effectively. We also indicate some directions of future improvement of the modeling.

Title: Order-by-disorder in magnets with frustrated spin interactions -- classical and large-$S$ limits via the spin functional integral
Authors: Peng Rao, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: We investigate spin systems with extensive degeneracies in the classical ground states due to anisotropic frustrated spin interactions, where the degeneracy is not protected by symmetry. Using spin functional integration, we study the lifting of the degeneracies by fluctuations called order-by-disorder (ObD), and the associated gap in the spin-wave spectrum. It is shown that ObD corresponds to gradient-dependent anisotropic interactions of the pseudo-Goldstone modes, which vanish for a classical uniform spin configuration. Fluctuations generate a gradient-independent effective potential which determines the ground state and the pseudo-Goldstone gap. Furthermore, we recover previous predictions for the pseudo-Goldstone gap in type-I and II ObD with two-spin interactions in the large spin-$S$ limit or the classical small temperature limit, by computing the gap explicitly for the type-II cubic compass model and the type-I square compass model. We show that these two limits correspond to the one-loop approximation for the effective potential. We also discuss other types of order by disorder due to $m$-spin interactions where $m>2$.

Title: Identifying vortex lattice in type-II superconductors via the dynamic magnetostrictive effect
Authors: Peipei Lu, Mengju Yuan, Jing Zhang, Qiang Gao, Shuang Liu, Yugang Zhang, Shipeng Shen, Long Zhang, Jun Lu, Xiaoyuan Zhou, Mingquan He, Aifeng Wang, Yang Li, Wenshan Hong, Shiliang Li, Huiqian Luo, Xingjiang Zhou, Xianhui Chen, Young Sun, Yisheng Chai
Abstract: In type-I superconductors, zero electrical resistivity and perfect diamagnetism define two fundamental criteria for superconducting behavior. In contrast, type-II superconductors exhibit more complex mixed-state physics, where magnetic flux penetrates the material above the lower critical field Hc1 in the form of quantized vortices, each carrying a single flux quantum. These vortices form a two-dimensional lattice which persists up to another irreversible field (Hirr) and then melts into a dissipative liquid phase. The vortex lattice is fundamental to the magnetic and electrical properties of type-II superconductors, a third definitive criterion-beyond resistivity and magnetization-for identifying this phase has remained elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a dynamic magnetostrictive effect, wherein the geometry of the superconductor oscillates only under an applied alternating magnetic field due to the disturbance of the vortex lattice. This effect is detected by a thin piezoelectric transducer, which converts the excited geometric deformation into an in-phase ac voltage. Notably, we find a direct and nearly linear relationship between the signal amplitude and the vortex density in lattice across several representative type-II superconductors. In the vortex liquid phase above Hirr, the signal amplitude rapidly decays to zero near the upper critical field (Hc2), accompanied by a pronounced out-of-phase component due to enhanced dissipation. This dynamic magnetostrictive effect not only reveals an unexplored magnetoelastic property of the vortex lattice but also establishes a fundamental criterion for identifying the type-II superconductors.

Title: Brownian motion with stochastic energy renewals
Authors: Ion Santra, Kristian Stølevik Olsen
Abstract: We investigate the impact of intermittent energy injections on a Brownian particle, modeled as stochastic renewals of its kinetic energy to a fixed value. Between renewals, the particle follows standard underdamped Langevin dynamics. For energy renewals occurring at a constant rate, we find non-Boltzmannian energy distributions that undergo a shape transition driven by the competition between the velocity relaxation timescale and the renewal timescale. In the limit of rapid renewals, the dynamics mimics one-dimensional run-and-tumble motion, while at finite renewal rates, the effective diffusion coefficient exhibits non-monotonic behavior. To quantify the system's departure from equilibrium, we derive a modified fluctuation-response relation and demonstrate the absence of a consistent effective temperature. The dissipation is characterized by deviations from equilibrium-like response, captured via the Harada-Sasa relation. Finally, we extend the analysis to non-Poissonian renewal processes and introduce a dimensionless conversion coefficient that quantifies the thermodynamic cost of diffusion.

Title: Nonequilibrium fluctuation-response relations for state-current correlations
Authors: Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Timur Aslyamov, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: Recently, novel exact identities known as Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs) have been derived for nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes. These identities link the fluctuations of state or current observables to a combination of responses of these observables to perturbations of transition rates. Here, we complement these results by deriving analogous FRRs applicable to mixed covariances of one state and one current observable. We further derive novel Inverse FRRs expressing individual state or current response in terms of a combination of covariances rather than vice versa. Using these relations, we demonstrate that the breaking of the Onsager symmetry can occur only in the presence of state-current correlations. On the practical side, we demonstrate the applicability of FRRs for simplifying calculations of fluctuations in large Markov networks, we use them to explain the behavior of fluctuations in quantum dot devices or enzymatic reaction schemes, and discuss their potential relevance for model inference.

Title: Experimental evidence of the topological obstruction in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: F. Mesple, P. Mallet, C. Dutreix, G. Lapertot, J-Y. Veuillen, V. T. Renard
Abstract: The rich physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) results from the Coulomb interactions of electrons in flat bands of non-trivial topology. While the bands' dispersion is well characterized, accessing their topology remains an experimental challenge. Recent measurements established the local density of states (LDOS) as a topological observable. Here, we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to investigate the LDOS of TBG near a defect. We observe characteristic patterns resulting from the Dirac cones having the same chirality within a moiré valley. At higher energies, we observe the Lifshitz transition associated with the Dirac cones mixing. Our measurements provide a full characterization of TBG's band structure, confirming the main features of the continuum model including the renormalization of the Fermi velocity, the role of emergent symmetries and the topological obstruction of the wavefunctions.

Title: Thermodynamics of microphase separation in a swollen, strain-stiffening polymer network
Authors: Carla Fernández-Rico, Robert W. Style, Stefanie Heyden, Shichen Wang, Peter D. Olmsted, Eric R. Dufresne
Abstract: Elastic MicroPhase Separation (EMPS) provides a simple route to create soft materials with homogeneous microstructures by leveraging the supersaturation of crosslinked polymer networks with liquids. At low supersaturation, network elasticity stabilizes a uniform mixture, but beyond a critical threshold, metastable microphase-separated domains emerge. While previous theories have focused on describing qualitative features about the size and morphology of these domains, they do not make quantitative predictions about EMPS phase diagrams. In this work, we extend Flory-Huggins theory to quantitatively capture EMPS phase diagrams by incorporating strain-stiffening effects. This model requires no fitting parameters and relies solely on independently measured solubility parameters and large-deformation mechanical responses. Our results reveal that strain-stiffening enables metastable microphase separation within the swelling equilibrium state and why the microstructures can range from discrete droplets to bicontinuous networks. This works highlights the critical role of nonlinear elasticity in controlling phase-separated morphologies in polymer gels.

Title: Giant transverse magnetic fluctuations at the edge of re-entrant superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$
Authors: Valeska Zambra, Amit Nathwani, Muhammad Nauman, Sylvia K. Lewin, Corey E. Frank, Nicholas P. Butch, Arkady Shekhter, B. J. Ramshaw, K. A. Modic
Abstract: UTe$_{2}$ exhibits the remarkable phenomenon of re-entrant superconductivity, whereby the zero-resistance state reappears above 40 tesla after being suppressed with a field of around 10 tesla. One potential pairing mechanism, invoked in the related re-entrant superconductors UCoGe and URhGe, involves transverse fluctuations of a ferromagnetic order parameter. However, the requisite ferromagnetic order - present in both UCoGe and URhGe - is absent in UTe$_{2}$, and magnetization measurements show no sign of strong fluctuations. Here, we measure the magnetotropic susceptibility of UTe$_{2}$ across two field-angle planes. This quantity is sensitive to the magnetic susceptibility in a direction transverse to the applied magnetic field - a quantity that is not accessed in conventional magnetization measurements. We observe a very large decrease in the magnetotropic susceptibility over a broad range of field orientations, indicating a large increase in the transverse magnetic susceptibility. The three superconducting phases of UTe$_{2}$, including the high-field re-entrant phase, surround this region of enhanced susceptibility in the field-angle phase diagram. The strongest transverse susceptibility is found near the critical end point of the high-field metamagnetic transition, suggesting that quantum critical fluctuations of a field-induced magnetic order parameter may be responsible for the large transverse susceptibility, and may provide a pairing mechanism for field-induced superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$.

Title: Tuning the the fundamental periodicity of the current-phase relation in multiterminal diffusive Josephson junctions
Authors: Venkat Chandrasekhar
Abstract: Conventional superconductor/insulator/superconductor (SIS) Josephson junctions, devices where two superconductors are separated by a tunnel barrier are technologically important as elements in quantum circuits, particularly with their key role in superconducting qubits. An important characteristic of Josephson junctions is the relation between the supercurrent Is and the phase difference {\phi} between them. For SIS junctions, the current-phase relation is sinusioidal and 2{\pi} periodic. Other types of Josephson junctions, where the material between the superconductors is a weak link or a normal metal (N) may have non-sinusoidal current-phase relations that are still 2{\pi} periodic. We show here that a multi-terminal diffusive SNS Josephson junction with 4 superconducting contacts can show a current phase relation between two of the contacts that is a superposition of 2{\pi} and 4{\pi} periodic components whose relative strength is controlled by the phase difference between the other two contacts, becoming 2{\pi} or 4{\pi} periodic for certain values of this phase difference. This tunability might have applications in tailoring the Hamiltonians of superconducting quantum circuits.

Title: Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis and Random Matrix Theory Universality in Few-Body Systems
Authors: Jiaozi Wang, Hua Yan, Robin Steinigeweg, Jochen Gemmer
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Feingold-Peres model as an example, which is a well-known paradigm of quantum chaos. Using semiclassical analysis and numerical simulations, we study the statistical properties of observables in few-body systems with chaotic classical limits and the emergence of random matrix theory universality. More specifically, we focus on: 1) the applicability of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in few-body systems and the dependence of its form on the effective Planck constant and 2) the existence of a universal random matrix theory description of observables when truncated to a small microcanonical energy window. Our results provide new insights into the established field of few-body quantum chaos and help bridge it to modern perspectives, such as the general eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH).

Title: Mixed phases in feedback Ising models
Authors: Yi-Ping Ma, Ivan Sudakow, P. L. Krapivsky
Abstract: We study mean-field Ising models whose coupling depends on the magnetization via a feedback function. We identify mixed phases (MPs) and show that they can be stable at zero temperature for sufficiently strong feedback. Moreover, stable MPs are always super-stable with perturbation decaying linearly in time. We argue that such feedback Ising models (FIMs) provide a useful framework for phase transformations between aligned phases via stable and unstable intermediate phases in multistable systems. We also analyze the dynamical behavior of FIMs driven by a time-varying magnetic field.

Title: Discovery of a 1D edge mode in a Magnetic Topological semimetal
Authors: Avior Almoalem, Rebecca Chan, Brinda Kuthanazhi, Juan Scmidt, Jose A. Moreno, Hermann Suderow, Paul Canfield, Taylor L. hughes, Vidya Madhavan
Abstract: In rare-earth monopnictides like NdBi, the interplay between magnetism and topology results in an extremely unusual topological semimetal phase which simultaneously hosts Weyl points with Fermi arcs as well as massive and massless Dirac cones. A central question in this class of materials is whether ferromagnetic surfaces with gapped Dirac cones can also host robust well-defined chiral edge states. In this study, we use spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) and spectroscopy to investigate the correlation between the magnetic and topological properties of NdBi. By combining SP-STM imaging with quasiparticle interference, we identify distinct signatures of both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic surface terminations and correlate them with their respective band structures. Crucially, we demonstrate that step edges on the ferromagnetic surface which serve as magnetic domain walls host well-defined one-dimensional (1D) edge modes that vanish above the Néel temperature. Our findings position NdBi as a promising platform for further explorations of 1D chiral edge modes and future realizations of Majorana states in proximitized rare-earth monopnictides.

Title: Heat Dissipation and Thermoelectric Performance of InSe-Based Monolayers: A Monte Carlo Simulation Study
Authors: Seyedeh Ameneh Bahadori, Zahra Shomali, Reza Asgari
Abstract: Using nonequilibrium Monte Carlo simulations of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation, we study transient heat transfer in five indium-based two-dimensional monolayers: Janus monolayers In$_2$SeTe and In$_2$SSe, pristine InSe, and InSe under 4$\%$ and 6$\%$ tensile strain. In this work, the potential of these materials for energy conversion in thermoelectric generators and hotspot control in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors is investigated. A promising option for an effective heat dissipation and enhanced transistor reliability is found to be a strained InSe, which shows the lowest peak temperature during the heating among the studied materials. On the other hand, with a high Seebeck coefficient, low thermal conductivity, and an improved figure of merit, the Janus In$_2$SeTe monolayer, compensates for its increased phonon scattering to reach the maximum temperature, making it a potent thermoelectric material. Our findings emphasis the importance of strain engineering and structural asymmetry in tuning phonon transport, enabling material optimization for next-generation nanoelectronic and energy-harvesting devices.

Title: Precise control of the phase-transition temperature of VO2 from 70 to -35 °C for tunable optics
Authors: Jin-Woo Cho, Jonathan L. King, Martin Hafermann, Karla Paz, Shenwei Yin, Tanuj Kumar, Hongyan Mei, Joseph A. Andrade, Dung. T. Quach, Colin Hessel, Chenghao Wan, Carsten Ronning, David Woolf, Mikhail A. Kats
Abstract: We demonstrate the combination of metal doping and ion bombardment as a hybrid technique to precisely engineer the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) properties of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) films. This approach enables (i) setting the phase-transition temperature ($T_c$) from $-35$ to $70$ °C, (ii) near-zero hysteresis in highly doped and irradiated films, and (iii) robust optical contrast across a broad range of doping and irradiation conditions, down to $T_c = -35$ °C. While previous work has focused on engineering the IMT via one of metal doping or ion irradiation, our hybrid method utilizes both. In doing so, we address several lingering challenges in VO$_2$ engineering, including the trade-off between $T_c$ reduction and optical contrast, and limitations in the achievable value of T$_c$. Strain$-T_c$ correlation from XRD and Raman measurements suggests a common mechanism behind doping- and irradiation-induced $T_c$ reduction. The ability to reduce the $T_c$ and hysteresis of VO$_2$ while maintaining large optical contrast will extend the functionality of VO$_2$-based optical and optoelectronic devices, including detectors, limiters, and modulators.

Title: Long-range dispersal promotes spatial synchrony but reduces the length and time scales of synchronous fluctuations
Authors: Davi Arrais Nobre, Karen C. Abbott, Jonathan Machta, Alan Hastings
Abstract: Synchronous oscillations of spatially disjunct populations are widely observed in ecology. Even in the absence of spatially synchronized exogenous forces, metapopulations may synchronize via dispersal. For many species, most dispersal is local, but rare long-distance dispersal events also occur. While even small amounts of long-range dispersal are known to be important for processes like invasion and spatial spread rates, their potential influence on population synchrony is often overlooked, since local dispersal on its own can be strongly synchronizing. In this work, we investigate the effect of random, rare, long-range dispersal on the spatial synchrony of a metapopulation and find profound effects not only on synchrony but also on properties of the resulting spatial patterns. While controlling for the overall amount of emigration from each local subpopulation, we vary the fraction of dispersal that occurs locally (to nearest neighbors) versus globally (to random locations, irrespective of distance). Using a metric that measures the instantaneous level of global synchrony, we show that this form of long-range dispersal significantly favors the spatially synchronous state and homogenizes the population by decreasing the size of clusters of subpopulations that are out of phase with the rest of the metapopulation. Moreover, the addition of non-local dispersal significantly decreases the equilibration time of the metapopulation.

Title: Correcting a noisy quantum computer using a quantum computer
Authors: Pan Zhang
Abstract: Quantum computers require error correction to achieve universal quantum computing. However, current decoding of quantum error-correcting codes relies on classical computation, which is slower than quantum operations in superconducting qubits. This discrepancy makes the practical implementation of real-time quantum error correction challenging. In this work, we propose a decoding scheme that leverages the operations of the quantum circuit itself. Given a noisy quantum circuit $A$, we train a decoding quantum circuit $B$ using syndrome measurements to identify the logical operators needed to correct errors in circuit $A$. The trained quantum circuit $B$ can be deployed on quantum devices, such as superconducting qubits, to perform real-time decoding and error correction. Our approach is applicable to general quantum codes with multiple logical qubits and operates efficiently under various noise conditions, and the decoding speed matches the speed of the quantum circuits being corrected. We have conducted numerical experiments using surface codes up to distance 7 under circuit-level noise, demonstrating performance on par with the classical minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm. Interestingly, our method reveals that the traditionally classical task of decoding error-correcting codes can be accomplished without classical devices or measurements. This insight paves the way for the development of self-correcting quantum computers.

Title: Topological Invariants in Nonlinear Thouless Pumping of Solitons
Authors: Fei-Fei Wu, Xian-Da Zuo, Qing-Qing Zhu, Tao Yuan, Yi-Yi Mao, Chao Zeng, Yi Jiang, Yu-Ao Chen, Jian-Wei Pan, Wei Zheng, Han-Ning Dai
Abstract: Recent explorations of quantized solitons transport in optical waveguides have thrust nonlinear topological pumping into the spotlight. In this work, we introduce a unified topological invariant applicable across both weakly and strongly nonlinear regimes. In the weak nonlinearity regime, where the nonlinear bands are wellseparated, the invariant reduces to the Abelian Chern number of the occupied nonlinear band. Consequently, the pumped charge is quantized to an integer value. As the nonlinearity increases, the nonlinear bands start to intertwine, leading to a situation where the invariant is expressed as the non-Abelian Chern number divided by the number of interacting bands. This could result in a fractional quantization of the pumped charge. Our unified topological invariant approach not only advances the understanding of the soliton dynamics, but also provides implications for the future design of nonlinear topological systems.

Title: Leveraging chaos in the training of artificial neural networks
Authors: Pedro Jiménez-González, Miguel C. Soriano, Lucas Lacasa
Abstract: Traditional algorithms to optimize artificial neural networks when confronted with a supervised learning task are usually exploitation-type relaxational dynamics such as gradient descent (GD). Here, we explore the dynamics of the neural network trajectory along training for unconventionally large learning rates. We show that for a region of values of the learning rate, the GD optimization shifts away from purely exploitation-like algorithm into a regime of exploration-exploitation balance, as the neural network is still capable of learning but the trajectory shows sensitive dependence on initial conditions -- as characterized by positive network maximum Lyapunov exponent --. Interestingly, the characteristic training time required to reach an acceptable accuracy in the test set reaches a minimum precisely in such learning rate region, further suggesting that one can accelerate the training of artificial neural networks by locating at the onset of chaos. Our results -- initially illustrated for the MNIST classification task -- qualitatively hold for a range of supervised learning tasks, learning architectures and other hyperparameters, and showcase the emergent, constructive role of transient chaotic dynamics in the training of artificial neural networks.

Title: Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method
Authors: Raffaele Salioni, Rocco Martinazzo, Davide Emilio Galli, Christian Apostoli
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ansätze.

Title: Solving excited states for long-range interacting trapped ions with neural networks
Authors: Yixuan Ma, Chang Liu, Weikang Li, Shun-Yao Zhang, L.-M. Duan, Yukai Wu, Dong-Ling Deng
Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size. Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate, through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition, we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states, which closely match recent experimental observations that the quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking quantum devices to photoisomerization.

Title: HSG-12M: A Large-Scale Spatial Multigraph Dataset
Authors: Xianquan Yan, Hakan Akgün, Kenji Kawaguchi, N. Duane Loh, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and 5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401 characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions, we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices, forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.

Abstract: In this paper we present the experimental protocol and data processing framework for Megahertz X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) experiments on soft matter samples, implemented at the Materials Imaging and Dynamics (MID) instrument of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL). Due to the introduction of a standard configuration and the implementation of a highly automated data processing pipeline, MHz-XPCS measurements can now be conducted and analyzed with minimal user intervention. A key challenge lies in managing the extremely large data volumes generated by the Adaptive Gain Integrating Pixel Detector (AGIPD) - often reaching several petabytes within a single experiment. We describe the technical implementation, discuss the hardware requirements related to effective parallel data processing, and propose strategies to enhance data quality, in particular related to data reduction strategies and an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we address strategies for making the processed data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), in alignment with the goals of the DAPHNE4NFDI project.

Title: Exciton Delocalization Suppresses Polariton Scattering
Authors: Yongseok Hong, Ding Xu, Milan Delor
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons (EPs) are part-light part-matter quasiparticles that combine large exciton-mediated nonlinearities with long-range coherence, ideal for energy harvesting and nonlinear optics. Optimizing EPs for these applications is predicated on a still-elusive understanding of how disorder affects their propagation and dephasing times. Here, using cutting-edge femtosecond spatiotemporal microscopy, we directly image EP propagation at light-like speeds in systems ranging from two-dimensional semiconductors to amorphous molecular films with systematically varied exciton-phonon coupling, exciton delocalization, and static disorder. Despite possessing similar EP dispersions, we observe dramatically different transport velocities and scattering times across systems. We establish a robust scaling law linking EP scattering to exciton transfer integral, demonstrating that polaritons based on materials with large exciton bandwidths are immune to disorder even for highly excitonic EPs. This observation cannot be deduced from the systems' linear optical properties, including EP dispersion and linewidth disorder. Our work highlights the critical and often-overlooked role of the matter component in dictating polariton properties, and provides precise guidelines for simultaneously optimizing EP propagation and nonlinearities.

Title: Isotope-agnostic motional ground-state cooling of neutral Yb atoms
Authors: Ronen M. Kroeze, René A. Villela, Er Zu, Tim O. Höhn, Monika Aidelsburger
Abstract: Efficient high-fidelity ground-state cooling of motional degrees of freedom is crucial for applications in quantum simulation, computing and metrology. Here, we demonstrate direct ground-state cooling of fermionic $^{171}$Yb and bosonic $^{174}$Yb atoms in two- and three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical lattices on the ultranarrow clock transition. Its high spectral resolution offers the potential for reaching extremely low temperatures. To ensure efficient cooling, we develop a chirped sideband cooling scheme, where we sweep the clock-laser frequency to mitigate the effects of spatial trap inhomogeneities. We further generalize the theoretical description of sideband spectra to higher-dimensional lattices for precise thermometry. We achieve 2D ground state fractions of $97\%$ for $^{171}$Yb with an average motional occupation of $\bar{n}\simeq0.015$ and provide a direct comparison with $^{174}$Yb, reaching similar cooling performance. Applying the same scheme in 3D results in $\bar{n}\simeq0.15$ limited by layer-to-layer inhomogeneities in the vertical direction. These results demonstrate efficient motional ground-state cooling in optical lattices, especially for bosonic alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, where other methods are not applicable, opening the door to novel protocols for quantum science applications with neutral atoms.

Title: Multicomponent multisublattice alloys, nonconfigurational entropy and other additions to the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit
Authors: Axel van de Walle
Abstract: A number of new functionalities have been added to the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) since it was last reviewed in this journal in 2002. ATAT can now handle multicomponent multisublattice alloy systems, nonconfigurational sources of entropy (e.g. vibrational and electronic entropy), Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS) generation, tensorial cluster expansion construction and includes interfaces for multiple atomistic or ab initio codes. This paper presents an overview of these features geared towards the practical use of the code. The extensions to the cluster expansion formalism needed to cover multicomponent multisublattice alloys are also formally demonstrated.

Title: YSR Bond Qubit in a Double Quantum Dot with cQED Operation
Authors: Gorm Ole Steffensen, Alfredo Levy Yeyati
Abstract: Connecting two half-filled quantum dots to two superconducting leads induces a competition of bonds, with the dots forming either an interdot exchange bond or two individual Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) screening bonds with the leads. Defining a qubit using these singlet parity bonding states provides dot charge noise protection, attributed to the chargeless nature of the screening quasiparticles, and magnetic noise protection, as the bonds guard against magnetic polarization. In this paper, we propose embedding a Double Quantum Dot (DQD) Josephson junction in parallel with a transmon to enable circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED) measurements and operation of a YSR bond qubit. We demonstrate that, under realistic parameters, two-tone spectroscopy of the DQD can be performed, revealing a significant parameter regime suitable for qubit operation. Additionally, coherent manipulations of the bond states can be achieved through dot gates, and single-shot readout is enabled by measurements of a capacitively coupled resonator. Finally, we analyze noise sources and estimate gate noise on couplings as the primary source of qubit decoherence. Since this qubit is protected against nuclear Overhauser fields and does not rely on spin-orbit interactions for operation, a broader range of material platforms becomes available compared to current Andreev spin qubits.

Title: Orbital Hall effect assisted field-free perpendicular magnetization switching
Authors: Zelalem Abebe Bekele, Yuan-Yuan Jiang, Kun Lei, Xiukai Lan, Xiangyu Liu, Hui Wen, Ding-Fu Shao, Kaiyou Wang
Abstract: Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated through the conventional spin Hall effect (SHE) and/or Rashba-Edelstein effect offer potential for magnetization manipulation. However, deterministic switching of perpendicular ferromagnets via SOTs requires a strong symmetry-breaking perturbation, typically an external magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate that field-free SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization can be facilitated with the assistance of the orbital Hall effect (OHE). Using a representative Co/PtGd bilayer SOT device, we find that while the planar Hall effect (PHE) generates a finite out-of-plane damping-like torque, representing a lateral symmetry breaking, the SHE-induced torque achievable at practical current density is insufficient to switch the perpendicular magnetization. Incorporating a Mo underlayer and exploiting its strong OHE can amplify the in-plane damping-like torque via orbital-to-spin conversion, enabling efficient field-free deterministic switching without complex device geometries or low symmetric spin sources, providing a straightforward and scalable strategy for achieving high-speed and low-power spintronics.

Title: Theory for Tunnel Magnetoresistance Oscillation
Authors: Keisuke Masuda, Thomas Scheike, Hiroaki Sukegawa, Yusuke Kozuka, Seiji Mitani, Yoshio Miura
Abstract: The universal oscillation of the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio as a function of the insulating barrier thickness in crystalline magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is a long-standing unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. To explain this, we here introduce a superposition of wave functions with opposite spins and different Fermi momenta, based on the fact that spin-flip scattering near the interface provides a hybridization between majority- and minority-spin states. In a typical Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ, we solve the tunneling problem and show that the TMR ratio oscillates with a period of $\sim3\,$Å by varying the MgO thickness, consistent with previous and present experimental observations.

Title: Fate of chiral order and impurity self-pinning in flat bands with local symmetry
Authors: Maxime Burgher, Marco Di Liberto, Nathan Goldman, Ivan Amelio
Abstract: Interacting bosons on a single plaquette threaded by a $\pi$-flux can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry, resulting in a chiral loop current. Connecting such bosonic $\pi$-flux plaquettes in a dispersive configuration was recently shown to lead to long-range chiral order. Here, instead, we design a chain of $\pi$-flux plaquettes that exhibits an all-flat-bands single-particle energy spectrum and an extensive set of local symmetries. Using Elitzur's theorem, we show that these local symmetries prevent the emergence of long-range chiral order. Moreover, projecting the dynamics to a Creutz ladder model with an effective intra-rung interaction allows one to derive simple spin Hamiltonians capturing the ground state degeneracy and the low-energy excitations, and to confirm the absence of chiral order. Nevertheless, we show how to obtain gauge-invariant information from a mean-field approach, which explicitly break gauge-invaraince. Finally, we observe an ``impurity self-pinning'' phenomenon, when an extra boson is added on top of a ground state at integer filling, resulting in a non-dispersive density peak. Exact diagonalization benchmarks are also provided, and experimental perspectives are discussed.

Title: Unified model for non-Abelian braiding of Majorana and Dirac fermion zero modes
Authors: Tianyu Huang, Rui Zhang, Xiaopeng Li, Xiong-Jun Liu, X. C. Xie, Yijia Wu
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are the most intensively studied non-Abelian anyons. The Dirac fermion zero modes in topological insulators, which are symmetry-protected doubling of MZMs under fermion number conservation, offer an alternative approach to explore non-Abelian anyons. However, a unified model that elucidates the braiding statistics of these types of topological zero modes remains absent. We show that the minimal Kitaev chain model beyond fine-tuning regime provides a unified characterization of the non-Abelian statistics of both MZMs and Dirac fermion zero modes in different parameter regimes. In particular, we introduce a minimal tri-junction setting based on the minimal Kitaev chain model and show it facilitates the unified scheme of braiding Dirac fermion zero modes, as well as the MZMs in the assistance of a Dirac mode. This unified minimal model provides deeper insights into non-Abelian statistics, demonstrating that the non-Abelian braiding of MZMs can be continuously extended to encompass Dirac fermion zero modes. The minimal Kitaev chain has been realized in coupled quantum dots [Nature 614, 445 (2023)]. Our extension, which demonstrates novel nontrivial phases with non-Abelian MZM pairs and Dirac zero modes emerging in the broader parameter regimes without fine-tuning, expands the accessible experimental parameter space and enhances the feasibility of observing non-Abelian statistics in the minimal Kitaev chain model.

Title: Disorder-induced spin-cluster magnetism in a doped kagome spin liquid candidate
Authors: Arnab Seth, Joseph C. Prestigiacomo, Aini Xu, Zhenyuan Zeng, Trevor D. Ford, B.S. Shivaram, Shiliang Li, Patrick A. Lee, Itamar Kimchi
Abstract: The search for new quantum spin liquid materials relies on systems with strong frustration such as spins on an ideal kagome lattice. However, lattice imperfections can have substantial effects which are as yet not well understood. In recent work the 2D kagome system YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{(1-x)}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_y$] (YCOB-Cl) has emerged as a leading candidate hosting a Dirac spin liquid which appears to survive at least for x<0.4, associated with alternating-bond hexagon (ABH) disorder. Here in samples with x=0.58, y=0.1 we report unusual in-plane ferromagnetic canting (FM) of the in-plane antiferromagnet with moreover an expanded regime of short-ranged order, and propose a theoretical model to explain this behavior. We show that Kitaev type exchanges naturally arise on the kagome lattice to second order in the known Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchanges, and that these interactions can produce the unusual in-plane FM moments. We propose a spin cluster phenomenological model to describe the short-ranged regime and analyze quantum fluctuations in a toy model to show how ABH disorder helps stabilize this regime. The combination of experimental observation and theory suggests that kagome-Kitaev interactions and ABH disorder are necessary for describing the magnetic fluctuations in this family of materials, with potential implications for the proposed proximate spin liquid phase.

Title: Breaking Mechanical Holography in Combinatorial Metamaterials
Authors: Chaviva Sirote-Katz, Ofri Palti, Naomi Spiro, Tamás Kálmán, Yair Shokef
Abstract: Combinatorial mechanical metamaterials are made of anisotropic, flexible blocks, such that multiple metamaterials may be constructed using a single block type, and the system's response strongly depends on the mutual orientations of the blocks within the lattice. We study a family of possible block types for the square, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Blocks that are centrally symmetric induce holographic order, such that mechanical compatibility (meaning that blocks do not impede each other's motion) implies bulk-boundary coupling. With them, one can design a compatible metamaterial that will deform in any desired texture only on part of its boundary. With blocks that break holographic order, we demonstrate how to design the deformation texture on the entire boundary. Correspondingly, the number of compatible holographic metamaterials scales exponentially with the boundary, while in non-holographic cases we show that it scales exponentially with the bulk.

Title: Chiral anomaly and internode scatterings in multifold semimetals
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: In our quest to unravel the topological properties of nodal points in three-dimensional semimetals, one hallmark property which warrants our attention is the \textit{chiral anomaly}. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign of the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality ($\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing chiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral anomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we have multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ is constrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\chi =\pm 1$. Hence, the presence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it possible to have two distinct scenarios: the pair of conjugate nodes in question comprise bands of (1) the same pseudospin variety and exhibiting Berry-curvature profiles differing by an overall factor of $\chi$, or (2) two distinct pseudospin representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply our derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point (threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes, and show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral anomaly.

Title: Defect Positioning in Combinatorial Metamaterials
Authors: Chaviva Sirote-Katz, Yotam M. Y. Feldman, Guy Cohen, Tamás Kálmán, Yair Shokef
Abstract: Combinatorial mechanical metamaterials are made of anisotropic, flexible blocks, such that multiple metamaterials may be constructed using a single block type, and the system's response depends on the frustration (or its absence) due to the mutual orientations of the blocks within the lattice. Specifically, any minimal loop of blocks that may not simultaneously deform in their softest mode defines a mechanical defect at the vertex (in two dimensions) or edge (in three dimensions) that the loop encircles. Defects stiffen the metamaterial, and allow to design the spatial patterns of stress and deformation as the system is externally loaded. We study the ability to place defects at arbitrary positions in metamaterials made of a family of block types that we recently introduced for the square, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Alongside blocks for which we show that any defect configuration is possible, we identify situations in which not all sets are realizable as defects. One of the restrictions is that in three dimensions, defected edges form closed curves. Even in cases when not all geometries of defect lines are possible, we show how to produce defect lines of arbitrary knottedness.

Title: Ising superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric bulk NbSe2

Abstract: Ising superconductivity allows in-plane upper critical magnetic fields to vastly surpass Pauli limit by locking the antiparallel electron spins of Cooper pairs in the out-of-plane direction. It was first explicitly demonstrated in fully two-dimensional monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides with large spin-orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry. Since then, several studies have shown that it can be present in layered bulk materials, too. In our previous study, we have clarified the underlying microscopic mechanism of Ising superconductivity in bulk, based on a reduced electronic coupling between superconducting layers due to intercalation by insulating layers and restricted inversion symmetry. But earlier studies suggest that in some transition metal dichalcogenide polytypes Pauli paramagnetic limit is violated even without intercalation. Here, using heat capacity measurements we unambiguously demonstrate, that the pristine noncentrosymmetric bulk 4Ha-NbSe2 polytype significantly violates the Pauli limit. The band structure parameters obtained from ab initio calculations using the experimentally determined crystal structure are used in the theoretical model which provides the microscopic mechanism of the Ising protection based solely on broken inversion symmetry.

Title: Edge states and persistent current in a PT-symmetric extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with generic boundary conditions
Authors: Supriyo Ghosh, Pijush K. Ghosh, Shreekantha Sil
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) model by including next-nearest neighbour(NNN) interaction and balanced loss-gain(BLG), and subjecting the whole system to an external uniform magnetic field. We study the band structure, edge states and persistent current in this extended SSH model under General Boundary Condition(GBC) of which the periodic, anti-periodic and open boundary conditions appear as special cases. It is shown that the point bandgap decreases with the increasing value of the strength of the NNN interaction and vanish beyond a critical value. Further, the line gap exhibits closed-loop like structures for non-vanishing NNN interaction under the Periodic Boundary Condition(PBC). The Zak phase receives no contribution from the NNN interaction under the PBC. We show that the NNN interaction has no effect on the persistent current in the half-filled limit for the case of PBC. We show that the model without the NNN interaction is exactly solvable for a class of GBC of which PBC, anti-periodic boundary condition(APBC) and anti-hermitian boundary condition(AHBC) arise as special cases. We obtain analytic expressions for the edge states in the case of Open Boundary Condition(OBC) and AHBC for vanishing NNN interaction. We show numerically for OBC that edge states in the topologically trivial phase appear for non-vanishing NNN interaction in the parametric regions where PT-symmetry is broken under PBC. In the topologically non-trivial phase, the edge states under OBC exists only up to a critical value of the NNN strength and vanishes beyond a critical value. The bulk-boundary correspondence(BBC) for unbroken PT-phase is similar to hermitian SSH model, while non-Hermitian skin effect(NHSE) is observed for broken PT-phase.

Title: Quasiparticle interference on the surface of Bi$_{\mathbf{2}}$Se$_{\mathbf{3}}$ terminated (PbSe)$_{\mathbf 5}$(Bi$_{\mathbf 2}$Se$_{\mathbf 3}$)$_{\mathbf 6}$
Authors: Mahasweta Bagchi, Philipp Rüßmann, Gustav Bihlmayer, Stefan Blügel, Yoichi Ando, Jens Brede
Abstract: Among the family of topological superconductors derived from {\BiSe}, $\mathrm{Cu}_x(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ is unique in its surface termination of a single quintuple layer (QL) of the topological insulator (TI) \BiSe{} on an ordinary insulator PbSe. Here, we report a combined scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) characterization of the cleaved surface of the parent compound $(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ (PSBS). Interestingly, the potential disorder due to the random distribution of native defects is only $\Gamma \sim 4~\mathrm{meV}$, comparable to the smallest reported for TIs. Performing high-resolution quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) near the Fermi energy ($E-E_\mathrm{F} = -1~\mathrm{eV}~\mathrm{to}~0.6~\mathrm{eV}$) we reconstruct the dispersion relation of the dominant spectral feature and our ab initio calculations show that this surface feature originates from two bands with Rashba-like splitting due to strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking. Moreover, only a small hexagonal distortion of the calculated Fermi surface is seen in the full momentum space distribution of the measured scattering data. Nevertheless, the scattering pattern at lower energies transforms into a flower-like shape with suppressed intensity along the $\overline{\Gamma \mathrm{K}}$ direction. We show that this effect is not due to the forbidden backscattering in the spin-momentum locked surface state in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ but reflects the threefold symmetry of the scattering potential.

Title: Tunable Band Inversion in Trilayer Graphene
Authors: Harsimran Kaur Mann, Simrandeep Kaur, Safil Mullick, Priya Tiwari, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Aveek Bid
Abstract: Displacement field control of elecronic bands in low-dimensional systems is a promising route toward engineering emergent quantum phases. Here, we report displacement-field-induced band inversion and modulation of the Berry phase of low-energy quasi particles in high-mobility Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene (TLG). Using quantum oscillations, we track the evolution of the Fermi surface and topological properties of Dirac-like gully bands that emerge under a finite interlayer potential. We observe a striking sequence of transitions: at low displacement field $D$, the gullies are characterized by a Berry phase of $2\pi$ and large effective mass, indicating massive fermions. As $D$ increases, the Berry phase abruptly shifts to $\pi$ and the effective mass reaches a minimum, signaling the onset of massless Dirac behavior. At higher $D$, the Berry phase returns to $2\pi$, and the effective mass increases again, consistent with a band inversion. These findings demonstrate a rare, reversible topological phase transition - massive to massless to massive - driven entirely by an external displacement field. Despite robust theoretical predictions [\textit{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{87}, 085424 (2013), \textit{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{87}, 115422 (2013), and \textit{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{101}, 245411 (2020)], this evolution of the band topology had escaped experimental detection. Our results establish TLG as a tunable platform for nanoscale control of band topology. They establish a means to tune between massive and Dirac-like dispersions dynamically providing a foundation for exploring field-switchable topological phenomena in layered 2D systems.

Title: Anti-symmetric Chiral currents at zero magnetic field in some two-dimensional superconductors
Authors: Chandra M. Varma
Abstract: Non-reciprocal critical currents without applying an external magnetic field have been observed recently in several superconductors, in various forms of Graphene, a Kagome compound and in an under-doped cuprate. A necessary requirement for this is that the usual supercurrent be accompanied by an anti-symmetric chiral super-current, i.e. with the symmetry of a hall current; equivalently that the superfluid density tensor have an anti-symmetric chiral component. It also requires inversion breaking. The conditions for this phenomena are derived to find that their normal states must break time-reversal and chirality and that the superconducting states must in addition be non-unitary. Each of the superconductors where spontaneous non-reciprocal critical currents are observed have shown some evidence for such broken symmetries in the normal state. The superconducting state of such materials have topological edge currents, but their projected electro-magnetic part is in general not an integer. The edge states are protected in the superconductor due to a gap. The normal state should show a Kerr effect and, under ideal conditions, an anomalous Hall effect.

Title: Complexity of Bose-Einstein condensates at finite temperature
Authors: Chang-Yan Wang
Abstract: We investigate the geometric quantum complexity of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at finite temperature. Specifically, we use the Bures and Sjöqvist metrics -- generalizations of the Fubini-Study metric for mixed quantum states, as well as the Nielsen geometric complexity approach based on purification of mixed states. Starting from the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian of BEC, which exhibits an $SU(1,1)$ symmetry, we explicitly derive and compare the complexities arising from these three distinct measures. For the Bures and Sjöqvist metrics, analytical and numerical evaluations of the corresponding geodesics are provided, revealing characteristic scaling behaviors with respect to temperature. In the Nielsen complexity approach, we rigorously handle the gauge freedoms associated with mixed state purification and non-uniqueness unitary operations, demonstrating that the resulting complexity aligns precisely with the Bures metric. Our work provides a comparative study of the geometric complexity of finite-temperature Bose-Einstein condensates, revealing its intimate connections to symmetry structures and temperature effects in BEC systems.

Title: Fermi energy sensitive universal conductance fluctuations in anisotropic materials
Authors: Qiang Yang, Yayun Hu, Zhe Hou, Peiqing Tong
Abstract: Universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) are a hallmark of quantum interference in mesoscopic devices. According to the Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory, the amplitude of UCF remains independent of system parameters such as Fermi energy and disorder strength. However, recent experiments have demonstrated a significant variation in UCF with respect to Fermi energy in the anisotropic Dirac semimetal $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, suggesting a dependence on band anisotropy. In this work, we reconcile the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental observations through a detailed study of UCF versus Fermi energy using a tight-binding model with tunable anisotropy parameters. Near the band edge, the Hamiltonian is simplified to an anisotropic free electron gas model, recovering the generalized Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory. However, as the Fermi energy shifts toward the band center, where rotational symmetry breaks into $C_4$ (four-fold rotational) symmetry, the UCF amplitude deviates from the standard theory. Our findings reveal that UCF becomes increasingly sensitive to Fermi energy as the anisotropy grows stronger. Furthermore, using realistic parameters for $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, our calculations demonstrate an increase in UCF away from the Dirac point, in qualitative agreement with experimental results. The enhancement of UCF occurs in two perpendicular transport directions that we have calculated, albeit with quantitative differences in magnitude, which can be tested in future experiments. Given the prevalence of anisotropic materials and technical advances in engineering anisotropy through strain or twist, our results offer a valuable reference for characterizing intrinsic electronic properties via UCF.

Title: Circular dichroism in resonant photoelectron diffraction as a direct probe of sublattice magnetization in altermagnets
Authors: Peter Krüger
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of magnetic materials that are promising for spintronics technology. Here it is shown that in altermagnets, the circular dichroism (CD) in resonant photoelectron diffraction (RPED) contains a time-reversal odd signal, which provides a direct probe of the sublattice magnetization. RPED calculations are performed for MnTe at the Mn L2,3-edge resonance, using a combination of atomic multiplet and multiple scattering theory. A large magnetic CD is found for light helicity parallel to the Néel vector. This signal has the same angular distribution as the difference between the structural RPED of the two magnetic sublattices and its amplitude is approximately proportional to the X-ray magnetic CD in absorption of a single sublattice, thus providing a direct probe of the local magnetic moments.

Title: NEP89: Universal neuroevolution potential for inorganic and organic materials across 89 elements

Abstract: While machine-learned interatomic potentials offer near-quantum-mechanical accuracy for atomistic simulations, many are material-specific or computationally intensive, limiting their broader use. Here we introduce NEP89, a foundation model based on neuroevolution potential architecture, delivering empirical-potential-like speed and high accuracy across 89 elements. A compact yet comprehensive training dataset covering inorganic and organic materials was curated through descriptor-space subsampling and iterative refinement across multiple datasets. NEP89 achieves competitive accuracy compared to representative foundation models while being three to four orders of magnitude more computationally efficient, enabling previously impractical large-scale atomistic simulations of inorganic and organic systems. In addition to its out-of-the-box applicability to diverse scenarios, including million-atom-scale compression of compositionally complex alloys, ion diffusion in solid-state electrolytes and water, rocksalt dissolution, methane combustion, and protein-ligand dynamics, NEP89 also supports fine-tuning for rapid adaptation to user-specific applications, such as mechanical, thermal, structural, and spectral properties of two-dimensional materials, metallic glasses, and organic crystals.

Title: Ferroelectric Properties and Topological Polar Textures of PbTiO$_3$ from a Second-Principles Open-Source Interatomic Potential
Authors: Louis Bastogne, Philippe Ghosez
Abstract: We introduce an open-source, fully atomistic second-principles interatomic potential for lead titanate (PbTiO3), a benchmark ferroelectric material known for its strong polarization and hightemperature phase transitions. While density functional theory excels at capturing atomic-scale behavior, it remains computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations required to explore complex phenomena. Our model addresses this limitation by accurately reproducing key properties of PbTiO3, including domain wall dynamics and different topological textures formation, which are known as key features to next-generation memory and energy-efficient technologies. Validated against DFT data, the model remains predictive across a wide range of conditions. It offers an accessible and efficient framework for high-accuracy large-scale simulations, allowing deeper insights into PbTiO3 and its potential applications.

Title: Two-step phase transitions in Fe(Se,Te)

Abstract: In the studied crystals of FeSe0.7 Te0.3 , a structural phase transition occurs in two stages. At higher temperatures, the electronic subsystem undergoes a reconstruction, leading to a significant increase in elastoresistance. 77 Se NMR data show an abrupt change in the relaxation rate during this transition. The final transition occurs at a temperature several degrees below and is also accompanied by anomalies in the electronic properties. Thus, in the Fe(Se,Te) series, similarly to the behavior of pure FeSe under pressure, the type of transition changes and intermediate state appear before the structural transition is suppressed. This similarity between the corresponding phase diagrams is explained by the same deformation of the iron coordination environment in Fe(Se,Te) compounds and in FeSe under pressure. Our findings provide new and significant information on the phase diagram of Fe(Se,Te) compounds and in particular suggest the possible existence of a triple point near the quantum critical point.

Title: Superconducting gaps revealed by STM measurements on La2PrNi2O7 thin films at ambient pressure
Authors: Shengtai Fan, Mengjun Ou, Marius Scholten, Qing Li, Zhiyuan Shang, Yi Wang, Jiasen Xu, Huan Yang, Ilya M. Eremin, Hai-Hu Wen
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in nickelate systems has generated tremendous interests in the field of superconductivity. The superconducting transition temperature above 80 K in La3Ni2O7 under pressure and the coexisting spin excitations certainly categorize the nickelate superconductors as unconventional. The core issue to understand the superconductivity mechanism is about the superconducting gap and its symmetry. By using the substrate of SrLaAlO4(00l), we have successfully synthesized the superconducting thin film of La2PrNi2O7 with Tc(onset) = 41.5 K. Superconducting tunneling spectra are successfully measured on the terraces after we remove the surface layer and expose the superconducting layer by using the tip-excavation technique. The spectrum shows a two-gap structure with Delta1 = 19 meV, Delta2 = 6 meV, and fittings based on the Dynes model indicate that the dominant gap should have an anisotropic s-wave structure, and the pure d-wave model fails to fit the data. Thus, our data put the priority in selecting the s+- among the two arguable pairing models: s+- and d-wave. Assuming the dominant interlayer superconducting gap, we obtain its magnitude to be Delta(perp) = 13 meV, while the intralayer gap Delta(para) is about 6 meV. Our results shed new light in understanding the mystery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate superconductors.

Title: Three-Majorana Cotunneling Interferometer for Non-Abelian Braiding and Topological Quantum Gate Implementation
Authors: Zhen Chen, Yijia Wu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.

Title: Phase separation in a mixture of proliferating and motile active matter
Authors: Lukas Hupe, Joanna M. Materska, David Zwicker, Ramin Golestanian, Bartlomiej Waclaw, Philip Bittihn
Abstract: Proliferation and motility are ubiquitous drivers of activity in biological systems. Here, we study a dense binary mixture of motile and proliferating particles with exclusively repulsive interactions, where homeostasis in the proliferating subpopulation is maintained by pressure-induced removal. Using computer simulations, we show that phase separation emerges naturally in this system at high density and weak enough self-propulsion. We show that condensation is caused by interactions between motile particles induced by the growing phase, and recapitulate this behavior in an effective model of only motile particles with attractive interactions. Our results establish a new type of phase transition and pave a way to reinterpret the physics of dense cellular populations, such as bacterial colonies or tumors, as systems of mixed active matter.

Title: Gor'kov-Hedin Equations for Quantum Many-Body Systems with Spin-Dependent Interactions
Authors: Christopher Lane
Abstract: Driven by the need to understand and determine the presence of non-trivial superconductivity in real candidate materials, we present a generalized set of self-consistent Gor'kov-Hedin equations in a vibrating lattice with spin dependent electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. This extends Hedin's original equations to treat quantum many-body systems where electronic and lattice correlations along with relativistic effects coexist on the same footing. Upon iterating this set of equations, the corresponding spin-dependent GW approximation and generalized ladder approximations are constructed.

Title: Evolutionary dynamics of any multiplayer game on regular graphs
Authors: Chaoqian Wang, Matjaž Perc, Attila Szolnoki
Abstract: Multiplayer games on graphs are at the heart of theoretical descriptions of key evolutionary processes that govern vital social and natural systems. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework for solving multiplayer games with an arbitrary number of strategies on graphs is still missing. Here, we solve this by drawing an analogy with the Balls-and-Boxes problem, based on which we show that the local configuration of multiplayer games on graphs is equivalent to distributing $k$ identical co-players among $n$ distinct strategies. We use this to derive the replicator equation for any $n$-strategy multiplayer game under weak selection, which can be solved in polynomial time. As an example, we revisit the second-order free-riding problem, where costly punishment cannot truly resolve social dilemmas in a well-mixed population. Yet, in structured populations, we derive an accurate threshold for the punishment strength, beyond which punishment can either lead to the extinction of defection or transform the system into a rock-paper-scissors-like cycle. The analytical solution also qualitatively agrees with the phase diagrams that were previously obtained for non-marginal selection strengths. Our framework thus allows an exploration of any multi-strategy multiplayer game on regular graphs.

Title: How transformers learn structured data: insights from hierarchical filtering
Authors: Jerome Garnier-Brun, Marc Mézard, Emanuele Moscato, Luca Saglietti
Abstract: Understanding the learning process and the embedded computation in transformers is becoming a central goal for the development of interpretable AI. In the present study, we introduce a hierarchical filtering procedure for data models of sequences on trees, allowing us to hand-tune the range of positional correlations in the data. Leveraging this controlled setting, we provide evidence that vanilla encoder-only transformers can approximate the exact inference algorithm when trained on root classification and masked language modeling tasks, and study how this computation is discovered and implemented. We find that correlations at larger distances, corresponding to increasing layers of the hierarchy, are sequentially included by the network during training. By comparing attention maps from models trained with varying degrees of filtering and by probing the different encoder levels, we find clear evidence of a reconstruction of correlations on successive length scales corresponding to the various levels of the hierarchy, which we relate to a plausible implementation of the exact inference algorithm within the same architecture.

Title: Fighting Exponentially Small Gaps by Counterdiabatic Driving
Authors: András Grabarits, Federico Balducci, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through a first-order quantum phase transition. Specifically, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging, necessitating high-order nonlocal terms in the expansion. Our results demonstrate that local CD strategies have limited effectiveness when crossing the extremely small gaps characteristic of NP-hard Ising problems. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which significantly increases the fidelity to the target state over the expansion method by directly addressing the gap-closing point and the associated edge states.

Title: Universal Characterization of Quantum Many-Body States through Local Information
Authors: Claudia Artiaco, Thomas Klein Kvorning, David Aceituno Chávez, Loïc Herviou, Jens H. Bardarson
Abstract: We propose a universal framework for classifying quantum states based on their scale-resolved correlation structure. Using the recently introduced information lattice, which provides an operational definition of the total amount of correlations at each scale, we define intrinsic characteristic length scales of quantum states. We analyze ground and midspectrum eigenstates of the disordered interacting Kitaev chain, showing that our framework provides a novel unbiased approach to quantum matter.

Title: Little to lose: the case for a robust European green hydrogen strategy
Authors: Koen van Greevenbroek, Johannes Schmidt, Marianne Zeyringer, Alexander Horsch
Abstract: The EU targets 10 Mt of green hydrogen production by 2030, but has not committed to targets for 2040. Green hydrogen competes with carbon capture and storage, biomass and imports in reaching emissions reductions; earlier studies have demonstrated the great uncertainty in future cost-optimal development of green hydrogen. In spite of this, we show that Europe risks little by setting green hydrogen production targets at around 25 Mt by 2040. Employing an extensive scenario analysis combined with novel near-optimal techniques, we find that this target results in systems that are within 10% of cost-optimal in most considered scenarios. Setting concrete targets is important in order to resolve significant uncertainty which hampers investments. Targeting green hydrogen reduces the dependence on carbon capture and storage and green fuel imports, making for a more robust European climate strategy.

Title: Hall Angle of a Spatially Random Vector Model
Authors: Yi-Li Wang, Young-Kwon Han, Xian-Hui Ge, Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: Strange metals exhibit linear resistivity and anomalous Hall transport, yet a comprehensive theory that accounts for both phenomena is still lacking. Recent studies have shown SYK-like spatially random couplings between a Fermi surface and a bosonic field, either scalar or vector type, can yield linear-$T$ resistivity. In this paper, we continue the investigation on a vector coupling in the presence of a magnetic field. We compute the fermion and boson propagators, along with the self-energy and polarization functions, and determine their dependence on the magnetic field. Although the Hall angle does not exhibit the signature of strange-metal, the linear-in-temperature resistivity remains at low temperatures. Results indicate that random interactions can robustly support linear transport, though additional ingredients may be required to capture the full phenomenology of strange metals.

Title: Emergence of network communities driven by local rules
Authors: Alexei Vazquez
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here, by means of numerical simulations, I show that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_ \kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model and Infomap methods for community detection, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_ \kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conjecture that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.

Title: Optimal Spectral Transitions in High-Dimensional Multi-Index Models
Authors: Leonardo Defilippis, Yatin Dandi, Pierre Mergny, Florent Krzakala, Bruno Loureiro
Abstract: We consider the problem of how many samples from a Gaussian multi-index model are required to weakly reconstruct the relevant index subspace. Despite its increasing popularity as a testbed for investigating the computational complexity of neural networks, results beyond the single-index setting remain elusive. In this work, we introduce spectral algorithms based on the linearization of a message passing scheme tailored to this problem. Our main contribution is to show that the proposed methods achieve the optimal reconstruction threshold. Leveraging a high-dimensional characterization of the algorithms, we show that above the critical threshold the leading eigenvector correlates with the relevant index subspace, a phenomenon reminiscent of the Baik-Ben Arous-Peche (BBP) transition in spiked models arising in random matrix theory. Supported by numerical experiments and a rigorous theoretical framework, our work bridges critical gaps in the computational limits of weak learnability in multi-index model.

Title: Symmetric Tensor Coupling in Holographic Mean-Field Theory: Deformed Dirac Cones
Authors: Moongul Byun, Taewon Yuk, Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We extend the holographic mean-field theory to rank-two symmetric tensor order parameter field coupled with fermion. We classify the roles of symmetric tensor order according to the effect on the spectral density: cone-angle change, squashing, and tilting of the spectral light cones. The over-tilted light cone is also achieved in a generalized prescription, which consistently preserves the causality condition. Our results provide agreements between the holographic spectra with those observed in real materials, such as type-II Dirac cones and strained graphene.

Title: Interplay of entanglement structures and stabilizer entropy in spin models
Authors: Michele Viscardi, Marcello Dalmonte, Alioscia Hamma, Emanuele Tirrito
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer Rényi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.

Title: polyGen: A Learning Framework for Atomic-level Polymer Structure Generation
Authors: Ayush Jain, Rampi Ramprasad
Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges in the on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect the conformational diversity of polymers. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers because of challenges in representation and dataset constraints. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first generative model designed specifically for polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone. polyGen combines graph-based encodings with a latent diffusion transformer using positional biased attention for realistic conformation generation. Given the limited dataset of 3,855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we incorporate joint training with small molecule data to enhance generation quality. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen overcomes the limitations of traditional crystal structure prediction methods for polymers, successfully generating realistic and diverse linear and branched conformations, with promising performance even on challenging large repeat units. As the first atomic-level proof-of-concept capturing intrinsic polymer flexibility, it marks a new capability in material structure generation.

Title: Quantum Statistics of Two Identical Particles and Modified Hong-Ou-Mandel Interferometer
Authors: Won-Young Hwang, Kicheon Kang
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to probe the quantum statistics of two identical particles. The transition between the quantum and classical statistics of two identical particles is described by the particles having identical multiple internal energy levels. We show that effective distinguishability emerges as the thermal energy increases with respect to the energy level spacing, and the mesoscopic regime bridges quantum indistinguishability and classical distinguishability. A realistic experimental approach is proposed using a two-particle interferometer, where the particles reach statistical equilibrium before the two-particle distribution is measured. The unitarity of the scattering/separation process ensures the preservation of the equilibrium distribution and allows a direct measurement of the two-particle statistical distribution. Our results show the transition between quantum and classical behavior of the two-particle distribution, which can be directly probed by a realistic experiment.

Title: Iterative Corpus Refinement for Materials Property Prediction Based on Scientific Texts
Authors: Lei Zhang, Markus Stricker
Abstract: The discovery and optimization of materials for specific applications is hampered by the practically infinite number of possible elemental combinations and associated properties, also known as the `combinatorial explosion'. By nature of the problem, data are scarce and all possible data sources should be used. In addition to simulations and experimental results, the latent knowledge in scientific texts is not yet used to its full potential. We present an iterative framework that refines a given scientific corpus by strategic selection of the most diverse documents, training Word2Vec models, and monitoring the convergence of composition-property correlations in embedding space. Our approach is applied to predict high-performing materials for oxygen reduction (ORR), hydrogen evolution (HER), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions for a large number of possible candidate compositions. Our method successfully predicts the highest performing compositions among a large pool of candidates, validated by experimental measurements of the electrocatalytic performance in the lab. This work demonstrates and validates the potential of iterative corpus refinement to accelerate materials discovery and optimization, offering a scalable and efficient tool for screening large compositional spaces where reliable data are scarce or non-existent.

Title: Fluxonium as a control qubit for bosonic quantum information
Authors: Ke Nie, J. Nofear Bradford, Supriya Mandal, Aayam Bista, Wolfgang Pfaff, Angela Kou
Abstract: Bosonic codes in superconducting resonators are a hardware-efficient avenue for quantum error correction and benefit from favorable error hierarchies provided by long-lived cavities compared to typical superconducting qubits. The required coupling to an ancillary control qubit, however, can negate these benefits by inducing highly detrimental effects such as excess decoherence and undesired nonlinearities. An important question is thus whether a cavity-qubit coupling can be realized that offers readout and control capabilities without spoiling the cavity. Here, motivated by its long lifetime and design flexibility of its Hamiltonian, we experimentally investigate the fluxonium as a control qubit for superconducting cavities. We couple a fluxonium qubit to a superconducting resonator in the strong-dispersive regime and use it to measure the coherence and inherited nonlinearities of the resonator. We then demonstrate universal control by preparing and characterizing resonator Fock states and their superpositions, with fidelities limited by resonator decay in our planar prototype device. Finally, we use the predictability of the resonator's inherited nonlinearities to show numerically that the fluxonium can reach cavity-coupling regimes that eliminate undesirable cavity nonlinearities. These results demonstrate the potential of the fluxonium as a high-performance bosonic control qubit for superconducting cavities.

Title: Expansion-contraction duality breaking in a Planck-scale sensitive cosmological quantum simulator
Authors: S. Mahesh Chandran, Uwe R. Fischer
Abstract: We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.
