Title: Image-Guided Microstructure Optimization using Diffusion Models: Validated with Li-Mn-rich Cathode Precursors
Authors: Geunho Choi, Changhwan Lee, Jieun Kim, Insoo Ye, Keeyoung Jung, Inchul Park
Abstract: Microstructure often dictates materials performance, yet it is rarely treated as an explicit design variable because microstructure is hard to quantify, predict, and optimize. Here, we introduce an image centric, closed-loop framework that makes microstructural morphology into a controllable objective and demonstrate its use case with Li- and Mn-rich layered oxide cathode precursors. This work presents an integrated, AI driven framework for the predictive design and optimization of lithium-ion battery cathode precursor synthesis. This framework integrates a diffusion-based image generation model, a quantitative image analysis pipeline, and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. By extracting key morphological descriptors such as texture, sphericity, and median particle size (D50) from SEM images, the platform accurately predicts SEM like morphologies resulting from specific coprecipitation conditions, including reaction time-, solution concentration-, and pH-dependent structural changes. Optimization then pinpoints synthesis parameters that yield user defined target morphologies, as experimentally validated by the close agreement between predicted and synthesized structures. This framework offers a practical strategy for data driven materials design, enabling both forward prediction and inverse design of synthesis conditions and paving the way toward autonomous, image guided microstructure engineering.

Title: Observation of Near-Critical Kibble-Zurek Scaling in Rydberg Atom Arrays
Authors: Tao Zhang, Hanteng Wang, Wenjun Zhang, Yuqing Wang, Angrui Du, Ziqi Li, Yujia Wu, Chengshu Li, Jiazhong Hu, Hui Zhai, Wenlan Chen
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek scaling reveals the universal dynamics when a system is linearly ramped across a symmetry-breaking phase transition. However, in reality, inevitable finite-size effects or symmetrybreaking perturbations can often smear out the critical point and render the phase transition into a smooth crossover. In this letter, we show experimentally that the precise Kibble-Zurek scaling can be retained in the near-critical crossover regime, not necessarily crossing the critical point strictly. The key ingredient to achieving this near-critical Kibble-Zurek scaling is that the system size and the symmetry-breaking field must be appropriately scaled following the variation of ramping speeds. The experiment is performed in a reconfigurable Rydberg atom array platform, where the Rydberg blockade effect induces a Z2 symmetry-breaking transition. The atom array platform enables precise control of the system size and the zigzag geometry as a symmetry-breaking field. Therefore, we can demonstrate notable differences in the precision of the Kibble-Zurek scaling with or without properly scaling the system size and the zigzag geometry. Our results strengthen the Kibble-Zurek scaling as an increasingly valuable tool for investigating phase transition in quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Electronic structure of monolayer-CrTe$_2$: an antiferromagnetic 2D van der Waals material
Authors: Olivia Armitage, Naina Kushwaha, Akhil Rajan, Luke C. Rhodes, Sebastian Buchberger, Bruno Kenichi Saika, Shu Mo, Matthew D. Watson, Phil D. C. King, Peter Wahl
Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals materials are an important building block to realize spintronic functionalities in heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Yet, establishing their magnetic and electronic properties and the interrelationship between the magnetic ground state and electronic structure is often challenging because only a limited number of techniques can probe magnetism and electronic structure on length scales of tens to hundreds of nanometers. Chromium chalcogenides are a class of 2D magnetic materials for which a rich interplay between structure and magnetism has been predicted. Here, we combine angle-resolved photoemission and quasi-particle interference imaging to establish the electronic structure of a monolayer of CrTe$_2$ on graphite. From a comparison of model calculations with spectroscopic mapping using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy we establish the magnetic ground state and the low energy electronic structure. We demonstrate that the band structure of monolayer CrTe$_2$ is captured well by density functional theory (DFT) in a DFT+U framework when a Coulomb repulsion of $U=2.5\mathrm{eV}$ is accounted for.

Title: A Unifying Framework for Fractional Chern Insulator Stabilization
Authors: Peleg Emanuel, Anna Keselman, Yuval Oreg
Abstract: We present a theory of fractional Chern insulator stabilization against charge-ordered states. We argue that the phase competition is captured by an effective interaction range, which depends on both the bare interaction range and quantum geometric properties. We argue that short effective interaction ranges stabilize fractional states while longer-range interactions favor charge-ordered states. To confirm our hypothesis, we conduct a numerical study of the generalized Hofstadter model using the density matrix renormalization group. Our theory offers a new interpretation of the geometric stability hypothesis and generalizes it, providing a unifying framework for several approaches to fractional phase stabilization. Finally, we propose a route towards experimental verification of the theory and possible implications for fractional states in bands with higher Chern numbers.

Title: Experimental Observation of Short-Range Magnetic Correlations in Amorphous Nb$_2$O$_5$ and Ta$_2$O$_5$ Thin Films
Authors: Y. V. Krasnikova, A. A. Murthy, D. Bafia, F. Crisa, A. Clairmont, Z. Sung, J. Lee, A. Cano, M. Shinde, D. M. T. van Zanten, M. Bal, A. Romanenko, A. Grassellino, R. Dhundwal, D. Fuchs, T. Reisinger, I. M. Pop, A. Suter, T. Prokscha, Z. Salman
Abstract: We used muon spin rotation/relaxation/resonance ($\mu$SR) to investigate the magnetic properties of niobium pentoxide (Nb$_2$O$_5$) and tantalum pentoxide (Ta$_2$O$_5$) thin films. In their amorphous phase (sputter-deposited), both oxides exhibit magnetic behavior down to 2.8 K. However, the magnetic response is strongly structure-dependent: thermally-oxidized, poly-crystalline Ta$_2$O$_5$ shows suppressed magnetism, while amorphous Ta$_2$O$_5$ demonstrates local static magnetism. In contrast, amorphous Nb$_2$O$_5$ is significantly more magnetically disordered. These results suggest that magnetic inhomogeneity in the native oxides of Ta and Nb may be a key factor in the performance of superconducting devices, particularly limiting T$_1$ for qubits and resonators.

Title: Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation Using WO$_3$ Nanoparticle-Decorated Sodium Niobate Microcubes
Authors: Vanessa S Antonin, Felipe M Souza, Victor S Pinheiro, Jo√£o PC Moura, Aline B Trench, Caio Machado Fernandes, Marcos RV Lanza, Mauro C Santos
Abstract: The current work studies the electrocatalytic performance of NaNbO$_3$ microcubes decorated with WO$_3$ nanoparticles on Printex L6 at varying concentrations (1%, 3%, 5%, and 10% by weight) for H$_2$O$_2$ electrogeneration aiming for future use in electrochemical advanced oxidation processes for organic pollutant degradation H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration was studied using oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. Electrochemical results revealed an improvement in H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration for the NaNbO$_3$@WO$_3$/C materials compared to that achieved with Printex L6 carbon. Notably, the 5% NaNbO$_3$@WO$_3$/C electrocatalyst exhibited a higher ring current for oxygen reduction reaction and promoted a 2.1-electron transfer, facilitating a higher rate of H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration through the 2-electron mechanism. Also, enhancing oxygen-containing functional groups has shown the capability to thoroughly adjust characteristics and enhance active sites, increasing H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration. These findings suggest that 5% NaNbO$_3$@WO$_3$/C electrocatalysts hold promise for in situ hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration.

Title: Universal quench dynamics of lattice $q$ fermion Yukawa Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model
Authors: Haixin Qiu, Stefan Kehrein
Abstract: We study the quantum quench of the Yukawa Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and one of its lattice extensions with $q$ fermions and one boson. Several equilibrium properties are computed for general $q$ with different parameter scaling within the large-$N$ dynamical mean field scheme. The non-Fermi liquid quench dynamics are studied by integrating the Kadanoff-Baym equations for switching off the lattice term with constant Yukawa coupling or quenching to different final Yukawa couplings. The post-quench oscillations and relaxation dynamics are insensitive to the quench amplitudes deep inside the non-Fermi liquid phase. With weak lattice coupling quenches, we find universal thermalization dynamics similar to the SYK model; however, with two temperatures and two distinct relaxation rates for bosons and fermions, both signal Planckian relaxations without quasiparticles, as in strange metals.

Title: The uniqueness of the driven $œÜ_0$ Josephson junction: when steps are not Shapiro
Authors: K. Kulikov, J. Tekiƒá, E. Kovalenko, M. Nashaat, T. A. Belgibayev, Yu. M. Shukrinov
Abstract: The $\varphi_0$ superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor Josephson junction exhibits unique locking phenomena under the external periodic signal when the magnetic component is taken into account. Contrary to the well-known Shapiro steps that come from the locking with the electric component, locking of the Josephson oscillations with the magnetic one results in the appearance of Buzdin steps in the current-voltage characteristic and a much more complex response of the system. These steps possess distinctive properties that are indications of their unique origins and locking mechanisms. The width of the Buzdin step oscillates with the amplitude of the magnetic component, nevertheless, it exhibits anomalies in the Bessel-like behavior. In addition, we perform an analytical analysis that supports the numerical results and shows that the width of the Buzdin step represents a product of two Bessel functions. Investigation of the effects that simultaneously appear in the magnetic subsystem reveals the presence of destructive interference and magnetization reorientation that accompany the appearance of Buzdin steps.

Title: Coulomb Interaction-Stabilized Isolated Narrow Bands with Chern Numbers $\mathcal{C} > 1$ in Twisted Rhombohedral Trilayer-Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Vo Tien Phong, Cyprian Lewandowski
Abstract: Recently, fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects have been discovered in two-dimensional moir√© materials when a topologically nontrivial band with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$ is partially doped. Remarkably, superlattice Bloch bands can carry higher Chern numbers that defy the Landau-level paradigm and may even host exotic fractionalized states with non-Abelian quasiparticles. Inspired by this exciting possibility, we propose twisted \textit{rhombohedral} trilayer-bilayer graphene at $\theta \sim 1.2^\circ$ as a field-tunable quantum anomalous Chern insulator that features spectrally-isolated, kinetically-quenched, and topologically-nontrivial bands with $\mathcal{C} = 2,3$ favorable for fractional phases once fractionally doped, as characterized by their quantum geometry. Based on extensive self-consistent mean-field calculations, we show that these phases are stabilized by Coulomb interactions and are robust against variations in dielectric environment, tight-binding hopping parameters, and lattice relaxation.

Title: An Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Microwave Polarization Switch Implemented with Directed Surface Acoustic Waves in a Magnonic Crystal
Authors: Raisa Fabiha, Erdem Topsakal, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: The ability to switch the polarization of a transmitted electromagnetic wave from vertical to horizontal, or vice versa, is of great technological interest because of its many applications in long distance communication. Binary bits can be encoded in two orthogonal polarizations and transmitted securely from point to point. Polarization switches, however, are usually much larger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Consequently, most research in this area has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short (~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not too inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the wavelength is much larger (typically > 1 cm). That makes a microwave ultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, we report such a switch made of an array of magnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral dimension) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an "artificial magnonic crystal". A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate with suitable electrodes excites spin waves in the nanomagnets via phonon-magnon coupling, resulting in radiation of electromagnetic waves via magnon-photon coupling. The polarization of the beam radiated in a given direction at a given frequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by changing the direction of SAW propagation in the substrate to implement the polarization switch.

Title: Phase alignment in a lattice of exciton-polaritonic Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: N.V. Kuznetsova, D.V. Makarov, N.A. Asriyan, A.A. Elistratov
Abstract: Dynamics of exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensate is examined by means of the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation including non-Markovian coupling to the excitonic reservoir. Attention is concentrated on properties of the condensate lattice created by laser beams providing incoherent pumping of the reservoir. It is shown that phase ordering of the lattice depends on temperature. The crossover between the in-phase (``ferromagnetic'') and the checkboard (``antiferromagnetic'') orders is accompanied by variation of the steady-state condensate density. Also it is shown that the condensate lattices can retain ordered pattern for temperatures which are much higher than the critical temperature of a single spot, probably due to suppression of the modulational instability.

Authors: M.P. Telenkov, Yu.A. Mityagin
Abstract: The processes of electron-electron scattering in a quantum well in a quantizing magnetic field are considered. The matrix of electron-electron scattering rates containing all types of transitions is calculated. This matrix is analysed, and the relative magnitude of the rates of transitions of different types is established. The behaviour of electron-electron scattering processes at changing the orientation of the quantising magnetic field is established.

Title: Theoretical Study on MR-TADF Materials Based on CzBN
Authors: Jinpu Bai (1), Jingfu Guo (1), Aynur Matyusup (1), Aimin Ren (2), Lu Shen (3) ((1) College of Physics, Northeast Normal University (2) Institute of Theoretical Chemistry, College of Chemistry, Jilin University (3) Department of Basic Science, Jilin Jianzhu University)
Abstract: Multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) materials have garnered significant research interest owing to their remarkably narrow emission spectra with full width at half maximum (FWHM) below $40~\text{nm}$, demonstrating substantial advantages over conventional donor-acceptor (D--A) type TADF materials in spectral purity. However, conventional N--B--N resonant framework materials are fundamentally constrained by their intrinsically low reverse intersystem crossing rates ($k_{\text{RISC}} < 10^{3}~\text{s}^{-1}$), presenting a persistent challenge for achieving high-efficiency TADF. This study proposes a triple collaborative design strategy based on CzBN to break through this limitation: (1) Enhance the separation of HOMO and LUMO by $\pi$-conjugation expansion and reduce $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$; (2) Introduce O/S heteroatoms to control the excited state charge transfer (CT) characteristics and further reduce $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$; (3) Enhance the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect through the synergy of extended $\pi$-system and heteroatoms. Based on this, five new MR-TADF molecules were designed and studied. Among them, the $k_{\text{RISC}}$ of CzBN\_S reached $3.48 \times 10^{6}~\text{s}^{-1}$, two orders of magnitude higher than CzBN, while maintaining $\Delta E_{\text{ST}} < 0.1~\text{eV}$ and FWHM at $40~\text{nm}$.

Title: Lanthanide L-Edge Spectroscopy of High-Entropy Oxides: Insights into Valence and Phase Stability
Authors: Gerald R. Bejger, Mary Kathleen Caucci, Saeed S.I. Almishal, Billy Yang, Jon-Paul Maria, Susan B. Sinnott, Christina M. Rost
Abstract: High-entropy oxides (HEOs) are a promising class of multicomponent ceramics with tunable structural and electronic properties. In this study, we investigate the local electronic structure of rare-earth HEOs in the (Ce, Sm, Pr, La, Y)O2 system using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). By systematically increasing the Ce concentration, we observe a phase transition from bixbyite to fluorite, tracked by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and corroborated by L-edge XANES analysis of La, Sm, Ce, and Pr. The oxidation states of La and Sm remain trivalent, while Ce exhibits a minor Ce 3+ fraction and Pr shows a consistent mixed-valence state. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Bader charge analysis support these findings and reveal that the phase transition is driven by compositional effects rather than cation redox. Our combined experimental and computational approach provides new insights into structure-valence correlations in RE-HEOs and their implications for ionic transport and phase stability.

Title: Electron-phonon coupling in correlated materials: insights from the Hubbard-Holstein model
Authors: Jennifer Coulter, Andrew J. Millis
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory computations of the electron self energy of the Hubbard-Holstein model as a function of electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions are analyzed to gain insight into the dependence of electron-phonon couplings on correlation strength in quantum materials. We find that the electron-phonon interaction is strongly suppressed by electronic correlations, while electron-electron correlation effects at Fermi liquid scales are only weakly modified by coupling to phonons, with phonon-induced modifications most evident at high frequencies on the order of the electronic bandwidth. Implications for beyond-density functional theories of the electron-phonon interaction are discussed.

Title: Colossal anomalous Stark shift in defect emission of undulated 2D materials
Authors: Sunny Gupta, Boris I. Yakobson
Abstract: We report a strikingly new physical phenomenon that mirror symmetry breaking in undulated two-dimensional (2D) materials induces a colossal Stark shift in defect emissions, occurring without external electric field F, termed anomalous Stark effect. First-principles calculations of multiple defects in bent 2D hBN uncover the fundamental physical reasonings for this anomalous effect and reveal this arises due to strong coupling between flexoelectric polarization and defect dipole moment. This flexo-dipole interaction, similar to that in traditional Stark effect due to F, results in zero-phonon line (ZPL) shifts >500 meV for defects like NBVN and CBVN at $\kappa$ = 1/nm, exceeding typical Stark shifts by 2-3 orders of magnitude. The large ZPL shifts variations with curvature and bending direction offers a method to identify nanotube chirality and explain the large variability in single photon emitters' wavelength in 2D materials, with additional implications for designing nano-electro-mechanical and photonic devices.

Title: Chiral split magnons in metallic g-wave altermagnets: Insights from many-body perturbation theory
Authors: Wejdan Beida, Ersoy Sasioglu, Christoph Friedrich, Gustav Bihlmayer, Yuriy Mokrousov, Stefan Bl√ºgel
Abstract: Altermagnets represent a novel class of magnetic materials that bridge the gap between conventional ferromagnets (FMs) and antiferromagnets (AFMs). Similar to FMs, altermagnets exhibit spin splitting in their electronic bands along specific crystal directions. However, like AFMs, they feature a compensated magnetic structure with zero net magnetic moment. A defining characteristic of altermagnets is the non-degeneracy of their magnon (spin-wave) modes along the crystallographic directions where electronic bands display spin splitting. This non-degeneracy imparts chirality and direction-dependent magnon dispersions, governed by the unique symmetry constraints of altermagnetic systems. In this study, we investigate the interplay between electronic band spin splitting and chiral magnon excitations in a series of metallic g-wave altermagnets (\(MZ\), where \(M\)= V, Cr; \(Z\)= As, Sb, Bi) using the density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory. We systematically analyze the impact of pnictogen substitution (As, Sb, Bi) on spin splitting and magnon dispersions. Our findings reveal pronounced anisotropic magnon band splitting that closely mirrors the spin-split electronic bands. Moreover, we find that magnon damping due to Stoner excitations is highly wavevector-dependent, reaching substantial values in specific Brillouin zone regions. These results highlight the potential of altermagnets for next-generation spintronic and magnonic devices, where direction-dependent magnon lifetimes and nonreciprocal magnon transport could enable new functionalities for chiral magnon propagation and directional magnon control.

Title: Equivariant graph neural network surrogates for predicting the properties of relaxed atomic configurations
Authors: Jamie Holber, Krishna Garikipati
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) calculations determine the relaxed atomic positions and lattice parameters that minimize the formation energy of a structure. We present an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) model to predict the outcome of DFT calculations for structures of interest. Cluster expansions are a well established approach for representing the formation energies. However, traditional cluster expansions are limited in their ability to handle variations from a fixed lattice, including interstitial atoms, amorphous materials, and materials with multiple structures. EGNNs offer a more flexible framework that inherently respects the symmetry of the system without being reliant on a particular lattice. In this work, we present the mathematical framework and the results of training for lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) at various compositions of lithium and arrangements of the lithium atoms. Our results demonstrate that the EGNN can accurately predict quantities outside the training set including the largest atomic displacements, the strain tensor and energy, and the formation energy providing greater insight into the system being studied without the need for more DFT calculations.

Title: Competing Pair Density Wave and Uniform $d$-wave Superconductivity in Phase Separated 214 Cuprates at the 1/8 Anomaly
Authors: Qiang Chen, Angela Moskal, Yiheng Wang, B. D. E. McNiven, A. A. Aczel, Wei Tian, B. D. Gaulin
Abstract: Compelling evidence exists for electronic phase separation in cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors, emerging near 1/8 hole doping. At these dopings and low temperatures, intertwined charge and spin stripes coexist with more uniformly doped regions in the two-dimensional (2$D$) copper-oxide planes. Each region is capable of developing superconducting pairing, either as a pair density wave (PDW) within the stripes or as a uniform $d$-wave condensate ($d$-SC) in the more homogeneous regions. Using neutron scattering on single crystals of La$_{1.875-y}$Nd$_{y}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$, we demonstrate that the onset temperatures for spin stripe order ($T_N$) and superconductivity ($T_c$) merge as the average ordered moment vanishes in LSCO ($y = 0$), whereas Nd doping stabilizes static stripe order and suppresses $T_c$. Because the spin stripes possess the same in-plane periodicity (8$a$) as the PDW and establish the framework in which the PDW resides, the stabilization of spin stripe order enhances PDW correlations. Thus, the competition between $d$-wave pairing in the uniform regions and PDW pairing in the stripe-ordered regions can be controlled by the Nd concentration in La$_{1.875-y}$Nd$_{y}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$, allowing the superconducting $T_c$ to vary by nearly an order of magnitude at a fixed 1/8 hole doping.

Title: Enhancing the Efficiency of Complex Systems Crystal Structure Prediction by Active Learning Guided Machine Learning Potential
Authors: Jiaxiang Li, Junwei Feng, Jie Luo, Bowen Jiang, Xiangyu Zheng, Jian Lv, Keith Butler, Hanyu Liu, Congwei Xie, Yu Xie, Yanming Ma
Abstract: Understanding multicomponent complex material systems is essential for design of advanced materials for a wide range of technological applications. While state-of-the-art crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods effectively identify new structures and assess phase stability, they face fundamental limitations when applied to complex systems. This challenge stems from the combinatorial explosion of atomic configurations and the vast stoichiometric space, both of which contribute to computational demands that rapidly exceed practical feasibility. In this work, we propose a flexible and automated workflow to build a highly generalizable and data-efficient machine learning potential (MLP), effectively unlocking the full potential of CSP algorithms. The workflow is validated on both Mg-Ca-H ternary and Be-P-N-O quaternary systems, demonstrating substantial machine learning acceleration in high-throughput structural optimization and enabling the efficient identification of promising compounds. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in exploring complex material systems and accelerating the discovery of new multicomponent materials.

Title: Sliding and superlubric moir√© twisting ferroelectric transition in HfO2
Authors: Jie Sun, Xin Li, Tianlin Li, Yu Yun, Guodong Ren, Yiheng Shen, Tengfei Cao, Li-Min Liu
Abstract: Despite progress in HfO2 thin-film ferroelectrics, issues such as fatigue and high coercive fields persist, and the dynamics of emerging twisted ferroelectricity remain largely unexplored. Here, we explore how interlayer sliding and twisting in bilayer HfO2 enables low barrier switching pathways. Among 144 sliding configurations, two exhibit strong in-plane polarization (2360 pC/m) with a low switching barrier of 3.19 meV/atom. Twisting generates polar textures associated with moir√© patterns and quasi-flat bands, which drive ferroelectricity via a soft zone-center optical mode, as revealed by machine-learning-assisted first-principles calculations. At twist angles of 21.79¬∞ and 27.80¬∞, switching barriers drop to 0.58 and 0.06 meV/atom, indicating superlubric-like ferroelectric transitions. Notably, the 46.83¬∞ twisted bilayer shows an almost barrier-free polar evolution (0.009 meV/atom), attributed to sharply enhanced zone-center phonon linewidths. Our findings establish a moir√©-engineered, ultra-low-energy switching route for 2D ferroelectric applications.

Title: Neural Network-Driven Molecular Insights into Alkaline Wet Etching of GaN: Toward Atomistic Precision in Nanostructure Fabrication
Authors: Purun-hanul Kim, Jeong Min Choi, Seungwu Han, Youngho Kang
Abstract: We present large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on a machine-learning interatomic potential to investigate the wet etching behavior of various GaN facets in alkaline solution-a process critical to the fabrication of nitride-based semiconductor devices. A Behler-Parrinello-type neural network potential (NNP) was developed by training on extensive DFT datasets and iteratively refined to capture chemical reactions between GaN and KOH. To simulate the wet etching of GaN, we perform NNP-MD simulations using the temperature-accelerated dynamics approach, which accurately reproduces the experimentally observed structural modification of a GaN nanorod during alkaline etching. The etching simulations reveal surface-specific morphological evolutions: pyramidal etch pits emerge on the $-c$ plane, while truncated pyramidal pits form on the $+c$ surface. The non-polar m and a surfaces exhibit lateral etch progression, maintaining planar morphologies. Analysis of MD trajectories identifies key surface reactions governing the etching mechanisms. To gain deeper insights into the etching kinetics, we conduct enhanced-sampling MD simulations and construct free-energy profiles for Ga dissolution, a process that critically influences the overall etching rate. The $-c$, $a$, and $m$ planes exhibit moderate activation barriers, indicating the feasibility of alkaline wet etching. In contrast, the $+c$ surface displays a significantly higher barrier, illustrating its strong resistance to alkaline etching. Additionally, we show that Ga-O-Ga bridges can form on etched surfaces, potentially serving as carrier traps. By providing a detailed atomistic understanding of GaN wet etching, this work offers valuable guidance for surface engineering in GaN-based device fabrication.

Title: X-Ray and neutron diffraction patterns of the AlCrTiV high entropy alloy and quaternary Heusler structures
Authors: Nedjma Kalliney, Michael Widom
Abstract: The quaternary alloy AlCrTiV has been proposed as both a lightweight high entropy alloy and also a functional spin filter material based on the Heusler structure. Experimental investigations to-date, based on X-ray diffraction, offer conflicting interpretations of the structure. Here we simulate diffraction patterns of the various proposed structures to show that neutron diffraction, in particular, can reveal the nature of long-range chemical order and discriminate among distributions of the refractory transition metals. Magnetic contributions to the neutron diffraction are also discussed.

Title: Observation of high partial-wave Feshbach resonances in $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Yue Zhang, Liangchao Chen, Zekui Wang, Yazhou Wang, Pengjun Wang, Lianghui Huang, Zengming Meng, Ran Qi, Jing Zhang
Abstract: We report the new observation of several high partial-wave (HPW) magnetic Feshbach resonances (FRs) in $^{39}$K atoms of the hyperfine substate $\left|F=1,m_{F}=-1\right\rangle$. These resonances locate at the region between two broad $s$-wave FRs from 32.6 G to 162.8 G, in which Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) can be produced with tunable positive scattering length obtained by magnetic FRs. These HPW FRs are induced by the dipolar spin-spin interaction with s-wave in the open channel and HPW in the closed channel. Therefore, these HPW FRs have distinct characteristics in temperature dependence and loss line shape from that induced by spin-exchange interaction with HPWs in both open and closed channels. Among these resonances, one $d$-wave and two $g$-wave FRs are confirmed by the multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT) calculation. The HPW FRs have significant applications in many-body physics dominated by HPW pairing.

Title: Current-induced successive structural phase transitions beyond thermal equilibrium in single-crystal VO2
Authors: Shunsuke Kitou, Akitoshi Nakano, Masato Imaizumi, Yuiga Nakamura, Yuto Nakamura, Hideo Kishida, Taka-hisa Arima, Ichiro Terasaki
Abstract: Nonequilibrium systems driven by external energy sources host unexplored physics; yet phase transitions beyond thermal equilibrium remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that electric current induces structural phase transitions in single-crystal VO2, a prototypical strongly correlated material. At room temperature, synchrotron X-ray diffraction shows that a current density of 6.5 A/cm2 disrupts V-V dimers, driving a monoclinic-to-tetragonal insulator-to-metal transition, independent of Joule heating. Increasing the current to 10 A/cm2 triggers a discontinuous isotropic lattice expansion, stabilizing a novel tetragonal structure that does not exist in thermal equilibrium. Optical microscopy and microscopic Raman spectroscopy reveal dynamic domain motion and metastable phases, reminiscent of dissipative structures. These findings establish direct pathways to access hidden phases and symmetry changes beyond thermal equilibrium, broadening the frontiers of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

Title: Toward Efficient Electrokinetic Energy Conversion with Topographic Modulation of Electrical Conduction
Authors: Austin Dick, Kushal Iyyapareddy, Aktaruzzaman Al Hossain, Carlos E. Colosqui
Abstract: This work presents experimental and theoretical analyses of electrokinetic flow in microchannels with glass and silica surfaces across a broad range of electrolyte concentrations (0.01 to 100 mM). We demonstrate simple but effective strategies for controlling electrical conduction by engineering nanoscale and microscale topographic features that directly modify the structure and extent of the electric double layer (EDL) and the interfacial ion conduction pathway. These tailored surface topographies modulate the overall electrical conductivity in slit microchannels through similar phenomena documented for nanochannels and nanopores due to the presence of liquidfilled nanoscale topographic features with high concentration of highly mobile protons. The findings of this work reveal that the interaction between tailored surface features and the EDL can substantially enhance energy conversion efficiency in microscale systems. These insights along with simple analytical models provide guidance for the rational design and optimization of scalable electrokinetic devices and are broadly relevant to numerous energy harvesting and charge-separation technologies.

Title: Energy-Efficient Pseudo-Ratchet for Brownian Computers through One-Dimensional Quantum Brownian Motion
Authors: Sho Nakade, Ferdinand Peper, Kazuki Kanki, Tomio Petrosky
Abstract: Brownian computers utilize thermal fluctuations as a resource for computation and hold promise for achieving ultra-low-energy computations. However, the lack of a statistical direction in Brownian motion necessitates the incorporation of ratchets that facilitate the speeding up and completion of computations in Brownian computers. To make the ratchet mechanism work effectively, an external field is required to overcome thermal fluctuations, which has the drawback of increasing energy consumption. As a remedy for this drawback, we introduce a new approach based on one-dimensional (1D) quantum Brownian motion, which exhibits intrinsic unidirectional transport even in the absence of external forces or asymmetric potential gradients, thereby functioning as an effective pseudo-ratchet. Specifically, we exploit that quantum resonance effects in 1D systems divide the momentum space of particles into subspaces. These subspaces have no momentum inversion symmetry, resulting in the natural emergence of unidirectional flow. We analyze this pseudo-ratchet mechanism without energy dissipation from an entropic perspective and show that it remains consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.

Title: Critical dynamics of three-dimensional $Z_N$ gauge models and the inverted XY universality class
Authors: Claudio Bonati, Haralambos Panagopoulos, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We investigate the critical relaxational dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) lattice $Z_N$ gauge models with $N=6$ and $N=8$, whose equilibrium critical behavior at their topological transitions belongs to the inverted XY (IXY) universality class (this is also the universality class of the continuous transitions of the 3D lattice U(1) gauge Higgs models with a one-component complex scalar field), which is connected to the standard XY universality class by a nonlocal duality relation of the partition functions. Specifically, we consider the purely relaxational dynamics realized by a locally reversible Metropolis dynamics, as commonly used in Monte Carlo simulations. To determine the corresponding dynamic exponent $z$, we focus on the out-of-equilibrium critical relaxational flows arising from instantaneous quenches to the critical point, which are analyzed within an out-of-equilibrium finite-size scaling framework. We obtain the estimate $z=2.59(3)$. A numerical analysis of the equilibrium critical dynamics give consistent, but less accurate, results. This dynamic exponent is expected to characterize the critical slowing down of the purely relaxational dynamics of all topological transitions that belong to the 3D IXY universality class. We note that this result implies that the critical relaxational dynamics of the 3D IXY universality class is slower than that of the standard 3D XY universality class, whose relaxational dynamic exponent $z\approx 2.02$ is significantly smaller, although they share the same length-scale critical exponent $\nu\approx 0.6717$.

Title: Modelling of time-dependent electrostatic effects and AFM-based surface conductivity characterization
Authors: Mario Navarro-Rodriguez, Paul Philip Schmidt, Regina Hoffmann-Vogel, Andres M. Somoza, Elisa Palacios-Lidon
Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) combined with electrical modes provides a powerful contactless approach to characterize material electrical properties at the nanoscale. However, conventional electrostatic models often overlook dynamic charge effects, which are particularly relevant for 2D materials deposited on insulating substrates. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework that extends traditional electrostatic models by incorporating charge dynamics, analyzing two key cases: quasi-ideal conductors and quasi-ideal insulators. Our model establishes a characteristic timescale, $\tau$, which governs charge redistribution and measurement reliability. Experimental validation using Graphene Oxide, Reduced Graphene Oxide, and lightly reduced GO demonstrates strong dependence of frequency shift on surface conductivity, confirming our predictions. Temperature-dependent measurements further reveal conductivity variations consistent with disordered electronic materials. These findings provide critical insight into the impact of finite surface conductivity on AFM-based techniques and establish a novel method for evaluating charge dynamics in individual flakes of 2D materials and propose an alternative, contactless method for estimating surface conductivity.

Title: First-principles electron-phonon interactions with self-consistent Hubbard interaction: an application to transparent conductive oxides
Authors: Wooil Yang, Sabyasachi Tiwari, Feliciano Giustino, Young-Woo Son
Abstract: The ab initio computational method known as Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+$U$) captures well ground electronic structures of a set of solids that are poorly described by standard DFT alone. Since lattice dynamical properties are closely linked to electronic structures, the Hubbard-corrected density functional perturbation theory (DFPT+$U$) can calculate them at the same level of accuracy. To investigate the effects of $U$ on electron-phonon (el-ph) interactions, we implemented DFPT+$U$ with a Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism to determine $U$ self-consistently and applied our method to compute optical and transport properties of transparent conductive oxides of CdO and ZnO. For CdO, we find that opening a band gap due to $U$ restores the long-range Fr√∂hlich interaction and that its calculated mobility and absorption spectrum are in excellent agreement with experiments. For ZnO where a band gap already appears at the DFT level, DFPT+$U$ brings the results into much closer alignment with experiment, thus demonstrating improved accuracy of our method in dealing with el-ph interactions in these technologically important materials.

Title: Estimating Diffuseness for the Non-Relaxor Type Ferroelectric to Paraelectric Phase Transition in BaTiO3
Authors: Prithwiraj Ganguly, Prashant Joshi, Maneesha Puthiyoth, Somaditya Sen
Abstract: Barium titanate has been extensively studied for a long time as a model ferroelectric material. However, the Ferro-Paraelectric phase transition of this material is a complex problem to analyse when it becomes diffuse. This has attracted significant research attention over the past few decades, primarily because of their intriguing and not yet fully understood physical properties. Bearing in mind the essential practical applications of ferroelectric materials and the great interest in having a simple functional form, describing the temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity near the diffuse phase transition, scientists have been trying to figure out a proper model for a long time. In this work, such an investigation has been done to understand the diffusion dynamics, following a distribution of transition temperatures and the temperature-dependent dipole density. The transition is then revisited in the light of a temperature-dependent differential plot. Through which, distinct dielectric regimes are demarcated with improved insight into the progression from ferroelectric to paraelectric phase. Following the establishment, a simple yet effective new measure is being proposed, offering a more accurate and physically meaningful estimation of the diffuse phase transition dynamics.

Title: Controllable creation of topological boundary states in topological-insulator-based Josephson corner junctions

Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in condensed matter systems have attracted great attention in the past two decades, due to their interesting physics and potential application in topological quantum computing (TQC). However, the topologically protected nature of MZMs still need more experimental verifications. In this study, we have realized controllable creation of a topological boundary state at the corner of topological insulator (TI)-based Josephson corner junctions. This state demonstrates protected existence across a broad region in parametric space, and exhibits a non-2{\pi}-period but 4{\pi}-period-compatible energy-phase relation. Our study suggests that TI-based Josephson junctions, as proposed in the Fu-Kane scheme of TQC, may provide a promising platform for hosting and braiding MZMs.

Title: Hamiltonian replica exchange augmented with diffusion-based generative models and importance sampling to assess biomolecular conformational basins and barriers
Authors: Zakarya Benayad, Guillaume Stirnemann
Abstract: Enhanced sampling techniques are essential for exploring biomolecular conformational dynamics that occur on timescales inaccessible to conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study introduces a framework that combines Hamiltonian replica exchange (REST2) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and importance sampling to enhance the mapping of conformational free-energy landscapes. Building on previous applications of DDPMs to temperature replica exchange (TREM), we propose two key improvements. First, we adapt the method to REST2 by treating potential energy as a fluctuating variable. This adaptation allows for more efficient sampling in large biomolecular systems. Second, to further improve resolution in high-barrier regions, we develop an iterative scheme combining replica exchange, DDPM, and importance sampling along known collective variables. Benchmarking on the mini-protein CLN025 demonstrates that DDPM-refined REST2 achieves comparable accuracy to TREM while requiring fewer replicas. Application to the enzyme PTP1B reveals a loop transition pathway consistent with prior complex biased simulations, showcasing the approach's ability to uncover high-barrier transitions with minimal computational overhead with respect to conventional replica exchange approaches. Overall, this hybrid strategy enables more efficient exploration of free-energy landscapes, expanding the utility of generative models in enhanced sampling simulations.

Title: Elastic properties of silicene: Spinodal instabilities
Authors: Carlos P. Herrero, Rafael Ramirez
Abstract: Silicene, a two-dimensional (2D) allotrope of silicon, has attracted significant interest for its electronic and mechanical properties, alongside its compatibility with various substrates. In this study, we investigate the structural and elastic characteristics of silicene using molecular dynamics simulations based on a tight-binding Hamiltonian, calibrated to align with density-functional theory calculations. We focus particularly on the material's elastic properties and mechanical stability, analyzing its behavior under extensive compressive and tensile in-plane stresses and across temperatures up to 1000 K. Key properties examined include in-plane area, Si--Si bond length, atomic mean-square displacements, elastic constants, and 2D compression modulus. Our findings reveal a notable reduction in stiffness elastic constants, Poisson's ratio, and compression modulus with increasing temperature. Additionally, we identify mechanical instabilities in the silicene structure at specific compressive and tensile biaxial stresses, signaling the material's stability limits or spinodal points. At the corresponding spinodal pressures, structural and elastic properties exhibit anomalies or divergences.

Title: Metal-Insulator Transition described by Natural Orbital Functional Theory
Authors: Juan Felipe Huan Lew-Yee, Mario Piris
Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics and a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. Hydrogen-based systems offer a simple yet powerful model for investigating the MIT, as their insulating behavior arises purely from electron-electron interactions. In this work, we study finite hydrogen clusters with cubic geometries using Natural Orbital Functional Theory (NOFT), a method capable of accurately describing correlated systems beyond mean-field approaches. We focus on two key signatures of the MIT: the fundamental energy gap and the harmonic average of the atomic one-particle reduced density matrix. Our results show that NOFT captures the transition from insulating to metallic behavior as the interatomic distance decreases. By extrapolating the energy gap to the thermodynamic limit, we estimate a critical distance rc ~ 1.2 Ang, in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the reliability of NOFT for describing strong correlation effects in large-scale models.

Title: Nonlocal electrodynamics of two-dimensional anisotropic magneto-plasmons
Authors: A. J. Chaves, Line Jelver, D. R. da Costa, Joel D. Cox, N. Asger Mortensen, Nuno M. R. Peres
Abstract: We present a hydrodynamic model, grounded in Madelung's formalism, to describe collective electronic motion in anisotropic materials. This model incorporates nonlocal contributions from the Thomas-Fermi quantum pressure and quantum effects arising from the Bohm potential. We derive analytical expressions for the magnetoplasmon dispersion and nonlocal optical conductivity. To demonstrate the applicability of the model, we examine electrons in the conduction band of monolayer phosphorene, an exemplary anisotropic two-dimensional electron gas. The dispersion of plasmons derived from our hydrodynamic approach is closely aligned with that predicted by ab~initio calculations. Then, we use our model to analyze few-layer black phosphorus, whose measured infrared optical response is hyperbolic. Our results reveal that the incorporation of nonlocal and quantum effects in the optical conductivity prevents black phosphorus from supporting hyperbolic surface plasmon polaritons. We further demonstrate that the predicted wavefront generated by an electric dipole exhibits a significant difference between the local and nonlocal descriptions for the optical conductivity. This study underscores the necessity of moving beyond local approximations when investigating anisotropic systems capable of hosting strongly confined plasmon-polaritons.

Title: DFT Investigation of Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy in Fe, Co, Pd0.97Co0.03 and Pd0.97Fe0.03 systems: From Bulk to Thin-Films
Authors: Irina I. Piyanzina, Regina M. Burganova, Hayk Zakaryan, Zarina I. Minnegulova, Igor V. Yanilkin, Amir I. Gumarov
Abstract: The nature of low-impurity ferromagnetism remains a challenging problem in the solid-state community due to the strong dependence of magnetic properties on composition, concentration, and structural geometry of diluted alloys. To address this, we performed a density functional theory study of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in Fe, Co, Pd0.97Co0.03, and Pd0.97Fe0.03 systems across bulk, monolayer, and thin-film geometries. Non-collinear spin-orbit calculations were employed to evaluate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies, supported by analysis of atomic-, spin-, and orbital-resolved densities of states. The results revealed that Fe and Co exhibit opposite easy-axis orientation depending on geometry. At the same time, even 3% Co-doping in Pd is sufficient to induce anisotropy trends resembling those of pure Co. In contrast, Fe-Pd system at the same concentration do not reproduce the anisotropy of pure Fe, showing isotropic behavior in bulk.

Freeman, Tianyi Wei, Takashi Kikkawa, Troy Dion, Daniel Stoeffler, Yves Henry, Matthieu Bailluel, Noora Naushad, William Griggs, Thomas Thomson, Murat Cubukcu, Jack C. Gartside, Eiji Saitoh, Will R. Branford, Hidekazu Kurebayashi
Abstract: We study a thin film yttrium iron garnet sample that exhibits magnetic stripe domains due to a small perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Using wide-field magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements we reveal the domain pattern evolution as a function of applied field and discuss the role of the cubic anisotropy for the domain formation. Rich magnetic resonant spectra for the stripe domain background are observed for different excitation conditions and micromagnetic simulations provide spatial profiles of each resonance mode. We further simulate domain patterns and resonance spectra as a function of the cubic anisotropy to correlate between them. This study highlights magnetic domain structures to host complex resonant behavior in a low-damping magnetic material, for a potential use of future applications in magnonics.

Title: Strain dependence of the Bloch domain component in 180$^\circ$ domains in bulk PbTiO$_{3}$ from first-principles
Authors: Stephen Chege, Louis Bastogne, Fernando G√≥mez-Ortiz, James Sifuna, George Amolo, Philippe Ghosez, Javier Junquera
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of Bloch-type polarization components in 180$^\circ$ ferroelectric domain walls in bulk PbTiO$_{3}$ under varying mechanical boundary conditions, using first-principles simulations based on density functional theory. A spontaneous Bloch component$-$primarily associated with Pb displacements confined within the PbO domain wall plane$-$condense under realistic strain conditions on top of the Ising-type domain walls. The amplitude and energetic stabilization of this component are highly sensitive to the in-plane lattice parameters. In particular, tensile strains akin to those imposed by DyScO$_{3}$ substrates enhance the Bloch component and lead to energy reductions as large as 10.7 mJ/m$^{2}$ (10.6 meV/$\square$) with respect to the most stable structure including only Ising and N√©el components. We identify a relatively flat energy landscape for the Bloch polarization, highlighting the tunability of chiral textures through strain engineering. Our results offer a predictive framework for estimating the strain-dependent onset temperature of Bloch-type domain wall components and provide insight into the design of topologically nontrivial and chiral polar structures in ferroelectrics.

Title: Real-space observation of salt-dependent aging in Laponite gels
Authors: Shunichi Saito, Sooyeon Kim, Yuichi Taniguchi, Miho Yanagisawa
Abstract: Colloidal gels gradually evolve as their structures reorganize, a process known as aging. Understanding this behavior is essential for fundamental science and practical applications such as drug delivery and tissue engineering. This study examines the aging of low-concentration Laponite suspensions with varying salt concentrations using fluorescence microscopy, scattering imaging, and particle tracking microrheology. Structural heterogeneity appeared earlier at higher salt concentrations, and the average size of aggregates decreased as the salt concentration increased further. Fourier transform analysis corroborated these trends, and scattering images showed similar results. Microrheology revealed distinct dynamics in Laponite-rich and Laponite-poor regions: the poor phase exhibited liquid-like behavior, while the rich phase exhibited gel-like properties. Further analysis suggested the presence of submicron or nanoscale structural heterogeneities within the rich phase. These findings provide insight into how aging and salt concentration shape the structure and dynamics of colloidal gels.

Title: Hall effect in slip flow of two-dimensional electron fluid
Authors: A. A. Grigorev, A. N. Afanasiev
Abstract: Hall effect in high-mobility 2D mesoscopic samples with hydrodynamic electron transport is related to manifestation of non-dissipative Hall viscosity at classical magnetic fields. However, the latter can be obscured by the particular geometry of the electronic flow through constriction and boundary effects. In this work we consider the low-field Hall resistivity of the narrow channel with hydrodynamic electron transport. Using kinetic theory we show that the hydrodynamic Hall viscosity contribution is accompanied by the comparable ballistic contribution associated with the formation of Knudsen layers in the slip flow of 2D electron fluid. The studied ballistic correction is present at any specularity of the boundary reflection and lowers the magnitude of the total negative size-dependent correction to the bulk Hall resistivity. The obtained analytic expression for the total Hall resistivity can be used to estimate the boundary reflection coefficient in high-mobility structures.

Title: Dynamic interfacial effects in ultrathin ferromagnetic bilayers
Authors: Anulekha De, Christopher Seibel, Sanjay Ashok, Paul Herrgen, Akira Lentfert, Laura Scheuer, Georg von Freymann, Philipp Pirro, Baerbel Rethfeld, Martin Aeschlimann
Abstract: We investigate the magnetization dynamics of an ultrathin Co (1.5 nm) /Py (1.5 nm) bilayer system from femtosecond (fs) to nanosecond (ns) timescales. Magnetization dynamics in the fs timescales is characterized as a highly non-equilibrium regime due to an ultrafast reduction of magnetization by laser excitation. On the other hand, the dynamics in the ns timescales is characterized as a close-to-equilibrium regime involving the excitation of coherent magnons. We demonstrate that the interfacial interaction between the Co and Py layers in these two non-equilibrium regimes across the timescales is dynamic and simultaneously influences the magnetization loss in the fs timescales and the magnon dynamics in the ns timescales. On ultrafast (fs) timescales, comparison between time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (TR-MOKE) measurements and temperature-based {\mu}T model simulations reveals that the bilayer exhibits demagnetization dynamics intermediate between those of its individual layers. When driven far from equilibrium by ultrashort laser pulse excitation, the magnetization dynamics of the individual Co and Py layers appear to remain decoupled and evolve independently in the initial stages of the ultrafast response. On the other hand, in the ns regime, the two individual layers of the bilayer precess together at the same frequency in a coupled manner as one effective single layer. Furthermore, by correlating the ultrafast demagnetization to precessional damping we attempt to bridge the two non-equilibrium regimes across fs to ns timescales. These results improve our understanding of magnetization dynamics across timescales in ultrathin exchanged-coupled ferromagnetic bilayers and provide valuable insights for the design of high-frequency and energy efficient spintronic device concepts.

Abstract: We present time-resolved X-ray diffraction measurements using advanced timing schemes that provide high temporal resolution while also maintaining a high flux in the X-ray probe beam. The method employs patterned probe pulse sequences that are generated with the WaveGate solid-state pulse picker. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method at two different beamlines on millisecond and microsecond timescales.

Title: Influence of Silicon Interlayers on Transition Layer Formation in Ti/Ni Multilayer Structures of Different Thicknesses
Authors: S. S. Sakhonenkov, A. U. Gaisin, A. S. Konashuk, A. V. Bugaev, R. S. Pleshkov, V. N. Polkovnikov, E. O. Filatova
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive investigation of chemical, structural, and magnetic properties of Ti/Ni multilayer systems with period thicknesses of 4 nm and 10 nm. Particular attention was paid to the characterization of the transition layers at Ni-Ti interfaces and the influence of thin silicon barrier layers on their formation. A combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray reflectometry (XRR), and SQUID magnetometry was employed for analysis. Extended transition layers up to 1.2 nm in thickness were identified at the Ni-Ti interfaces, primarily composed of the intermetallic Ni3Ti phase. The insertion of ultra-thin silicon buffer layers at the interfaces significantly suppressed the formation of intermetallic compounds, most likely due to the formation of titanium silicides. Additionally, it was observed that the use of Si layer on the sample surface leads to the formation of silicon oxide after exposure to the ambient environment, which acts as a passivation layer and inhibits oxidation of Ni and Ti layers within the topmost period of the multilayer structure.

Title: Assembly of High-Performance van der Waals Devices Using Commercial Polyvinyl Chloride Films
Authors: Son T. Le, Jeffrey J. Schwartz, Tsegereda K. Esatu, Sharadh Jois, Andrea Centrone, Karen E. Grutter, Aubrey T. Hanbicki, Adam L. Friedman
Abstract: Control over the position, orientation, and stacking order of two-dimensional (2D) materials within van der Waals heterostructures is crucial for applications in electronics, spintronics, optics, and sensing. The most popular strategy for assembling 2D materials uses purpose-built stamps with working surfaces made from one of several different polymers. However, these stamps typically require tedious preparation steps and suffer from poor durability, contamination, and limited applicability to specific 2D materials or surfaces. Here, we demonstrate significant improvements upon current 2D flake transfer and assembly practices by using mechanically durable stamps made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) thin films. These stamps are simpler to prepare compared with existing methods and can withstand multiple transfer cycles, enabling greater reusability. We use two commercially available PVC films with distinct pick-up and release temperatures. Together, these films also enable polymer-to-polymer flake transfers and stack-and-flip fabrication of inverted heterostructures in one seamless process. Systematic comparisons of cleaning processes confirm the removal of PVC-derived residue from the assembled structures to create atomically clean interfaces. We demonstrate the utility and versatility of these polymer films and transfer process by fabricating graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructure devices with high-performance electrical characteristics. Further, we demonstrate the ability to pick up and to deposit bulk aluminum gallium arsenide nanostructured films, enabling the creation of heterogeneously integrated devices. This technique increases fabrication rates, improves device quality, and enables more complex structures, thereby facilitating nanomaterial assembly in a broad range of applications.

Title: Demonstration of returning Thouless pump in a Berry dipole system
Authors: Qingyang Mo, Shanjun Liang, Xiangke Lan, Jie Zhu, Shuang Zhang
Abstract: The Thouless pump, a cornerstone of topological physics, enables unidirectional quantized wave/particle transport via geometric Berry phase engineering in periodically driven systems. While decades of research have been dedicated to monopole-mediated pumping, mechanisms governed by higher-order singularities like Berry dipoles remain unexplored. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of a Berry-dipole-mediated returning Thouless pump (RTP) in a 1D acoustic waveguide array achieved through adiabatic encircling of a Berry dipole singularity. During this adiabatic cycle, an initial edge-localized mode first delocalizes into the bulk and eventually returns to the original edge, marking the characteristic signature of the RTP. Notably, this RTP exhibits an interesting feature of pseudospin flipping, distinguishing it from previously proposed RTP models. The demonstrated RTP contrasts sharply with the well-studied monopole-governed pumps that feature unidirectional transport.

Title: Strain Induced Robust Skyrmion lattice at Room Temperature in van der Waals Ferromagnet

Abstract: Manipulating topological magnetic orders of two-dimensional (2D) magnets by strain, once achieved, offers enormous potential for future low-power flexible spintronic applications. In this work, by placing Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), a room-temperature 2D ferromagnet, on flexible substrate, we demonstrate a field-free and robust formation of skyrmion lattice induced by strain. By applying a minimal strain of ~0.80% to pre-annealed FGaT flakes, the Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) tip directly triggers the transition from maze-like domains to an ordered skyrmion lattice while scanning the sample surface. The skyrmion lattice is rather stable against extensive cyclic mechanical testing (stretching, bending, and twisting over 2000 cycles each). It also exhibited stability across a wide range of magnetic fields (~2.9 kOe) and temperatures (~ 323 K), as well as long-term retention stability, highlighting its robustness and field free stabilization. The strain effect reduces the lattice symmetry and enhances the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) of FGaT, thus stabilizing the skyrmion lattice. Our findings highlight the potential of FGaT for integrating magnetic skyrmions into future low-power-consumption flexible spintronics devices.

Title: Superconductor-Insulator transition in a two-orbital attractive Hubbard model with Hund's exchange
Authors: Laura Torchia, Massimo Capone
Abstract: We study a two-orbital attractive Hubbard model with a repulsive Hund's exchange coupling $J$ as an idealized model for a two-band superconductor. This framework is motivated by a system where a large isotropic electron-phonon coupling drives the on-site Hubbard repulsion $U$ negative, while leaving the exchange term unaffected. We focus on the intra-orbital (intra-band) singlet superconducting phase and we solve the model at zero temperature and half-filling using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. Already at $J=0$, the two-orbital model features a superconductor-insulator transition as $\vert U\vert$ grows, as opposed to the single-orbital case which remains superconducting for any $U < 0$. We find that a finite $J$ strengthens the effect of the attractive $U$, both in the normal state and, more significantly, in the superconducting state. However, this pushes the system towards an effectively stronger coupling, hence to a faster transition to the insulating state. Remarkably, the transition from a superconductor to an insulator occurs with a vanishing quasi-particle weight $Z$ and in a scenario that recalls strongly correlated superconductivity close to a Mott transition, even though the present model is dominated by attractive interactions.

Title: Bubble formation in active binary mixture model
Authors: Kyosuke Adachi
Abstract: Phase separation, the spontaneous segregation of density, is a ubiquitous phenomenon observed across diverse physical and biological systems. Within a crowd of self-propelled elements, active phase separation emerges from the interplay of activity and density interactions. A striking feature of active phase separation is the persistent formation of dilute-phase bubbles within the dense phase, which has been explored in theoretical models. However, the fundamental parameters that systematically control bubble formation remain unclear in conventional active particle models. Here, we introduce an active binary mixture model, where active solutes and solvents dynamically exchange their positions, and find that spontaneous bubble formation can be tuned by the asymmetry in their activities. Numerical simulations reveal that moderate solvent activity enhances bubble formation, while larger solvent activity, comparable to solute activity, suppresses it. By employing mean-field theory, which captures essential phase behaviors, we consider the mechanism for the enhancement of bubble formation induced by solvent activity. Beyond these findings, when solute and solvent activities are equal, numerical simulations indicate that critical phenomena of active phase separation under the suppression of bubbles belong to the Ising universality class. Our findings establish activity asymmetry as a key control parameter for active matter phase transitions, offering new insights into universality in nonequilibrium systems.

Title: Nonlinear Dynamics in the Formation of Molecular Polariton Condensates
Authors: Evan J Kumar, Katherine A Koch, Rishabh Kaurav, Ravindra Kumar Yadav, Victoria Quiros-Cordero, Josiah N Brinson, Vinod Menon, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons - hybrid light-matter quasiparticles - can undergo Bose-Einstein-like condensation at elevated temperatures owing to their lower effective mass. This becomes even more pronounced in the context of molecular polariton condensates where the large exciton binding energy of Frenkel excitons facilitates condensation at room temperature. While widely studied as low-threshold coherent light sources, the dynamics of their condensation remain poorly understood, partly due to the limitations of existing kinetic models. Here, we use excitation correlation photoluminescence (ECPL), a nonlinear optical technique with 220fs resolution, to probe molecular polariton condensation in Rhodamine-B-doped small-molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES). This platform promotes dipole alignment and suppresses detrimental intermolecular interactions. ECPL reveals condensate formation within hundreds of femtoseconds, driven by radiative scattering from the reservoir. A sustained population beyond the polariton lifetime suggests an additional feeding mechanism from higher momentum states in the lower polariton dispersion. These results provide quantitative insight into condensation timescales and mechanisms, advancing our control over polariton dynamics.

Title: Dominant orbital magnetization in the prototypical altermagnet MnTe
Authors: Chao Chen Ye, Karma Tenzin, Jagoda S≈Çawi≈Ñska, Carmine Autieri
Abstract: Altermagnetism is an unconventional form of antiferromagnetism characterized by momentum-dependent spin polarization of electronic states and zero net magnetization, arising from specific crystalline symmetries. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken time-reversal symmetry, altermagnets can exhibit finite net magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), phenomena typically associated with ferromagnets. Due to the dependence of AHE on magnetization, understanding the interplay between spin and orbital contributions to magnetization is essential for interpreting experiments and designing altermagnetic devices. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the intrinsic spin and orbital magnetization of the magnetic ground state of the prototypical altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe. We find that SOC induces weak ferromagnetism through spin canting, accompanied by a slight in-plane rotation of the N√©el vector. Notably, we identify a significant net orbital magnetization of 0.176 {\mu}B per unit cell oriented along the z-axis, while the spin magnetization in the same direction is much smaller at 0.002 {\mu}B. By varying the chemical potential, we show that the spin magnetization is tunable through hole doping, whereas the orbital magnetization remains robust against carrier density changes. These results highlight the important role of orbital magnetization and establish its relevance for orbital-based phenomena in altermagnets.

Title: First-principles dissociation pathways of BCl$_3$ on the Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface
Authors: Quinn T. Campbell, Shashank Misra, Jeffrey A. Ivie
Abstract: One of the most promising acceptor precursors for atomic-precision $\delta$-doping of silicon is BCl$_3$. The chemical pathway, and the resulting kinetics, through which BCl$_3$ adsorbs and dissociates on silicon, however, has only been partially explained. In this work, we use density functional theory to expand the dissociation reactions of BCl$_3$ to include reactions that take place across multiple silicon dimer rows, and reactions which end in a bare B atom either at the surface, substituted for a surface silicon, or in a subsurface position. We further simulate resulting scanning tunneling microscopy images for each of these BCl$_x$ dissociation fragments, demonstrating that they often display distinct features that may allow for relatively confident experimental identification. Finally, we input the full dissociation pathway for BCl$_3$ into a kinetic Monte Carlo model, which simulates realistic reaction pathways as a function of environmental conditions such as pressure and temperature of dosing. We find that BCl$_2$ is broadly dominant at low temperatures, while high temperatures and ample space on the silicon surface for dissociation encourage the formation of bridging BCl fragments and B substitutions on the surface. This work provides the chemical mechanisms for understanding atomic-precision doping of Si with B, enabling a number of relevant quantum applications such as bipolar nanoelectronics, acceptor-based qubits, and superconducting Si.

Title: Plastic deformation as a phase transition: a combinatorial model of plastic flow in copper single crystals
Authors: Afonso D. M. Barroso, Elijah Borodin, Andrey P. Jivkov
Abstract: Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge and both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The phases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like cross-slip, strain localisation and partial dislocations. The first-order transitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the second-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field coupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other statistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental observations.

Title: Quantum confinement theory of ultra-thin films: electronic, thermal and superconducting properties
Authors: Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.

Abstract: We present neutron diffraction, muon spin rotation and pulsed-field magnetometry measurements on the Heisenberg quantum chiral chain [Cu(pym)(H2O)4]SiF6.H2O, which displays a four-fold-periodic rotation of the local environment around the Cu(II) S = 1/2 ions from site to site along the chain. Previous measurements on this material have shown the absence of magnetic order down to surprisingly low temperatures >= 20 mK, as well as the presence of an energy gap for magnetic excitations that grows linearly with magnetic field. Here we find evidence at dilution refrigerator temperatures for a field-induced transition to long-range magnetic order above an applied magnetic field of 3 T. From the polarization of magnetic moments observed in applied fields we can identify the static magnetic structure that best accounts for the data. The proposed model is supported microscopically by the presence of an alternating component of the g tensor, which produces an internal two-fold staggered field that dictates both the direction of the ordered moments and the effective coupling between adjacent chains. The observed magnetic structure is contrary to previous proposals for the departure of the magnitude and field dependence of the energy gap from the predictions of the sine-Gordon model.

Title: The structure and migration of twin boundaries in tetragonal $Œ≤$-Sn: an application of machine learning based interatomic potentials
Authors: Ian Chesser, Mashroor Nitol, Esther C. Hessong, Himanshu Joshi, Nikhil Admal, Brandon Runnels, Daniel N. Blaschke, Khanh Dang, Abigail Hunter, Saryu Fensin
Abstract: Although atomistic simulations have contributed significantly to our understanding of twin boundary structure and migration in metals and alloys with hexagonal close packed (HCP) crystal structures, few direct atomistic studies of twinning have been conducted for other types of low symmetry materials, in large part due to a lack of reliable interatomic potentials. In this work, we examine twin boundary structure and migration in a tetragonal material, $\beta$-Sn, comparing high resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images of deformation twins in $\beta$-Sn to the results of direct atomistic simulations using multiple interatomic potentials. ML-based potentials developed in this work are found to give results consistent with our experimental data, revealing faceted twin boundary structures formed by the nucleation and motion of twinning disconnections. We use bicrystallographic methods in combination with atomistic simulations to analyze the structure, energy and shear coupled migration of observed twin facets in $\beta$-Sn. In analogy to Prismatic-Basal (PB/BP) interfaces in HCP metals, we discover low energy asymmetric Prismatic-A-plane (PA/AP) interfaces important to twin growth in $\beta$-Sn. A Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) and Rapid Artificial Neural Network (RANN) interatomic potential suitable for studying twinning and phase transformations in Sn are made publicly available as part of this work.

Title: Absolute measurement of the exchange interaction in an InSb quantum well using Landau-level tunnelling spectroscopy
Authors: S.K. Clowes, C.P. Allford, D. Shearer, G.V. Smith, R. Simmons, B.N. Murdin, U. Zeitler, P.D. Buckle
Abstract: We studied InSb quantum well devices using Landau level tunneling spectroscopy through a three-terminal differential conductance technique. This method is similar to filled state scanning tunneling microscopy but uses a stationary contact instead of a mobile tip to analyze the two-dimensional electron system. Applying magnetic fields up to 15~T, we identified clear peaks in the differential current-voltage profiles, indicative of Landau level formation. By examining deviations from the expected Landau fan diagram, we extract an absolute value for the exchange-induced energy shift. Through an empirical analysis, we derive a formula describing the exchange shift as a function of both magnetic field strength and electron filling. Our findings indicate that the emptying of the $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$ Landau levels causes an exchange interaction energy shift in the $\nu=1$ level. Unlike prior studies that infer level energies relative to one another and report oscillatory g-factor behavior, our method references the energy of the Landau levels above the filled states of the contact under a bias voltage, revealing that only the ground state Landau level experiences a measurable exchange shift.

Title: Elevated Hall Responses as Indicators of Edge Reconstruction
Authors: Sampurna Karmakar, Amulya Ratnakar, Sourin Das
Abstract: We investigate edge reconstruction scenarios in the $\nu = 1$ quantum Hall state, focusing on configurations with upstream and downstream charge and neutral modes. Our analysis shows that the coexistence of upstream charge and neutral modes in a multi-terminal geometry can cause pronounced deviations from the expected quantized values of electrical ($e^2/h$) and thermal ($\pi^2 k_\text{B}^{2}T/3h$) Hall conductance dictated by bulk-boundary correspondence. In particular, we find that both electrical and thermal Hall conductances can be significantly enhanced -- exceeding twice their unreconstructed values -- offering a clear diagnostic of edge reconstruction.

Title: Ce(III) Ions in Hydroxyapatite: Nanoscale Environment Investigation
Authors: M.A. Sadovnikova, D.V. Shurtakova, G.V. Mamin, F.F. Murzakhanov, Yu. O. Zobkova, N.V. Petrakova, V.S. Komlev, M.R. Gafurov
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of cerium-doped hydroxyapatite (Ce-HAp), a material of interest for biomedical applications due to the good biocompatibility of hydroxyapatite and the antioxidant activity of cerium ions. We employ advanced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques, including continuous wave (CW) and pulsed X-band experiments, electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM), and electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR)-detected NMR (EDNMR) to investigate the local coordination and electron environment of cerium ions in the hydroxyapatite matrix. The experimental results are complemented by g-tensor calculation, which allows us to interpret the EPR spectra and identify the types of paramagnetic centers. Our results show that during the synthesis of hydroxyapatite powder by the chemical precipitation method using nitrates, cerium ions enter the structure mainly in the trivalent state and replace calcium ions in two nonequivalent positions. In addition to cerium ions, nitrate radicals are found in the HAp structure. Heat treatment reduces the amount of nitrate radicals and increases crystallinity. This work expands the understanding of the role of cerium in calcium phosphates and provides a methodological basis for the characterization of doped bioceramics using various EPR approaches.

Title: Extreme Loss Suppression and Wide Tunability of Dipolar Interactions in an Ultracold Molecular Gas
Authors: Weijun Yuan, Siwei Zhang, Niccol√≤ Bigagli, Haneul Kwak, Claire Warner, Tijs Karman, Ian Stevenson, Sebastian Will
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar molecules hold great promise for the creation of novel quantum states of matter, but the realization of long-lived molecular bulk samples with strong dipole-dipole interactions has remained elusive. Here, we realize a collisionally stable gas of ultracold ground state molecules with a lifetime of several seconds. Utilizing double microwave dressing, we achieve an extreme suppression of inelastic two- and three-body losses by factors of more than 10,000 and 1,000, respectively. We find that losses remain suppressed across a wide range of dipole-dipole interactions, allowing the continuous tuning of the dipolar length from 0 to 1 um $\sim$ 20,000 $a_0$. Combined with the recent realization of Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules, our findings open the door to the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum liquids.

Title: Exotic Carriers from Concentrated Topology: Dirac Trions as the Origin of the Missing Spectral Weight in Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Patrick J. Ledwith, Ashvin Vishwanath, Eslam Khalaf
Abstract: The nature of charge carriers in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near $\nu = -2$, where superconductivity emerges, remains mysterious. While various symmetry-broken ground states have been proposed, experimental evidence of significant entropy persisting to low temperatures suggests that the disordered thermal state is a more natural starting point for understanding the normal state physics. Our previous work proposed that this thermal state in TBG hosts nearly decoupled nonlocal moments and an exotic Mott semimetal at charge neutrality. This evolves into a spectrally imbalanced Mott state at non-zero integer fillings. Notably, at $\nu = -2$, the quasiparticle residue vanishes at the top of the valence band, precisely where superconductivity develops. The vanishing quasiparticle residue naturally leads to the following question: Which excitation accounts for the missing spectral weight, and how are they related to electrons? In this work, we demonstrate that the missing spectral weight corresponds to a trion excitation, which we explicitly construct and characterize. Remarkably, despite being composed of heavy particles away from the Gamma point, this trion is unexpectedly light. At charge neutrality, the electron and trion hybridize with a momentum-dependent phase that winds around zero, forming a massless Dirac cone. At finite doping $\nu < 0$, the Dirac cone acquires a mass with the valence (conduction) band becoming trion (electron)-like near the $\Gamma$ point. Finally, we show that such trion excitations evolve into the quasiparticles of the intervalley Kekul√© spiral (IKS) state at finite doping, where they represent electrons dressed by the IKS order parameter. More broadly, our work highlights the unusual spectral properties and excitations that emerge when fermions interact within topological bands with concentrated quantum geometry and topology.

Title: $C^\ast$-categorical prefactorization algebras for superselection sectors and topological order
Authors: Marco Benini, Victor Carmona, Pieter Naaijkens, Alexander Schenkel
Abstract: This paper presents a conceptual and efficient geometric framework to encode the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors of an algebraic quantum field theory on the $n$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. It is shown that, under certain assumptions which are implied by Haag duality, the monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of localized superselection sectors carry the structure of a locally constant prefactorization algebra over the category of cone-shaped subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Employing techniques from higher algebra, one extracts from this datum an underlying locally constant prefactorization algebra defined on open disks in the cylinder $\mathbb{R}^1\times\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. While the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ arises geometrically as the angular coordinates of cones, the origin of the line $\mathbb{R}^1$ is analytic and rooted in Haag duality. The usual braided (for $n=2$) or symmetric (for $n\geq 3$) monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of superselection sectors are recovered by removing a point of the sphere $\mathbb{R}^1\times(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\setminus\mathrm{pt}) \cong\mathbb{R}^n$ and using the equivalence between $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras and locally constant prefactorization algebras defined on open disks in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The non-trivial homotopy groups of spheres induce additional algebraic structures on these $\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal $C^\ast$-categories, which in the case of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is given by a braided monoidal self-equivalence arising geometrically as a kind of `holonomy' around the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$. The locally constant prefactorization algebra structures discovered in this work generalize, under some mild geometric conditions, to other discrete spaces and thereby provide a clear link between the geometry of the localization regions and the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors.

Title: Singular Damped Twist Waves in Chromonic Liquid Crystals
Authors: Silvia Paparini, Epifanio G. Virga
Abstract: Chromonics are special classes of nematic liquid crystals, for which a quartic elastic theory seems to be more appropriate than the classical quadratic Oseen-Frank theory. The relaxation dynamics of twist director profiles are known to develop a shock wave in finite time in the inviscid case, where dissipation is neglected. This paper studies the dissipative case. We give a sufficient criterion for the formation of shocks in the presence of dissipation and we estimate the critical time at which these singularities develop. Both criterion and estimate depend on the initial director profile. We put our theory to the test on a class of initial kink profiles and we show how accurate our estimates are by comparing them to the outcomes of numerical solutions.

Abstract: This work presents an innovative magnetoelastic (ME) biosensor using graphene functionalized with the SARS-CoV-2 N protein for antibody detection via magnetoelastic resonance. Graphene was chosen for its biocompatibility and high surface area, enabling efficient antigen adsorption, validated by techniques such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Changes in Raman bands (a $\sim 10~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ shift in the 2D band and an increase in the $I_D/I_G$ ratio from 0.03 to 0.60) confirmed non-covalent interactions and enhanced surface coverage with ~100 $\mu$g of N protein. Tests using human plasma (10 RT-PCR-positive and 10 negative samples) demonstrated a clear distinction between groups using graphene sensors functionalized with ~100 $\mu$g of N protein. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) validation corroborated the results. Optimization of protein concentration and biofunctionalization time highlighted the importance of homogeneous surface coverage for reproducibility of the graphene-based ME biosensor. The platform combines graphene's advantages with the wireless, real-time detection capabilities of ME sensors, offering low cost, high sensitivity, and potential for automation, with applications in point-of-care diagnostics.

Title: Micro-swimmer locomotion and hydrodynamics in Brinkman Flows
Authors: Francisca Guzman-Lastra, Enkeleida Lushi
Abstract: Micro-swimmer locomotion in heterogeneous media is increasingly relevant in biological physics due to the prevalence of microorganisms in complex environments. A model for such porous media is the Brinkman fluid which accounts for a sparse matrix of stationary obstacles via a linear resistance term in the momentum equation. We investigate two models for the locomotion and the flow field generated by a swimmer in such a medium. First, we analyze a dumbbell swimmer composed of two spring-connected spheres and driven by a flagellar force and derive its exact swimming velocity as a function of the Brinkman medium resistance, showing that the swimmer monotonically slows down as the medium drag monotonically increases. In the limit of no resistance the model reduces to the classical Stokes dipole swimmer, while finite resistance introduces hydrodynamic screening that attenuates long-range interactions. Additionally, we derive an analytical expression for the far-field flow generated by a Brinkmanlet force-dipole, which can be used for propulsive point-dipole swimmer models. Remarkably, this approximation reproduces the dumbbell swimmer's flow field in the far-field regime with high accuracy. These results provide new analytical tools for understanding locomotion in complex fluids and offer foundational insights for future studies on collective behavior in active and passive suspensions within porous or structured environments.

Title: Recovery dynamics of a gap-engineered transmon after a quasiparticle burst
Authors: Heekun Nho, Thomas Connolly, Pavel D. Kurilovich, Spencer Diamond, Charlotte G. L. B√∏ttcher, Leonid I. Glazman, Michel H. Devoret
Abstract: Ionizing radiation impacts create bursts of quasiparticle density in superconducting qubits. These bursts severely degrade qubit coherence for a prolonged period of time and can be detrimental for quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally resolve quasiparticle bursts in 3D gap-engineered transmon qubits by continuously monitoring qubit transitions. Gap engineering allowed us to reduce the burst detection rate by a factor of a few. This modest reduction falls several orders of magnitude short of the reduction expected if the quasiparticles quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature. We associate the limited effect of gap engineering with the slow thermalization of the phonons in our chips after the burst.

Title: Bang-bang preparation of a quantum many-body ground state in a finite lattice: optimization of the algorithm with a tensor network
Authors: Ihor Sokolov, Jacek Dziarmaga
Abstract: A bang-bang (BB) algorithm prepares the ground state of a lattice quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H=H_1+H_2$ by evolving an initial product state alternating between $H_1$ and $H_2$. We optimize the algorithm with tensor networks in one and two dimensions. The optimization has two stages. In stage one, a shallow translationally-invariant circuit is optimized in an infinite lattice. In stage two, the infinite-lattice gate sequence is used as a starting point for a finite lattice where it remains optimal in the bulk. The prepared state requires optimization only at its boundary, within a healing length from lattice edges, and the gate sequence needs to be modified only within the causal cone of the boundary. We test the procedure in the 1D and 2D quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point employing, respectively, the matrix product state (MPS) and the pair-entangled projected state (PEPS). At the boundary already the infinite-lattice sequence turns out to provide a more accurate state than in the bulk.

Title: Experimental demonstration of kinetic proofreading inherited in ligation-based information replication
Authors: Hiroyuki Aoyanagi, Yasuhiro Magi, Shoichi Toyabe
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that information replication by templated ligation of DNA strands inherits a kinetic proofreading mechanism and achieves significant error suppression through cascade replication. A simple simulation model derived from the experimental results shows that templated ligation has a significant advantage over replication by polymerization for error suppression of long strands. This mechanism provides a plausible route for high-fidelity replication in prebiotic chemistry and illustrates how physical principles such as nonequilibrium kinetics and network architecture can drive reliable molecular information replication. The approach also offers new strategies for error suppression in biotechnology.

Title: Quantum Time Crystal Clock and its Performance
Authors: Ludmila Viotti, Marcus Huber, Rosario Fazio, Gonzalo Manzano
Abstract: Understanding different aspects of time is at the core of many areas in theoretical physics. Minimal models of continuous stochastic and quantum clocks have been proposed to explore fundamental limitations on the performance of timekeeping devices. Owing to the level of complexity in the clock structure and its energy consumption, such devices show trade-offs whose characterization remains an open challenge. Indeed, even conceptual designs for thermodynamically efficient quantum clocks are not yet well understood. In condensed matter theory, time-crystals were found as an exciting new phase of matter, featuring oscillations in (pseudo)-equilibrium with first experimental observations appearing recently. This naturally prompts the question: \textit{can time crystals be used as quantum clocks and what is their performance from a thermodynamic perspective?} We answer this question and find that quantum crystals are indeed genuine quantum clocks with a performance enhanced by the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry.

Title: Nonlinear optical response in kagome lattice with inversion symmetry breaking
Authors: Xiangyang Liu, Junwen Lai, Jie Zhan, Tianye Yu, Peitao Liu, Seiji Yunoki, Xing-Qiu Chen, Yan Sun
Abstract: The kagome lattice is a fundamental model structure in condensed matter physics and materials science featuring symmetry-protected flat bands, saddle points, and Dirac points. This structure has emerged as an ideal platform for exploring various quantum physics. By combining effective model analysis and first-principles calculations, we propose that the synergy among inversion symmetry breaking, flat bands, and saddle point-related van Hove singularities within the kagome lattice holds significant potential for generating strong second-order nonlinear optical response. This property provides an inspiring insight into the practical application of the kagome-like materials, which is helpful for a comprehensive understanding of kagome lattice-related physics. Moreover, this work offers an alternative approach for designing materials with strong a second-order nonlinear optical response.

Title: Multireference error mitigation for quantum computation of chemistry
Authors: Hang Zou, Erika Magnusson, Hampus Brunander, Werner Dobrautz, Martin Rahm
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) strategies are essential for improving the precision and reliability of quantum chemistry algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Reference-state error mitigation (REM) is a cost-effective chemistry-inspired QEM method that performs exceptionally well for weakly correlated problems. However, the effectiveness of REM is often limited when applied to strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce multireference-state error mitigation (MREM), an extension of REM that systematically captures quantum hardware noise in strongly correlated ground states by utilizing multireference states. A pivotal aspect of MREM is using Givens rotations to efficiently construct quantum circuits to generate multireference states. To strike a balance between circuit expressivity and noise sensitivity, we employ compact wavefunctions composed a few dominant Slater determinants. These truncated multireference states, engineered to exhibit substantial overlap with the target ground state, can effectively enhance error mitigation in variational quantum eigensolver experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MREM through comprehensive simulations of molecular systems $\mathrm{H_2O, ~N_2, ~and ~F_2}$, underscoring its ability to realize significant improvements in computational accuracy compared to the original REM method. MREM broadens the scope of error mitigation to encompass a wider variety of molecular systems, including those exhibiting pronounced electron correlation.

Title: Capacity of Entanglement in Lifshitz Theories
Authors: Sare Khoshdooni, Komeil Babaei Velni, M. Reza Mohammadi Mozaffar
Abstract: We study the capacity of entanglement in certain integrable scale-invariant theories which exhibit Lifshitz scaling symmetry with a generic dynamical exponent z at the critical point. This measure characterizes the width of the eigenvalue spectrum of the reduced density matrix and is a quantum informational counterpart of heat capacity. We explore various aspects of capacity of entanglement, such as the corresponding universal terms for the ground state, its z-dependence and also its temporal evolution after a global quantum quench in two dimensions. We carefully examine the existence of a convenient entropic c-function based on this quantity both in bosonic and fermionic theories. While in the relativistic case the corresponding c-function displays a monotonic behavior under the RG flow, this is not the case for the nonrelativistic theories. We also investigate the dynamics of capacity of entanglement after a mass quench and show that it follows the quasiparticle interpretation for the spreading of entanglement. Finally, we discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including the entanglement entropy.

Title: Engineering long-range and multi-body interactions via global kinetic constraints
Authors: Runmin Wu, Bing Yang, Pieter W. Claeys, Hongzheng Zhao
Abstract: Long-range and multi-body interactions are crucial for quantum simulation and quantum computation. Yet, their practical realization using elementary pairwise interactions remains an outstanding challenge. We propose an experimental scheme based on the Bose-Hubbard system with a periodic driving of the on-site energy and global-range density-density interactions, a setup readily implementable via cold atoms in optical lattices with cavity-mediated interactions. Optimally chosen driving parameters can induce global kinetic constraints, where tunneling rates are selectively suppressed depending on the particle number imbalance between all even and odd sites. This mechanism, together with the flexible tunability of local tunneling rates, provides efficient implementation schemes of a family of global controlled gates for quantum computation. We illustrate this scheme for the $N$-qubit Toffoli gate, circumventing the need for a two-body gate decomposition, and elaborate on the efficient preparation of entangled many-body states.

Title: Measurements of molecular size and shape on a chip
Authors: Xin Zhu, Timothy JD Bennett, Konstantin C Zouboulis, Dimitrios Soulias, Michal Grzybek, Justin LP Benesch, Afaf H El-Sagheer, √únal Coskun, Madhavi Krishnan
Abstract: Size and shape are critical discriminators between molecular species and states. We describe a micro-chip based high-throughput imaging approach offering rapid and precise determination of molecular properties under native solution conditions. Our method detects differences in molecular weight across at least three orders of magnitude, and down to two carbon atoms in small molecules. We quantify the strength of molecular interactions over six orders of magnitude in affinity constant, and track reactions in real-time. Highly parallel measurements on individual molecules serve to characterize sample-state heterogeneity at the highest resolution, offering predictive input to model three-dimensional structure. We further leverage the method's structural sensitivity for diagnostics, exploiting ligand-induced conformational changes in the insulin receptor to sense insulin concentration in serum at the sub-nanoliter and sub-zeptomole scale.

Title: A Non-planar ReBCO Test Coil with 3D-printed Aluminum Support Structure for the EPOS Stellarator
Authors: Paul Huslage, Tristan Schuler, Pedro F. Gil, Vitali Brack, Dylan Schmeling, Diego A. R. Orona, Elisabeth von Schoenberg, Timo Thun, Jason. Smoniewski, Eve V. Stenson
Abstract: We report on the test of a small scale, non-planar coil using non-insulated ReBCO tape wound on a 3D-printed aluminum support structure. A 3D-scan of the winding frame which was printed out of AlSi10Mg using selective laser melting, showed peak manufacturing deviations of 0.3 mm. We tested the coil with 21 turns of 3 mm wide tape cooled both by liquid nitrogen and with a cryocooler. We achieved a central field strength of up to 21 mT which agrees with the prediction suggesting that we manufactured the coil without defects. The peak field was reached at a supply current of 120 A. The current leads showed a contact resistance of $\left(2.25\pm0.13\right)\mu\Omega$. The discharge time $L/R$ was found to be 0.63 s in liquid nitrogen and 2.92 s when cooled by the cryocooler. From this we estimate a winding pack temperature of 41 K.

Title: Building-Block Aware Generative Modeling for 3D Crystals of Metal Organic Frameworks
Authors: Chenru Duan, Aditya Nandy, Sizhan Liu, Yuanqi Du, Liu He, Yi Qu, Haojun Jia, Jin-Hu Dou
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) marry inorganic nodes, organic edges, and topological nets into programmable porous crystals, yet their astronomical design space defies brute-force synthesis. Generative modeling holds ultimate promise, but existing models either recycle known building blocks or are restricted to small unit cells. We introduce Building-Block-Aware MOF Diffusion (BBA MOF Diffusion), an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that learns 3D all-atom representations of individual building blocks, encoding crystallographic topological nets explicitly. Trained on the CoRE-MOF database, BBA MOF Diffusion readily samples MOFs with unit cells containing 1000 atoms with great geometric validity, novelty, and diversity mirroring experimental databases. Its native building-block representation produces unprecedented metal nodes and organic edges, expanding accessible chemical space by orders of magnitude. One high-scoring [Zn(1,4-TDC)(EtOH)2] MOF predicted by the model was synthesized, where powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and N2 sorption confirm its structural fidelity. BBA-Diff thus furnishes a practical pathway to synthesizable and high-performing MOFs.

Title: Rejoining fragmented ancient bamboo slips with physics-driven deep learning
Authors: Jinchi Zhu, Zhou Zhao, Hailong Lei, Xiaoguang Wang, Jialiang Lu, Jing Li, Qianqian Tang, Jiachen Shen, Gui-Song Xia, Bo Du, Yongchao Xu
Abstract: Bamboo slips are a crucial medium for recording ancient civilizations in East Asia, and offers invaluable archaeological insights for reconstructing the Silk Road, studying material culture exchanges, and global history. However, many excavated bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands of irregular pieces, making their rejoining a vital yet challenging step for understanding their content. Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework designed to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips. Based on the physics of fracture and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations. This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the rejoining process. Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36\% to 52\%. Archaeologists using WisePanda have experienced substantial efficiency improvements (approximately 20 times faster) when rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research demonstrates that incorporating physical principles into deep learning models can significantly enhance their performance, transforming how archaeologists restore and study fragmented artifacts. WisePanda provides a new paradigm for addressing data scarcity in ancient artifact restoration through physics-driven machine learning.

Title: Symmetry Transmutation and Anomaly Matching
Authors: Nathan Seiberg, Sahand Seifnashri
Abstract: We explore a situation where a global symmetry of the ultraviolet (UV) theory does not act faithfully on the local infrared (IR) degrees of freedom, but instead acts effectively as a higher-form symmetry. We refer to this phenomenon as symmetry transmutation, where the UV symmetry is "transmuted" into a higher-form symmetry in the IR. Notably, unlike emergent (accidental) symmetries, which are approximate, these symmetries are exact. We illustrate the ubiquity of this phenomenon in various continuum and lattice systems and provide examples where the 't Hooft anomalies of the UV symmetry are matched by those of the new higher-form symmetry in the IR. We also show that in certain phases and for certain energies, the UV baryon-number symmetry of one-flavor QCD is transmuted into a discrete one-form global symmetry. Finally, we compare our symmetry transmutation to the well-known phenomenon of symmetry fractionalization.

Title: Augmenting Density Matrix Renormalization Group with Matchgates and Clifford circuits
Authors: Jiale Huang, Xiangjian Qian, Zhendong Li, Mingpu Qin
Abstract: Matchgates and Clifford circuits are two types of quantum circuits which can be efficiently simulated classically, though the underlying reasons are quite different. Matchgates are essentially the single particle basis transformations in the Majorana fermion representation which can be easily handled classically, while the Clifford circuits can be efficiently simulated using the tableau method according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. In this work, we propose a new wave-function ansatz in which matrix product states are augmented with the combination of Matchgates and Clifford circuits (dubbed MCA-MPS) to take advantage of the representing power of all of them. Moreover, the optimization of MCA-MPS can be efficiently implemented within the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Our benchmark results on one-dimensional hydrogen chain show that MCA-MPS can improve the accuracy of the ground-state calculation by several orders of magnitude over MPS with the same bond dimension. This new method provides us a useful approach to study quantum many-body systems. The MCA-MPS ansatz also expands our understanding of classically simulatable quantum many-body states.

Title: Runtime Quantum Advantage with Digital Quantum Optimization
Authors: Pranav Chandarana, Alejandro Gomez Cadavid, Sebasti√°n V. Romero, Anton Simen, Enrique Solano, Narendra N. Hegade
Abstract: We demonstrate experimentally that the bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm on IBM's 156-qubit devices can outperform simulated annealing (SA) and CPLEX in time-to-approximate solutions for specific higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. We suitably select problem instances that are challenging for classical methods, running in fractions of minutes even with multicore processors. On the other hand, our counterdiabatic quantum algorithms obtain similar or better results in at most a few seconds on quantum hardware, achieving runtime quantum advantage. Our analysis reveals that the performance improvement becomes increasingly evident as the system size grows. Given the rapid progress in quantum hardware, we expect that this improvement will become even more pronounced, potentially leading to a quantum advantage of several orders of magnitude. Our results indicate that available digital quantum processors, when combined with specific-purpose quantum algorithms, exhibit a runtime quantum advantage even in the absence of quantum error correction.

Title: Three-dimensional flat Landau levels in an inhomogeneous acoustic crystal
Authors: Zheyu Cheng, Yi-jun Guan, Haoran Xue, Yong Ge, Ding Jia, Yang Long, Shou-qi Yuan, Hong-xiang Sun, Yidong Chong, Baile Zhang
Abstract: When electrons moving in two-dimensions (2D) are subjected to a strong uniform magnetic field, they form flat bands called Landau levels, which are the basis for the quantum Hall effect. Landau levels can also arise from pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs) induced by lattice distortions; for example, mechanically straining graphene causes its Dirac quasiparticles to form a characteristic set of unequally-spaced Landau levels, including a zeroth Landau level. In three-dimensional (3D) systems, there has thus far been no experimental demonstration of Landau levels or any other type of flat band. For instance, applying a uniform magnetic field to materials hosting Weyl quasiparticles, the 3D generalizations of Dirac quasiparticles, yields bands that are non-flat in the direction of the field. Here, we report on the experimental realization of a flat 3D Landau level in an acoustic crystal. Starting from a lattice whose bandstructure exhibits a nodal ring, we design an inhomogeneous distortion corresponding to a specific pseudomagnetic vector potential (PVP) that causes the nodal ring states to break up into Landau levels, with a zeroth Landau level that is flat along all three directions. These findings point to the possibility of using nodal ring materials to generate 3D flat bands, to access strong interactions and other interesting physical regimes in 3D.

Title: AI-accelerated Discovery of Altermagnetic Materials
Authors: Ze-Feng Gao, Shuai Qu, Bocheng Zeng, Yang Liu, Ji-Rong Wen, Hao Sun, Peng-Jie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and experimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many exotic physical properties, the limited availability of known altermagnetic materials hinders the study of such properties. Hence, discovering more types of altermagnetic materials with different properties is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus facilitating new applications in the next generation information technologies, e.g., storage devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Since each altermagnetic material has a unique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered by an AI search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn the intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by fine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the altermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we successfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals, semiconductors, and insulators confirmed by the first-principles electronic structure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics reveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr effect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 4 $i$-wave altermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine performs much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic materials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated discovery of the materials with targeted properties.

Title: Magnetic penetration depth of Aluminum thin films
Authors: David L√≥pez-N√∫√±ez, Alba Torras-Coloma, Queralt Portell Montserrat, Elia Bertoldo, Luca Cozzolino, Gemma Rius, M. Mart√≠nez, P. Forn-D√≠az
Abstract: We present a study of the superconducting penetration depth $\lambda$ in aluminum thin films of varying thickness. The range of thicknesses chosen spans from the thin-film regime to the regime approaching bulk behavior. The penetration depths observed range from $\lambda = 163.3\pm0.4~\rm{nm}$ for the thinnest $20~\rm{nm}$ samples down to $\lambda = 53.6\pm0.4~\rm{nm}$ for the $200~\rm{nm}$-thick ones. In order to accurately determine $\lambda$, we performed complementary measurements using the frequency of superconducting $LC$ resonators as well as the resistance of normal-state meanders. Both methods yield comparable results, providing a well-characterized set of values of $\lambda$ in aluminum in the relevant range for applications in fields such as quantum computing and microwave radiation detector technologies.

Title: Summation of Divergent Series and Quantum Phase Transitions in Kitaev Chains with Long-Range Hopping
Authors: Hao Fu, Peiqing Tong
Abstract: We study the quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in extended Kitaev chains with long-range ($1/r^{\alpha}$) hopping. Formally, there are two QPT points at $\mu=\mu_0(\alpha)$ and $\mu_\pi(\alpha)$ ($\mu$ is the chemical potential) which correspond to the summations of $\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}m^{-\alpha}$ and $\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{m-1}m^{-\alpha}$, respectively. When $\alpha\leq0$, both the series are divergent and it is usually believed that no QPTs exist. However, we find that there are two QPTs at $\mu=\mu_0(0)$ and $\mu_\pi(0)$ for $\alpha=0$ and one QPT at $\mu=\mu_\pi(\alpha)$ for $\alpha<0$. These QPTs are second order. The $\mu_0(0)$ and $\mu_\pi(\alpha\leq0)$ correspond to the summations of the divergent series obtained by the analytic continuation of the Riemann $\zeta$ function and Dirichlet $\eta$ function. Moreover, it is found that the quasiparticle energy spectra are discontinue functions of the wave vector $k$ and divide into two branches. This is quite different from that in the case of $\alpha>0$ and induces topological phases with the winding number $\omega:=\pm1/2$. At the same time, the von Neumann entropy are power law of the subchain length $L$ no matter in the gapped region or not. In addition, we also study the QPTs, topological properties, and von Neumann entropy of the systems with $\alpha>0$.

Title: Dissipation driven phase transition in the non-Hermitian Kondo model
Authors: Pradip Kattel, Abay Zhakenov, Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, Patrick Azaria, Natan Andrei
Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians capture several aspects of open quantum systems, such as dissipation of energy and non-unitary evolution. An example is an optical lattice where the inelastic scattering between the two orbital mobile atoms in their ground state and the atom in a metastable excited state trapped at a particular site and acting as an impurity, results in the two body losses. It was shown in \cite{nakagawa2018non} that this effect is captured by the non-Hermitian Kondo model. which was shown to exhibit two phases depending on the strength of losses. When the losses are weak, the system exhibits the Kondo phase and when the losses are stronger, the system was shown to exhibit the unscreened phase where the Kondo effect ceases to exist, and the impurity is left unscreened. We re-examined this model using the Bethe Ansatz and found that in addition to the above two phases, the system exhibits a novel $\widetilde{YSR}$ phase which is present between the Kondo and the unscreened phases. The model is characterized by two renormalization group invariants, a generalized Kondo temperature $T_K$ and a parameter `$\alpha$' that measures the strength of the loss. The Kondo phase occurs when the losses are weak which corresponds to $0<\alpha<\pi/2$. As $\alpha$ approaches $\pi/2$, the Kondo cloud shrinks resulting in the formation of a single particle bound state which screens the impurity in the ground state between $\pi/2<\alpha<\pi$. As $\alpha$ increases, the impurity is unscreened in the ground state but can be screened by the localized bound state for $\pi<\alpha<3\pi/2$. When $\alpha>3\pi/2$, one enters the unscreened phase where the impurity cannot be screened. We argue that in addition to the energetics, the system displays different time scales associated with the losses across $\alpha=\pi/2$, resulting in a phase transition driven by the dissipation in the system.

Title: Observation of generalized t-J spin dynamics with tunable dipolar interactions
Authors: Annette N. Carroll, Henrik Hirzler, Calder Miller, David Wellnitz, Sean R. Muleady, Junyu Lin, Krzysztof P. Zamarski, Reuben R. W. Wang, John L. Bohn, Ana Maria Rey, Jun Ye
Abstract: Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions profoundly modify the dynamics of particles hopping in a periodic lattice potential. We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.

Title: Abnormal planar Hall effect and disentanglement of incoherent and coherent transport in a Kondo lattice
Authors: Shuo Zou, Hai Zeng, Zhuo Wang, Guohao Dong, Xiaodong Guo, Fangjun Lu, Zengwei Zhu, Youguo Shi, Yifeng Yang, Yongkang Luo
Abstract: The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.

Title: Random matrix universality in dynamical correlation functions at late times
Authors: Oscar Bouverot-Dupuis, Silvia Pappalardi, Jorge Kurchan, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Laura Foini
Abstract: We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.

Title: Fractional Wannier Orbitals and Tight-Binding Gauge Fields for Kitaev Honeycomb Superlattices with Flat Majorana Bands
Authors: K. B. Yogendra, G. Baskaran, Tanmoy Das
Abstract: Fractional excitations hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and quantum technologies. However, constructing lattice models for their dynamics under gauge fields remains a formidable challenge due to inherent obstructions. Here, we introduce a novel and systematic framework for deriving low-energy lattice models of fractional orbitals coupled to tight-binding gauge fields. Departing from conventional geometric approaches, our method systematically eliminates the high-energy states via virtual hopping, thereby deriving the gauge potential and quantum metric through a superexchange-like mechanism. We demonstrate the framework by constructing Wannier orbitals for Majorana states and a tight-binding $Z_2$ gauge field across various flux crystalline phases in the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice. Our study reveals a striking phase transition between two non-trivial topological phases characterized by gapless flat-band with extensive degeneracy. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting Majorana orbitals, leading to a correlation-induced fractional Chern state. Our work establishes a general framework for gauge-mediated tight-binding models and a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting fractional orbitals that can be readily extended to $U(1)$, $SU(N)$ lattice gauge theories.

Title: Radio-frequency cascade readout of coupled spin qubits fabricated using a 300~mm wafer process

Abstract: Advanced semiconductor manufacturing offers a promising path to scaling up silicon-based quantum processors by improving yield, uniformity, and integration. Individual spin qubit control and readout have been demonstrated in quantum dots fabricated on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm natural silicon MOS process customised for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the exchange interaction, forming the basis for entangling gates such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We measure gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns with a quality factor of 10. For readout, we introduce a novel dispersive readout technique, the radio-frequency electron cascade, that simplifies the qubit unit cell while providing high gain. This method achieves a signal-to-noise ratio of 6 within an integration time of 46 ${\mu}$s, the highest-performing dispersive readout demonstration in a planar MOS process. The combination of sensitive dispersive readout with industrial-grade manufacturing marks a crucial step towards large-scale integration of silicon quantum processors.

Title: Efficient driving of a spin-qubit using single-atom magnets
Authors: Jose Reina-G√°lvez, Hoang-Anh Le, Hong Thi Bui, Soo-hyon Phark, Nicol√°s Lorente, Christoph Wolf
Abstract: The realization of electron-spin resonance at the single-atom level using scanning tunneling microscopy has opened new avenues for coherent quantum sensing and quantum state manipulation at the ultimate size limit. This allows to build many-body Hamiltonians and the study of their complex physical behavior. Recently, a novel qubit platform has emerged from this field, raising questions about the driving mechanism from single-atom magnets. In this work, we demonstrate how single-atom magnets can be used to drive a nearby single spin qubit efficiently. We show that the modulation of exchange coupling is the primary driving force, which successfully reproduces Rabi rates in the tens of MHz range, consistent with experimental data, while also addressing critical aspects related to the optimization of experimental parameters.

Title: InvDesFlow: An AI-driven materials inverse design workflow to explore possible high-temperature superconductors
Authors: Xiao-Qi Han, Zhenfeng Ouyang, Peng-Jie Guo, Hao Sun, Ze-Feng Gao, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: The discovery of new superconducting materials, particularly those exhibiting high critical temperature ($T_c$), has been a vibrant area of study within the field of condensed matter physics. Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop InvDesFlow, an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for the discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing InvDesFlow, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ (at 5 GPa) and B$_5$CN$_2$ (at ambient pressure) whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties.

Title: Data-driven stochastic 3D modeling of the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in battery cathodes
Authors: Phillip Gr√§fensteiner, Markus Osenberg, Andr√© Hilger, Nicole Bohn, Joachim R. Binder, Ingo Manke, Volker Schmidt, Matthias Neumann
Abstract: A stochastic 3D modeling approach for the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in hierarchically structured cathodes of lithium-ion batteries is presented. The binder-conductive additive phase of these electrodes consists of carbon black, polyvinylidene difluoride binder and graphite particles. For its stochastic 3D modeling, a three-step procedure based on methods from stochastic geometry is used. First, the graphite particles are described by a Boolean model with ellipsoidal grains. Second, the mixture of carbon black and binder is modeled by an excursion set of a Gaussian random field in the complement of the graphite particles. Third, large pore regions within the mixture of carbon black and binder are described by a Boolean model with spherical grains. The model parameters are calibrated to 3D image data of cathodes in lithium-ion batteries acquired by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. Subsequently, model validation is performed by comparing model realizations with measured image data in terms of various morphological descriptors that are not used for model fitting. Finally, we use the stochastic 3D model for predictive simulations, where we generate virtual, yet realistic, image data of nanoporous binder-conductive additives with varying amounts of graphite particles. Based on these virtual nanostructures, we can investigate structure-property relationships. In particular, we quantitatively study the influence of graphite particles on effective transport properties in the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase, which have a crucial impact on electrochemical processes in the cathode and thus on the performance of battery cells.

Title: Charge and spin properties of a generalized Wigner crystal realized in the moir√© WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer
Authors: Andrzej Biborski, Micha≈Ç Zegrodnik
Abstract: We examine the charge and spin properties of an effective single-band model representing a moir√© superlattice of the WSe$_{2}$/WS$_{2}$ heterobilayer. We focus on the $2/3$ electron filling, which refers to the formation of a generalized Wigner crystal, as evidenced experimentally. Our approach is based on the extended-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice with non-interacting part effectively describing a spin-split band due to Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. We investigate the system in the regime of strong on-site Coulomb repulsion and the ground state of the Hamiltonian is obtained with the use of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group formulated within the Matrix Product State approach. According to our analysis, based on the density-density correlation functions resolved in the momentum space, a transition from the metallic to the insulating state appears with increasing intersite electron-electron interactions. This transition is identified as being concomitant with the emergence of a generalized Wigner crystal that realizes the honeycomb lattice pattern. We investigate the magnetic properties of such a Wigner crystal state and find that the presence of spin-valley polarization and the increased intersite repulsion induce spin canting of the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering.

Title: Highly Transparent Lead-Free Piezoelectric Haptic Device
Authors: Longfei Song, Sebastjan Glinsek, Nagamalleswara Rao Alluri, Veronika Kovacova, Michele Melchiorr, Alfredo Blazquez Martinez, Barnik Mandal, Juliette Cardoletti, Emmanuel Defay
Abstract: Acoustic haptic technology adds touch sensations to human-machine interfaces by integrating piezoelectric actuators onto touchscreens. Traditional piezoelectric haptic technologies use opaque lead-containing ceramics that are both toxic and visible. We have developed a highly transparent lead-free piezoelectric haptic device using potassium sodium niobate (KNN) and transparent conductive oxide thin films. The KNN film, grown on glass, exhibits a pure perovskite phase and a dense microstructure. This device achieves up to 80% transmittance, surpassing lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films. It generates an acoustic resonance at 16.5 kHz and produces a peak-to-peak displacement of 1.0 um at 28 V unipolar, making it suitable for surface rendering applications. This demonstrates the potential of transparent lead-free piezoelectric actuators as an effective alternative to conventional PZT haptic actuators.

Title: Symmetries of all lines in monolayer crystals
Authors: Bernard Field, Sin√©ad M. Griffin
Abstract: As "2D" materials (i.e. materials just a few atoms thick) continue to gain prominence, understanding their symmetries is critical for unlocking their full potential. In this work, we present comprehensive tables that tabulate the rod group symmetries of all crystallographic lines in all 80 layer groups, which describe the symmetries of 2D materials. These tables are analogous to the scanning tables for space groups found in Volume E of the International Tables for Crystallography, but are specifically tailored for layer groups and their applications to 2D materials. This resource will aid in the analysis of line defects, such as domain walls, which play a crucial role in determining the properties and functionality of 2D materials.

Title: Designed self-assembly of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents
Authors: Xiuyang Xia, Yuhan Peng, Ka Ki Li, Ran Ni
Abstract: To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.

Title: Efficient moment tensor machine-learning interatomic potential for accurate description of defects in Ni-Al Alloys
Authors: Jiantao Wang, Peitao Liu, Heyu Zhu, Mingfeng Liu, Hui Ma, Yun Chen, Yan Sun, Xing-Qiu Chen
Abstract: Combining the efficiency of semi-empirical potentials with the accuracy of quantum mechanical methods, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have significantly advanced atomistic modeling in computational materials science and chemistry. This necessitates the continual development of MLIP models with improved accuracy and efficiency, which enable long-time scale molecular dynamics simulations to unveil the intricate underlying mechanisms that would otherwise remain elusive. Among various existing MLIP models, the moment tensor potential (MTP) model employs a highly descriptive rotationally-covariant moment tensor to describe the local atomic environment, enabling the use of even linear regression for model fitting. Although the current MTP model has achieved state-of-the-art efficiency for similar accuracy, there is still room for optimizing the contraction process of moment tensors. In this work, we propose an effective genetic algorithm based optimization scheme that can significantly reduce the number of independent moment tensor components and intermediate tensor components. This leads to a speedup of nearly one order of magnitude in efficiency and also improved accuracy compared to the traditional MTP model for intricate basis sets. We have applied our improved MTP model to predicting the energetic and dynamical properties of various point and planar defects in Ni-Al alloys, showing overall good performances and in general outperforming the semi-empirical potentials. This work paves the way for fast and accurate atomistic modeling of complex systems and provides a useful tool for modeling defects in Ni-Al alloys.

Title: Lorentz Skew Scattering and Giant Nonreciprocal Magneto-Transport
Authors: Cong Xiao, Yue-Xin Huang, Shengyuan A. Yang
Abstract: Skew scattering is the well-known dominant mechanism for anomalous Hall transport in highly conductive systems. However, despite extensive research, the primary mechanism governing nonlinear (nonreciprocal) magneto-transport in clean samples remains unknown. This theoretical gap has impeded the development of design principles for efficient nonreciprocal devices. Here, we unveil a hitherto unexplored effect in nonreciprocal magneto-transport from cooperative action of Lorentz force and skew scattering. The significance of this Lorentz skew scattering mechanism lies in that it dominates both longitudinal and transverse responses in highly conductive systems, and it exhibits a scaling behavior distinct from all known mechanisms. At low temperature, it shows a cubic scaling in linear conductivity, whereas the scaling becomes quartic at elevated temperature when phonon scattering kicks in. Applying our developed microscopic theory to surface transport in topological crystalline insulator SnTe and bulk transport in Weyl semimetals leads to significant results, suggesting a new route to achieve giant transport nonreciprocity in high-mobility materials with topological band features.

Title: On the breakdown of dimensional reduction and supersymmetry in random-field models
Authors: Gilles Tarjus, Matthieu Tissier, Ivan Balog
Abstract: We discuss the breakdown of the Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetry (SUSY) and of the dimensional-reduction (DR) property in the random field Ising and O($N$) models as a function of space dimension $d$ and/or number of components $N$. The functional renormalization group (FRG) predicts that this takes place below a critical line $d_{\rm DR}(N)$. We revisit the perturbative FRG results for the RFO($N$)M in $d=4+\epsilon$ and carry out a more comprehensive investigation of the nonperturbative FRG approximation for the RFIM. In light of this FRG description, we discuss the perturbative results in $\epsilon=6-d$ recently derived for the RFIM by Kaviraj, Rychkov, and Trevisani. We stress in particular that the disappearance of the SUSY/DR fixed point below $d_{\rm DR}$ arises as a consequence of the nonlinearity of the FRG equations and cannot be found via the perturbative expansion in $\epsilon=6-d$ (nor in $1/N$). We also provide an error bar on the value of the critical dimension $d_{\rm DR}$ for the RFIM, which we find around $5.11\pm0.09$, by studying several successive orders of the nonperturbative FRG approximation scheme.

Title: Interplay of superconductivity and charge-density-wave order in kagome materials
Authors: Sofie Castro Holb√¶k, Mark H. Fischer
Abstract: In the $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ $=$ K, Rb, Cs) kagome materials, superconductivity coexists with a charge density wave (CDW), constituting a new platform to study the interplay of these two orders. Despite extensive research, the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter remains disputed, with experiments seemingly supporting different conclusions. As key aspects of the physics might lie in the intertwining of electronic orders, a better understanding of the impact of the CDW on superconductivity is crucial. In this work, we develop a phenomenological framework to study the interplay of superconductivity and CDW order. In particular, we derive a Ginzburg-Landau free energy for both superconducting and CDW order parameters. Given the unclear nature of the superconducting state, we discuss general pairing symmetries with a focus on $s$-wave, $d$-wave, and pair-density-wave order parameters. Motivated by experiments, we consider the additional breaking of time-reversal or point-group symmetries of the CDW and determine in detail the consequences for the superconducting state. Our results show how the superconducting state mimics the broken symmetries of the CDW and can guide future microscopic calculations, as well as the experimental identification of the superconducting state in the $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ compounds.

Title: Controlling particle-hole symmetry of fractional quantum hall states in trilayer graphene
Authors: Simrandeep Kaur, Harsimran Singh, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Unmesh Ghorai, Manish Jain, Rajdeep Sensarma, Aveek Bid
Abstract: We present a detailed experimental study of the particle-hole symmetry (PHS) of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states about half filling in a multiband system. Specifically, we focus on the lowest Landau level of the monolayer-like band of Bernal stacked trilayer graphene (TLG). In pristine TLG, the excitation energy gaps, Land√© g-factor, effective mass, and disorder broadening of the odd-denominator FQH states are identical to their hole-conjugate counterpart. This precise PH symmetry stems from the lattice mirror symmetry that precludes Landau-level mixing. Introducing a non-zero displacement field \(D\) disrupts this mirror symmetry, facilitating the hybridization between the monolayer-like and bilayer-like Landau levels. This inter-band coupling enhances the Landau level mixing factor $\eta$ and activates three-body interactions -- both of which explicitly break the PHS of FQHs. As a result, conventional FQHs are completely destabilized, offering a route to engineer symmetry breaking of FQHs in a controlled way. We establish that the PHS breaking in TLG is of extrinsic origin and is fundamentally distinct from the intrinsic, interaction-driven symmetry breaking observed in the lowest Landau levels of single-layer and bilayer graphene.

Title: Edge modes and boundary impurities in the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain
Authors: Pradip Kattel, Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, J. H. Pixley, Natan Andrei
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.

Title: General Theory for Group Resetting with Application to Avoidance
Authors: Juhee Lee, Seong-Gyu Yang, Hye Jin Park, Ludvig Lizana
Abstract: We present a general theoretical framework for group resetting dynamics in multi-particle systems in a drift potential. While traditional resetting models typically focus on a single particle, our setup considers a group of particles whose collective dynamics determine the resetting process. More recently, resetting has also been used as a regulatory mechanism to avoid adverse outcomes, such as preventing critically high water levels in dams or deleveraging financial portfolios. Here, we extend current resetting theories to group dynamics, with applications ranging from bacterial evolution under antibiotic pressure to multiple-searcher optimization algorithms. Combining renewal theory and extreme value statistics, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the spatial distribution of the group's center of mass, treated as an effective particle. This formalism allows us to analytically calculate essential observables including the stationary mean position, variance, and a dimensionless measure of risk--the squared coefficient of variation. Our results demonstrate how the group size and resetting rate affect the probability of avoiding the danger region. This theoretical approach opens new perspectives on designing optimal group-level search and avoidance strategies through resetting.

Title: Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled approximations
Authors: Xinliang Lyu, Naoki Kawashima
Abstract: We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional (3D) real space renormalization group (RG) method. Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry exploited. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.

Title: Fermi-Liquid $T^2$ Resistivity: Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Meets Experiment
Authors: Fabian B. Kugler, Jeremy Lee-Hand, Harrison LaBollita, Lorenzo Van Mu√±oz, Jason Kaye, Sophie Beck, Alexander Hampel, Antoine Georges, Cyrus E. Dreyer
Abstract: Direct-current resistivity is a key probe for the physical properties of materials. In metals, Fermi-liquid (FL) theory serves as the basis for understanding transport. A $T^2$ behavior of the resistivity is often taken as a signature of FL electron-electron scattering. However, the presence of impurity and phonon scattering as well as material-specific aspects such as Fermi surface geometry can complicate this interpretation. We demonstrate how density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory can be used to elucidate the FL regime. We take as examples SrVO$_{3}$ and SrMoO$_{3}$, two moderately correlated perovskite oxides, and establish a precise framework to analyze the FL behavior of the self-energy at low energy and temperature. Reviewing published low-temperature resistivity measurements, we find agreement between our calculations and experiments performed on samples with exceptionally low residual resistivity. This comparison emphasizes the need for further theoretical, synthesis, and characterization developments in these and other FL materials.

Title: The role of Berry curvature derivatives in the optical activity of time-invariant crystals
Authors: Giancarlo Soavi, Jan Wilhelm
Abstract: Quantum geometry and topology are fundamental concepts of modern condensed matter physics, underpinning phenomena ranging from the quantum Hall effect to protected surface states. The Berry curvature, a central element of this framework, is well established for its key role in electronic transport, whereas its impact on the optical properties of crystals remains comparatively unexplored. Here, we derive a relation between optical activity, defined by the gyration tensor, and the k-derivatives of the Berry curvature at optical resonances in the Brillouin zone. We systematically determine which of these derivatives are non-zero or constrained by symmetry across all time-reversal-invariant crystal classes. In particular, we analytically demonstrate that circular dichroism emerges in chiral crystal classes as a result of a non-zero Berry curvature k-derivative along the optical axis, and we interpret this finding based on the conservation of angular momentum in light-matter interactions. This work establishes a quantum-geometric framework for optical activity in solids and it opens new routes to probe quantum geometry via linear and nonlinear optics.

Title: Plasmon-sound hybridization in ionic crystals
Authors: Jakob Rappolt, Andreas R√ºckriegel, Peter Kopietz
Abstract: We study the hybridization between plasmons, phonons, and electronic sound in ionic crystals using the Debye model, where the ionic background is modeled as a homogeneous, isotropic, elastic medium. We explicitly obtain the energies and the damping of the hybrid plasmon-sound modes in the hydrodynamic regime and calculate the corresponding dynamic structure factor. We find that with increasing viscosity a plasmon-like mode quickly decays into a broad, incoherent background, while a phonon-like mode with linear dispersion remains rather sharp. The quantitative behavior of the hybridized collective modes depends on the ratio of the electronic and the ionic plasma frequencies. We also show that the direct Coulomb interaction between the ions is essential to obtain a collective sound mode with linear dispersion.

Title: Probing scattering of Raman phonons on magnetic and electronic excitations in pyrochlores Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Sami Muhammad, Yuanyuan Xu, Christos Kakogiannis, Takumi Ohtsuki, Yang Qiu, Satoru Nakatsuji, Eli Zoghlin, Stephen D. Wilson, Natalia Drichko
Abstract: Magnetic rare earth atoms on pyrochlore lattice can produce such exotic magnetic states as spin ice and quantum spin ice. These states are a result of the frustration in the pyrochlore lattice, as well as crystal field degrees of freedom of rare earth atoms, and their interactions with the lattice. Raman scattering spectroscopy, which possess high spectral resolution and can easily access broad energy and temperature ranges, is an optimum tool to study these excitations and their interactions. In this work we follow Raman scattering of zone center phonons and crystal field excitations of Nd$^{3+}$ in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ in the temperature range where these materials are paramagnetic. A comparison between an insulating Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and semimetallic Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ materials allow us to distinguish between scattering of phonons on other phonons, crystal field excitations, and electrons, highlighting interactions between these degrees of freedom.

Title: Ultra-strong coupling of two ferromagnets via Meissner currents
Authors: V. M. Gordeeva, G. A. Bobkov, A. M. Bobkov, I. V. Bobkova, Tao Yu
Abstract: In this work, we study the magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet trilayer sandwiched between two superconductors (S/F/I/F/S heterostructure). It is well-known that a conceptually similar S/F/S system is a platform for implementing ultra-strong magnon-photon coupling. Here, we demonstrate that in such S/F/I/F/S heterostructure, ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling between the two F layers also appears. The strength of this interaction is many times greater than the strength of the usual dipole-dipole interaction. It is mediated via Meissner currents excited in the superconductor layers by the magnon stray fields. The strength of the magnon-magnon coupling is anisotropic, and its anisotropy is opposite to the anisotropy of the magnon-photon coupling, which allows them to be separated. Both couplings become much stronger when the temperature drops below the critical temperature of the superconductor layers. It enables the implementation of an efficient tuning of the wavenumber in the S/F/I/F/S heterostructures controlled by temperature in a wide range of frequencies. Overall, the rich and tunable spectrum of S/F/I/F/S multilayers opens broad prospects for their application in magnonics.

Title: Magnetic Phase Diagram of YbRh\textsubscript{2}Si\textsubscript{2}: the Influence of Hyperfine Interactions
Authors: Jan Knapp, Lev V. Levitin, Jan Nyeki, Brian Cowan, John Saunders, Manuel Brando, Christoph Geibel, Cornelius Krellner, Kristin Kliemt
Abstract: We report the determination of the magnetic phase diagram of the heavy fermion metal YbRh\textsubscript{2}Si\textsubscript{2} in magnetic fields up to 70\,mT applied perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis. By a combination of heat capacity, magneto-caloric, and magneto-resistance measurements we map two antiferromagnetic phases: the electronic AFM1 below 70\,mK and electro-nuclear AFM2 below 1.5\,mK. The measurements extend into the microkelvin regime to explore the quantum phase transitions in this system. We demonstrate how the hyperfine interaction significantly modifies the phase diagram and the putative field-tuned quantum critical point. The determination of the rich magnetic properties of YbRh\textsubscript{2}Si\textsubscript{2} is essential to understanding the interplay of the two magnetic orders and superconductivity in this compound.

Title: Mixed-symmetry superconductivity and the energy gap
Authors: Pramodh Senarath Yapa, Xinyu Guo, Joseph Maciejko, Frank Marsiglio
Abstract: The symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, or simply the ``gap'', provides certain constraints on the actual mechanism that gives rise to pairing and ultimately to superconductivity. In this work we show how superconducting phases with mixed singlet-triplet symmetries can arise below $T_c$ for a generic tight-binding model. We first examine the 1D case to better illustrate the prevalence of symmetry-breaking transitions below $T_c$, and then the more realistic 2D case. In both cases we illustrate the implication for spectroscopic investigations of the energy gap by calculating the density of states for different temperatures below $T_c$. We find that the structure of the density of states near $T_c$ can vary dramatically from its form near $T=0$. A complete picture of the superconducting symmetry can only be attained if measurements are made over the entire temperature range.

Title: Transmission through rectangular potentials in semimetals featuring quadratic dispersion
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We revisit the problem of transmission of quasiparticles through a rectangular potential barrier, for semimetals featuring quadratic-in-momentum band-crossings at a nodal point. Although this was considered in Annals of Physics 419 (2020) 168235, the solutions corresponding to evanescent waves were missed, leading to a partial fulfillment of the boundary conditions required to determine the piecewise-continuous wavefunctions. In this paper, our aim is to correct those shortcomings, recompute the transmission coefficients, and show the resulting behaviour of the conductivity and the Fano factor for some representative parameter values.

Title: Behavior of Ising spins and ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small-world networks
Authors: Davi Arrais Nobre, Karen C. Abbott, Jonathan Machta, Alan Hastings
Abstract: Many ecological populations are known to display a cyclic behavior with period 2. Previous work has shown that when a metapopulation (group of coupled populations) with such dynamics is allowed to interact via nearest neighbor dispersal in two dimensions, it undergoes a phase transition from disordered (spatially asynchronous) to ordered (spatially synchronous) that falls under the 2-D Ising universality class. While nearest neighbor dispersal may satisfactorily describe how most individuals migrate between habitats, we should expect a small fraction of individuals to venture on a journey to further locations. We model this behavior by considering ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small-world networks, in which at each time step a fraction $p$ of the nearest neighbor interactions is replaced by a new interaction with a random node on the network. We measure how this connectivity change affects the critical point for synchronizing ecological oscillators. Our results indicate that increasing the amount of long-range interaction (increasing $p$) favors the ordered regime, but the presence of memory in ecological oscillators leads to quantitative differences in how much long-range dispersal is needed to order the network, relative to an analogous network of Ising spins. We also show that, even for very small values of $p$, the phase transition falls into the mean-field universality class, and argue that ecosystems where dispersal can occasionally happen across the system's length scale will display a phase transition in the mean-field universality class.

Abstract: We continue our explorations of the transport characteristics in junction-configurations comprising semimetals with quadratic band-crossings, observed in the bandstructures of both two- and three-dimensional materials. Here, we consider short potential barriers/wells modelled by delta-function potentials. We also generalize our analysis by incorporating tilts in the dispersion.

Here, we consider short potential barriers/wells modelled by delta-functions. We also generalize our analysis by incorporating tilts in the dispersion. Due to the parabolic nature of the spectra, caused by quadratic-in-momentum dependence, there exist evanescent waves, which decay exponentially as we move away from the junction represented by the location of the delta-function potential. Investigating the possibility of the appearance of bound states, we find that their energies appear as pairs of $\pm |E_b |$, reflecting the presence of the imaginary-valued wavevectors at both positive and negative values of energies of the propagating quasiparticles.

Title: Anomalous current-electric field characteristics in transport through a nanoelectromechanical systems
Authors: Chengjie Wu, Yi Ding, Yiying Yan, Yuguo Su, Elijah Omollo Ayieta, Slobodan Rado≈°eviƒá, Georg Engelhardt, Gernot Schaller, JunYan Luo
Abstract: A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.

Title: Ferroaxial order of the monolayer ice in martyite

Abstract: Ice Ih, the most stable phase of water at ambient pressure, is a stacking of the honeycomb network of water molecules H2O. What if one layer of ice is exfoliated and confined to a two-dimensional (2D) sheet? Martyite Zn3(V2O7)(OH)2 2H2O, a mineral with the honeycomb lattice of H2O in the porous framework, is an ideal system for studying such monolayer ice. Due to the geometrical frustration and 2D nature, H2O molecules are dynamically disordered at room temperature. In this study, we reveal disorder-order transitions of H2O in martyite using single-crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD results visualize the formation of hydrogen-bonded toroidal H2O hexamers, leading to the ferroaxial order below 200 K. Combined with the molecular dynamics simulations, we discuss the formation process of the H2O hexamers and how they compromise the molecular arrangement towards lower temperatures. Our results unveil the ground state of monolayer ice, a fundamental knowledge to understand the polymorphism of H2O.

Title: Superconducting diode effect in Ising superconductors
Authors: Itai Bankier, Lotan Attias, Alex Levchenko, Maxim Khodas
Abstract: We study the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in an Ising superconductor with broken basal mirror symmetry in a parallel magnetic field. We show that in the presence of a small Rashba spin splitting, $\Delta_R$, the dominant Ising spin-orbit coupling ($\Delta_I >> \Delta_R$) dramatically enhances the SDE efficiency compared to a Rashba superconductor with $\Delta_I = 0$ and the same $\Delta_R$. The suppression of the SDE for $\Delta_I = 0$ at $\Delta_R$ much larger than the critical temperature ($T_c$) is accidental. At $\Delta_R << T_c$, the SDE efficiency is small because, to linear order, $\Delta_R$ can be removed by a gauge transformation. These two factors -- the accidental suppression of the SDE at large $\Delta_R$ and the systematic suppression at small $\Delta_R$ -- are eliminated by Ising spin-orbit coupling. As a result, SDE efficiency is substantially enhanced for $\Delta_I >> \Delta_R \neq 0$.

Title: Martingale approach for first-passage problems of time-additive observables in Markov processes
Authors: Izaak Neri
Abstract: We develop a method based on martingales to study first-passage problems of time-additive observables exiting an interval of finite width in a Markov process. In the limit that the interval width is large, we derive generic expressions for the splitting probability and the cumulants of the first-passage time. These expressions relate first-passage quantities to the large deviation properties of the time-additive observable. We find that there are three qualitatively different regimes depending on the properties of the large deviation rate function of the time-additive observable. These regimes correspond to exponential, super-exponential, or sub-exponential suppression of events at the unlikely boundary of the interval. Furthermore, we show that the statistics of first-passage times at both interval boundaries are in general different, even for symmetric thresholds and in the limit of large interval widths. While the statistics of the times to reach the likely boundary are determined by the cumulants of the time-additive observables in the original process, those at the unlikely boundary are determined by a dual process. We obtain these results from a one-parameter family of positive martingales that we call Perron martingales, as these are related to the Perron root of a tilted version of the transition rate matrix defining the Markov process. Furthermore, we show that each eigenpair of the tilted matrix has a one-parameter family of martingales. To solve first-passage problems at finite thresholds, we generally require all one-parameter families of martingales, including the non-positive ones. We illustrate this by solving the first-passage problem for run-and-tumble particles exiting an interval of finite width.

Title: Towards "on-demand" van der Waals epitaxy with hpc-driven online ensemble sampling
Authors: Soumendu Bagchi, Ankita Biswas, Prasanna V. Balachandran, Ayana Ghosh, Panchapakesan Ganesh
Abstract: Traditional approaches to achieve targeted epitaxial growth involves exploring a vast parameter space of thermodynamical and kinetic drivers (e.g., temperature, pressure, chemical potential etc). This tedious and time-consuming approach becomes particularly cumbersome to accelerate synthesis and characterization of novel materials with complex dependencies on local chemical environment, temperature and lattice-strains, specifically nanoscale heterostructures of layered 2D materials. We combine the strength of next generation supercomputers at the extreme scale, machine learning and classical molecular dynamics simulations within an adaptive real time closed-loop virtual environment steered by Bayesian optimization to enable asynchronous ensemble sampling of the synthesis space, and apply it to the recrystallization phenomena of amorphous transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) bilayer to form stack moir√© heterostructures under various growth parameters. We show that such asynchronous ensemble sampling frameworks for materials simulations can be promising towards achieving on-demand epitaxy of van der Waals stacked moir√© devices, paving the way towards a robust autonomous materials synthesis pipeline to enable unprecedented discovery of new functionalities.

Title: Contemporary tensor network approaches to gapless and topological phases in an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder
Authors: Yuma Watanabe, Ravindra W. Chhajlany, Maciej Lewenstein, Tobias Gra√ü, Utso Bhattacharya
Abstract: The development of numerically efficient computational methods has facilitated in depth studies of various correlated phases of matter including critical and topological phases. A quantum Monte-Carlo study of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder has recently been used to identify an exotic phase with hidden order, where superfluid correlations coexist with string order, dubbed a Haldane superfluid (HSF). However, finite-size methods can struggle to uniquely determine the boundaries of quasi-long-range ordered states with nonlocal, e.g. string-like, correlations. In the present Letter, we revisit the HSF scenario using tensor network algorithms specialized for finite/infinite (quasi-)1D systems, \textit{i.e.} the well-governed finite-size density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and the state-of-the-art infinite-size variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) methods. While DMRG results extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit are compatible with a putative HSF, the results from the VUMPS calculations provide sharper phase boundaries that leave no room for such a topological superfluid. Our results demonstrate the crucial advantage of the VUMPS in characterizing topological and critical interacting phases providing the precise phase boundaries.

Title: Doping lattice non-abelian quantum Hall states
Authors: Zhengyan Darius Shi, Carolyn Zhang, T. Senthil
Abstract: We study quantum phases of a fluid of mobile charged non-abelian anyons, which arise upon doping the lattice Moore-Read quantum Hall state at lattice filling $\nu = 1/2$ and its generalizations to the Read-Rezayi ($\mathrm{RR}_k$) sequence at $\nu = k/(k+2)$. In contrast to their abelian counterparts, non-abelian anyons present unique challenges due to their non-invertible fusion rules and non-abelian braiding structures. We address these challenges using a Chern-Simons-Ginzburg-Landau (CSGL) framework that incorporates the crucial effect of energy splitting between different anyon fusion channels at nonzero dopant density. For the Moore-Read state, we show that doping the charge $e/4$ non-abelion naturally leads to a fully gapped charge-$2$ superconductor without any coexisting topological order. The chiral central charge of the superconductor depends on details of the interactions determining the splitting of anyon fusion channels. For general $\mathrm{RR}_k$ states, our analysis of states obtained by doping the basic non-abelion $a_0$ with charge $e/(k+2)$ reveals a striking even/odd pattern in the Read-Rezayi index $k$. We develop a general physical picture for anyon-driven superconductivity based on charge-flux unbinding, and show how it relates to the CSGL description of doped abelian quantum Hall states. Finally, as a bonus, we use the CSGL formalism to describe transitions between the $\mathrm{RR}_k$ state and a trivial period-$(k+2)$ CDW insulator at fixed filling, driven by the gap closure of the fundamental non-abelian anyon $a_0$. Notably, for $k=2$, this predicts a period-4 CDW neighboring the Moore-Read state at half-filling, offering a potential explanation of recent numerical observations in models of twisted MoTe$_2$.

Title: Quantum geometry and dipolar dynamics in the orbital magneto-electric effect
Authors: James H. Cullen, Daniel P. Arovas, Roberto Raimondi, Dimitrie Culcer
Abstract: We show that the orbital magneto-electric effect (OME) -- the generation of a steady-state orbital angular momentum density -- is partly the result of a nonequilibrium dipole moment generated via Zitterbewegung and proportional to the quantum metric. For tilted massive Dirac fermions this dipole gives the only contribution to the OME in the insulating case, while the intrinsic and extrinsic OMEs occur for different electric field orientations, yielding an experimental detection method. Our results suggest quantum metric engineering as a route towards maximizing orbital torques.

Title: Engineering Morphologies of Metal-Based Colloidal Assemblies via Colloid Jamming at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces
Authors: Jiyuan Yao, Shuting Xie, Shijian Huang, Weilong Xu, Jiaqin Li, Zhenping Liu, Mingliang Jin, Loes I. Segerink, Lingling Shui, Sergii Pud
Abstract: Self-assemblies, structured via nanoparticles, show promise as materials for advanced applications, like photonic devices, electrochemical energy storage units and catalysis support. Despite observing diverse morphologies, a comprehensive understanding of the formation mechanism remains elusive. In this work, we show that the coordination interaction between metal-based sulfide nanoparticles (MS NPs) and the fluorosurfactants at the droplet interface influences the morphology during the evaporation-induced self-assembly facilitated by droplet microfluidics. Further investigation into fluorosurfactants with various chemical groups and MS NPs reveals that the strength of coordination interactions significantly influences assembly morphology. The interfacial interactions can be eliminated through coating a SiO2 layer on the metal-based colloid (M@SiO2 NPs). In addition, we demonstrate that the morphologies of the self-assemblies can be engineered via the coordination interactions between the MS NPs and fluorosurfactants, and by varying the concentrations of MS NPs. Utilizing these interfacial interactions, assemblies with core-shell and homogeneous distribution of binary nanoparticles were constructed. Our findings offer novel insights into the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles at the droplet interface through evaporation-induced self-assembly, and into the design of metal-based colloidal assemblies with diverse morphologies, crucial for developing novel functional assemblies for catalysis, plasmonic, and porous materials in a controlled manner.

Title: Modeling the time evolution of a camphor rotor perturbed by a stationary camphor source
Authors: Jerzy Gorecki, Yuki Koyano, Hiroyuki Kitahata
Abstract: A self-propelled motion resulting from the dissipation of camphor molecules on the water surface has been attracting scientific attention for more than 200 years. A generally accepted description of the phenomenon includes equations for the object motion coupled with the hydrodynamics of Marangoni flows and the time evolution of camphor surface concentration. The solution of such equations is a numerically complex problem. In recent publications, an alternative approach based on Hamiltonian including the potential term representing Marangoni interactions has been applied to simulate the time evolution of camphor rotors. Such a model represents a significant numerical simplification if compared to the standard description. Here, we comment on the applicability of Hamiltonian approach by applying it to a single camphor rotor perturbed by a camphor disk fixed on the water surface. We demonstrate that in such a case, the approach leads to the results qualitatively different from the experimental ones. Therefore, we doubt in its applicability to describe the time evolution of interacting camphor rotors. We also show that the approximation of the Marangoni forces by a potential gives more realistic results if used together with the equation of motion that includes the hydrodynamic friction. Still, a better agreement with experiments can be obtained by considering an additional equation for the time evolution of camphor surface concentration.

Title: Interface-Bound States and Majorana Zero Modes in Lateral Heterostructures of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with Proximity-Induced Superconductivity
Authors: Yoonkang Kim
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the emergence of interface-bound states, particularly Majorana zero modes (MZMs), in a lateral heterostructure composed of two three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$, under the influence of proximity-induced superconductivity from niobium (Nb) contacts. We develop an advanced two-dimensional Dirac model for the topological surface states (TSS), incorporating spatially varying chemical potentials and s-wave superconducting pairing. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism, we derive analytical solutions for the bound states and compute the local density of states (LDOS) at the interface, revealing zero-energy modes characteristic of MZMs. The topological nature of these states is rigorously analyzed through winding numbers and Pfaffian invariants, and their robustness is explored under various physical perturbations, including gating effects. Our findings highlight the potential of this heterostructure as a platform for topological quantum computing, with detailed predictions for experimental signatures via tunneling spectroscopy.

Title: Strong Crystalline Thermal Insulation Induced by Extended Antibonding States
Authors: Ruihuan Cheng, Chen Wang, Niuchang Ouyang, Xingchen Shen, Yue Chen
Abstract: Crystalline solids with extreme insulation often exhibit a plateau or even an upward-sloping tail in thermal conductivity above room temperature. Herein, we synthesized a crystalline material AgTl$_2$I$_3$ with an exceptionally low thermal conductivity of 0.21 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K, which continues to decrease to 0.17 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 523 K. We adopted an integrated experimental and theoretical approach to reveal the lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of AgTl$_2$I$_3$. Our results suggest that the Ag-I polyhedron enables extended antibonding states to weaken the chemical bonding, fostering strong lattice anharmonicity driven by the rattling vibrations of Ag atoms and causing lattice softening. Experimental measurements further corroborate the large atomic thermal motions and low sound velocity. These features impede particle-like phonon propagation, and significantly diminish the contribution of wave-like phonon tunneling. This work highlights a strategy for designing thermal insulating materials by leveraging crystal structure and chemical bonding, providing a pathway for advancing the development of thermal insulators.

Title: Generation of magnetic chiral solitons, skyrmions, and hedgehogs with electric fields
Authors: Teruya Nakagawara, Minoru Kanega, Shunsuke C. Furuya, Masahiro Sato
Abstract: Electric-field controls of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs) have recently been discussed from the microscopic viewpoint. Since the DMI plays a critical role in generating topological spin textures (TSTs) such as the chiral soliton, the magnetic skyrmion, and the magnetic hedgehog, electric-field controls of these TSTs have become an important issue. This paper shows that such electric-field-induced DMI indeed creates and annihilates TSTs by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for many-body spin systems at finite temperatures. We show that when a strong electric field is applied in a proper way to one- or two-dimensional ferromagnets, the Hamiltonians are changed into the well-known spin models for the chiral soliton or the skyrmion lattice, and the TST states emerge. We utilize a machine-learning method to count the number of generated TSTs. In the three-dimensional (3D) case, we demonstrate the electric-field induction of a magnetic hedgehog structure as follows: Applying a strong enough electric field along a proper direction to a skyrmion-string state (a triple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state) at low but finite temperatures, we find that the field-induced DMI can drive a quadruple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state with hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs. This result indicates that we have succeeded in constructing a simple 3D short-range interacting spin model hosting a magnetic hedgehog structure.

Title: Non-linear flow of two-dimensional viscous electron fluid in moderate magnetic fields
Authors: P. S. Alekseev, M. A. Semina
Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, the inter-particle interaction can lead to the formation of a viscous electron fluid and realization of the hydrodynamic regime of electron transport. Here a nonlinear model of the electron hydrodynamic transport is constructed based on the accounting of pair correlations in the electron dynamics. When describing these systems within the framework of classical kinetics, such correlations represent subsequent ``extended'' collisions of the same electrons temporarily joined into pairs. We study their influence on stationary magnetotransport for large-amplitude fluid flows in long samples. Current profiles in the nonlinear regime and the corresponding differential magnetoresistance are calculated. Pair correlations lead to a characteristic nonmonotonic dependence of the differential resistance on magnetic field. We compare our results with experimental data on magnetoresistance of 2D electrons in high-purity GaAs quantum wells; our model can be responsible for a part of the observed features of the differential magnetoresistance.

Title: Operator-state correspondence in simple current extended conformal field theories: Toward a general understanding of chiral conformal field theories and topological orders
Authors: Yoshiki Fukusumi, Guangyue Ji, Bo Yang
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the operator-state correspondence in the Majorana conformal field theory (CFT) with emphasis on its semion representation. Whereas the semion representation (or $Z_{2}$ extension of the chiral Ising CFT) gives a concise ``abelian" (or invertible) representation in the level of fusion rule and quantum states, there exists subtlety when considering the chiral multipoint correlation function. In this sense, the operator-state correspondence in the semion sector of the fermionic theory inevitably contains difficulty coming from its anomalous conformal dimension $1/16$ as a $Z_{2}$ symmetry operator. By analyzing the asymptotic behaviors of the existing correlation functions, we propose a nontrivial correspondence between the chiral conformal blocks and bulk correlation functions containing both order and disorder fields. One can generalize this understanding to $Z_{N}$ models or fractional supersymmetric models (in which there exist long-standing open problems). We expect this may improve our understanding of the simple current extension of CFT which can appear commonly in the studies of topologically ordered systems.

Title: Spectral anomalies and broken symmetries in maximally chaotic quantum maps
Authors: Laura Shou, Amit Vikram, Victor Galitski
Abstract: Spectral statistics such as the level spacing statistics and spectral form factor (SFF) are widely expected to accurately identify ``ergodicity'', including the presence of underlying macroscopic symmetries, in generic quantum systems ranging from quantized chaotic maps to interacting many-body systems. By studying various quantizations of maximally chaotic maps that break a discrete classical symmetry upon quantization, we demonstrate that this approach can be misleading and fail to detect macroscopic symmetries. Notably, the same classical map can exhibit signatures of different random matrix symmetry classes in short-range spectral statistics depending on the quantization. While the long-range spectral statistics encoded in the early time ramp of the SFF are more robust and correctly identify macroscopic symmetries in several common quantizations, we also demonstrate analytically and numerically that the presence of Berry-like phases in the quantization leads to spectral anomalies, which break this correspondence. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that long-range spectral rigidity remains directly correlated with ergodicity in the quantum dynamical sense of visiting a complete orthonormal basis.

Title: Realizing non-trivial doublon formation using a quantum computer
Authors: Biswajit Paul, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: Dynamical formation of doublons or onsite repulsively bound pairs of particles on a lattice is a highly non-trivial phenomenon. In this work, we show the signatures of doublon formation in a quantum computer by simulating the continuous time quantum walk in the framework of the one dimensional extended Fermi-Hubbard model. By considering two up-component and one down-component particles initially created at the three neighbouring sites at the middle of the lattice and allowing intra- (inter-) component nearest neighbour (onsite) interactions we show the formation a stable onsite doublon in the quantum walk. The probability of such doublon formation is more (less) if the hopping strength of the down particle is weaker (stronger) compared to the up particle. On the contrary, for an initial doublon along with a free up particle, the stability of the doublon is more prominent than the doublon dissociation in the dynamics irrespective of the hopping asymmetry between the two components. We first numerically obtain the signatures of the stable doublon formation in the dynamics and then observe them using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.

Title: Considerations in the use of ML interaction potentials for free energy calculations
Authors: Orlando A. Mendible, Jonathan K. Whitmer, Yamil J. Col√≥n
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer the potential to accurately model the energy and free energy landscapes of molecules with the precision of quantum mechanics and an efficiency similar to classical simulations. This research focuses on using equivariant graph neural networks MLPs due to their proven effectiveness in modeling equilibrium molecular trajectories. A key issue addressed is the capability of MLPs to accurately predict free energies and transition states by considering both the energy and the diversity of molecular configurations. We examined how the distribution of collective variables (CVs) in the training data affects MLP accuracy in determining the free energy surface (FES) of systems, using Metadynamics simulations for butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). The study involved training forty-three MLPs, half based on classical molecular dynamics data and the rest on ab initio computed energies. The MLPs were trained using different distributions that aim to replicate hypothetical scenarios of sampled CVs obtained if the underlying FES of the system was unknown. Findings for butane revealed that training data coverage of key FES regions ensures model accuracy regardless of CV distribution. However, missing significant FES regions led to correct potential energy predictions but failed free energy reconstruction. For ADP, models trained on classical dynamics data were notably less accurate, while ab initio-based MLPs predicted potential energy well but faltered on free energy predictions. These results emphasize the challenge of assembling an all-encompassing training set for accurate FES prediction and highlight the importance of understanding the FES in preparing training data. The study points out the limitations of MLPs in free energy calculations, stressing the need for comprehensive data that encompasses the system's full FES for effective model training.

Title: Wilsonian Renormalization of Neural Network Gaussian Processes
Authors: Jessica N. Howard, Ro Jefferson, Anindita Maiti, Zohar Ringel
Abstract: Separating relevant and irrelevant information is key to any modeling process or scientific inquiry. Theoretical physics offers a powerful tool for achieving this in the form of the renormalization group (RG). Here we demonstrate a practical approach to performing Wilsonian RG in the context of Gaussian Process (GP) Regression. We systematically integrate out the unlearnable modes of the GP kernel, thereby obtaining an RG flow of the GP in which the data sets the IR scale. In simple cases, this results in a universal flow of the ridge parameter, which becomes input-dependent in the richer scenario in which non-Gaussianities are included. In addition to being analytically tractable, this approach goes beyond structural analogies between RG and neural networks by providing a natural connection between RG flow and learnable vs. unlearnable modes. Studying such flows may improve our understanding of feature learning in deep neural networks, and enable us to identify potential universality classes in these models.

Abstract: Simulating strongly coupled gauge theories at finite temperature and density is a longstanding challenge in nuclear and high-energy physics that also has fundamental implications for condensed matter physics. In this work, we use minimally entangled typical thermal state (METTS) approaches to facilitate both classical and quantum computational studies of such systems. METTS techniques combine classical random sampling with imaginary time evolution, which can be performed on either a classical or a quantum computer, to estimate thermal averages of observables. We study 1+1-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to spinless fermionic matter, which maps onto a local quantum spin chain. We benchmark both a classical matrix-product-state implementation of METTS and a recently proposed adaptive variational approach that is a promising candidate for implementation on near-term quantum devices, focusing on the equation of state as well as on various measures of fermion confinement. Of particular importance is the choice of basis for obtaining new METTS samples, which impacts both the classical sampling complexity (a key factor in both classical and quantum simulation applications) and complexity of circuits used in the quantum computing approach. Our work sets the stage for future studies of strongly coupled gauge theories with both classical and quantum hardware.

Title: Classical Benchmarks for Variational Quantum Eigensolver Simulations of the Hubbard Model
Authors: Antonios M. Alvertis, Abid Khan, Thomas Iadecola, Peter P. Orth, Norm Tubman
Abstract: Simulating the Hubbard model is of great interest to a wide range of applications within condensed matter physics, however its solution on classical computers remains challenging in dimensions larger than one. The relative simplicity of this model, embodied by the sparseness of the Hamiltonian matrix, allows for its efficient implementation on quantum computers, and for its approximate solution using variational algorithms such as the variational quantum eigensolver. While these algorithms have been shown to reproduce the qualitative features of the Hubbard model, their quantitative accuracy in terms of producing true ground state energies and other properties, and the dependence of this accuracy on the system size and interaction strength, the choice of variational ansatz, and the degree of spatial inhomogeneity in the model, remains unknown. Here we present a rigorous classical benchmarking study, demonstrating the potential impact of these factors on the accuracy of the variational solution of the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, for systems with up to $32$ qubits. We find that even when using the most accurate wavefunction ans√§tze for the Hubbard model, the error in its ground state energy and wavefunction plateaus for larger lattices, while stronger electronic correlations magnify this issue. Concurrently, spatially inhomogeneous parameters and the presence of off-site Coulomb interactions only have a small effect on the accuracy of the computed ground state energies. Our study highlights the capabilities and limitations of current approaches for solving the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, and we discuss potential future avenues of research.

Title: Early-Cycle Internal Impedance Enables ML-Based Battery Cycle Life Predictions Across Manufacturers
Authors: Tyler Sours, Shivang Agarwal, Marc Cormier, Jordan Crivelli-Decker, Steffen Ridderbusch, Stephen L. Glazier, Connor P. Aiken, Aayush R. Singh, Ang Xiao, Omar Allam
Abstract: Predicting the end-of-life (EOL) of lithium-ion batteries across different manufacturers presents significant challenges due to variations in electrode materials, manufacturing processes, cell formats, and a lack of generally available data. Methods that construct features solely on voltage-capacity profile data typically fail to generalize across cell chemistries. This study introduces a methodology that combines traditional voltage-capacity features with Direct Current Internal Resistance (DCIR) measurements, enabling more accurate and generalizable EOL predictions. The use of early-cycle DCIR data captures critical degradation mechanisms related to internal resistance growth, enhancing model robustness. Models are shown to successfully predict the number of cycles to EOL for unseen manufacturers of varied electrode composition with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 150 cycles. This cross-manufacturer generalizability reduces the need for extensive new data collection and retraining, enabling manufacturers to optimize new battery designs using existing datasets. Additionally, a novel DCIR-compatible dataset is released as part of ongoing efforts to enrich the growing ecosystem of cycling data and accelerate battery materials development.

Title: Superradiance of Strongly Interacting Dipolar Excitons in Moir√© Quantum Materials
Authors: Jan Kumlin, Ajit Srivastava, Thomas Pohl
Abstract: Moir√© lattices created in two-dimensional heterostructures exhibit rich many-body physics of interacting electrons and excitons and, at the same time, suggest promising optoelectronic applications. Here, we study the cooperative radiance of moir√© excitons that is demonstrated to emerge from the deep subwavelength nature of the moir√© lattice and the strong excitonic on-site interaction. In particular, we show that the static dipole-dipole interaction between interlayer excitons can strongly affect their cooperative optical properties, suppressing superradiance of disordered states while enhancing superradiance of ordered phases of moir√© excitons. Moreover, we show that doping permits direct control of optical cooperativity, e.g., by generating supperradiant dynamics of otherwise subradiant states of excitons. Our results show that interlayer moir√© excitons offer a unique platform for exploring cooperative optical phenomena in strongly interacting many-body systems, thus, holding promise for applications in quantum nonlinear optics.

Title: Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime
Authors: Michal Makowski, Wenzheng Ye, Dominik Kowal, Francesco Maddalena, Somnath Mahato, Yudhistira Tirtayasri Amrillah, Weronika Zajac, Marcin Eugeniusz Witkowski, Konrad Jacek Drozdowski, Nathaniel, Cuong Dang, Joanna Cybinska, Winicjusz Drozdowski, Ferry Anggoro Ardy Nugroho, Christophe Dujardin, Liang Jie Wong, Muhammad Danang Birowosuto
Abstract: Scintillators convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons and play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films because of the localized nature of this effect. This study introduces a method to expand the application of nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-sized plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) folds for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_{3}$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling also predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.26 $\pm$ 0.31) and (3.02 $\pm$ 0.69) folds for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate a (2.07 $\pm$ 0.39) fold increase in light yield under $^{241}$Am $\gamma$-excitation. These findings provide a viable pathway for utilizing nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.

Title: Machine Learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery in CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion
Authors: Prajwal Pisal, Ondrej Krejci, Patrick Rinke
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.

Title: Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories: emergent properties from Tensor Network methods
Authors: Giovanni Cataldi
Abstract: This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.

Title: Spin photonic topological metasurface based on kagome lattice and leaky-wave application
Authors: Sayyed Ahmad Abtahi, Mohsen Maddahali, Ahmad Bakhtafrouz
Abstract: The emerging field of topological metasurfaces offers unique advantages, particularly in robustness against backscattering in low-profile structures. The lattice configuration of these structures significantly influences the ability to achieve sharp turns in the propagation path. One of the most studied lattices in condensed matter physics is the kagome lattice, characterized by its hexagonal Brillouin zone, which displays a Dirac cone in its dispersion diagram. Previous research on kagome lattices in photonic topological insulators has primarily focused on valley types of insulators. This article introduces a spin topological metasurface based on the kagome lattice and its unit cell, enabling a broad range of sharp turns and propagation paths. The unit cell is compared to its hexagonal and 60-degree rhombic counterparts, and a parametric study of its dimensions is conducted. As a result of this research, a new X-band leaky-wave antenna designed in the kagome lattice with an armchair arrangement interface has been developed. This antenna provides two forward and two backward beams, each pair achieving an approximately 50-degree scan within the 8.8 to 11.1 GHz bandwidth.

Title: Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes
Authors: Udaya Maurya, Surya Teja Gavva, Arpan Saha, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: Thin cylindrical membranes arise in a wide variety of biological systems ranging from tubular structures on and within cell membranes to in-vitro experiments on artificial vesicles. Motor proteins embedded in such fluidic membranes often induce vortex-like flows. In this work, we construct a class of 2D vortex flow in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to 3D external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincar√© Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian, This Hamiltonian also incorporates the specific couplings of the 2D membrane flow with the 3D external fluids. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, such as orbit pinching, For a two-vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time, unlike flat and spherical fluid membranes, where the separation remains constant. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999), now extended to tubular geometries. We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).

Title: Many-Body Vertex Effects: Time-Dependent Interaction Kernel with Correlated Multi-Excitons in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation
Authors: Brian Cunningham
Abstract: Building on a beyond-GW many-body framework that incorporates higher-order vertex effects in the self-energy -- giving rise to T-matrix and second-order exchange contributions -- this approach is extended to now include the vertex derived in that work to the kernel in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) for the reducible polarization function. This results in a frequency-dependent interaction kernel that naturally captures random phase approximation (RPA) effects, dynamical excitonic interactions, and the correlated propagation of multiple correlated electron-hole pairs that model multi- (including bi- and tri-) excitonic effects, relevant for nonlinear optics and high harmonic generation. These processes emerge from including the functional derivatives of the screening and vertex with respect to the Green's function in the vertex, enabling a fully abinitio, time-dependent treatment of correlation effects. By focusing on the reducible rather than irreducible polarization function, this approach provides a computationally viable framework for capturing complex many-body interactions for calculating the self-energy, optical spectra and EELS. The resulting interaction kernel is relatively straightforward, clearly delineates the physical processes that are included and omitted, and has the same dimensionality as the conventional BSE kernel used in standard many-body theory implementations, but is now itself frequency dependent. The method is expected to facilitate the integration of advanced many-body effects into state-of-the-art software packages, offering a universal and highly accurate framework for the description of sub-atomic correlations. Such advancements are crucial for the development of semiconductor, optoelectronic, superconducting and antimatter technologies, and ensuring that theoretical modeling evolves alongside exascale and accelerated computing.

Title: Interplay of entanglement structures and stabilizer entropy in spin models
Authors: Michele Viscardi, Marcello Dalmonte, Alioscia Hamma, Emanuele Tirrito
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer R√©nyi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.

Title: Detuning-symmetric laser cooling of many mechanical modes with a photothermally modified cavity
Authors: Thomas J. Clark, Jiaxing Ma, Jack C. Sankey
Abstract: We simultaneously cool $\gtrsim$100 mechanical modes of a membrane with a photothermally modified optical cavity driven by a single blue-detuned laser. In contrast to radiation pressure and bolometric forces applied directly to the mechanical system, this cooling effect does not depend on the sign of detuning, allowing for single-laser stabilization (i.e., simultaneous positive optical spring and damping) that is especially effective at room temperature and high laser power. We also provide intuition about the competing thermal processes, and propose two simple modifications to the mirror coatings that can strongly enhance this effect.

Title: Momentum, spin, and orbital angular momentum of electromagnetic, acoustic, and water waves
Authors: Konstantin Y. Bliokh
Abstract: Waves of various types carry momentum, which is associated with their propagation direction, i.e., the phase gradient. The circulation of the wave momentum density gives rise to orbital angular momentum (AM). Additionally, for waves described by vector fields, local rotation of the wavefield produces spin AM (or simply, spin). These dynamical wave properties become particularly significant in structured (i.e., inhomogeneous) wavefields. Here we provide an introduction and overview of the momentum and AM properties for a variety of classical waves: electromagnetic, sound, elastic, plasma waves, and water surface waves. A unified field-theory approach, based on Noether's theorem, offers a general framework to describe these diverse physical systems, encompassing longitudinal, transverse, and mixed waves with different dispersion characteristics. We also discuss observable manifestations of the wave momentum and AM providing clear physical interpretations of the derived quantities.

Title: Hybridization of edge modes with substrate phonons
Authors: Azat F. Aminov, Alexey A. Sokolik
Abstract: Surface plasmons or phonons propagating on a two-dimensional (2D) material can exhibit coupling with resonant excitations in its substrate, and the resulting coupled modes were extensively studied. Similar coupling of edge modes propagating along a boundary of 2D material with the substrate excitations remains unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the edge-substrate hybrid modes using the exact Wiener-Hopf analytical approach. We analyze dispersions, decay rate, and confinement of such hybrid modes both without magnetic field (plasmon-phonon and phonon-phonon hybrid modes) and in quantizing magnetic field where edge magnetoplasmons hybridize with substrate phonons. The hybrid modes are predicted to occur in THz and far-IR ranges for several combinations of quasi-2D materials (single- and bilayer graphene, quantum wells, thin-film semiconductors) and substrates with polar-phonon resonances.

Title: Diffusion and instabilities in large-N holographic Fermi liquids: the vector fluctuations of the electron star
Authors: Vladan Gecin, Mihailo ƒåubroviƒá
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic response of the AdS electron star in the vector sector, and compute the correlation functions and the transverse conductivity of the dual field theory. The system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior at low temperatures and near the critical temperature where the electron star undergoes the phase transition to the RN black hole. However, at intermediate temperatures the hydrodynamics does not exist. Remarkably, the system has an instability, i.e. a pole on the positive imaginary frequency axis at finite temperature. This instability is found both from analytical arguments and from numerics. Its physical meaning is so far unclear but it might mean that the ideal fluid limit for the star is a false vacuum.

Title: Identifying optimal magnetic field configurations for decoherence mitigation of boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Basanta Mistri, Saksham Mahajan, Felix Donaldson, Rama K. Kamineni, Siddharth Dhomkar
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy center in 2D hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as a promising quantum sensor. However, its sensitivity is constrained due to ubiquitous nuclear spins in the environment. The nuclear spins, hyperfine coupled with the central electron spin, effectively behave as magnetic field fluctuators, leading to rapid decoherence. Here, we explore the effectiveness of static magnetic field strength and orientation in realizing peculiar subspaces that can lead to enhanced spin coherence. Specifically, using detailed numerical simulations of the spin Hamiltonian, we identify specific field configurations that minimize energy gradients and, consequently, are expected to facilitate decoherence suppression. We also develop an approximate analytical model based on the perturbation theory that accurately predicts these low-gradient subspaces for magnetic fields aligned with the electron spin quantization axis, applicable not only to boron vacancies but to any spin-1 electronic system coupled to nearby nuclear spins. Furthermore, to stimulate experimental validation, we estimate coherence lifetimes as a function of various bias field configurations and demonstrate that significant decoherence suppression can indeed be achieved in certain regions. These findings and the developed methodology offer valuable insights for mitigating decoherence in a low-field regime.
