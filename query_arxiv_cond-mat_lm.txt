Title: A shear-induced limit on bacterial surface adhesion in fluid flow
Authors: Edwina F. Yeo, Benjamin J. Walker, Philip Pearce, Mohit P. Dalwadi
Abstract: Controlling bacterial surface adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation in fluid systems is crucial for the safety and efficacy of medical and industrial processes. Here, we theoretically examine the transport of bacteria close to surfaces, isolating how the key processes of bacterial motility and fluid flow interact and alter surface adhesion. We exploit the disparity between the fluid velocity and the swimming velocity of common motile bacteria and, using a hybrid asymptotic-computational approach, we systematically derive the coarse-grained bacterial diffusivity close to surfaces as a function of swimming speed, rotational diffusivity, and shape. We calculate an analytical upper bound for the bacterial adhesion rate by considering the scenario in which bacteria adhere irreversibly to the surface on first contact. Our theory predicts that maximal adhesion occurs at intermediate flow rates: at low flow rates, increasing flow increases surface adhesion, while at higher flow rates, adhesion is decreased by shear-induced cell reorientation.

Title: Nonlinear ferroelectric characteristics of barium titanate nanocrystals determined via a polymer nanocomposite approach
Authors: Qiong Li, Elshad Allahyarov, Tianxiong Ju, Zhiqun Lin, Lei Zhu
Abstract: The growing demand for high energy storage materials has garnered substantial attention towards lead-free ferroelectric nanocrystals (NCs), such as BaTiO3 (BTO), for next-generation multilayer ceramic capacitors. Notably, it remains challenging to accurately measure the dielectric constant and polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loop for BTO NCs. Herein, we report on nonlinear ferroelectric characteristics of BTO NCs via a polymer nanocomposite approach. Specifically, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)(PVP)/BTO nanocomposite films of 3-10 {\mu}m thickness, containing 380 nm tetragonal-phased and 60 nm cubic-phased BTO NCs with uniform particle dispersion, were prepared. Theoretical deconvolution of the broad experimental P-E loops of the PVP/BTO NC composite films revealed three contributions, that is, the linear deformational polarization of the nanocomposites, the polarization of BTO NCs (Pp ), and the polarization from strong particle-particle interactions. Using different mixing rules and nonlinear dielectric analysis, the overall dielectric constants of BTO NCs were obtained, from which the internal field in the BTO NCs (Ep ) was estimated. Consequently, the Pp-Ep hysteresis loops were obtained for the BTO380 and BTO60 NCs. Interestingly, BTO380 exhibited square-shaped ferroelectric loops, whereas BTO60 displayed slim paraelectric loops. This work presents a robust and versatile route to extract the Pp-Ep loops of ferroelectric NCs from polymer/ceramic nanocomposites.

Title: Link between Continuous and Discrete Descriptions of Noise in Nonlinear Resistive Electrical Components
Authors: Lucas Désoppi, Bertrand Reulet
Abstract: We consider the modeling of a nonlinear, classical, resistive electrical component using two models: i) a continuous description based on a stochastic differential equation with a white thermal Gaussian noise; ii) a discrete, shot noise model based on a Markovian master equation. We show that thermodynamics imposes in i) the use of the Hänggi-Klimontovich (H-K) prescription when the noise depends on bias voltage, and implies a generalized Johnson-Nyquist relation for the noise where the conductance is replaced by the ratio mean current over voltage. In ii) we show that the discrete description compatible with thermodynamics leads to the continuous one of i) with again the H-K prescription. Here the generalized Johnson-Nyquist relation for noise is recovered only at low voltage, when the continuous description is valid.

Title: Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models
Authors: Jessica Kaijia Jiang, Federica Maria Surace, Olexei I. Motrunich
Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-André models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-André models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.

Title: Dynamical correlation functions for the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard insulator
Authors: Kevin zu Münster, Florian Gebhard, Satoshi Ejima, Holger Fehske
Abstract: We calculate the dynamical current and kinetic-energy correlation functions for the first Mott lobe of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. We employ the strong-coupling expansion up to sixth order in $x=t/U$, and the dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method on rings with 64 sites. The correlation functions are finite above the single-particle gap with a square-root onset, as is also found from field theory close to the Mott transition. The correlation functions display a featureless superposition of the primary and tertiary Hubbard bands. We find very good agreement between all methods in the interaction/frequency regimes where they are applicable.

Title: Spin-Glass Phases and Multichaos in the Ashkin-Teller Model
Authors: Alican Saray, A. Nihat Berker
Abstract: The global phase diagram of the Ashkin-Teller spin glass is calculated in d = 3 spatial dimensions by renormalization-group theory. Depending on the value of the positive or negative four-spin interaction, qualitatively different topologies are found for the spin-glass phase diagram in the usual variables of temperature and fraction of antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interactions. Two different spin-glass phases occur. Both spin-glass phases are chaotic. One spin-glass exhibits phase reentrance that is reverse from the reentrances seen in previous spin-glass phase diagrams. Seven different phases: Ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, entropic ferromagnetic and entropic antiferromagnetic, spin-glass and entropic spin-glass, and disordered phases occur. The entropic ferromagnetic phase unusually but understandably occurs at temperatures above one spin-glass phase. A random disorder line is identified and no phase transition occurs on this lie. Our calculation is exact on the d = 3 hierarchical lattice and Migdal-Kadanoff approximate on the cubic lattice.

Title: Electrostatics in semiconducting devices II : Solving the Helmholtz equation
Authors: Antonio Lacerda-Santos, Xavier Waintal
Abstract: The convergence of iterative schemes to achieve self-consistency in mean field problems such as the Schrödinger-Poisson equation is notoriously capricious. It is particularly difficult in regimes where the non-linearities are strong such as when an electron gas in partially depleted or in presence of a large magnetic field. Here, we address this problem by mapping the self-consistent quantum-electrostatic problem onto a Non-Linear Helmoltz (NLH) equation at the cost of a small error. The NLH equation is a generalization of the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We show that one can build iterative schemes that are provably convergent by constructing a convex functional whose minimum is the seeked solution of the NLH problem. In a second step, the approximation is lifted and the exact solution of the initial problem found by iteratively updating the NLH problem until convergence. We show empirically that convergence is achieved in a handfull, typically one or two, iterations. Our set of algorithms provide a robust, precise and fast scheme for studying the effect of electrostatics in quantum nanoelectronic devices.

Title: Quantics Tensor Train for solving Gross-Pitaevskii equation
Authors: Aleix Bou-Comas, Marcin Płodzień, Luca Tagliacozzo, Juan José García-Ripoll
Abstract: We present a quantum-inspired solver for the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the Quantics Tensor-Train (QTT) representation. By evolving the system entirely within a low-rank tensor manifold, the method sidesteps the memory and runtime barriers that limit conventional finite-difference and spectral schemes. Two complementary algorithms are developed: an imaginary-time projector that drives the condensate toward its variational ground state and a rank-adapted fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator for real-time dynamics. The framework captures a broad range of physical scenarios - including barrier-confined condensates, quasi-random potentials, long-range dipolar interactions, and multicomponent spinor dynamics - without leaving the compressed representation. Relative to standard discretizations, the QTT approach achieves an exponential reduction in computational resources while retaining quantitative accuracy, thereby extending the practicable regime of Gross-Pitaevskii simulations on classical hardware. These results position tensor networks as a practical bridge between high-performance classical computing and prospective quantum hardware for the numerical treatment of nonlinear Schrodinger-type partial differential equations.

Title: Mapping phase diagrams of quantum spin systems through semidefinite-programming relaxations
Authors: David Jansen, Donato Farina, Luke Mortimer, Timothy Heightman, Andreas Leitherer, Pere Mujal, Jie Wang, Antonio Acín
Abstract: Identifying quantum phase transitions poses a significant challenge in condensed matter physics, as this requires methods that both provide accurate results and scale well with system size. In this work, we demonstrate how relaxation methods can be used to generate the phase diagram for one- and two-dimensional quantum systems. To do so, we formulate a relaxed version of the ground-state problem as a semidefinite program, which we can solve efficiently. Then, by taking the resulting vector of operator monomials for different model parameters, we identify all first- and second-order transitions based on their cosine similarity. Furthermore, we show how spontaneous symmetry breaking is naturally captured by bounding the corresponding observable. Using these methods, we reproduce the phase transitions for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and the two-dimensional frustrated bilayer Heisenberg model. We also illustrate how the phase diagram of the latter changes when a next-nearest-neighbor interaction is introduced. Overall, our work demonstrates how relaxation methods provide a novel framework for studying and understanding quantum phase transitions.

Title: Quasiparticle energies and excitonic effects of α-RuCl3
Authors: Du Li, Li Yang
Abstract: {\alpha}-phase Ruthenium (III) chloride ({\alpha}-RuCl3) has attracted significant attention because of its potential for realizing Kitaev quantum spin liquid. In this work, we employ first-principles many-body perturbation theory to study its many-electron interactions and excited-state properties. We find enhanced many-electron interactions that dominate quasiparticle energies and optical responses in {\alpha}-RuCl3. Our calculated quasiparticle band gap of bulk structure is about 1.75 eV that agrees well with recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, our calculated first and second primary bright excitons are located at 1.23 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively. These excitons show good consistency with the main features observed in the optical absorption spectrum. We extend our investigation to monolayer {\alpha}-RuCl3, examining the zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases. In addition to significant excitonic effects, the optical spectrum of the zigzag AFM phase exhibits anisotropic behavior, while the FM phase demonstrates isotropic characteristics. The different optical response behaviors provide an efficient approach to identify the energy nearly degenerate magnetic states, which can both potentially exist in fabricated samples.

Title: Domain Growth in Long-range Ising Models with Disorder
Authors: Ramgopal Agrawal, Federico Corberi, Eugenio Lippiello, Sanjay Puri
Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the rich low-temperature kinetics of the long-range Ising model (LRIM). This study investigates domain growth in an LRIM with quenched disorder, following a deep low-temperature quench. Specifically, we consider an Ising model with interactions that decay as $J(r) \sim r^{-(D+\sigma)}$, where $D$ is the spatial dimension and $\sigma > 0$ is the power-law exponent. The quenched disorder is introduced via random pinning fields at each lattice site. For nearest-neighbor models, we expect that domain growth during activated dynamics is logarithmic in nature: $R(t) \sim (\ln t)^{\alpha}$, with growth exponent $\alpha >0$. Here, we examine how long-range interactions influence domain growth with disorder in dimensions $D = 1$ and $D = 2$. In $D = 1$, logarithmic growth is found to persist for various $\sigma > 0$. However, in $D = 2$, the dynamics is more complex due to the non-trivial interplay between extended interactions, disorder, and thermal fluctuations.

Title: Effective anisotropic interaction potentials for pairs of ultracold molecules shielded by a static electric field
Authors: Bijit Mukherjee, Luis Santos, Jeremy M. Hutson
Abstract: Quantum gases of ultracold polar molecules have novel properties because of the strong dipolar forces between molecules. Current experiments shield the molecules from destructive collisions by engineering long-range repulsive interactions using microwave or static electric fields. These shielding methods produce interaction potentials with large repulsive cores that are not well described with contact potentials. In this paper we explore the anisotropic interaction potentials that arise for pairs of polar molecules shielded with static electric fields. We derive computationally inexpensive approximations for the potentials that are suitable for use in calculations of many-body properties. The interaction potentials for molecules shielded with static fields are qualitatively different from those that arise from single-field microwave shielding and will produce quite different many-body physics.

Title: Revealing electron-electron interactions in graphene at room temperature with the quantum twisting microscope

Abstract: The Quantum Twisting Microscope (QTM) is a groundbreaking instrument that enables energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of quantum phases via tunneling spectroscopy across twistable van der Waals heterostructures. In this work, we significantly enhance the QTMs resolution and extend its measurement capabilities to higher energies and twist angles by incorporating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a tunneling dielectric. This advancement unveils previously inaccessible signatures of the dispersion in the tunneling between two monolayer graphene (MLG) sheets, features consistent with a logarithmic correction to the linear Dirac dispersion arising from electron-electron (e-e) interactions with a fine-structure constant of alpha = 0.32. Remarkably, we find that this effect, for the first time, can be resolved even at room temperature, where these corrections are extremely faint. Our results underscore the exceptional resolution of the QTM, which, through interferometric interlayer tunneling, can amplify even subtle modifications to the electronic band structure of two-dimensional materials. Our findings reveal that strong e-e interactions persist even in symmetric, nonordered graphene states and emphasize the QTMs unique ability to probe spectral functions and their excitations of strongly correlated ground states across a broad range of twisted and untwisted systems.

Title: High-throughput screening of charge-order-induced ferroelectrics
Authors: Jose Cuevas-Medina, Yubo Qi, Natasa Stojic, Sebastian E. Reyes-Lillo
Abstract: Charge-order-induced ferroelectrics display important technological applications in spintronics devices due to the possibility of magnetoelectric coupling and fast electronic switching. However, the list of known charge-order-induced ferroelectrics remains limited, hindering the fundamental understanding of the phenomena and the optimization of materials for real applications. In this work, we develop a high-throughput workflow to screen for charge-order-induced ferroelectrics in The Materials Project database. We use the local symmetry and bond valence sum to determine 147 materials displaying a coexistence of charge order and ferroelectric polarization. Then, ab initio simulations are used to identify 21 charge-order-induced ferroelectric candidates in which the ferroelectric polarization originates from or is structurally coupled to the charge order. For the final 21 candidates, we use symmetry-adapted modes and first-principles calculations to determine the structural coupling term between charge order and polar distortions and compute electronic properties, respectively.

Title: System-Bath Approach to Rotational Brownian Motion
Authors: Ashot Matevosyan, Armen E. Allahverdyan
Abstract: Rotational equilibrated systems are widespread, but relatively little attention has been devoted to studying them from the first principles of statistical mechanics. Here we bridge this gap, as we look at a Brownian particle coupled with a rotational thermal bath modeled via Caldeira-Leggett oscillators. We show that the Langevin equation that describes the dynamics of the Brownian particle contains (due to rotation) long-range correlated noise. In contrast to the usual situation of non-rotational equilibration, the rotational Gibbs distribution is recovered only for a weak coupling with the bath. However, the presence of a uniform magnetic field disrupts equilibrium, even under weak coupling conditions. In this context, we clarify the applicability of the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem to classical systems in rotational equilibrium, as well as the concept of work done by a changing magnetic field. Additionally, we show that the Brownian particle under a rotationally symmetric potential reaches a stationary state that behaves as an effective equilibrium, characterized by a free energy. As a result, no work can be extracted via cyclic processes that respect the rotation symmetry. However, if the external potential exhibits asymmetry, then work extraction via slow cyclic processes is possible. This is illustrated by a general scenario, involving a slow rotation of a non-rotation-symmetric potential.

Title: Can slow recombination in ordered superconductors explain the excess quasiparticle population?
Authors: Eva Gurra, Douglas A. Bennett, Shannon M. Duff, Michael R. Vissers, Joel N. Ullom
Abstract: An excess density of quasiparticles is widely observed in superconducting films. This excess causes performance degradation in a variety of superconducting devices, including decoherence in qubits. In this Letter, we evaluate the hypothesis of [1] that the quasiparticle excess is caused by anomalously slow recombination at low quasiparticle densities due to localization in sub-gap states. We probe the density of states in aluminum and niobium films using current-voltage measurements of tunnel junctions and extract upper bounds on the energy scales of the sub-gap states and gap smearing. With these parameters, we evaluate the recombination times predicted by [1] and find that slow recombination is not predicted to occur at observed quasiparticle densities in aluminumand niobium-based superconducting devices. These results suggest that the quasiparticle excess in ordered superconductors is primarily due to non-thermal sources of quasiparticle generation and not slow recombination.

Title: Spontaneous Cholesteric Phase in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals: Preference for Integer Number of Pitches
Authors: Lincoln Paik, Jonathan V. Selinger
Abstract: In a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal, the electrostatic interaction can induce a spontaneous cholesteric helix, even if the material is not chiral. If the liquid-crystal cell is infinitely thick, then the predicted pitch depends continuously on material parameters. Here, we consider how the prediction must be modified in a cell of finite thickness. If the Debye screening length is large enough, we find that the free energy has multiple minima. In these minima, the cholesteric pitch is locked to the cell thickness, so that the cell contains an integer number of pitches. However, if the screening length is smaller, then the cholesteric pitch can vary continuously.

Title: Nonlinear Seebeck effect in Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$|Pt at room temperature
Authors: Y. Hirata, T. Kikkawa, H. Arisawa, E. Saitoh
Abstract: The nonlinear Seebeck effect, nonlinear conversion of a temperature gradient into an electric current, was observed at room temperature. Based on a second-harmonic lock-in method combined with an a.c. temperature gradient, $\nabla T$, we measured a nonlinear Seebeck voltage in NiFe|Pt bilayers at 300 K, the amplitude of which increases in proportion to $(\nabla T)^2$. We also observed that the nonlinear Seebeck voltage increases as the sample length along the $\nabla T$ direction decreases, showing a characteristic scaling law distinct from the conventional linear Seebeck effect. We developed a phenomenological model for the nonlinear Seebeck effect incorporating the spin-current induced modulation of the Seebeck coefficient, which well reproduces the experimental results.

Title: Impact of charge-density-wave pattern on the superconducting gap in V-based kagome superconductors
Authors: T. Nagashima, K. Ishihara, Y. Yamakawa, F. Chen, K. Imamura, M. Roppongi, R. Grasset, M. Konczykowski, B. R. Ortiz, A. C. Salinas, S. D. Wilson, R. Tazai, H. Kontani, K. Hashimoto, T. Shibauchi
Abstract: Kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs) provide a compelling platform to explore the interplay between superconductivity (SC) and charge-density-wave (CDW) orders. While distinct CDW orders have been identified in K/RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ versus CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, their influence on the SC order parameter remains unresolved. Here, we investigate low-energy quasiparticle excitations in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$, uncovering a striking difference in SC gap anisotropy: K/RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibit fully gapped, nearly isotropic $s$-wave states, in contrast to the strongly anisotropic SC gap in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Contrary to previous vortex-state studies suggesting nodal SC in K/RbV$_3$Sb$_5$, our Meissner-state measurements in high-quality crystals demonstrate fully gapped states with reduced anisotropy compared to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Impurity scattering introduced via electron irradiation in K/RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ has a minimal impact on low-energy excitations, and it induces an increase in the SC transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$, consistent with more isotropic $s$-wave SC competing with CDW order. Our theoretical analysis attributes the observed SC gap anisotropy differences to distinct CDW modulation patterns: the star-of-David structure unique to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ preserves van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, promoting anisotropic $s$-wave SC with enhanced $T_{\rm c}$ via bond-order fluctuations. These findings establish a systematic framework for understanding the interplay between SC and CDW orders in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$, driven by electron correlations.

Title: Determining the complex second-order optical susceptibility in macroscale van der Waals heterobilayers
Authors: Zeyuan Zhu, Taejun Yoo, Kanchan Shaikh, Amalya C. Johnson, Qiuyang Li, Fang Liu, Hui Deng, Yuki Kobayashi
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of the second-order susceptibility in MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayers, including their hidden complex phases. To this end, we developed a heterodyne-detection scheme for second-harmonic generation and applied it to macroscale heterobilayer samples prepared using the gold-tape exfoliation method. The heterodyne scheme enabled us to distinguish the relative orientation of the crystal domains, and further, it allowed us to characterize the complex phases of the susceptibility relative to a reference quartz sample. By comparing the results from the monolayer regions and the heterobilayer region over several hundred microns of the sample area, we determined that the contribution of interlayer effects to second-harmonic generation is within the experimental uncertainty arising from the sample inhomogeneity. The results here provide fundamental quantitative information necessary for the precise design of nanophotonic systems based on stacking engineering.

Title: Metallic NbS2 one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Wanyu Dai, Yongjia Zheng, Akihito Kumamoto, Yanlin Gao, Sijie Fu, Sihan Zhao, Ryo Kitaura, Esko I. Kauppinen, Keigo Otsuka, Slava V. Rotkin, Yuichi Ikuhara, Mina Maruyama, Susumu Okada, Rong Xiang, Shigeo Maruyama
Abstract: This study presents the experimental realization of metallic NbS2-based one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures applying a modified NaCl-assisted chemical vapor deposition approach. By employing a "remote salt" strategy, precise control over NaCl supply was achieved, enabling the growth of high-quality coaxial NbS2 nanotubes on single-walled carbon nanotube-boron nitride nanotube (SWCNT-BNNT) templates. With the remote salt strategy, the morphologies of as synthesized NbS2 could be controlled from 1D nanotubes to suspended 2D flakes. Structural characterization via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirms the formation of crystalline NbS2 nanotubes, revealing a distinct bi-layer preference compared to monolayer-dominated semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide analogs. Optical analyses using UV-vis-NIR and FTIR spectroscopy highlight the metallic nature of NbS2. With Raman analysis, oxidation studies demonstrate relative higher degradation rate of 1D NbS2 under ambient conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate the stabilization mechanism of bi-layer NbS2 nanotubes, emphasizing interlayer charge transfer and Coulomb interactions. This work establishes a robust framework for synthesizing metallic 1D vdW heterostructures, advancing their potential applications in optoelectronics and nanodevices.

Title: Magnetic, charge and orbital properties of parent and Sr-doped La$_2$NiO$_4$ and its pressure evolutions
Authors: Han-Yu Wang, Shu-Hong Tang, Xiao-Teng Huang, Ya-Min Quan, XianLong Wang, Yan-Ling Li, Da-Yong Liu, H.-Q. Lin, Zhi Zeng, Liang-Jian Zou
Abstract: Recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity on multilayer nickelates under high pressure have stimulated great interest. The magnetic and charge configurations in the normal phase of multilayer nickelates which closely relate to the spin-charge fluctuations remain under strongly debated. In this work, we focus the normal-state magnetic, charge and orbital configurations and its evolutions with hydrostatic pressure and Sr-doping concentration of monolayer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$. We reveal that in the ambient pressure tetragonal La2NiO4 displays Neel-type antiferromagnetic order in planer Ni spins with negligible interlayer magnetic coupling; with the increase of pressure, La2NiO4 evolves from insulate into metallic state with the critical pressure about P = 50 GPa; with the substitution of La by Sr, the magnetic ground state evolves from G-type, A-type, to double spin striped antiferromagnetic states, as well as weak charge and orbital orders, at x=1; These results can greatly promote our understanding of the magnetic properties of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, and shed the light of the pairing mechanism of unconventional nickelate superconductors.

Title: Multi-gap and high-Tc superconductivity in metal-atom-free borocarbides: Effects of dimensional confinement and strain engineering
Authors: Hao-Dong Liu, Wei-Yi Zhang, Zhen-Guo Fu, Bao-Tian Wang, Hong-Yan Lu, Hua-Jie Song, Ning Hao, Ping Zhang
Abstract: Pure borocarbides suffer from limited superconducting potential due to intrinsic structural instability, requiring transition/alkali metals as dual-functional stabilizers and dopants. Here, by combining high-throughput screening with anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg (aME) theory, we identify dynamically stable borocarbides where high-Tc superconductivity predominately originates from E symmetry-selective electron-phonon coupling (EPC). The six distinct superconducting gaps emerge from a staircase distribution or uncoupling of EPC strength across each Fermi surface (FS) sheet, constituting a metal-free system with such high gap multiplicity. Crucially, dimensional reduction from bulk to surface strengthens E-symmetry EPC and enhances Tc from 32 K (3D bulk) to 75 K (2D surface), a result that highlights structural confinement as a key design strategy for observing high Tc. External strain further optimizes the competition between EPC strength and characteristic phonon frequency to achieve Tc > 90 K. This work reveals a systematic correlation between structural dimensionality and gap multiplicity and establishes borocarbide as a tunable platform to engineer both high-Tc and multi-gap superconductivity.

Title: Evidence of topological Kondo insulating state in MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers
Authors: Zhongdong Han, Yiyu Xia, Zhengchao Xia, Wenjin Zhao, Yichi Zhang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jie Shan, Kin Fai Mak
Abstract: Topological Kondo insulators (TKIs) are topologically protected insulating states induced not by single-particle band inversions, but by the Kondo interaction between itinerant electrons and a lattice of local magnetic moments. Although experiments have suggested the emergence of three-dimensional (3D) TKIs in the rare earth compound SmB6, its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart has not been demonstrated to date. Here we report experimental evidence of a TKI in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers, which support a Kondo lattice with topologically nontrivial Kondo interactions. We prepare in a dual-gated device a triangular lattice Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer Kondo-coupled to a half-filled itinerant band in the WSe2 layer. Combined transport and compressibility measurements show that the prepared state supports metallic transport at high temperatures and, at low temperatures, an insulating bulk with conducting helical edge states protected by spin-Sz conservation. The presence of Kondo singlets is further evidenced by their breakdown at high magnetic fields. Such behaviors are in stark contrast to the simple metallic state when the Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer is depleted by gating. Our results open the door for exploring tunable topological Kondo physics in moiré materials.

Title: Synthesis and transport properties of epitaxial Bi (0001) films on GaAs (111) substrates
Authors: Jagannath Jena, Eugene Ark, Justin Wood, Junyi Yang, John Pearson, Hanu Arava, Daniel Rosenmann, U. Welp, J. S. Jiang, Deshun Hong, Anand Bhattacharya
Abstract: In recent decades, the growth of ultrathin epitaxial bismuth (Bi) films on various substrates has garnered interest due to their topological, thermoelectric, and even ferroelectric properties. We report upon the growth and transport properties of epitaxial Bi (0001) films in the thickness range of 5-32 nm deposited directly on GaAs (111) substrates, without a buffer layer. The quality of Bi films are found to depend on conditions for substrate treatment using Ar+ ion-milling and annealing. Substrates milled at low ion beam currents display poor surface reconstruction after annealing, which hinders the growth of high-quality films. In contrast, substrates milled under optimized conditions led to reconstructed surfaces upon annealing, resulting in epitaxial Bi films with predominantly single-domain orientation. Although epitaxial films formed in both cases, transport measurements indicated significantly higher conductivity for films grown on optimally treated substrates. Measurements at low temperatures suggest that the transport properties are dominated by a surface state. Magneto-transport measurements suggest that conductivity and mobility improve progressively with increasing film thickness. Remarkably, our 5 nm Bi film demonstrated resilience to ambient conditions without oxidation, with transport properties similar to those of bilayer Bi films grown by confinement heteroepitaxy in other studies. These results provide a robust methodology for growing high-quality epitaxial Bi films on GaAs (111) and offer insights into their unique transport properties.

Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) are frequently implicated as key defect structures facilitating metal hydride formation, yet their specific role remains poorly understood due to their structural complexity. Here, we investigate hydrogen insertion in Pd nanostructures enriched with well-defined $\Sigma$3(111) GBs (Pd GB) synthesized via electrolysis-driven nanoparticle assembly. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals that Pd GB exhibits dramatically accelerated hydriding and dehydriding kinetics compared to ligand-free and ligand-capped Pd nanoparticles with similar crystallite sizes. Strain mapping using environmental transmission electron microscopy shows that strain is highly localized at GBs and intensifies upon hydrogen exposure, indicating preferential hydrogen insertion along GB sites. Density functional theory calculations support these findings, showing that hydrogen insertion near $\Sigma$3(111) GBs is energetically more favorable and that tensile strain lowers insertion barriers. These results provide atomic-level insights into the role of GBs in hydride formation and suggest new design strategies for GB-engineered Pd-based functional materials. Keywords: Hydrogen Insertion; Tensile Strain; Grain Boundaries; Palladium Nanostructures.

Title: Anomalous Charge Density Wave and Fermi Surface Reconstruction in Pressurized BaFe2Al9

Abstract: The intermetallic compound BaFe2Al9 exhibits unusual physical properties associated with a charge density wave (CDW) transition. Unlike conventional CDW materials, which typically display subtle structural distortions or lattice modulations, BaFe2Al9 undergoes a first-order phase transition in which lattice strain plays a crucial role in the formation of the CDW state. To further explore this unique behavior, we conducted high-pressure studies, examining the electrical transport, magnetic, and structural properties to gain deeper insight into the underlying CDW mechanism. At ambient pressure, electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements confirm the presence of a CDW transition. Upon applying pressure, the CDW transition temperature (TCDW) shifts to higher values, reaching approximately 300 K near 3.2 GPa, and the electrical resistivity increases, suggesting that pressure modulates the charge carrier concentration. Furthermore, the initially sharp first-order transition becomes more gradual, and analysis of the temperature derivative of resistivity indicates a crossover from first-order to second-order like behavior under pressure. High-pressure magnetization measurements are consistent with the electrical transport data, showing an enhancement of TCDW with increasing pressure. The residual resistivity increases with pressure, while the Fermi liquid coefficient A decreases above 2 GPa, pointing to a possible Fermi surface reconstruction. High-pressure synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements at room temperature reveal a lattice anomaly near 3.8 GPa, marked by a distinct trend change in macrostrain, further supporting the existence of a pressure induced structural response. These findings provide valuable insight into the nature of CDW formation in BaFe2Al9 and highlight the critical role of lattice strain and external pressure in tuning its electronic ground state.

Abstract: When thinned down to just a few atomic layers, the layered magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 offers an exceptional platform for exploring a wide range of topological phenomena. In this work, we overcome longstanding challenges in synthesizing high-purity MnBi2Te4 crystals and report the observation of a myriad of quantized topological states in high-quality five-septuple-layer (5-SL) samples under magnetic fields up to 45 Tesla. We show that the nontrivial topology of 5-SL MnBi2Te4, in the presence of Landau quantization, is governed by a generalized topological index rooted in the parity anomaly of Dirac fermions in (2+1) dimensions. The anomaly manifests as an anomalous Landau level, giving rise to gate-tunable helical edge transport. Our results establish high-quality MnBi2Te4 as a robust platform for exploring emergent topological states and for advancing novel quantum device applications.

Title: Incipient ionic conductors: Ion-constrained lattices achieving superionic-like thermal conductivity by extreme anharmonicity
Authors: Yongheng Li, Chunqiu Lu, Bin Wei, Cong Lu, Xingang Jiang, Daisuke Ishikawa, Taishun Manjo, Caofeng Pan, Alfred Q. R. Baron, Jiawang Hong
Abstract: Phonon liquid-like thermal conduction in the solid state enables superionic conductors to serve as efficient thermoelectric device candidates. While liquid-like motion of ions effectively suppresses thermal conductivity (\kappa), their high mobility concurrently triggers material degradation due to undesirable ion migration and consequent metal deposition, making it still a challenge to balancing low \kappa and high stability. Here, we report a superionic-like thermal transport alongside restricted long-range ion migration in CsCu_2I_3 with incipient ionic conduction, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, inelastic X-ray scattering, and machine-learning potential-based simulations. We reveal that the Cu ions exhibit confined migration between CuI_4 tetrahedra at high temperatures, displaying extreme anharmonicity of dominated phonons beyond conventional rattling and comparable to that in superionic conductorsl. Consequently, a glass-like \kappa (~0.3 W m^{-1} K^{-1} at 300 K) following the relationship of \kappa ~ T^{0.17}, was achieved along the x-direction, where Cu ion migration is three oders of magnitude lower than in superionic conductors. These results highlight the advantage of incipient ionic conductors in simultaneously maintaining both low \kappa and high stability, elucidate the thermal transport mechanism via ion migration constraints, and pave an effective pathway toward ultralow thermal conductivity in ionic conductors.

Title: Multiscale Modeling of Vacancy-Cluster Interactions and Solute Clustering Kinetics in Al-Mg-Zn Alloys
Authors: Zhucong Xi, Louis G. Hector Jr., Amit Misra, Liang Qi
Abstract: During heat treatment of age-hardenable alloys, growing solute clusters can strongly trap excess vacancies, limiting their mobility and significantly influencing precipitation kinetics. However, quantitative understanding of vacancy-cluster interactions remains limited due to the inherently multi-time- and multi-length-scale nature of vacancy-mediated diffusion. In this work, we develop an integrated computational framework combining lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, an atomistic absorbing Markov chain model, and mesoscale cluster dynamics (CD) to investigate these interactions and predict their effects on long-time clustering in Al-Mg-Zn alloys. The Markov chain model yields vacancy escape times from solute clusters and identifies a two-stage behavior of the vacancy-cluster binding energy: a size-dependent regime for small clusters (fewer than $\sim$100 atoms), followed by a saturation stage governed by vacancy formation energy differences between the cluster and matrix. These binding energies are used to estimate residual mobile vacancy concentrations in the Al matrix after quenching, which serve as critical inputs to CD simulations to predict the long-time cluster evolution kinetics during natural aging. Our results quantitatively demonstrate that cooling rate substantially affects natural aging kinetics, offering predictive insights for tailoring heat treatments in engineering alloys.

Title: Ferroelectric Antiferromagnetic Lifting of Spin-Valley Degeneracy
Authors: Jiaqi Feng, Xiaodong Zhou, Jingyan Chen, Meiling Xu, Xiuxian Yang, Yinwei Li
Abstract: The generation and control of spin- and valley-polarization in antiferromagnets (AFMs) have garnered increasing attention due to their potential for enabling faster and more stable multifunctional spintronic and valleytronic memory and logic devices. However, the two primary categories of AFMs, altermagnets and TP-symmetric AFMs, either lack intrinsic valley-polarization or net spin-polarization. Here, we propose an effective approach for achieving spontaneous spin-valley polarization in TP-broken layered ferroelectric antiferromagnets (FE-AFMs). The FE-AFMs exhibit lifted spin degeneracy across the entire Brillouin zone, along with uncompensated spin density of states. They combine the benefits of spin-polarization in altermagnets with valley-polarization in TP-symmetric AFMs. Furthermore, the FE-AFMs feature layer-dependent spin-polarization, rooted in their intrinsic ferroelectric property, allowing for the flexible control over spin-valley polarization by interlayer sliding. This tunability facilitates sign-reversible and size-tunable valley Hall and Nernst effects, along with other spin-valley-dependent transport properties. Our findings are demonstrated in a broad class of TP-broken bilayer antiferromagnets such as Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br, I), VX2 (X = S, Se), and VSi2X4 (X = N, P), underscoring the potential of FE-AFMs for advancing next-generation spin- and valley-based information technologies.

Title: Magnetic field induced exciton spin dynamics in indirect band gap (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots
Authors: T.S. Shamirzaev, D. R. Yakovlev, D. S. Smirnov, V. N. Mantsevich, D. Kudlacik, A. Yu. Gornov, A. K. Gutakovskii, M. Bayer
Abstract: The exciton recombination and spin dynamics are investigated both experimentally and theoretically in an ensemble of indirect band gap (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots (QDs) with type-I band alignment. The magnetic-field-induced circular polarization of the time-integrated photoluminescence changes sign across the emission spectrum with a width reflecting the QD size. It is negative on the low energy side, i.e. for emission from large QDs, but positive on the high energy side, i.e. for emission from small QDs. However, the exciton g factor, measured by spin-flip Raman scattering, is positive across the whole QD ensemble. The magnetic-field-induced circular polarization of the photoluminescence dynamics is studied as function of the magnetic field strength and direction. The dynamics are non-monotonic over a time range up to milliseconds. The time dependence of the photoluminescence circular polarization degree and sign strongly depends on the emission energy and changes with magnetic field orientation. The observed nonmonotonic behavior is provided by the interplay of bright and dark exciton states, contributing to the emission. The experiment is interpreted using a kinetic theory, which accounts for the dynamics of the spin states in the exciton level quartet in longitudinal and tilted magnetic fields, the radiative recombination processes, and the redistribution of the excitons between these states as result of spin relaxation. The model allows us to evaluate the electron and heavy hole spin relaxation times in QDs with different sizes.

Title: Index Theorem and Vortex Kinetics in Bose-Einstein Condensates on a Haldane Sphere with a Magnetic Monopole
Authors: Xi-Yu Chen, Lijia Jiang, Tao Yang, Jun-Hui Zheng
Abstract: The geometry-gauge interplay constitutes a fundamental issue in quantum physics, with profound implications spanning from quantum gravity to topological matter. Here, we investigate the dynamic effects of geometry-gauge interplay in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) on a Haldane sphere with a magnetic monopole. We reveal an index theorem that establishes a correspondence between BEC vortices and the topology of the gauge field, enabling the construction of vortex-monopole composites. Furthermore, we derive the universal logarithmic interaction between composites, which governs the structure of the ground-state vortex lattice. By developing a kinetic theory, we predict scale-invariant vortex dynamics and an emergent duality. Both are confirmed through numerical simulations. This work first presents the dynamical coupling mechanism between spatial geometry and gauge fields, providing deep insights into superfluid systems with topological gauge structures in curved space.

Abstract: Effective thermal management at variable and extreme temperatures face limitations for the development of novel energy and aerospace applications. Plasmonic approaches, shown to be capable of tailoring black-body emission, could be effective if materials with high-temperature and tunable plasmonic-resonance were available. Here, we report a synergy between experimental and theoretical results proving that many high-entropy transition-metal carbides, consisting of four or more metals at equal molar ratio, have plasmonic resonance at room, high (>1000C) and variable temperatures. We also found that these high-entropy carbides can be tuned and show considerable plasmonic thermal cycling stability. This paradigm-shift approach could prove quite advantageous as it facilitates the accelerated rational discovery and manufacturability of optically highly-optimized high-entropy carbides with ad-hoc properties.

Title: Anharmonicity and Coulomb Pseudopotential Effects in YH$_6$ and YH$_9$ Superconductivity
Authors: Yucheng Ding, Haoran Chen, Junren Shi
Abstract: Anharmonic effects are widely believed to be the primary cause of the overestimation of superconducting transition temperatures of yttrium hydrides YH$_6$ and YH$_9$ in theoretical predictions. However, prior studies indicate that anharmonicity alone may be insufficient to account for this discrepancy. In this work, we employ the stochastic path-integral approach to investigate the quantum and anharmonic effects of ions in yttrium hydrides. Our calculations reveal significant corrections to the electron-phonon coupling parameters and an increase in the average phonon frequency compared to density functional perturbation theory, aligning closely with results from the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. We find that properly taking into account the renormalization of the Coulomb pseudopotential due to the frequency cutoff, which is often overlooked in previous calculations, is critical to predicting transition temperatures consistent with experimental values for both YH$_6$ and YH$_9$. This indicates that, with this correction, anharmonic effects are sufficient to explain the discrepancies between experimental and theoretical results.

Title: Brownian motion near a soft surface
Authors: Yilin Ye (LOMA, LPMC), Yacine Amarouchene (LOMA), Raphaël Sarfati (CU), David S. Dean (LOMA), Thomas Salez (LOMA)
Abstract: Brownian motion near soft surfaces is a situation widely encountered in nanoscale and biological physics. However, a complete theoretical description is lacking to date. Here, we theoretically investigate the dynamics of a two-dimensional colloid in an arbitrary external potential and near a soft surface. The latter is minimally modelled by a Winkler's foundation, and we restrict the study to the colloidal motion in the direction perpendicular to the surface. We start from deterministic hydrodynamic considerations, by invoking the already-established leading-order soft-lubrication forces acting on the particle. Importantly, a negative softness-induced and position-dependent added mass is identified. We then incorporate thermal fluctuations in the description. In particular, an effective Hamiltonian formulation is introduced and a temperature-dependent generalized potential is constructed in order to ensure equilibrium properties for the colloidal position. From these considerations and the Fokker-Planck equation, we then derive the relevant Langevin equation, which self-consistently allows to recover the deterministic equation of motion at zero temperature. Interestingly, besides an expected multiplicative-noise feature, the noise correlator appears to be modified by the surface softness. Moreover, a softness-induced temperature-dependent spurious drift term has to be incorporated within the Ito prescription. Finally, using numerical simulations with various initial conditions and parameter values, we statistically analyze the trajectories of the particle when placed within a harmonic trap and in presence of the soft surface. This allows us to: i) quantify further the influence of surface softness, through the added mass, which enhances the velocity fluctuations; and ii) show that intermediate-time diffusion is unaffected by softness, within the assumptions of the model.

Title: Structural and Magnetic Properties of Barium Hexaferrite Nanoplatelets
Authors: Daniel Zabek, Joseph Veryard, Yusra Ahmed, Arjen van den Berg, Joseph Askey, Sam Ladak
Abstract: Combining unique geometric and magnetic anisotropy in barium hexaferrites has the potential to enhance the performance of advanced technological applications, such as data storage, spintronics, and medicine. Here, we report the synthesis and deposition of barium hexaferrite nanoplatelets, followed by comprehensive structural and magnetic microscopies. The topographic, physical, and morphological properties of individual nanoplatelets, clusters, and aggregates are analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron microscopy, while magnetic properties are analysed using magnetic force microscopy (MFM). Relevant size distributions and nanoparticle configurations for magnetic interactions have been experimentally identified and numerically analyzed. For dense nanoparticle arrangements, direct exchange coupling dominates with parallel magnetisation configuration in overlapping particles. In contrast, separated particles exhibit anti-parallel coupling. Detailed micro-magnetic modelling elucidates the length scales over which these two interaction regimes are dominant, paving the way for macroscopic two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures with tuned magnetic ordering.

Title: Vacancy-free cubic superconducting NbN enabled by quantum anharmonicity

Abstract: Niobium nitride (NbN) is renowned for its exceptional mechanical, electronic, magnetic, and superconducting properties. The ideal 1:1 stoichiometric $\delta$-NbN cubic phase, however, is known to be dynamically unstable, and repeated experimental observations have indicated that vacancies are necessary for its stabilization. In this work, we demonstrate that when the structure is fully relaxed and allowed to distort under quantum anharmonic effects, a previously unreported stable cubic phase with space group $P\bar{4}3m$ emerges - 65 meV/atom lower in free energy than the ideal $\delta$ phase. This discovery is enabled by state-of-the-art first-principles calculations accelerated by machine-learned interatomic potentials. To evaluate the vibrational and superconducting properties with quantum anharmonic effects accounted for, we use the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) and molecular dynamics spectral energy density (SED) methods. Electron-phonon coupling calculations based on the SSCHA phonon dispersion yield a superconducting transition temperature of $T_\text{c}$ = 20 K, which aligns closely with experimentally reported values for near-stoichiometric NbN. These findings challenge the long-held assumption that vacancies are essential for stabilizing cubic NbN and point to the potential of synthesizing the ideal 1:1 stoichiometric phase as a route to achieving enhanced superconducting performance in this technologically significant material.

Title: AFLOW4: heading toward disorder
Authors: Simon Divilov, Hagen Eckert, Scott D. Thiel, Sean D. Griesemer, Rico Friedrich, Nicholas H. Anderson, Michael J. Mehl, David Hicks, Marco Esters, Nico Hotz, Xiomara Campilongo, Arrigo Calzolari, Stefano Curtarolo
Abstract: AFLOW4 is the latest iteration of the AFLOW toolkit, specifically tailored to study high-entropy disordered materials. This upgrade includes innovative features like the Soliquidy module, based on the Euclidean transport cost between disordered and ordered material states. AFLOW4 can calculate dielectric functions to understand optical and electronic properties of disordered ceramics. The newly introduced human-readable data export feature ensures the uncomplicated incorporation of AFLOW4 in diverse automated workflows. Features relevant to high-entropy research, like prototype identification, partial occupation method, convex hull calculation, and enthalpy corrections based on local atomic environments, have been improved and exhibit substantial speed-up. Together, these enhancements represent a step forward for AFLOW as a valuable tool for research of high-entropy materials.

Title: Enhancing thermoelectric efficiency of multilayer graphene by nanomeshing
Authors: Mehrdad Rahimi, Nunzia Lubertino, Roberto Bellelli, Linsai Chen, François Mallet, Philippe Lafarge, Clément Barraud, PAscal Marti, Julien Chaste, Danièle Fournier, Maria Luisa Della Rocca
Abstract: Nanostructuring materials at small scales enables control over their physical properties, revealing behaviors not observed at larger dimensions. This strategy is particularly effective in two-dimensional (2D) materials, where surface effects dominate, and has been applied in the thermoelectric field. Here, we use multilayer graphene (4-6 nm thick) as a test platform to study the effect of nanomeshing on its thermoelectric properties. The nanomesh consists of a hexagonal array of holes, with a measured diameter and neck-width of ~360 nm and ~160 nm, respectively. The multilayer graphene is integrated into field-effect transistor-like devices supported by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), allowing simultaneous electric and thermoelectric measurements, with nanomeshing applied to only part of the material. We use modulated thermoreflectance to investigate thermal transport in equivalent nanomeshed and pristine graphene flakes, extracting key parameters that affect thermoelectric performance. The nanomesh geometry suppresses thermal transport without significantly impacting charge transport, highlighting the different scattering lengths of phonons and electrons while enhancing the thermopower response. We observe a twofold improvement in the device power factor, PF = S^2 sigma (with S the Seebeck coefficient and sigma the electrical conductivity), at room temperature, along with a nearly threefold reduction in thermal conductivity k. The results show that nanomeshing can significantly improve the thermoelectric performance of multilayer graphene, paving the way for novel energy conversion strategies using 2D materials.

Title: Room temperature magnetic vortices in the van der Waals magnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$
Authors: Elias Sfeir, Carolin Schrader, Florentin Fabre, Jules Courtin, Céline Vergnaud, Alain Marty, Matthieu Jamet, Frédéric Bonell, Isabelle Robert-Philip, Vincent Jacques, Aurore Finco
Abstract: We investigate the effect of confinement on the magnetic state of a 12 nm-thick Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ layer grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We use quantitative scanning NV magnetometry to locally extract the magnetization in rectangular uniformly in-plane magnetized microstructures, showing no enhancement of the Curie temperature compared to magnetization measurements performed before patterning the film, in contrast to previous results obtained on thick Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ flakes. Under the application of a weak out-of-plane magnetic field, we observe the stabilization of magnetic vortices at room temperature in micrometric squares. Finally, we highlight the effect of the size of the patterned micro-discs and micro-squares on the stabilization of the vortices using experiments and micromagnetic simulations. Our work thus proposes and demonstrates a way to stabilize non-collinear textures at room temperature in a van der Waals magnets using confinement, although we also show that this approach alone is not successful to enhance the Curie temperature of Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ significantly above 300 K.

Title: An alternative approach to the phonon theory of liquids: An analytical study of Frenkel frequency and heat capacity as a function of pressure and temperature
Authors: M. Y. Esmer, Bahtiyar A. Mamedov
Abstract: Based on the Maxwell relationship and experimental viscosity data, the phonon theory of liquids can provide a temperature-dependent description of liquid heat capacity that is consistent with experimental data. However, since liquid heat capacity also varies with pressure, we present an alternative approach that can be used to calculate the Frenkel frequency in terms of temperature and pressure by applying the concept of chemical potential under the assumption of a diffusive equilibrium. Using this derived Frenkel frequency, we formulate an analytical expression for the liquid heat capacity in terms of both temperature and pressure, without the need for viscosity data, which is consistent with predictions from the phonon theory of liquids. Our model is tested by comparing the calculated heat liquid capacity with experimental data for four noble liquids at various pressures and temperatures, and good agreement is found. Finally, based on our findings, we propose analytical expressions for the Frenkel line and viscosity as a function of pressure and temperature, and discuss the key details and implications of our approach.

Title: From localized 4f electrons to anisotropic exchange interactions in ferromagnetic CeRh6Ge4
Authors: Shoichiro Itokazu, Akimitsu Kirikoshi, Harald O. Jeschke, Junya Otsuki
Abstract: CeRh6Ge4 is a Ce-based ferromagnetic material exhibiting a quantum critical behavior under pressure. We derive effective exchange interactions, using the framework of density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal that the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interaction along the c-axis is isotropic in spin space, leading to a formation of spin chains. On the other hand, the inter-chain coupling is highly anisotropic: The in-plane moment weakly interacts ferromagnetically in the a--b plane to stabilize the ferromagnetic state, whereas the z-component couples antiferromagnetically, contributing to its destabilization. The magnetic anisotropy of the interchain interactions as well as of the local 4f wavefunctions characterizes the magnetic properties underlying the ferromagnetic transition and the quantum critical behavior in CeRh6Ge4.

Title: Magnetocalorics of singlet ground state induced moment magnets
Authors: Peter Thalmeier
Abstract: In f-electron materials like Pr or U compounds with non-Kramers states of the f-shell the ground state may be a nonmagnetic singlet due to the action of the crystalline electric field. Nevertheless these compounds can order magnetically. They develop a ground state moment and long range order due to the spontaneous admixture of the excited state into the ground state caused by inter-site exchange. This mechanism can establish magnetic order if a control parameter exceeds a critical value defining the quantum critical point between disordered and magnetic phase. Here we investigate the magnetocaloric properties of such quantum magnets where the entropy release at low temperature is due to a competition between thermal depopulation and spontaneous order effects. We determine field and temperature dependence of specific heat for ferro- and antiferromagnetic order and also calculate the adiabatic magneto- and barocaloric cooling rates. As a model application we discuss the magnetic specific heat of the new induced ferromagnet PrI3. Furthermore we analyze the excitation spectrum of the singlet induced moment magnets in an external field with particular emphasis on field and temperature dependence of the critical soft mode. We find that the latter is fragile and exists only at specific points in the phase diagram.

Title: A Molecule with Half-Möbius Topology
Authors: Igor Roncevic, Fabian Paschke, Yueze Gao, Leonard-Alexander Lieske, Lene A. Gödde, Jascha Repp, Florian Albrecht, Harry L. Anderson, Leo Gross
Abstract: Stereoisomers of C13Cl2 exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation. We resolved chiral geometries of the closed-shell singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. The {\pi}-orbital basis of the singlets twists by 90° in one circulation, which is consistent with a half-Möbius topology. In such a topology, the {\pi}-orbital basis is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations, corresponding to a quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition, implying a Berry phase of {\pi}/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-Möbius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet isomer.

Title: Microscopic origin of the nemato-elastic coupling and dynamics of hybridized collective nematic-phonon excitations
Authors: Morten H. Christensen, Michael Schütt, Avraham Klein, Rafael M. Fernandes
Abstract: Electronically-driven nematic order breaks the rotational symmetry of a system, e.g., through a Pomeranchuk instability of the Fermi surface, with a concomitant distortion of the lattice. As a result, in a metal, the nematic collective mode interacts with two different sets of gapless excitations: the particle-hole excitations of the metal and the lattice fluctuations that become soft at the induced structural transition, namely, the transverse acoustic phonons. However, the \textit{dynamics} of these hybridized collective modes formed by the transverse acoustic phonons and the metallic electronic-nematic fluctuations has remained largely unexplored. Here we address this problem by developing a formalism in which the nemato-elastic coupling is obtained microscopically from the direct coupling between electrons and transverse acoustic phonons enabled by impurities present in the crystal. We then demonstrate the emergence of hybrid nemato-elastic modes that mix the characteristics of the transverse phonons and of the nematic fluctuations. Near the nematic quantum critical point in a metal, two massless modes emerge with intertwined dynamic behaviors, implying that neither mode dominates the response of the system. We systematically study the non-trivial dependence of these collective modes on the longitudinal and transverse momenta, revealing a rich landscape of underdamped and overdamped modes as the proximity to the quantum critical point and the strength of the electron-phonon coupling are changed. Since dynamics play an important role for determining superconducting instabilities, our results have implications for the study of pairing mediated by electronic nematic fluctuations.

Title: Chirality-dependent terahertz topological resonance and inertial dynamics of magnetic skyrmions
Authors: X. D. Wang, Y. F. Duan, H. M. Dong, Kai Chang
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the terahertz (THz) optical response of magnetic skyrmions governed by an inertial-modified Thiele equation. By incorporating the inertial mass term, we derive analytical expressions for the THz absorption spectrum of skyrmions, revealing a topological resonance phenomenon tunable via the skyrmion's topological charge $Q$, damping factor $\alpha$, and effective mass $m$. The resonance frequency $\omega_0 \propto Q/m$ emerges from the interplay between gyroscopic coupling and inertial mass, enabling precise control over skyrmion dynamics through circularly polarized THz fields. Our results demonstrate that the helical motion trajectories and velocity components of skyrmions depend on the chirality of light and the topological charge $Q$, with critical damping $\alpha_c$ marking the transition to overdamped regimes. Our findings establish an optical method for designing tunable THz devices, such as topological filters and detectors, by exploiting the interplay between magnetic skyrmion topology and the chirality of THz light coupling.

Title: Phonon-enhanced optical spin-conductivity and spin-splitter effect in altermagnets
Authors: Erik Wegner Hodt, Alireza Qaiumzadeh, Jacob Linder
Abstract: Collinear antiferromagnets with nonrelativistic spin-split bands and no net magnetization, called altermagnets, show interesting transport properties due to their unique band structure. We here compute the linear response optical conductivity of thin films of such materials in the presence of phonon scatterings. Using a tight-binding lattice model for altermagnets and the Holstein model for the phonon sector, we find that the electron-phonon scatterings can strongly increase the spin conductivity at finite frequencies. This occurs despite the fact that the self-energy describing the electron-phonon interactions is spin-independent. Interestingly, we show that electron-phonon scattering also enhances the spin-splitter effect at finite frequencies. These results suggest that altermagnets with strong electron-phonon coupling are favorable with regard to AC spin-polarized transport.

Title: On-chip magnon polaron generation in mode-matched cavity magnomechanics
Authors: Daiki Hatanaka, Motoki Asano, Megumi Kurosu, Yoshitaka Taniyasu, Hajime Okamoto, Hiroshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: Generation of magnon polarons, which are hybridized states resulting from strong magnon-phonon coupling, is a key to enabling coherent manipulation in acoustic and spintronic devices. However, the conventional device configuration, a magnetic thin film on a thick piezoelectric layer, often has difficulty achieving a large magnon-phonon coupling due to a very small spatial mode overlap. Here, we demonstrate generation of magnon polarons by using a mode-matched on-chip magnomechanical system. A configuration with a thin piezoelectric film on a magnetic layer several micrometers thick was found to sustain deeply distributed magnon modes that enable magnetoelastic coupling to phonons over almost the entire mode volume. The enhanced spatial mode overlap generated magnon polarons whose spectra showed distinct avoided crossing. This magnomechanical system will facilitate utilization of coherent magnon-phonon conversion and their hybrid states in functional phononic devices.

Title: Numerical investigation of the equilibrium Kauzmann transition in a two-dimensional atomistic glass
Authors: Gerhard Jung, Misaki Ozawa, Giulio Biroli, Ludovic Berthier
Abstract: Dense liquids gradually transform into non-equilibrium amorphous solids as they pass through the experimental glass transition. Experimentally, ergodicity is lost because measurements are conducted within a finite time window. More than seventy years ago, Kauzmann posed a fundamental question: If experiments could run indefinitely, would there exist a critical temperature at which an ergodicity-breaking phase transition occurs? Random first-order transitions represent the modern theoretical framework for this idea, rigorously established in the mean-field limit of high-dimensional atomistic systems and several idealized physical models. However, achieving theoretical understanding in finite dimensions is challenging, while experimental and numerical limitations on accessible timescales hinder direct observation of the putative Kauzmann transition. Here, we overcome this longstanding barrier by developing a computational strategy that combines three advanced Monte Carlo methods to access the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional atomistic glass-former down to zero temperature across a range of system sizes. This enables us to directly measure thermodynamic and structural observables that provide unambiguous evidence that the system undergoes a Kauzmann transition at a temperature that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. This transition is towards an ideal glass state characterized by a complex energy landscape with a hierarchical organization of low-lying states. Our results are the first demonstration that computer simulations can fully probe the statistical mechanics of the bulk transition to a non-ergodic glass state. We anticipate that our study will serve as a foundation for future simulation work on larger systems, three-dimensional materials, and more complex glass-forming models to fully elucidate the nature of the glass state of matter.

Title: Andreev bound state spectroscopy of a quantum-dot-based Aharonov-Bohm interferometer with superconducting terminals
Authors: Peter Zalom, Don Rolih, Rok Žitko
Abstract: We analytically and numerically investigate an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer with two superconducting terminals and a strongly correlated quantum dot in one arm. Through a rigorous derivation, we prove that this double-path interferometer is spectrally equivalent to a simpler system: an interacting quantum dot coupled to a non-interacting side-coupled proximitized mode and a semiconductor lead. This equivalence reveals a simple interpretation of the interferometer's behavior through the competition of a geometric factor $\chi$, a key parameter characterizing the anomalous part of the hybridization function, with the properties of the side-coupled mode. We identify the conditions for the formation of doublet chimney in the phase diagrams in more general setting. Moreover, we show how the obtained Andreev bound state spectra clearly indicate the presence of Josephson diode effect generated by interferometric phenomena.

Title: Local entropy production rate of run-and-tumble particles
Authors: Matteo Paoluzzi, Andrea Puglisi, Luca Angelani
Abstract: We study the local entropy production rate and the local entropy flow in active systems composed of non-interacting run-and-tumble particles in a thermal bath. After providing generic time-dependend expressions, we focus on the stationary regime. Remarkably, in this regime the two entropies are equal and depend only on the distribution function and its spatial derivatives. We discuss in details two case studies, relevant to real situations. First, we analyze the case of space dependent speed,describing photokinetic bacteria, cosidering two different shapes of the speed, piecewise constant and sinusoidal. Finally, we investigate the case of external force fields, focusing on harmonic and linear potentials, which allow analytical treatment. In all investigated cases, we compare exact and approximated analytical results with numerical simulations.

Title: Effect of alloying additions on the lattice ordering of Ti$_2$AlNb intermetallic
Authors: Adilakshmi Chirumamilla, Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam
Abstract: Alloys based on the orthorhombic-Ti$_2$AlNb intermetallic phase (O-phase) are promising materials for high-temperature applications in jet engines, given that they can potentially replace Ni-based superalloys in some operating regions of the engines. However, the O-phase is prone to lattice disordering at high temperatures, primarily via anti-site defect formation across the Ti and Nb sites, which can reduce the material's creep resistance and high-temperature tensile properties, necessitating the need to identify strategies to mitigate the disorder. Here, we focus on identifying suitable alloying additions to suppress the disordering of the O-phase using density functional theory and nudged elastic band calculations. Specifically, we consider six different alloying additions, namely, V, Cr, Fe, Mo, Ta, and W, and examine their role in the thermodynamics of anti-site formation and the kinetics of atomic diffusion. Upon verifying the ground state structure and formation energy of Ti$_2$AlNb, we observe the proclivity of all alloying elements (except V) to occupy the Nb site in the O-phase structure. Subsequently, we find that none of the alloying additions can effectively suppress anti-site formation in Ti$_2$AlNb, highlighting the unfavourable thermodynamics. However, we find that Mo and W additions to Ti$_2$AlNb can kinetically suppress the disorder by reducing the diffusivities of Ti and Nb, by $\approx$4$\times$ and 8$\times$ compared to the pristine O-phase, respectively, at an operating temperature of 823 K. Thus, Mo and W additions represent a promising strategy to improve the creep resistance of Ti$_2$AlNb-based alloys.

Title: Vanadium-doped HfO$_2$, multiferroic uncompromised
Authors: Vincenzo Fiorentini, Paola Alippi, Gianaurelio Cuniberti
Abstract: Ab initio density-functional calculations show that orthorhombic Pca21 hafnia HfO2 mixed with vanadium at low concentration is a ferroelectric and ferromagnetic insulator. The multiorbital degeneracy of singly-occupied V states in the nominally 4+ ionic state is broken by magnetism, reduced symmetry, and local distortion, causing a single one-electron majority state per V atom to be occupied. A gap of order 1 eV thus survives at all V concentrations, and intrinsic polarization is preserved, at the level of two-thirds the hafnia value. Ferromagnetic magnetization is found to increase linearly with V content, with values of 30-40 emu/cm3 at concentrations near the end of the stability range.

Title: Wavefunction textures in twisted bilayer graphene from first principles
Authors: Albert Zhu, Daniel Bennett, Daniel T. Larson, Mohammed M. Al Ezzi, Efstratios Manousakis, Efthimios Kaxiras
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments probing the wavefunctions of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we perform large-scale first-principles calculations of tBLG with full atomic relaxation across a wide range of twist angles down to $0.99^\circ$. Focusing on the magic angle, we compute wavefunctions of the low energy bands, resolving atomic-scale details and moiré-scale patterns that form triangular, honeycomb, and Kagome lattices. By tuning the interlayer interactions, we illustrate the formation of the flat bands from isolated monolayers and the emergence of the band inversion and fragile topology at a sufficiently large interaction strength. We identify strong indicators of a new topological phase transition with increasing interlayer interaction strength, achievable with external pressure or a decrease in the twist angle. When this transition occurs, the upper and lower flat bands exchange their wavefunction character, which may explain why superconductivity appears with electron doping below the magic angle. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using first-principles wavefunctions to help interpret experimental signatures of topological and correlated phases in tBLG.

Title: Numerical and data-driven modeling of spall failure in polycrystalline ductile materials
Authors: Indrashish Saha, Lori Graham-Brady
Abstract: Developing materials with tailored mechanical performance requires iteration over a large number of proposed designs. When considering dynamic fracture, experiments at every iteration are usually infeasible. While high-fidelity, physics-based simulations can potentially reduce experimental efforts, they remain computationally expensive. As a faster alternative, key dynamic properties can be predicted directly from microstructural images using deep-learning surrogate models. In this work, the spallation of ductile polycrystals under plate-impact loading at strain rates of O(10^6 s^-1) is considered. A physics-based numerical model that couples crystal plasticity and a cohesive zone model is used to generate data for the surrogate models. Three architectures - 3D U-Net, 3D Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-3D), and U-FNO were trained on the particle-velocity field data from the numerical model. The generalization of the models was evaluated using microstructures with varying grain sizes and aspect ratios. U-FNO and 3D U-Net performed significantly better than FNO-3D across all datasets. Furthermore, U-FNO and 3D U-Net exhibited comparable accuracy for every metric considered in this study. However, training the U-FNO requires almost twice the computational effort compared to the 3D U-Net, making it a desirable option for a surrogate model.

Title: Enhanced molecular diffusion near a soft fluctuating membrane
Authors: Ali Mohammadi, Zhen Li, Sophie Marbach, Micheline Abbas
Abstract: Particles diffusing near interfaces face anisotropic resistance to motion due to hydrodynamic interactions. While this has been extensively studied near \textit{hard} interfaces since the works of Lorentz and Brenner, our understanding of diffusion near \textit{soft, thermally fluctuating} interfaces remains limited. Previous studies have predominantly focused on particles much larger than the molecular scale at which thermal fluctuations become important. In this work, we numerically investigate the dynamics of individual solvent molecules near a thermally fluctuating lipid membrane, a canonical soft interface in biology. We observe that diffusive motion of solvent molecules near the fluctuating membrane is slightly enhanced compared to a flat rigid interface and significantly more so than near an undulated rigid interface. This enhancement in diffusive motion of solvent molecules arises from spontaneous momentum exchanges between the moving membrane and adjacent molecules, promoting mixing. Notably, this dispersion effect overcomes geometric trapping that slows diffusion near the rigid undulated interface. Our analysis reveals that the momentum transfer near the fluctuating membrane is so efficient that it resembles an effective slip boundary condition over a length scale equal to the fluctuation height. These molecular-scale mechanisms differ from those of larger particles, where hydrodynamic memory and elasticity effects can be at play as they relax over timescales comparable to significant diffusive motion. Our findings advance understanding of enhanced diffusive motion and promoted mixing near soft fluctuating membranes involved in diverse biological processes and soft-matter technologies containing natural and model cell membranes.

Title: Entropy production and statistical relaxation of dipolar bosons and fermions in interaction quench dynamics
Authors: Barnali Chakrabarti, N D Chavda, F.V. Prudente
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of dipolar bosons and fermions after a sudden change in the interaction strength from zero to a finite repulsive value. We simulate the interaction quench on the initial state which is the ground state of harmonic potential with noninteracting bosons and fermions. We solve the time-dependent many-boson Schrödinger equation exactly using numerical methods. To understand the many-body dynamics we analyze several measures of many-body information entropy, monitoring their time evolution and assessing their dependence on interaction strength. We establish that for weak interaction quench the dynamics is statistics independent, both dipolar bosons and fermions do not relax. Whereas it is significantly different for dipolar bosons from that of dipolar fermions in the stronger interaction quench. When dipolar bosons exhibit concurrent signature of relaxation in all entropy measures, dipolar fermions fail to relax. For dipolar bosons and for larger interaction quench, the many-body information entropy measures dynamically approach the value predicted for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices, implying statistical relaxation. The relaxation time is uniquely determined when the orbital fragmentation exhibits a $1/M$ population in each orbital ($M$ is the number of orbitals) and all entropy measures saturate to the maximum entropy values. The relaxation time also becomes independent of the strength of dipolar interaction. Whereas, for the same quench protocol, dipolar fermions exhibit modulated oscillations in all entropy dynamics. Our study is also complemented by the measures of delocalization in Hilbert space, clearly establishing the onset of chaos for strongly interacting dipolar bosons. It highlights the importance of many-body effects with a possible exploration in quantum simulation with ultracold atoms.

Title: Thermodynamic bounds and symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents
Authors: Adarsh Raghu, Izaak Neri
Abstract: We develop a method for deriving thermodynamic bounds for first-passage problems of currents with two boundaries. Using this method, we extend some results on first-passage times of fluctuating currents. Notably, we derive a thermodynamic bound on the rate of dissipation of a Markov process in terms of the splitting probabilities and the first-passage time statistics of a fluctuating current, which is a refinement of a previously derived inequality. We also show that the concept of effective affinity, originally developed for continuous-time Markov chains, naturally extends to discrete-time Markov chains. Furthermore, we analyse symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents with two boundaries. We show that optimal currents -- those for which the effective affinity fully accounts for the dissipation -- satisfy a symmetry property: the current's average speed to reach the positive threshold equals the current's speed to reach the negative threshold. The developed approach uses a coarse-graining procedure for the average entropy production at random times and utilises martingale methods to perform time-reversal of first-passage quantities.

Title: Kappa distributions in the language of superstatistics
Authors: Sergio Davis, Biswajit Bora, Cristian Pavez, Leopoldo Soto
Abstract: The kappa distribution of velocities appears routinely in the study of collisionless plasmas present in Earth's magnetosphere, the solar wind among other contexts where particles are unable to reach thermal equilibrium. Originally justified through the use of Tsallis' non-extensive statistics, nowadays there are alternative frameworks that provide insight into these distributions, such as superstatistics. In this work we review the derivation of the multi-particle and single-particle kappa distributions for collisionless plasmas within the framework of superstatistics, as an alternative to the use of non-extensive statistics. We also show the utility of the superstatistical framework in the computation of expectation values under kappa distributions. Some consequences of the superstatistical formalism regarding correlations, temperature and entropy of kappa-distributed plasmas are also discussed.

Title: Direct signatures of Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in nonequilibrium quantum dots
Authors: Sarath Sankar, Joshua Folk, Yigal Meir, Eran Sela
Abstract: We propose schemes for unambiguous direct observation of Anderson orthogonality catastrophe (AOC) effects in a quantum dot coupled to a charge detector, and to estimate the strength of the AOC exponent $\alpha$. We show that certain easy-to-measure observables have a robust dependence on $\alpha$ in the non-equilibrium regimes of source-drain voltage bias or thermal imbalance. Our results are obtained using a rate equation formalism in which the AOC effects on tunnel rates are incorporated in an exact manner.

Title: Topological defects govern plasticity and shear band formation in two-dimensional amorphous solids
Authors: Xin Wang, Jin Shang, Yujie Wang, Jie Zhang, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental mechanisms behind plastic instabilities and shear band formation in amorphous media under applied deformation remains a long-standing challenge. Leveraging on the mathematical concept of topology, we revisit this problem using two-dimensional experimental amorphous granular packings subjected to pure shear. We demonstrate that topological defects (TDs) in the displacement vector field act as carriers of plasticity, enabling the prediction of both the onset of plastic flow and the global mechanical response of the system. At the microscopic level, we show that these TDs are responsible for the dynamical breakdown of local orientational order, thereby linking topological excitations to short-range structural changes. Finally, we establish that the spatial localization and cooperative alignment of TDs underlie the formation of macroscopic shear bands, which drive plastic flow under large shear loads. This process is mediated by the quasi-periodic annihilation of large defect clusters and their geometric transformation from an approximately isotropic to a strongly anisotropic shape. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding plastic deformation and shear band formation in two-dimensional amorphous systems by connecting topology, short-range order, and mechanical response.

Title: Domain-wall melting and entanglement in free-fermion chains with a band structure
Authors: Viktor Eisler
Abstract: We study the melting of a domain wall in free-fermion chains, where the periodic variation of the hopping amplitudes gives rise to a band structure. It is shown that the entanglement grows logarithmically in time, and the prefactor is proportional to the number of filled bands in the initial state. For a dimerized chain the particle density and current are found to have the same expressions as in the homogeneous case, up to a rescaling of the velocity. The universal contribution to the entropy profile is then doubled, while the non-universal part can be extracted numerically from block-Toeplitz matrices.

Title: Implantation studies of low-energy positive muons in niobium thin films
Authors: Ryan M. L. McFadden, Andreas Suter, Leon Ruf, Angelo Di Bernardo, Arnold M. Müller, Thomas Prokscha, Zaher Salman, Tobias Junginger
Abstract: Here we study the range of keV positive muons $\mu^+$ implanted in Nb$_2$O$_5$($x$ nm)/Nb($y$ nm)/SiO$_2$(300 nm)/Si [$x$ = 3.6 nm, 3.3 nm; $y$ = 42.0 nm, 60.1 nm] thin films using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR). At implantation energies 1.3 keV $\leq E \leq$ 23.3 keV, we compare the measured diamagnetic $\mu^+$ signal fraction $f_{\mathrm{dia.}}$ against predictions derived from implantation profile simulations using the this http URL Monte Carlo code. Treating the implanted $\mu^+$ as light protons, we find that simulations making use of updated stopping cross section data are in good agreement with the LE-$\mu$SR measurements, in contrast to parameterizations found in earlier tabulations. Implications for other studies relying on accurate $\mu^+$ stopping information are discussed.

Title: Short-Range Ordering and Lattice Distortions in Entropy-Stabilized Oxides
Authors: Bo Jiang, De-Ye Lin, Gerald R. Bejger, Stephen C. Purdy, Yuanpeng Zhang, Xin Wang, Jon-Paul Maria, Christina M. Rost, Katharine Page
Abstract: Entropy-stabilized oxides (ESOs), driven by high configurational entropy, have gained phenomenological research interest due to their potential for tailoring structure property relationships. However, the chemical short range ordering (SRO) and its interplay with local lattice distortion (LD) remain to be explored, although they could diminish the configurational entropy and potentially impact structure property relationships. A combination of experimental and theoretical approaches are employed to investigate the SRO and LD in the prototype ESO, Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O, generally referred to as J14. We demonstrate that the efficiency and accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) relaxed special quasirandom structures (SQS) enhances the analysis of the local structure of J14, unveiling the unique local cationic environments. Importantly, this joint experimental and computational approach sheds light on the understanding of local structure and structure property relationships in J14, demonstrating the necessity for further research into other high entropy and compositionally complex materials.

Title: Thermodynamics of analogue black holes in a non-Hermitian tight-binding model
Authors: D.F. Munoz-Arboleda, M. Stålhammar, C. Morais Smith
Abstract: We present a non-Hermitian model with gain/loss and non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbor hopping that emulates black-hole physics. The model describes a one-dimensional lattice with a smooth connection between regions with distinct hopping parameters. By mapping the system to an effective Schwarzschild metric in the Painlevé-Gullstrand coordinates, we find that the interface is analogue to a black-hole event horizon. We obtain emission rates for particles and antiparticles, the Hawking temperature, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the mass of the analogue black hole as a function of the interface sharpness and the system parameters. An experimental realization of the theoretical model is proposed, thus opening the way to the detection of elusive black-hole features.

Title: Multicolor groups for molecules and solids
Authors: Hai-Yang Ma, Shihao Zhang, Hu Xu, Shengbai Zhang, Jin-Feng Jia
Abstract: Just like we classify lions and tigers into the same panthera, but into different species, we can classify molecules and solids by their spatial and spin space symmetries. In magnetic molecules and solids, local moments of the atoms can be represented by different colors; we can therefore classify these materials by playing with colors. The advantage of the multicolor group scheme is that it unifies the classifications into a single framework through multicolor group theory, including the recently identified altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. In particular, non-magnetic compounds fall into 0-color groups, ferro/ferrimagnets fall into 1-color groups, antiferromagnets, as usual, fall into 2-color groups, and non-collinear magnets fall into the simple and complex multicolor groups. Moreover, confusions brought about by conventional magnetic-group classification can be resolved through this new framework.

Title: High Temperature Superconductivity Dominated by Inner Underdoped CuO$_2$ Planes in Quadruple-Layer Cuprate (Cu,C)Ba$_2$Ca$_3$Cu$_4$O$_{11+δ}$
Authors: Xingtian Sun, Suppanut Sangphet, Nan Guo, Yu Fan, Yutong Chen, Minyinan Lei, Xue Ming, Xiyu Zhu, Hai-Hu Wen, Haichao Xu, Rui Peng, Donglai Feng
Abstract: The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) of trilayer or quadruple-layer cuprates typically surpasses that of single-layer or bilayer systems. This observation is often interpreted within the ``composite picture", where strong proximity effect between inner CuO$_2$ planes (IPs) and outer CuO$_2$ planes (OPs) is crucial. Albeit intriguing, a straightforward scrutinization of this composite picture is still lacking. In this study, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate (Cu,C)Ba$_2$Ca$_3$Cu$_4$O$_{11+\delta}$ (CuC-1234) with a high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of 110~K, we found that the OPs are not superconducting at the $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of the material. Instead, the large pairing strength and phase coherence concurrently emerge at the underdoped IPs, suggesting that the high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ is primarily driven by these underdoped IPs. Given that the $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of CuC-1234 is comparable to other trilayer or quadruple-layer cuprates, our findings suggest that the conventional ``composite picture" is not universally required for achieving high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$. More importantly, we demonstrate that CuO$_2$ planes free of apical oxygen can support superconductivity up to 110~K even at a doping level of 0.07 holes per Cu, a level that lies deep in the underdoped regime of single- and bilayer cuprates. These findings provide new insights into the origin of high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in multilayer cuprates.

Title: Hyperuniform interfaces in non-equilibrium phase coexistence
Authors: Raphaël Maire, Leonardo Galliano, Andrea Plati, Ludovic Berthier
Abstract: We show that long-wavelength interfacial fluctuations are strongly suppressed in non-equilibrium phase coexistence between bulk hyperuniform systems. Using simulations of three distinct microscopic models, we demonstrate that hyperuniform interfaces are much smoother than equilibrium ones, with a universal reduction of height fluctuations at large scale. We derive a non-equilibrium interface equation from the field theory of the bulk order parameter, and predict a reduction in height fluctuations, $S_h(\boldsymbol k)\equiv \langle |h(\boldsymbol k)|^2\rangle\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-1}$, in stark contrast to equilibrium capillary wave theory where $S_h(\boldsymbol k)\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-2}$. Our results establish a new universality class for non-equilibrium interfaces, highlighting the fundamental role of suppressed bulk fluctuations in shaping interfacial dynamics far from equilibrium.

Title: Rigid Spheres Rising at Constant Speed Through Collections of Hydrogels
Authors: Tom Mullin, Tommaso Pettinari, Joshua A. Dijksman
Abstract: We present the results of an experimental investigation into buoyant rigid spheres rising through concentrated collections of hydrated hydrogel particles. The volume fraction of particles is such that the mechanical properties of the material are intermediate between a very viscous fluid and a soft solid. Despite the non-Newtonian character of these hydrogels, we find that when the surface of the material is free, an immersed buoyant sphere rises with a constant speed. The effects of the motion in the surrounding material are observed to be highly localized around the sphere. When the mass of the sphere is varied, its terminal velocity is observed to depend exponentially on the buoyancy. Qualitatively distinct behavior is found when a lid is present on the surface of the material, and in this case, a sublinear time dependence of the displacement is found. Linear motion of the sphere is accompanied by flow at the surface of the material whereas fluid movement is suppressed when a lid is applied. Other boundary condition variations are consistent with the perspective that constant speed motion is induced by the presence of a free boundary.

Title: Polariton transport in 2D semiconductors: Phonon-mediated transitions between ballistic, superdiffusive and exciton-limited regimes
Authors: Jamie M. Fitzgerald, Roberto Rosati, Ermin Malic
Abstract: Exciton transport in 2D semiconductors holds promise for room-temperature, ultra-compact optoelectronic devices, but it is limited by short propagation distances. Hybridization of excitons with cavity photons to form exciton-polaritons can enhance the propagation by orders of magnitude, enabling a coherent, ballistic transport. However, a microscopic understanding of the role of phonons is still lacking, particularly regarding their influence on the crossover from the ballistic to the diffusive polariton transport regime. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal polariton dynamics in \ce{MoSe2} monolayers at moderate to high temperatures, explicitly including the phonon-mediated coupling to the intervalley exciton reservoir. We identify three distinct transport regimes: (i) an initial sub-ps ballistic-like regime characterized by a phonon-induced velocity renormalization, (ii) a transient, few-ps superdiffusive regime characterized by strongly enhanced diffusion, and (iii) a slower, exciton-limited diffusion following thermalization. The gained microscopic insights will trigger and guide future experimental studies on the phonon-mediated polariton transport in atomically thin semiconductors.

Title: Ferroelectrically Switchable Half-Quantized Hall Effect
Authors: M. U. Muzaffar, Kai-Zhi Bai, Wei Qin, Guohua Cao, Bo Fu, Ping Cui, Shun-Qing Shen, Zhenyu Zhang
Abstract: Integrating ferroelectricity, antiferromagnetism, and topological quantum transport within a single material is rare, but crucial for developing next-generation quantum devices. Here, we propose a multiferroic heterostructure consisting of an antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer and an Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film is able to harbor the half-quantized Hall (HQH) effect with a ferroelectrically switchable Hall conductivity of $e^2/2h$. We first show that, in the energetically stable configuration, the antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer opens a gap in the top surface bands of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ through proximity effect, while its bottom surface bands remain gapless; consequently, HQH conductivity of $e^2/2h$ can be sustained clockwise or counterclockwise depending on antiferromagnetic configuration of the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Remarkably, when applying interlayer sliding within the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer, its electric polarization direction associated with parity-time reversal symmetry breaking is reversed, accompanied by a reversal of the HQH conductivity. The proposed approach offers a powerful route to control topological quantum transport in antiferromagnetic materials by ferroelectricity.

Title: On-Device Control of Electronic Friction
Authors: Zhaokuan Yu, Jinbo Bian, Jin Wang, Zonghuiyi Jiang, Linxin Zhai, Xin Lu, Xiaofei Liu, Quanshui Zheng, Zhiping Xu
Abstract: Friction causes mechanical energy dissipation and material degradation in machinery and devices. While phononic friction is well understood via anharmonic lattice dynamics, the physics of electronic friction remains unclear due to challenges in separating electronic degrees of freedom from phononic ones in experiments and analyzing the non-equilibrium interactions between ionic movement and electronic dynamics in theory. To tackle this problem, we construct a sliding device featuring 2D crystalline interfaces that possess ultra-smooth and minimally interacting surfaces, achieving the state of structural superlubricity with no wear and minimal friction. Using electrical and mechanical controls, we tuned the nature of interfacial electronic coupling and charge densities in materials in an on-device setting, which allows us to disentangle the electron and phonon contributions to friction. Our experimental data and theoretical analysis supported by first-principles calculations demonstrate that electronic friction can well surpass phononic contributions and dominate energy dissipation at structural superlubricity contacts. These findings offer fresh insights into the mechanism of electronic friction and promising opportunities for friction control in device applications.

Title: Prediction of High-Temperature Half Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in a Semi-magnetic Topological Insulator of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Sb$_2$Te$_3$
Authors: M. U. Muzaffar, Kai-Zhi Bai, Wei Qin, Guohua Cao, Yutong Yang, Shunhong Zhang, Ping Cui, Shun-Qing Shen, Zhenyu Zhang
Abstract: The classic Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs theorem dictates that a single electron band of a lattice can only harbor an integer quantum Hall conductance as a multiple of e^2/2h, while recent studies have pointed to the emergence of half quantum anomalous Hall (HQAH) effect, though the underlying microscopic mechanisms remain controversial. Here we propose an ideal platform of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Sb$_2$Te$_3$ that allows not only to realize the HQAH effect at much higher temperatures, but also to critically assess the different contributions of the gapped and gapless Dirac bands. We first show that the top surface bands of the Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film become gapped, while the bottom surface bands remain gapless due to proximity coupling with the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ overlayer. Next we show that such a semi-magnetic topological insulator harbors the HQAH effect at ~20 K, with Cr doping enhancing it to as high as 67 K, driven by large magnetic anisotropy and strong magnetic coupling constants that raise the Curie temperature. Our detailed Berry curvature analysis further helps to reveal that, whereas the gapped surface bands can contribute to the Hall conductance when the chemical potential is tuned to overlap with the bands, these bands have no net contribution when the chemical potential is in the gapped region, leaving the gapless bands to be the sole contributor to the HQAH conductance. Counterintuitively, the part of the gapless bands within the gapped region of the top surface bands have no net contribution, thereby ensuring the plateau nature of the Hall conductance.

Title: Non-reciprocal spin-wave excitations in Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnets
Authors: Aastha Jain, Dheeraj Kumar Singh
Abstract: We explore the nonreciprocity of spin-wave excitations in the Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnet within the random-phase approximation. We find that the non-reciprocal behavior arises only when the magnetic moments are aligned in-plane and not out-of-plane. Furthermore, the spin-wave excitations exhibit non-reciprocal behavior in a direction in the momentum space reciprocal to an in-plane direction perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic moments. In that case, the first dominating term in the low-energy dispersion is linear. However, if the magnetic moments are out-of-plane, then the first dominant term is quadratic instead. The low-energy non-quadratic behavior is examined in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime for various strengths of Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Transient segregation of bi-disperse granular mixtures in a periodic chute flow
Authors: Soniya Kumawat, Vishnu Kumar Sahu, Anurag Tripathi
Abstract: Transient size segregation of a bi-disperse granular mixture flowing over a periodic chute is studied using the Discrete Element Method and continuum simulations. A recently developed particle force-based size segregation model is used to predict the time-dependent flow properties of binary mixtures starting from rest. A two-way coupled continuum model that solves the momentum balance and convection-diffusion equations by incorporating the mixture segregation model along with the generalized inertial number-based rheological model is developed for predicting the evolution of segregation. The predicted concentration profiles and other flow properties of the mixture are found to be in good agreement with the DEM data for a variety of compositions. The evolution of the centre of mass of the two species with time is also very well captured for different initial configurations and size ratios using the particle force-based segregation model.

Title: Specific heat and density anomalies in the Hubbard model
Authors: M. A. Habitzreuter, Willdauany C. de Freitas Silva, Eduardo O. Rizzatti, Thereza Paiva, Marcia C. Barbosa
Abstract: Understanding thermal properties of materials is fundamental to technological applications and to discover new phenomena. In particular, advances of experimental techniques such as cold-atoms measurements allow the simulation of paradigmatic Hamiltonians with great control over model parameters, such as the Fermi-Hubbard model. One aspect of this model which is not much explored is the behavior of the specific heat as function of density. In this work, we perform Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model to analyze the specific heat as the filling, interaction and temperature of the system is changed. We found that, with strong correlations, the specific heat presents a three-maxima structure as a function of filling, with local minima between them. This effect can be explained by a decomposition of kinetic and potential contributions to the specific heat. Moreover, by analyzing the kinetic contribution in momentum space we show that, connected to this specific heat behavior, there is a density anomaly detected through the thermal expansion coefficient. These momentum-space quantities are accessible using cold-atoms experiments. Finally, we map the location of these phenomena and connect the thermal expansion anomaly with the well-known Seebeck coefficient change of sign. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze this change of sign. Moreover, our specific heat results demonstrate interesting phenomena away from the commonly studied half-filling regime.

Title: Microscopy of Ultracold Fermions in Optical Lattices
Authors: Waseem S. Bakr, Zengli Ba, Max L. Prichard
Abstract: These lecture notes review recent progress in studying the Fermi-Hubbard model using ultracold gases in optical lattices. We focus on results from quantum gas microscope experiments that have allowed site-resolved measurements of charge and spin correlations in half-filled and doped Hubbard systems, as well as direct imaging of various types of polaronic quasiparticles. We also review experiments exploring dynamical properties of the Hubbard model through transport and spectroscopy. Moving beyond the plain-vanilla square-lattice Hubbard model, we present more recent work exploring Hubbard systems with novel lattice geometries and long-range interactions that stabilize new phases. Finally, we discuss the realization of entropy distribution protocols to cool these systems to ultralow temperatures where comparison to unbiased numerics is no longer possible.

Title: TopoMAS: Large Language Model Driven Topological Materials Multiagent System
Authors: Baohua Zhang, Xin Li, Huangchao Xu, Zhong Jin, Quansheng Wu, Ce Li
Abstract: Topological materials occupy a frontier in condensed-matter physics thanks to their remarkable electronic and quantum properties, yet their cross-scale design remains bottlenecked by inefficient discovery workflows. Here, we introduce TopoMAS (Topological materials Multi-Agent System), an interactive human-AI framework that seamlessly orchestrates the entire materials-discovery pipeline: from user-defined queries and multi-source data retrieval, through theoretical inference and crystal-structure generation, to first-principles validation. Crucially, TopoMAS closes the loop by autonomously integrating computational outcomes into a dynamic knowledge graph, enabling continuous knowledge refinement. In collaboration with human experts, it has already guided the identification of novel topological phases SrSbO3, confirmed by first-principles calculations. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate robust adaptability across base Large Language Model, with the lightweight Qwen2.5-72B model achieving 94.55% accuracy while consuming only 74.3-78.4% of tokens required by Qwen3-235B and 83.0% of DeepSeek-V3's usage--delivering responses twice as fast as Qwen3-235B. This efficiency establishes TopoMAS as an accelerator for computation-driven discovery pipelines. By harmonizing rational agent orchestration with a self-evolving knowledge graph, our framework not only delivers immediate advances in topological materials but also establishes a transferable, extensible paradigm for materials-science domain.

Title: Characterization of fractional Chern insulator quasiparticles in moiré transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Zhao Liu, Bohao Li, Fengcheng Wu
Abstract: We provide a detailed study of Abelian quasiparticles of valley polarized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) residing in the top valence band of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) at hole filling $\nu_h=2/3$. We construct a tight-binding model of delocalized quasiparticles to capture the energy dispersion of a single quasiparticle. We then localize quasiparticles by short-range delta impurity potentials. Unlike the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) counterpart in the lowest Landau level (LLL), the density profile around the localized FCI quasiparticle in tMoTe$_2$ depends on the location of the impurity potential and loses the continuous rotation invariance. The FCI quasiparticle localized at moiré lattice center closely follows the anyon Wannier state of the tight-binding model of the mobile quasiparticle. Despite of the difference in density profiles, we find that the excess charge around the impurity potential for the $\nu_h=2/3$ FCIs in tMoTe$_2$ is still similar to that of the $\nu=2/3$ FQH state in the LLL if an effective magnetic length on the moiré lattice is chosen as the length unit, which allows a rough estimation of the spatial extent of the FCI quasiparticle. Far away from the impurity potential, this excess charge has the tendency to reach $e/3$, as expected for the Laughlin quasiparticle. The braiding phase of two FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$ also agrees with the theoretical prediction of fractional statistics. Based on the nearly ideal quantum geometry of the top valence band of tMoTe$_2$, we propose a trial wave function for localized FCI quasiparticles, which reproduces the key feature of the density profile around a quasiparticle. We also discuss the effect of band mixing on FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$.

Title: Observation of Momentum-Band Topology in PT-Symmetric acoustic Floquet Lattices

Abstract: Momentum-band topology, which transcends conventional topological band theory, unlocks new topological phases that host fascinating temporal interface states. However, direct bulk experimental evidence of such emerging band topology is still lacking due to the great challenges in resolving eigenstates and topological invariants of time-varying systems. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the momentum-band topology in a PT-symmetric Floquet lattice, where the drive-induced momentum gap can be characterized by a quantized Berry phase in the energy Brillouin zone. Experimentally, we synthesize the Floquet lattice model using an acoustic cavity-tube structure coupled to custom-designed external circuits. By reconstructing the effective Hamiltonian, we extract the system's eigenstates and provide the first bulk evidence of momentum-band topology from the perspectives of band inversion and topological invariants. This is accompanied by an unambiguous observation of time-localized interface states in real physical time, thereby providing the boundary signature of the bulk topology. Our work paves the way for further experimental studies on the burgeoning momentum-gap physics.

Title: Time-Dependent Oxidative Degradation of WSe2 Nanosheets and Its Influence on HER Catalysis
Authors: Panwad Chavalekvirat, Wisit Hirunpinyopas, Pawin Iamprasertkun
Abstract: The selection of an appropriate solvent has long been a critical factor in the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (2D TMD) nanosheets. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) remains one of the most commonly used solvents due to its favourable surface tension compatibility, particularly with tungsten diselenide (WSe2), which facilitates a relatively high yield of exfoliated nanosheets. However, prolonged exposure of the nanosheets to NMP promotes oxidation, consequently diminishing their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In contrast, a more environmentally friendly solvent system, consisting of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionised water (DI), induces significantly less oxidation and results in enhanced HER performance. Notably, this green solvent system achieves the lowest overpotential of 0.209 V vs RHE after 24 hours of chronoamperometry.

Title: Absence of higher than 6-fold coordination in glassy $GeO_{2}$ up to 158 GPa revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy
Authors: João Elias F. S. Rodrigues, Angelika D. Rosa, Emin Mijit, Tetsuo Irifune, Gaston Garbarino, Olivier Mathon, Raffaella Torchio, Max Wilke
Abstract: Simple binary oxide glasses can exhibit a compression behavior distinct from that of their crystalline counterparts. In this study, we employed high-pressure X-ray absorption spectroscopy coupled to the diamond anvil cell to investigate in detail local structural changes around Ge in glassy $GeO_{2}$ up to 158 GPa. We conducted four independent runs, both with and without pressure-transmitting media. Up to 30 GPa, we observed no significant influence of the pressure medium on the pressure dependence of the $Ge-O$ bond length ($<R_{Ge-O}>$). Between 10 and 30 GPa, the evolution of $<R_{Ge-O}>$ shows substantial variability across our experiments and previous works. The measured values lie close to those reported for crystalline polymorphs, including the rutile- and $CaCl_{2}$-type phase of $GeO_{2}$. This finding suggests that the amorphous structure possesses considerable flexibility to transition among different atomic configurations. From 30 GPa to 158 GPa, our results for both $<R_{Ge-O}>$ and the non-bonded cation-cation distance $<R_{Ge...Ge}>$ demonstrate that edge-sharing octahedra remain the main structural motives in glassy $GeO_{2}$. Up to 100 GPa, compaction proceeds primarily via distortions of octahedral $O-Ge-O$ bond angles accompanied by octahedral bond shortening. Above 100 GPa, octahedral distortion becomes the prevailing mechanism. Compared to its crystalline analogues ($\alpha-PbO_{2}$ and pyrite-like phase), glassy $GeO_{2}$ exhibits a slightly less efficient compaction mechanism, likely due to kinetic constraints that inhibit reconstructive lattice rearrangements.

Title: Microscopic Origins of Conformable Dynamics: From Disorder to Deformation
Authors: José Weberszpil
Abstract: Conformable derivatives have attracted increasing interest for bridging classical and fractional calculus while retaining analytical tractability. However, their physical foundations remain underexplored. In this work, we provide a systematic derivation of conformable relaxation dynamics from microscopic principles. Starting from a spatially-resolved Ginzburg-Landau framework with quenched disorder and temperature-dependent kinetic coefficients, we demonstrate how spatial heterogeneity and energy barrier distributions give rise to emergent power-law memory kernels. In the adiabatic limit, these kernels reduce to a conformable temporal structure of the form T^{1-\mu}\,d\psi/dT. The deformation parameter \mu is shown to be connected to experimentally measurable properties such as transport coefficients, disorder statistics, and relaxation time spectra. This formulation also reveals a natural link with nonextensive thermodynamics and Tsallis entropy. By unifying memory effects, anomalous relaxation, and spatial correlations under a coherent physical mechanism, our framework transforms conformable derivatives from heuristic tools into physically grounded operators suitable for modeling complex critical dynamics.

Title: Longitudinal magnon transport properties in the easy-axis XXZ Heisenberg ferromagnet on the face-centered cubic lattice
Authors: M. R. Parymuda
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in the $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-axis exchange anisotropy ($\Delta>1$) on a face-centered cubic lattice consisting of four sublattices. We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.

Title: Effective behavior of heterogeneous media governed by strain gradient elasticity
Authors: Harkirat Singh, Mayank Raj, Kaushik Bhattacharya
Abstract: Various mechanical phenomena depend on the length scale, and these have inspired a variety of nonlocal and higher gradient continuum theories. Mechanistically, it is believed that the length scale dependence arises due to an interplay between the length scale of heterogeneities in the material, the length scale of the material being probed and the phenomenon under study. In this paper, we seek to understand this interplay in a simple setting by studying the overall behavior of a one-dimensional periodic medium governed by strain gradient elasticity at the microstructural scale. We find that the overall behavior is not described by a strain gradient elasticity. In other words, strain gradient theories are not invariant under averaging at this scale. We also find that the overall behavior may be described by a kernel-based nonlocal elasticity theory, and approximated locally by a fractional strain gradient elasticity. Consequently, one can obtain various scaling laws with exponent between zero (classical elasticity) and one (strain-gradient elasticity). We also learn the overall behavior using a Fourier neural operator.

Title: Phenomenological model of decaying Bose polarons
Authors: Ragheed Alhyder, Georg M. Bruun, Thomas Pohl, Mikhail Lemeshko, Artem G. Volosniev
Abstract: Cold atom experiments show that a mobile impurity particle immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate forms a well-defined quasiparticle (Bose polaron) for weak to moderate impurity-boson interaction strengths, whereas a significant line broadening is consistently observed for strong interactions. Motivated by this, we introduce a phenomenological theory based on the assumption that the most relevant states are characterized by the impurity correlated with at most one boson, since they have the largest overlap with the uncorrelated states to which the most common experimental probes couple. These experimentally relevant states can however decay to lower energy states characterised by correlations involving multiple bosons, and we model this using a minimal variational wave function combined with a complex impurity-boson interaction strength. We first motivate this approach by comparing to a more elaborate theory that includes correlations with up to two bosons. Our phenomenological model is shown to recover the main results of two recent experiments probing both the spectral and the non-equilibrium properties of the Bose polaron. Our work offers an intuitive framework for analyzing experimental data and highlights the importance of understanding the complicated problem of the Bose polaron decay in a many-body setting.

Title: Orbital mixing as key ingredient for magnetic order in a van der Waals ferromagnet
Authors: Alessandro De Vita, Srdjan Stavrić, Roberto Sant, Nicholas B. Brookes, Ivana Vobornik, Giancarlo Panaccione, Silvia Picozzi, Martin Wolf, Laurenz Rettig, Ralph Ernstorfer, Tommaso Pincelli
Abstract: Recent years have seen a vast increase in research onto van der Waals magnetic materials, due to the richness of many-body effects and the versatility for next-generation technologies. In many of these systems, magnetism is introduced via light 3\textit{d}-transition metal elements, combined with chalcogenides or halogens. Despite the high technological promise in the field of spintronics, the connection between the \textit{d}-wave orbital configuration and the occurrence of low-dimensional magnetic order is currently unclear. To solve this issue, here we address the prototypical two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI\textsubscript{3}, via complementary absorption and photoemission spectroscopies, and density functional theory calculations. We reveal the electronic structure and orbital character of bulk CrI\textsubscript{3} in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, describing the couplings underpinning its energy diagram, and demonstrating that the mechanism of stabilization of ferromagnetism in this material is attributable to the orbital mixing between I \textit{p} and Cr \textit{e\textsubscript{g}} states. These findings reveal the microscopic connection between orbital and spin degrees of freedom, providing fundamental insights that can be readily generalized to many other low-dimensional magnetic materials.

Title: Modeling of a twisted-Kagome HoAgGe spin ice using Reduced-Configuration-Space Search and Density Functional Theory
Authors: Gunnar F. Schwertfeger, Po-Hao Chang, Predrag Nikolic, Igor I. Mazin
Abstract: The Kagome lattice is a 2D network of corner sharing triangles found in several rare earth materials resulting in a complicated and often frustrated magnetic system. In the last decades, modifications of the motif, such as breathing Kagome, asymmetric Kagome, and twisted Kagome were brought into the limelight. In particular, the latter has lower symmetry than the original Kagome and thus allows implementations of an "Ising-local" Hamiltonian, leading to a 2D spin ice. One such material implementation, HoAgGe, was recently reported to have an exceptionally rich phase diagram and is a strongly frustrated 2D spin-ice material with a twisted-Kagome geometry. In the presence of an external magnetic field the compound exhibits step-like magnetization plateaus at simple fractions of the saturation magnetization. It is believed that this phenomenon results from strong single-site anisotropy, which in HoAgGe was found to be in-plane and along a high-symmetry direction. Previous Monte Carlo simulations with empirical exchange parameters explain some, but not all experimental observations. In this work we present (a) first-principle calculations of the crucial model parameters and (b) direct energy minimization via a Reduced-Configuration-Space search, as well as Monte-Carlo simulations of the field-dependent phase diagram. We find that for HoAgGe the calculated exchange parameters are very different from the earlier suggested empirical ones, and describe the phase diagram much more accurately. This is likely because the first-principles parameters are, in addition to geometrically, also parametrically frustrated.

Title: Electrons in quantum dots on helium: from charge qubits to synthetic color centers
Authors: M. I. Dykman, J. Pollanen
Abstract: Electrons trapped above the surface of helium provide a means to study many-body physics free from the randomness that comes from defects in other condensed-matter systems. Localizing an electron in an electrostatic quantum dot makes its energy spectrum discrete, with controlled level spacing. The lowest two states can act as charge qubit states. In this paper, we study how the coupling to the quantum field of capillary waves on helium -- ripplons -- affects electron dynamics. As we show, the coupling can be strong. This bounds the parameter range where electron-based charge qubits can be implemented. The constraint is different from the conventional relaxation time constraint. The electron-ripplon system in a dot is similar to a color center formed by an electron defect coupled to phonons in a solid. In contrast to solids, the coupling in the electron on helium system can be varied from strong to weak. This enables a qualitatively new approach to studying color center physics. We analyze the spectroscopy of the pertinent synthetic color centers in a broad range of the coupling strength

Title: Gate Voltage-Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy Effect on Pt-Porphyrin functionalized single-layer graphene
Authors: Ambika Shanker Shukla, Abhishek Erram, Heston Mendonca, Deepak Kumar, Akanksha Chouhan, Rachit Pandey, Ashwin A. Tulapurkar
Abstract: This report presents for the first time the investigation of a novel class of functionalized graphene showing a large Voltage Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy Effect (VCMA) with enhanced Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC), which holds promise for applications in Spintronics devices aimed at ultra-low power memory and logic functionalities. Our study was conducted at the interface of Single Layer chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method-grown graphene (SLG hereafter) grafted with Platinum(II) 5,10,15,30-(tetraphenyl) porphyrin (Pt-Porphyrin hereafter) and NiFe(Py hereafter). The stability of Pt-Porphyrin functionalized SLG at room temperature granted the execution of voltage-dependent Spin Torque Ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements. A substantial VCMA coefficient of 375.6 (fJV-1m-1) was determined at the interface, and the Spin torque efficiency ({\theta}sh) was improved by an order of one in functionalized graphene to compare with pristine SLG

Title: Thermal relaxation and the complete set of second order transport coefficients for the unitary Fermi gas from kinetic theory
Authors: Christian Hall, Thomas Schaefer
Abstract: We compute the complete set of second order transport coefficients of the unitary Fermi gas, a dilute gas of spin 1/2 particles interacting via an $s$-wave interaction tuned to infinite scattering length. The calculation is based on kinetic theory and the Chapman-Enskog method at second order in the Knudsen expansion. We take into account the exact two-body collision integral. We extend previous results on second order coefficients related to shear stress by including terms related to heat flow and gradients of the fugacity. We confirm that the thermal relaxation time is given by the simple estimate $\tau_\kappa = \kappa m/(c_PT)$ even if the full collision kernel is taken into account. Here, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $m$ is the mass of the particles, $c_P$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $T$ is the temperature.

Title: Unusual electronic structure in underdoped cuprate superconductors
Authors: Xiang Li, Minghuan Zeng, Huaiming Guo, Shiping Feng
Abstract: The underdoped cuprate superconductors are characterized by the opening of the pseudogap, while such an aspect of the pseudogap effect should be reflected in the low-energy electronic structure (LEES). Here the effect of the pseudogap on LEES in the underdoped cuprate superconductors is investigated within the kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity. The strong coupling of the electrons with the spin excitation induces the pseudogap-state in the particle-hole channel and superconducting (SC) state in the particle-particle channel, where the pseudogap and SC gap respectively originate from the electron normal and anomalous self-energies, and are evaluated by taking into account the vertex correction. As a natural consequence of the interplay between the pseudogap-state and SC-state, the SC transition temperature Tc exhibits a dome-like shape of the doping dependence, however, in a striking contrast to Tc in the underdoped regime, the pseudogap crossover temperature T* is much higher than Tc in the underdoped regime, and then it decreases with the increase of doping, eventually disappearing together with Tc at the end of the SC dome. Concomitantly, the spectral weight on the electron Fermi surface (EFS) at around the antinodal region is suppressed strongly by this pseudogap, and then EFS is truncated to form four disconnected Fermi arcs centered around the nodal region with the largest spectral weight located at around the tips of the disconnected Fermi arcs. Moreover, the dip in the peak-dip-hump structure observed in the energy distribution curve and checkerboard charge ordering found in the ARPES autocorrelation are intrinsically connected with the emergence of the pseudogap. The theory therefore indicates that the same spin excitation that governs both the pseudogap-state and SC-state naturally leads to the exotic features of LEES in the underdoped cuprate superconductors.

Title: Quantum Metric Enhancement and Hierarchical Scaling in One-Dimensional Quasiperiodic Systems
Authors: Jundi Wang, Yuxiao Chen, Huaqing Huang
Abstract: The quantum metric, a key component of quantum geometry, plays a central role in a wide range of physical phenomena and has been extensively studied in periodic crystals and moiré materials. Here, we systematically investigate quantum geometry in one-dimensional (1D) quasiperiodic systems and uncover novel properties that fundamentally distinguish them from both periodic crystals and disordered media. Our comparative analysis reveals that quasiperiodicity significantly enhances the quantum metric -- despite the absence of translational symmetry -- due to the presence of critical wavefunctions with long-range spatial correlations. In the Aubry-André-Harper model, we show that the quantum metric serves as a sensitive probe of localization transitions, exhibiting sharp changes at the critical point and distinct behaviors near mobility edges. In the Fibonacci chain, characterized by a singular continuous spectrum, we discover an anomalous enhancement of the quantum metric when the Fermi level lies within the minimal gaps of the fractal energy spectrum. Using a perturbative renormalization group framework, we trace this enhancement to the hierarchical structure of the spectrum and the bonding-antibonding nature of critical states across narrow gaps. Our findings establish a fundamental connection between wavefunction criticality, spectral fractality, and quantum geometry, suggesting quasiperiodic systems as promising platforms for engineering enhanced quantum geometric properties beyond conventional crystalline paradigms.

Title: Thermodynamics of quantum oscillators
Authors: Michel Caffarel
Abstract: In this work, we present a compact analytical approximation for the quantum partition function of systems composed of quantum oscillators. The proposed formula is general and applicable to an arbitrary number of oscillators described by a rather general class of potential energy functions (not necessarily polynomials). Starting from the exact path integral expression of the partition function, we introduce a time-dependent Gaussian approximation for the potential contribution and, then, invoke a principle of minimal sensitivity to minimize the error. This leads to a system of coupled nonlinear equations whose solution yields the optimal parameters of the gaussian approximation. The resulting approximate partition function accurately reproduces thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy, average energy, and specific heat -- even at zero temperature -- with typical errors of only a few percent. We illustrate the performance of our approximate formula with numerical results for systems of up to ten coupled anharmonic oscillators. These results are compared to "exact" numerical results obtained via Hamiltonian diagonalization for small systems and Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations for larger ones.

Title: Growth and prediction of plastic strain in metallic glasses
Authors: Tero Mäkinen, Anshul D. S. Parmar, Silvia Bonfanti, Mikko Alava
Abstract: Predicting the failure and plasticity of solids remains a longstanding challenge, with broad implications for materials design and functional reliability. Disordered solids like metallic glasses can fail either abruptly or gradually without clear precursors, and the mechanical response depends strongly on composition, thermal history and deformation protocol -- impeding generalizable modeling. While deep learning methods offer predictive power, they often rely on numerous input parameters, hindering interpretability, methodology advancement and practical deployment. Here, we propose a macroscopic, physically grounded approach that uses plastic strain accumulation in the elastic regime to robustly predict deformation and yield. This method reduces complexity and improves interpretability, offering a practical alternative for disordered materials. For the Cu-Zr-(Al) metallic glasses prepared with varied annealing, we identify two limiting regimes of plastic strain growth: power-law in poorly annealed and exponential in well-annealed samples. A physics-informed framework with Bayesian inference extracts growth parameters from stress-strain data within $\sim$5\% strain, enabling early prediction of bulk response and yield point, well before the failure. The predictive performance improves with annealing, and bulk plasticity correlates with the microscopic plastic activity from scattered to growth near yielding. This work presents a physically interpretable and experimentally relevant framework for predicting plasticity and failure in metallic glasses from early mechanical response, offering both theoretical insights and practical tools for material characterization and design.

Title: Spin-split magnon bands induce pure spin current in insulating altermagnets
Authors: Sankar Sarkar, Amit Agarwal
Abstract: Altermagnets offer a promising platform for dissipationless spin transport by combining zero net magnetization with spontaneous non-relativistic spin splitting. However, their magnonic transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we develop a quantum-kinetic theory for thermally driven magnon currents that cleanly separates Berry-curvature-driven intrinsic contributions from Drude-like scattering-dependent terms. Applying this framework to a collinear honeycomb antiferromagnet with anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we reveal spin-split magnon bands that support both intrinsic and extrinsic spin Nernst and Seebeck currents. For realistic parameters, we predict a sizable magnon spin-splitting angle (about 3.3 degrees) and a pure transverse spin current capable of exerting a strong spin-splitter torque suitable for magnetization switching.

Title: Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with Quantic Tensor Trains: Ground States and Nonlinear Dynamics
Authors: Qian-Can Chen, I-Kang Liu, Jheng-Wei Li, Chia-Min Chung
Abstract: We develop a tensor network framework based on the quantic tensor train (QTT) format to efficiently solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which governs Bose-Einstein condensates under mean-field theory. By adapting time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) and gradient descent methods, we accurately handle the GPE's nonlinearities within the QTT structure. Our approach enables high-resolution simulations with drastically reduced computational cost. We benchmark ground states and dynamics of BECs--including vortex lattice formation and breathing modes--demonstrating superior performance over conventional grid-based methods and stable long-time evolution due to saturating bond dimensions. This establishes QTT as a powerful tool for nonlinear quantum simulations.

Title: Signature of gate tunable superconducting network in twisted bilayer graphene

Abstract: Twisted van der Waals materials provide a tunable platform for investigating two-dimensional superconductivity and quantum phases. Using spectra-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we study the superconducting states in twisted bilayer graphene and track their evolution from insulating phases. Gate-dependent spectroscopic measurements reveal two distinct regimes: under-doped ({\nu} = -2.3) and optimally doped ({\nu} = -2.6). In the under-doped regime, partial superconductivity arises, forming a network interspersed with non-gapped regions. At optimal doping, the entire unit cell demonstrates superconductivity, with gap size modulation showing an anti-correlation with the local density of states. This gate-dependent transition from an insulating phase to a modulated superconductor uncovers an unexpected spatial hierarchy in pairing behavior and offers direct microscopic insights to constrain theories of superconductivity in moiré systems.

Title: Astrophysical Quantum Matter Revisited: Flat-Band Topological States on a Zero-Flux Dipole Sphere
Authors: Jeff Murugan
Abstract: We study strongly correlated fractional topological phases on a two-sphere threaded by a magnetic dipole field with globally vanishing flux. Solving the Dirac equation in this background produces spheroidal wavefunctions forming a highly degenerate manifold of normalizable zero modes, with degeneracy proportional to the total absolute flux. We introduce a non-Abelian spin gauge field near the equator to hybridize the north and south domain-confined modes, forming a global flat band. Projecting interactions into this band yields Laughlin-type correlated states. The entanglement spectrum shows a chiral tower consistent with a virtual edge, demonstrating bulk-edge correspondence in a closed geometry. This generalizes the zero-flux flat-band construction of \cite{Parhizkar:2024som} to curved backgrounds, with potential applications to synthetic and astrophysical systems.

Abstract: Entanglement underpins quantum information processing and computing, yet its experimental quantification in complex, many-body condensed matter systems remains a considerable challenge. Here, we reveal a highly entangled electronic phase proximate to a quantum metal-insulator transition, identified by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering interferometry. This approach reveals that entanglement across atomic sites generates characteristic interference patterns, which our model accurately reproduces, enabling extraction of a full entanglement spectrum and resolution of the underlying quantum states. Our analysis of the pyrochlore iridate Nd2Ir2O7 demonstrates that the system undergoes pronounced quantum fluctuations in its spin, orbital and charge degrees of freedom, even in the presence of a long-range 'all-in-all-out' antiferromagnetic order. Importantly, the observed entanglement signatures facilitate the coexistence of multiple exotic symmetry-breaking orders. Complementary investigations using Raman spectroscopy corroborate the presence of these hidden orders and their emergent excitations. In particular, we observe a two-magnon-bound state below the lowest single-magnon excitation energy, which, together with split phonon modes, provides strong evidence for cubic symmetry-breaking orders of magnetic origin juxtaposed with the all-in-all-out order. Our work thus establishes a direct link between quantum entanglement and emergent unconventional orders, opening new avenues for investigating quantum materials.

Title: Observation of Electride-like $s$ States Coexisting with Correlated $d$ Electrons in NdNiO$_2$

Abstract: Despite exhibiting a similar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band character to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates host additional electron pockets that distinguish them from single-band cuprates. The elusive orbital origin of these electron pockets has led to competing theoretical scenarios. Here, using polarization-dependent and resonant angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we determine the orbital character of the Fermi surfaces in NdNiO$_2$. Our data reveal that the electron-like pocket arises predominantly from interstitial $s$ states, with negligible contributions from rare-earth 5$d$ and 4$f$ orbitals near the Fermi level. The observation of well-defined quantum well states indicates a uniform distribution of these interstitial electrons throughout the film thickness. By comparing with electronic structure of LaNiO$_2$, we find that the rare-earth element modulates the Ni-derived bands and hopping integrals through a chemical pressure effect. These findings clarify the role of rare-earth elements in shaping the low-energy electronic structure and establish the presence of electride-like interstitial $s$ states in a correlated oxide system, where electrons occupy lattice voids rather than atomic orbitals. The electride-like character offer new insight into the self-doping and superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.

Title: Generation of new quadratic coefficients within Ginzburg-Landau theory: Applications for specific heat calculations in various high-temperature superconductors
Authors: Feulefack Ornela Claire, Keumo Tsiaze Roger Magloire, Tsague Fotio Carlos, Danga Jeremie Edmond, Fotue Alain Jerve, Mahouton Norbert Hounkonnou
Abstract: We revisit Landau's theory by renormalizing quadratic coefficients from nonlinear polynomial equations to adapt them to the system's dimensionality. These coefficients are employed to perform detailed specific-heat calculations for several high-temperature superconductors near the superconducting transition. We phenomenologically explain the change in the specific heat jump using Ginzburg-Landau theory, which is applicable to any spatial arrangement and interactions between electrons that influence the system's symmetries. We discuss the effects that may lead to the rapid and non-monotonic variation of the specific heat jump, $\Delta{C_p}/T_{c}$, across the transition over relatively small ranges of fluctuations, focusing particularly on changes attributed to the Sommerfeld coefficient in the normal state. We quantitatively explain the considerable reduction, disappearance, or significant enhancement of the specific heat anomaly at the superconducting transition, considering strong fluctuation corrections to the Ginzburg-Landau theory of low-dimensional systems. Additionally, we study the evolution of specific heat jumps by varying the system's dimensionality and discuss the results in relation to experimental observations of specific-heat jumps in iron-, yttrium-, and bismuth-based superconductors, as well as in $\beta$-pyrochlore oxides superconductors like $KOs_2O_6$.

Title: Acoustoelectric superlattices
Authors: Eli Meril, Unmesh Ghorai, Tobias Holder, Rafi Bistritzer
Abstract: We introduce a new class of tunable periodic structures, formed by launching two obliquely propagating surface acoustic waves on a piezoelectric substrate that supports a two-dimensional quantum material. The resulting acoustoelectric superlattice exhibits two salient features. First, its periodicity is widely tunable, spanning a length scale intermediate between moiré superlattices and optical lattices, enabling the formation of narrow, topologically nontrivial energy bands. Second, unlike moiré systems, where the superlattice amplitude is set by intrinsic interlayer tunneling and lattice relaxation, the amplitude of the acoustoelectric potential is externally tunable via the surface acoustic wave power. Using massive monolayer graphene as an example, we demonstrate that varying the frequencies and power of the surface acoustic waves enables in-situ control over the band structure of the 2D material, generating flat bands and nontrivial valley Chern numbers, featuring a highly localized Berry curvature.

Title: CEMP: a platform unifying high-throughput online calculation, databases and predictive models for clean energy materials
Authors: Jifeng Wang, Jiazhe Ju, Ying Wang
Abstract: The development of materials science is undergoing a shift from empirical approaches to data-driven and algorithm-oriented research paradigm. The state-of-the-art platforms are confined to inorganic crystals, with limited chemical space, sparse experimental data and a lack of integrated online computation for rapid validation. Here, we introduce the Clean Energy Materials Platform (CEMP), an open-access platform that integrates high-throughput computing workflows, multi-scale machine learning (ML) models and a comprehensive materials database tailored for clean energy applications. A key feature of CEMP is the online calculation module, which enables fully automatic quantum and molecular dynamics simulations via structured table uploads. CEMP harmonizes heterogeneous data from experimental measurements, theoretical calculation and AI-based predictions for four material classes, including small molecules, polymers, ionic liquids, and crystals. The platform hosts ~ 376,000 entries, including ~6,000 experimental records, ~50,000 quantum-chemical calculations and ~320,000 AI-predicted properties. The database covers 12 critical properties and the corresponding ML models demonstrate robust predictive power with R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.94, thus ensures rapid material screening, structure-property relationship analysis and multi-objective optimization for clean energy applications. CEMP aims to establish a digital ecosystem for clean energy materials, enabling a closed-loop workflow from data acquisition to material discovery and real-time online validation.

Title: Shear flow of frictional spheroids: lentil-like grains slide more than rice-like
Authors: Jacopo Bilotto, Martin Trulsson, Jean-François Molinari
Abstract: The rheology of dense granular shear flows is influenced by friction and particle shape. We investigate numerically the impact of non-spherical particle geometries under shear on packing fraction, stress ratios, velocity fluctuations, force distribution, and dissipation mechanisms, for a wide range of inertial numbers, friction coefficients and aspect ratios. We obtain a regime diagram for the dissipation which shows that lentil-like (oblate) particles exhibit an extended sliding regime compared to rice-like (prolate) particles with the same degree of eccentricity. Additionally, we identify non-monotonic behaviour of slightly aspherical particles at low friction, linking it to their higher fluctuating rotational kinetic energy. We find that angular velocity fluctuations are generally reduced when particles align with the flow, except in highly frictional rolling regimes, where fluctuations collapse onto a power-law distribution and motion becomes less correlated. Moreover, for realistic friction coefficients power dissipation tends to concentrate along the major axis aligned with the flow, where slip events are more frequent. We also show that flat particles develop stronger fabric anisotropy than elongated ones, influencing macroscopic stress transmission. These findings provide new insights into the role of particle shape in granular mechanics, with implications for both industrial and geophysical applications.

Title: Direct observation of distinct bulk and edge nonequilibrium spin accumulation in ultrathin MoTe$_2$
Authors: Fangchu Chen, Kamal Das, Bowen Yang, Chuangtang Wang, Shazhou Zhong, Diana Golovanova, He Ren, Tianyang Wang, Xuan Luo, Yuping Sun, Liuyan Zhao, Guo-Xing Miao, Binghai Yan, Adam W. Tsen
Abstract: Low-symmetry two-dimensional (2D) topological materials such as MoTe$_2$ host efficient charge-to-spin conversion (CSC) mechanisms that can be harnessed for novel electronic and spintronic devices. However, the nature of the various CSC mechanisms and their correlation with underlying crystal symmetries remain unsettled. In this work, we use local spin-sensitive electrochemical potential measurements to directly probe the spatially dependent nonequilibrium spin accumulation in MoTe$_2$ flakes down to four atomic layers. We are able to clearly disentangle contributions originating from the spin Hall and Rashba-Edelstein effects and uncover an abundance of unconventional spin polarizations that develop uniquely in the sample bulk and edges with decreasing thickness. Using ab-initio calculations, we construct a unified understanding of all the observed CSC components in relation to the material dimensionality and stacking arrangement. Our findings not only illuminate previous CSC results on MoTe$_2$ but also have important ramifications for future devices that can exploit the local and layer-dependent spin properties of this 2D topological material.

Authors: Nathan L. Pessoa, Antônio M. S. Macêdo, Anderson L. R. Barbosa
Abstract: We show that the integer quantum Hall transition in a disordered nanowire with orbital momentum-space texture connected to four terminals is accompanied by an orbital Hall transition. We applied a multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis and found that both conductance fluctuations in the integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) and orbital-conductance fluctuations in the orbital Hall transition (OHT) display multifractal behavior. We argue that this multifractality is primarily related to disorder, which gives rise to the strong fluctuations that are fingerprints of IQHT and OHT, but is also a consequence of the fact that the nanowire has finite size, which causes a weakening of the multifractality in a certain range of values of disorder strength followed by a new regime of increasing multifractality with increasing disorder strength. Furthermore, our findings indicate that OHT can bring novel insights to future IQHT analysis.

Title: The role of dimensionality in the magnetic properties of CeIn$_3$ nanowires
Authors: M. H. Carvalho, D. Zau, A. P. Reyes, R. Cong, S. D. House, H. P. Pizzi, J. Thompson, A. M. Caffer, D.S. Passos, R. C. Santos, G. S. Freitas, K. R. Pirota, R. R. Urbano, P. J. G. Pagliuso
Abstract: In this work, we have explored the Metallic-Flux Nanonucleation method to synthesize single crystals and nanowires (diameter $\approx$ 170 nm) of CeIn$_{3}$ and compare their properties. The effects of reduced dimensionality were systematically investigated using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Selected area electron diffraction (SAED), magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Semi-quantitative EDS analysis revealed a Ce:In ratio of 1:3.1(1), and the SAED results confirmed that the nanowires are polycrystalline with a cubic unit cell. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and NMR data indicated a suppression of the antiferromagnetic transition to $T_N$ $\approx$ 2.4 K compared to the bulk value ($\approx$ 10 K). Furthermore, NMR analysis at temperatures below 2.8 K showed a reduced quadrupole frequency, $\nu_Q$ $\approx$ 1.77(2) MHz, and provided evidence of polycrystalline nanowires formed within the nanoporous alumina template, in agreement with SAED results. We attribute these findings to an increasing magnetic order frustration induced by dimensionality in CeIn$_{3}$ nanowires.

Title: Floquet-Engineering Weyl Points and Linked Fermi Arcs from Straight Nodal Lines
Authors: Dongling Liu, Zheng-Yang Zhuan, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.

Title: Efficient transport of indirect excitons in a van der Waals heterostructure
Authors: Zhiwen Zhou, W. J. Brunner, E. A. Szwed, H. Henstridge, L. H. Fowler-Gerace, L. V. Butov
Abstract: Exciton transport is fundamental for understanding transport phenomena in bosonic systems and for embracing excitation energy transfer in materials. Spatially indirect excitons (IXs) are composed of electrons and holes in separated layers. Long IX lifetimes allow them to form quantum bosonic states and travel long distances. In this work, we measured IX transport in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure by time-resolved photoluminescence imaging. These measurements probe the kinetics of IX cloud expansion and reveal the transport characteristics. We found IX transport with anomalously high diffusivity, orders of magnitude higher than for regular diffusive exciton transport in van der Waals heterostructures. This efficient IX transport agrees with long-range ballistic transport and is consistent with the Bose-Hubbard theory prediction of superfluid in moire superlattices.

Title: Universal shape-dependence of quantum entanglement in disordered magnets
Authors: Natalie Love, István A. Kovács
Abstract: Disordered quantum magnets are not only experimentally relevant, but offer efficient computational methodologies to calculate the low energy states as well as various measures of quantum correlations. Here, we present a systematic analysis of quantum entanglement in the paradigmatic random transverse-field Ising model in two dimensions, using an efficient implementation of the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization group method. The phase diagram is known to be governed by three distinct infinitely disordered fixed points (IDFPs) that we study here. For square subsystems, it has been recently established that quantum entanglement has a universal logarithmic correction due to the corners of the subsystem at all three IDFPs. This corner contribution has been proposed as an "entanglement susceptibility", a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner contribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner contribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different in each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a special case of skeletal entanglement. Therefore, unlike in conformally invariant systems, in general different subsystem shapes are versatile probes to unveil new universal information on the phase transitions in disordered quantum systems.

Title: Deciphering the interplay between wetting and chemo-mechanical fracture in lithium-ion battery cathode materials
Authors: Wan-Xin Chen, Luis J. Carrillo, Arnab Maji, Xiang-Long Peng, Joseph Handy, Sarbajit Banerjee, Bai-Xiang Xu
Abstract: Crack growth in lithium-ion battery electrodes is typically detrimental and undesirable. However, recent experiments suggest that stabilized fracture of cathode active materials in liquid electrolytes can increase electrochemically active surfaces, shorten diffusion pathway, enhance (de)lithiation and improve overall capacity. To decipher the fundamental couplings between electrolyte wetting and fracture evolution and evaluate their influences on macroscopic battery performance, we conducted an integrated experiment-simulation study on $\alpha$-V2O5 single crystals and polycrystalline NCM as model cathode materials. Despite synthesis challenges, single-crystal $\alpha$-V2O5 offers clearer fundamental insights than polycrystalline counterparts with grain-boundary complexities. Fracture patterns and lithiation heterogeneities on the samples were mapped using advanced scanning techniques after chemical (de)lithiation cycles, exhibiting excellent agreements with simulations by the developed multiphysics model. Results reveal a mutually reinforcing interplay between wetting and fracture: (i) electrolyte infiltration at fracture surfaces enhances (de)lithiation and compositional heterogeneity; (ii) wetting influences fracture dynamics, including fracture modes, propagation distance and directionality. The validated modelling framework is further applied to simulations on polycrystalline NCM particles under constant-current (dis)charging, highlighting the critical role of wetting in promoting fracture and improving overall capacity. This work bridges fundamental understanding of wetting-fracture coupling with practical implications for battery performance optimization via controlled fracture engineering.

Title: Nitrogen-related short-range order in Fe-Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steels: first principles and cluster expansion study
Authors: Tianyu Su, Brian J. Blankenau, Namhoon Kim, Jessica A. Krogstad, Elif Ertekin
Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is a key alloying element that enhances the performance of Fe-Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steels, improving austenite stability, corrosion resistance, and yield strength. However, the role of N in modifying chemical ordering, particularly short-range order (SRO) and long-range order (LRO), is complex due to the multi-sublattice nature and magnetic interactions in these alloys. In this work, we combine first-principles calculations with the spin cluster expansion (spin CE) method to systematically investigate the effects of N on chemical ordering in Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. Our atomistic models confirm a strong affinity between N and Cr, which drives the formation of N-Cr SRO and, at higher N concentrations, stabilizes M4N-type ordered phases (M = metal). Monte Carlo simulations reveal that low N concentrations promote local N-Cr or N-N SRO, while increasing N content leads to the emergence of Cr-and N-rich LRO structures. We also show that the presence of N suppresses intrinsic Fe-Cr and Ni-Cr SRO by competing with these interactions, particularly at high concentrations. The impact of Cr content on ordering diminishes as N approaches its solubility limit. These findings are consistent with experimental observations in high-N austenitic steels. Finally, we discuss the influence of kinetic and magnetic effects on SRO evolution in high-N alloys. This study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding N-driven chemical ordering and offers insights into microstructural changes during nitriding processes.

Title: Scaling laws for doublet craters formed by low-velocity impacts of unequal-mass spheres into a granular bed
Authors: Haruto Kitagawa, Ririha Obara, Yu Matsuda
Abstract: Understanding the formation mechanism of doublet craters is an important challenge for advancing knowledge in astronomy and granular physics. In this study, we investigated craters formed by low-velocity impacts of two steel spheres with different masses into a granular bed. Even when the masses were different, a figure-eight-shaped doublet crater and a central ridge were observed, similar to the case with equal masses. However, the resulting shape became asymmetric even without a time delay between impacts. The total length of the doublet crater increased depending on the spacing between the two spheres and the ratio of their impact energies. These results followed a theoretical model based on a scaling law, where the crater diameter is proportional to the one-fourth power of the impact energy. A model was also developed to describe the crater overlap, which increases as the spheres become closer. It was also shown that the crater diameters vary with the time difference, and that the second impact tends to form a larger crater due to fluidization induced by the first.

Title: Optimized Bistable Vortex Memory Arrays for Superconducting In-Memory Matrix-Vector Multiplication
Authors: Mustafa Altay Karamuftuoglu, Changxu Song, Beyza Zeynep Ucpinar, Sasan Razmkhah, Massoud Pedram
Abstract: Building upon previously introduced Bistable Vortex Memory (BVM) as a novel, nonvolatile, high-density, and scalable superconductor memory technology, this work presents a methodology that uses BVM arrays to address challenges in data-driven algorithms and neural networks, specifically focusing on matrix-vector multiplication (MVM). The BVM approach introduces a novel superconductor-based methodology for in-memory arithmetic, achieving ultra-high-speed and energy-efficient computation by utilizing BVM arrays for in-memory computation. The design employs a tiled multiplier structure where BVM's inherent current summation capability is combined with Quantizer Buffer (QB) cells to convert the analog accumulated current into a variable number of digital Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) pulses. These pulses are then processed by T1 adder cells, which handle binary addition and carry propagation, thereby forming a complete functional multiplier unit. This paper thus presents an efficient MVM architecture that uses these BVM-based multipliers in a systolic array configuration to enable parallel computation. A key innovation is an optimized BVM array structure specifically tailored for multiplication applications, involving a restructuring of Sense Lines (SLs) with diagonal connections to reduce area and an adjusted input scheme to enhance computational efficiency compared to the general-purpose BVM array design. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with a 4-bit multiplier operating at 20 GHz with 50 ps latency and an MVM structure demonstrating operation at 20 GHz. Furthermore, we showcase how this multiplier design can be extended to support Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. This work paves the way for power-efficient neural networks by enabling high-speed in-memory computation.

Title: Anomalous Ionic Conductivity along the Coherent $Σ$3 Grain Boundary in ThO2
Authors: Miaomiao Jin, Jilang Miao, Marat Khafizov, Beihan Chen, Yongfeng Zhang, David H. Hurley
Abstract: Understanding oxygen diffusion along grain boundaries (GBs) is critical for controlling ionic conductivity in oxide ceramics. GBs are typically thought to enhance ionic transport due to structural disorder and increased free volume. In this study, we report an unexpected anomaly: the $\Sigma 3(111)$ GB in thorium dioxide (ThO$_2$), despite its compact and coherent structure, exhibits significantly higher oxygen ionic conductivity compared to the more open GB ($\Sigma 19$ as an example). Using atomistic simulations based on a machine learning interatomic potential, we revealed that the high conductivity in the $\Sigma 3$ GB arises from a collective diffusion mechanism involving highly correlated atomic motion reminiscent of a superionic state. In contrast, the $\Sigma 19$ GB follows conventional pipe diffusion, consistent with its more open structure. This comparison highlights that enhanced GB conductivity is not simply correlated with free volume, but can occur from specific structural motifs that enable collective transport. These findings provide new guidance for designing GB-engineered oxides with targeted ionic transport properties for energy applications.

Title: Prethermal inverse Mpemba effect
Authors: Koudai Sugimoto, Tomotaka Kuwahara, Keiji Saito
Abstract: The inverse Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system, initially in thermal equilibrium and prepared at different temperatures below that of the final equilibrium state, relaxes to the final state more rapidly when starting from a lower initial temperature. We extend this concept to the relaxation toward a prethermal state in isolated quantum systems. By examining a simple model that exhibits prethermalization, we demonstrate that this effect indeed manifests under periodic driving. We further discuss the realization of this phenomenon in a variety of systems within a unified theoretical framework.

Title: Tuning electronic correlations in the Kagome metals $RT_3$B$_2$
Authors: Savita Chaudhary, Armando Consiglio, Jaskaran Singh, Domenico Di Sante, Ronny Thomale, Yogesh Singh
Abstract: The $RT_3$B$_2$ ($R=$Y, Lu, $T=$ Co, Os) family hosts a perfect kagome lattice of $T$ atoms, offering an interesting platform to investigate the interplay of electronic structure, superconductivity, and lattice dynamics. Here, we compare two members of this family, LuOs$_3$B$_2$ and YCo$_3$B$_2$, with similar crystallography but differing chemical composition, leading to distinct electronic correlation strengths and spin-orbit coupling effects. We confirm superconductivity in LuOs$_3$B$_2$ with $T_c = 4.75$K, while YCo$_3$B$_2$ remains non-superconducting above 1.8K. First-principles estimates of the electron-phonon coupling for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ are consistent with its observed $T_c$ and suggest a moderate coupling strength. Both materials exhibit kagome-derived electronic features, including quasi-flat bands, Dirac cones, and van Hove singularities. Fermi surface calculations reveal quasi-one-dimensional behavior along the $c$-axis in YCo$_3$B$_2$, in contrast to the more three-dimensional Fermiology of LuOs$_3$B$_2$. Phonon calculations for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ show imaginary modes, indicating potential lattice instabilities. Experimental estimates of the Wilson and Kadowaki-Woods ratios point to non-negligible electronic correlations in both compounds.

Title: Quantized conductance in a CVD-grown nanoribbon with hidden Rashba effect
Authors: Jianfei Xiao, Yiwen Ma, Congwei Tan, Kui Zhao, Yunteng Shi, Bingbing Tong, Peiling Li, Ziwei Dou, Xiaohui Song, Guangtong Liu, Jie Shen, Zhaozheng Lyu, Li Lu, Hailin Peng, Fanming Qu
Abstract: Quantized conductance in quasi-one-dimensional systems not only provides a hallmark of ballistic transport, but also serves as a gateway for exploring quantum phenomena. Recently, a unique hidden Rashba effect attracts tremendous attention, which arises from the compensation of opposite spin polarizations of a Rashba bilayer in inversion symmetric crystals with dipole fields, such as bismuth oxyselenide ($\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$). However, investigating this effect utilizing conductance quantization is still challenging. Here we report the conductance quantization observed in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown high-mobility $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$ nanoribbon, where quantized conductance plateaus up to $44\cdot 2e^{2}/{h}$ ($e$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is the Planck constant, and the factor $2$ results from spin degeneracy) are achieved at zero magnetic field. Due to the hidden Rashba effect, the quantized conductance remains in multiples of $2e^{2}/{h}$ without Zeeman splitting even under magnetic field up to $12$ T. Moreover, within a specific range of magnetic field, the plateau sequence exhibits the Pascal triangle series, namely $(1,3,6,10,15\dots )\cdot 2e^{2}/{h}$, reflecting the interplay of size quantization in two transverse directions. These observations are well captured by an effective hidden Rashba bilayer model. Our results demonstrate $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$ as a compelling platform for spintronics and the investigation of emergent phenomena.

Title: The size effect on nucleation process during solidification of metals
Authors: A.S. Nuradinov, K.A. Sirenko, I.A. Nuradinov, O.V. Chystiakov, D.O. Derecha
Abstract: This work investigates the mechanisms of crystal nucleation in metal melts, in dependence on the influence of their shape and volume. Investigations were conducted on both thin flat and bulk samples prepared of low-temperature Wood's metal alloy and transparent organic media (camphene and diphenylamine). The study revealed that in flat samples, the nucleation rate is primarily influenced by the activity of the mold wall surface, which is affected by melt overheating and subcooling, while in bulk samples, supercooling and nucleation are additionally influenced by factors such as impurity activity, temperature, and density fluctuations.

Title: DFT-Guided Operando Raman Characterization of Ni-Based Phases Relevant to Electrochemical Systems
Authors: Harol Moreno Fernández, Siavash Karbasizadeh, Esmaeil Adabifiroozjaei, Leopoldo Molina-Luna, Jan P. Hofmann, Mohammad Amirabbasi
Abstract: We present a phase-resolved investigation of Ni-based oxides and hydroxides relevant to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), combining ground-state DFT+U calculations with operando and in situ Raman spectroscopy, supported by high-resolution TEM. Five crystalline phases-cubic and hexagonal NiO, monoclinic and trigonal Ni(OH)2, and NiOOH-are systematically characterized in terms of their vibrational and electronic structure. Although the DFT models are idealized (0 K, defect-free, no solvation), they serve as clean, phase-specific references for interpreting complex experimental spectra. Cubic NiO is confirmed to be dynamically and electronically stable, consistent with dominant Raman modes observed experimentally. Despite dynamic instabilities in phonon dispersions, hexagonal NiO is structurally verified via TEM, suggesting substrate- or defect-stabilized metastability. Ni(OH)2 polymorphs are both vibrationally stable semiconductors, with the trigonal phase exhibiting stronger spin polarization. NiOOH exhibits spin-polarized electronic states across the Brillouin zone, consistent with its asymmetric band structure under ferromagnetic ordering. Independently, phonon calculations reveal soft modes near the Gamma-point, indicating dynamic instability under idealized conditions, yet operando Raman spectra align closely with calculated zone-center modes. However, introducing 0.03 Angstrom symmetry-breaking displacements relaxes the NiOOH lattice off its saddle point, removing imaginary phonon modes and stabilizing the phase. This integrated framework demonstrates how idealized DFT can reveal intrinsic fingerprints that anchor the interpretation of vibrational and electronic responses in catalytically active, dynamically evolving Ni-based materials.

Title: The Ferroelectric Superconducting Field Effect Transistor
Authors: Alessandro Paghi, Laura Borgongino, Elia Strambini, Giorgio De Simoni, Lucia Sorba, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: The ferroelectric field-effect transistor (Fe-FET) is a three-terminal semiconducting device first introduced in the 1950s. Despite its potential, a significant boost in Fe-FET research occurred about ten years ago with the discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide. This material has been incorporated into electronic processes since the mid-2000s. Here, we observed ferroelectricity in a superconducting Josephson FET (Fe-JoFET) operating at cryogenic temperatures below 1 Kelvin. The Fe-JoFET was fabricated on the InAsOI platform, which features an InAs epilayer hosted by an electrical insulating substrate, using HfO2 as the gate insulator, making it a promising candidate due to its ferroelectric properties. The Fe-JoFET exhibits significant hysteresis in the switching current and normal-state resistance transfer characteristics, which depend on the range of gate voltages. This phenomenon opens a new research area exploring the interaction between ferroelectricity and superconductivity in hybrid superconducting-semiconducting systems, with potential applications in cryogenic data storage and computation. Supporting this, the Fe-JoFET was operated as a cryogenic superconducting single memory cell, exhibiting both dissipative and non-dissipative states. Its non-volatility was tested over a 24-hour measurement period. We also demonstrated that the Fe-JoFET can retain information at temperatures above the superconductor critical temperature, resulting in a temperature-fault-tolerant memory cell resistant to temperature oscillations or, in the worst case, cryostat faults.

Abstract: This work presents experimental and theoretical comparison in the modelling of the quantum wave function of single-electron in semiconductor nanowire via classical analog electronics based hardware emulator with the use of Kron concept. Thus we are able to express the semiconductor single-electron devices of linear or closed circle topology as present in position-based qubits that can be mapped essentially to one dimensional Kron model implemented experimentally. We have also represented a two dimensional single-electron wave function in Krons model and point out future experiments to be conducted.

Title: The occupation dependent DFT-1/2 method
Authors: Shengxin Yang, Jiangzhen Shi, Kan-Hao Xue, Jun-Hui Yuan, Xiangshui Miao
Abstract: There has been a high demand in rectifying the band gap under-estimation problem in density functional theory (DFT), while keeping the computational load at the same level as local density approximation. DFT-1/2 and shell DFT-1/2 are useful attempts, as they correct the spurious electron self-interaction through the application of self-energy potentials, which pull down the valence band. Nevertheless, the self-energy potential inevitably disturbs the conduction band, and these two methods fail for semiconductors whose hole and electron are entangled in the same shell-like regions. In this work, we introduce the occupation-dependent DFT-1/2 method, where conduction band states are not subject to the additional self-energy potential disturbance. This methodology works for difficult cases such as $\text{Li}_2\text{O}_2$, $\text{Cu}_2\text{O}$ and two-dimensional semiconductors. Using a shell-like region for the self-energy potential, and allowing for downscaling of the atomic self-energy potential (with an $A$ < 1 factor), the occupation-dependent shell DFT+$A$-1/2 method yields more accurate conduction band and valence band edge levels for monolayer $\text{MoS}_2$, compared with the computationally demanding hybrid functional approach.

Title: Multipole phases in a type of spin/fermion ladders with local conserved quantities and generalizations
Authors: Jianlong Fu
Abstract: We study spin/fermion ladder models with multipole phases, which are traditional transverse-field-Ising phases formed by multipole moments. These phases feature non-trivial order with zero magnetization. The multipole models have dimer local conserved quantities that are Ising terms of spin. The Hilbert spaces are locally fragmented into independent sectors described effectively by {\it higher-order spin}. For dipole models, we consider two ladder geometries and work out the phase diagrams. Different phases of the model can be distinguished experimentally with the dynamical structure factor. Higher-order multipole models are obtained by introducing more dimer conserved quantities. The phases are characterized by the values of the local conserved quantities and the transverse-Ising phases of the higher-order spin.

Title: Ferroelectrically Controlled Chirality Switching of Weyl Quasiparticles
Authors: Zeling Li, Yu liu, Le Du, Fengyu Li, Zhifeng Liu, Lei Li, Lei Wang, Botao Fu, Xiao-Ping Li
Abstract: Weyl quasiparticles, as gapless low-energy excitations with nontrivial chirality, have garnered extensive interest in recent years. However, archieving effective and reversible control over their chirality (topological charge) remains a major challeng due to topological protection. In this work, we propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons, where the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a simultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables electric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon excitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups, we identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with chiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via polarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to screen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set of prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As a representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two pairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl points is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological features such as Berry curvature and surface phonon arcs. These findings provide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band crossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications.

Title: Severe Plastic Deformation of Ceramics by High-Pressure Torsion: Review of Principles and Applications
Authors: Kaveh Edalati, Jacqueline Hidalgo-Jiménez, Thanh Tam Nguyen, Hadi Sena, Nariman Enikeev, Gerda Rogl, Valery I. Levitas, Zenji Horita, Michael J. Zehetbauer, Ruslan Z. Valiev, Terence G. Langdon
Abstract: Ceramics are typically brittle at ambient conditions due to their covalent or ionic bonding and limited dislocation activities. While plasticity, and occasionally superplasticity, can be achieved in ceramics at high temperatures through thermally activated phenomena, creep, and grain boundary sliding, their deformation at ambient temperature and pressure remains challenging. Processing under high pressure via the high-pressure torsion (HPT) method offers new pathways for severe plastic deformation (SPD) of ceramics. This article reviews recent advances in HPT processing of ceramics, focusing primarily on traditional ceramics (e.g., oxides, carbides, nitrides, oxynitrides) and to a lesser extent advanced ceramics (e.g., silicon, carbon, perovskites, clathrates). Key structural and microstructural features of SPD-processed ceramics are discussed, including phase transformations and the generation of nanograins and defects such as vacancies and dislocations. The properties and applications of these deformed ceramics are summarized, including powder consolidation, photoluminescence, bandgap narrowing, photovoltaics, photocatalysis (dye degradation, plastic waste degradation, antibiotic degradation, hydrogen production, CO2 conversion), electrocatalysis, thermoelectric performance, dielectric performance, and ion conductivity for Li-ion batteries. Additionally, the article highlights the role of HPT in synthesizing novel materials, such as high-entropy ceramics (particularly high-entropy oxides), black oxides, and high-pressure polymorphs, which hold promise for energy and environmental applications.

Title: Induced Zeeman effect of moiré surface states in topological insulators
Authors: Haijiao Ji, Noah F. Q. Yuan
Abstract: Recently, moiré superlattices have been found on the surface of topological insulators due to the rotational misalignment of topmost layers. In this work, we study the effects of moiré superlattices on the Landau levels of topological surface states. We find that an extra Zeeman term besides the intrinsic one can be induced by the orbital effect of the magnetic field in moiré surface states. As a result, the originally field-independent zeroth Landau level of moiré surface states could be tilted by the out-of-plane magnetic field.

Title: Ultrafast non-equilibrium magnon generation and collapse of spin-orbit hybridization gaps in iron
Authors: Xinwei Zheng, Shabnam Haque, Christian Strüber, Martin Weinelt
Abstract: We distinguish between longitudinal and transverse spin excitations in the ultrafast response of iron by probing exchange splitting {\Delta}Eex and magnetic linear dichroism (MLD) in time- and angleresolved photoemission. Comparing spin-split partner bands at the Fermi level shows that {\Delta}Eex remains constant upon optical excitation. In contrast, the different MLD response of spin-orbitsplit valence bands reveals non-equilibrium, transverse spin dynamics. Magnon generation in Fe is ultrafast, electronic band specific, and drives the collapse of spin-orbit hybridization gaps.

Title: Universal Diagnostic Criterion for Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect
Authors: Ran Wang, Ning Hao
Abstract: The intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) is distinguished from the Josephson diode effect (JDE) by its manifestation of nonreciprocal critical current phenomena within a monolithic superconductor, typically linked to finite-momentum Cooper pairing. The long-standing assumption that SDE requires co-breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries proves to be necessary but not sufficient. In this work, we propose a universal diagnostic criterion. Embodied in two concise inequalities, this criterion enables convenient and intuitive assessment of whether an intrinsic SDE can emerge in a given system without requiring extensive numerical calculations. Furthermore, our universal criterion provides explicit design guidelines for material systems exhibiting intrinsic SDE.

Title: Quantum transport in nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphenes
Authors: Gaetano Calogero, Isaac Alcón, Alan E. Anaya Morales, Nick Papior, Pol Febrer, Aron W. Cummings, Miguel Pruneda, Stephan Roche, Mads Brandbyge
Abstract: Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded pi-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials which are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.

Title: Torsional Behavior of Carbon-Doped Ferrous Nanowires: Atomic-Scale Insights from MD Simulations
Authors: Charith L. Hirimuthugodage, Laalitha S.I. Liyanage
Abstract: This study investigates the torsional mechanical properties of pristine iron (Fe) and carbon-doped iron (FeC) nanowires with [001] orientation through molecular dynamics simulations utilizing the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential developed by Liyanage et al. for accurately modeling Fe-C interactions in body-centered cubic structures. Systematic analysis across carbon concentrations (0 - 10%), temperatures (1 - 900 K), and cross-sectional dimensions 10a, 13a, 15a, ( where a = 2.81 Angstrom represents the lattice constant ) within the LAMMPS environment reveals that increasing carbon content weakens grain boundaries, reducing the maximum shear stress required to reach the critical torsional angle, while higher temperatures promote phase transitions from elastic to plastic deformation due to enhanced atomic vibrations, and larger cross-sections exhibit higher shear stress resistance attributed to strengthening effects from the outer atomic layers. By elucidating these interrelationships between carbon content, temperature, and dimensional factors, this work provides fundamental insights into the mechanical behavior of FeC nanowires under torsional loading conditions, offering valuable guidance for their potential applications in nanoelectromechanical systems, nanorobotic actuators, and advanced structural materials where precise control of mechanical properties is essential.

Title: Unlocking high coercivity at room temperature in phase modified MoS$_2$
Authors: Zainab Chowdhry, Kushal Mazumder, Praveen Hegde, Pramoda K. Nayak, Vidya Praveen Bhallamudi
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials showing room-temperature magnetism and high coercivity are desired for combining magnetism with semiconducting properties useful for spintronics. In this work, the magnetic properties of the 1T phase of MoS$_2$ have been studied at room temperature. We observe ferromagnetism with a coercivity of ~0.3 T and a maximum saturation magnetization of 0.26 emu/g at room temperature. This is the highest among coercivities reported so far in 2D magnets at room temperature. MoS$_2$ nanosheets are prepared using a single-step hydrothermal synthesis with a relative 1T-phase reaching up to 77%. We report a correlation between the structural and magnetic characteristics via interplanar distance and coercivity. The increase in interplanar distance is also accompanied by an increase in the 1T phase. Our results pave a useful way of controlling the coercivity and saturation magnetization in a 2D magnet with applications in spintronics and low-power quantum devices.

Authors: M. Makeš, J. Zázvorka, M. Hubert, P. Veřtát, M. Rameš, J. Zemen, O. Heczko, M. Veis
Abstract: The optical and magneto-optical properties of thin epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films, with thicknesses ranging from 8 to 160 nm, were investigated across the spectral range of 0.7-6.4 eV. The films were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering on MgO substrate with stress-mediating Cr buffer layer. Structural and magnetic characterization revealed an stress-induced martensitic transformation for the films thicker than 80 nm, while thinner films remained in austenite structure deformed by substrate constraint. Both X-type and Y-type twin domains were observed in martensitic samples. Magneto-optical polar Kerr effect spectra showed notable evolution with film thicknesses, demonstrating changes in electronic structure of Ni-Mn-Ga. A combination of spectroscopic ellipsometry and magneto-optical Kerr spectroscopy allowed for the deduction of the spectral dependence of full permittivity tensor of investigated samples. Three magneto-optical transitions were fitted to the spectra of non-diagonal permittivity using semiclassical theory, showing strong correlations with in-plane coercivity. Observed correlations highlight the impact of substrate-induced strain on Ni-Mn-Ga films and provide insights into the electronic structure changes associated with the martensitic transformation.

Title: Computing dielectric spectra in molecular dynamics simulations: using a cavity to disentangle self and cross correlations
Authors: Marceau Hénot
Abstract: Dielectric spectra are typically obtained in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by analyzing the fluctuations, in the absence of an applied electric field, of the total dipole moment of the simulation box. We compare this standard method with a protocol that focuses on a virtual cavity whose size is chosen to include short-range dipolar cross-correlations, while excluding long-range correlations that are affected by the choice of electrostatic boundary conditions. We tested this protocol on three non-polarizable systems with different dielectric permittivities. We showed that it produces the same dielectric spectra as the standard method while being less sensitive to noise. The question of the decomposition of a dielectric spectrum into self and cross contributions is discussed in the context of both methods. We propose that, for a liquid with a sufficiently high dielectric permittivity, the cavity protocol yields a self-spectrum consistent with the electrostatic boundary conditions applicable to the experimental situation.

Title: Variational Approach to the Snake Instability of a Bose-Einstein Condensate Soliton
Authors: Umut Tanyeri, Mehmet Atakan Gürkan, Ahmet Keleş, Mehmet Özgur Oktel
Abstract: Solitons are striking manifestations of nonlinearity, encountered in diverse physical systems such as water waves, nonlinear optics, and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). In BECs, dark solitons emerge as exact stationary solutions of the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. While they can be long-lived in elongated traps, their stability is compromised in higher dimensions due to the snake instability, which leads to the decay of the soliton into vortex structures among other excitations. We investigate the dynamics of a dark soliton in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an anisotropic harmonic trap. Using a variational ansatz that incorporates both the transverse bending of the soliton plane and the emergence of vortices along the nodal line, we derive equations of motion governing the soliton's evolution. This approach allows us to identify stable oscillation modes as well as the growth rates of the unstable perturbations. In particular, we determine the critical trap anisotropy required to suppress the snake instability. Our analytical predictions are in good agreement with full numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

Title: Supersymmetric properties of one-dimensional Markov generators with the links to Markov-dualities and to shape-invariance-exact-solvability
Authors: Cecile Monthus
Abstract: For diffusion process involving the force $F(x)$ and the diffusion coefficient $D(x)$, the continuity equation $\partial_t P_t(x)=- \partial_xJ_t(x)$ gives the dynamics of the probability $P_t( x)$ in terms of the current $J_t( x)=F(x)P_t(x)-D(x)\partial_x P_t(x)={\cal J}P_t( x)$ obtained from $P_t( x) $ via the application of the first-order differential current-operator ${\cal J}$. So the dynamics of the probability $P_t( x)$ is governed by the factorized Fokker-Planck generator ${\cal F}=-\partial_x{\cal J}$, while the dynamics of the current $J_t( x)$ is governed by its supersymmetric partner ${\hat {\cal F} }= - {\cal J}\partial_x$, so that their right and left eigenvectors are directly related using the two intertwining relations ${\cal J}{\cal F}=-{\cal J}\partial_x{\cal J}={\hat {\cal F}}{\cal J}$ and ${\cal F}\partial_x=-\partial_x{\cal J}\partial_x=\partial_x{\hat {\cal F} }$. We also describe the link with the factorization of the adjoint $ {\cal F}^{\dagger}=\frac{d}{dm(x)}\frac{d}{ds(x)} $ in terms of the scale function $s(x)$ and speed measure $m(x)$. We then analyze how the supersymmetric partner ${\hat {\cal F} } = - {\cal J} \partial_x$ can be re-interpreted in two ways: (1) as the adjoint ${\mathring {\cal F}}^{\dagger} ={\mathring {\cal J} }^{\dagger} \partial_x$ of the Fokker-Planck generator ${\mathring {\cal F}}=- \partial_x{\mathring {\cal J} }$ associated to the dual force ${\mathring F}(x)=-F(x)-D'(x)$, that unifies various known Markov dualities; (2) as the non-conserved Fokker-Planck generator ${\tilde {\cal F}}_{nc} = -\partial_x{\tilde {\cal J}}-{\tilde K }(x)$ involving the force ${\tilde F}(x)=F(x) +D'(x)$ and the killing rate ${\tilde K }(x)=-F'(x)-D''(x)$, with application to shape-invariance-solvability. Finally, we describe how all these ideas can be also applied to Markov jump processes with nearest-neighbors transition rates $w(x \pm 1,x)$.

Title: Nanoparticles and Quantum Dots as Emerging Optical Sensing Platforms for $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ Detection: Recent Approaches and Perspectives
Authors: Sudhanshu Naithani, Heena, Pooja Sharma, Samar Layek, Franck Thetiot, Tapas Goswami, Sushil Kumar
Abstract: Over the preceding years, nickel (Ni) and its compounds have been increasingly employed in various aspects of human social life, metallurgical/industrial manufactures, healthcare, and chemical processes. Although Ni is considered an essential trace element in biological systems, excessive intake or metabolic deficiency of \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\) ions may cause detrimental health effects to living organisms. Therefore, a facile and accurate detection of \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\), especially in environmental and biological settings, is of huge significance. As an efficient detection method, assaying \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\) using optical (colorimetric and/or fluorogenic) sensors has experienced quite a vigorous growth period, with a large number of excellent research contributions. Nanomaterial-based optical sensors, including metal nanoparticles (MNPs), quantum dots (QDs), and carbon dots (CDs), offer distinct advantages over conventional small-molecule organic and inorganic sensors. This study mainly provides an overview of the recent advancements and challenges related to the design strategies of various optical nanosensors to selectively detect the \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\) ion. Emphasis has also been placed on comparing the sensing performance of various nanosensors, along with exploring future perspectives.

Title: Spin-orbit coupling in digital alloyed InGaAs quantum wells
Authors: Jason T. Dong, Yilmaz Gul, Irene Villar Rodriguez, Aaron N. Engel, Connor P. Dempsey, Stuart N. Holmes, Michael Pepper, Christopher J. Palmstrøm
Abstract: Increasing the spin-orbit coupling in InGaAs quantum wells is desirable for applications involving spintronics and topological quantum computing. Digital alloying is an approach towards growing ternary quantum wells that enables asymmetric interfaces and compositional grading in the quantum well, which can potentially modify the spin-orbit coupling in the quantum well. The spin-orbit coupling of the quantum wells is extracted from beating patterns in the low magnetic field magnetoresistance. Digital alloying is found to modify the spin-orbit coupling by up to 138 meV\textnormalÅ. The changes induced in the spin-orbit coupling can be qualitatively understood as being due to modifications in the interfacial Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Variability of hole spin qubits in planar Germanium
Authors: Biel Martinez, Yann-Michel Niquet
Abstract: Hole spin qubits in Ge/GeSi heterostructures benefit from the clean environment of epitaxial interfaces and from the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling that enables efficient electrical control, which makes them promising candidates for quantum computation. However, spin-orbit coupling also enhances the sensitivity to electrical disorder, potentially increasing variability. In this work, we perform numerical simulations in a realistic device geometry to quantify the variability of the charge and spin properties of Ge qubits induced by charge traps at the SiGe/oxide interfaces. We show that while the variability of charge properties remains moderate, spin properties (g-factors and Rabi frequencies) show significant dispersion. We explore the implications of this variability for large-scale architectures, and provide guidelines to minimize variability both in terms of interface quality requirements and optimal operation strategies.

Title: Momentum transfer in the ponderomotive potential of near-infrared laser pulses leads to sizable energy shifts and electron-wavepacket squeezing in time-resolved ARPES
Authors: Xinwei Zheng, Martin Weinelt, Christian Strüber
Abstract: We observe momentum transfer in the ponderomotive potential of near-infrared (NIR) laser pulses in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) experiments with ultrashort extreme ultraviolet probe pulses. Acceleration of photoelectrons in the transient grating provided by an intense laser pulse reflected at a surface leads to delay-dependent oscillations of electric kinetic energies. Photon and electron momenta determine the oscillation frequency. We experimentally observe and theoretically simulate electron yield modulations driven by a novel electron-energy bunching effect. Measurement results are simulated and fitted with high accuracy. Complete reversion of the ponderomotive momentum transfer allows for retrieval of the undisturbed initial state and the transient band structure for overlapping pump and probe pulses.

Title: A Pyridyl-Benzimidazole Based Ruthenium(II) Complex as Optical Sensor: Targeted Cyanide Detection and Live Cell Imaging Applications
Authors: Sudhanshu Naithani, Franck Thetiot, Vikas Yadav, Saakshi Saini, Partha Roy, Samar Layek, Tapas Goswami, Sushil Kumar
Abstract: The extreme toxicity of cyanide (\ce{CN^-}) ions in diverse environmental media has garnered significant attention toward the design of well-organized molecular probes for their selective and sensitive detection. In this context, we present a monometallic Ru(II) complex (Ru-1), based on the 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole moiety, acting as a highly selective luminescent probe for \ce{CN^-} recognition in pure water. Additionally, Ru-1 also functions as an efficient sensor for \ce{F^-}, \ce{AcO^-}, and \ce{H2PO4^-} ions, along with \ce{CN^-}, when acetonitrile is used as the solvent system. The binding constant ($K_b$) and detection limit (LoD) for \ce{CN^-} were determined to be $3.05 \times 10^6$~M$^{-1}$ and 12.8~nM, respectively, in water. The close proximity of the N--H site to the Ru(II) center, along with its notable acidity, were identified as the primary factors responsible for the high selectivity of Ru-1 toward \ce{CN^-} in aqueous media. Job's plots and density functional theory (DFT) analyses were conducted to support the anion binding mechanism. Furthermore, time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) spectroscopy was employed to evaluate the \ce{CN^-}-induced emission lifetime change of Ru-1 in water. To explore practical applicability, the Ru-1 probe was developed into paper-based strips capable of detecting \ce{CN^-} ions in the millimolar range via the naked eye under 365~nm UV illumination. It was also effectively applied for the detection of \ce{CN^-} in human breast cancer MCF-7 cell lines and natural food sources, such as apple seeds and sprouting potatoes.

Title: Equilibrium-preserving Laplacian renormalization group
Authors: Sudo Yi, Seong-Gyu Yang, K.-I. Goh, D.-S. Lee
Abstract: Diffusion over networks has recently been used to define spatiotemporal scales and extend Kadanoff block spins of Euclidean space to supernodes of networks in the Laplacian renormalization group (LRG). Yet, its ad hoc coarse-graining procedure remains underdeveloped and unvalidated, limiting its broader applicability. Here we rigorously formulate an LRG preserving the equilibrium state, offering a principled coarse-graining procedure. We construct the renormalized Laplacian matrix preserving dominant spectral properties using a proper, quasi-complete basis transformation and the renormalized adjacency matrix preserving mean connectivity from equilibrium-state flows among supernodes. Applying recursively this equilibrium-preserving LRG to various hypergraphs, we find that in hypertrees with low spectral dimensions vertex degree and hyperedge cardinality distributions flow toward Poissonian forms, while in hypergraphs lacking a finite spectral dimension they broaden toward power-law forms when starting from Poissonian ones, revealing how informational, structural, and dynamical scale-invariances are interrelated.

Title: Stochastic size control of self-assembled filaments
Authors: Maximilian C. Hübl, Carl P. Goodrich
Abstract: Controlling the size and shape of assembled structures is a fundamental challenge in self-assembly, and is highly relevant in material design and biology. Here, we show that specific, but promiscuous, short-range binding interactions make it possible to economically assemble linear filaments of user-defined length. Our approach leads to independent control over the mean and width of the filament size distribution and allows us to smoothly explore design trade-offs between assembly quality (spread in size) and cost (number of particle species). We employ a simple hierarchical assembly protocol to minimize assembly times, and show that multiple stages of hierarchy make it possible to extend our approach to the assembly of higher-dimensional structures. Our work provides a simple and experimentally straightforward solution to size control that is immediately applicable to a broad range of systems, from DNA origami assemblies to supramolecular polymers and beyond.

Title: Beyond LSDA and Thomas-Fermi: A Hartree-Fock Analysis of Spherical Nanoparticles in the Jellium Approximation
Authors: Michael Píro, Jaroslav Hamrle
Abstract: A comprehensive Hartree-Fock analysis of the ground-state electronic structure of spherical gold nanoparticles modeled within the jellium approximation is carried out for all systems containing up to 132 delocalized electrons. Emphasis is placed on resolving the energy-level ordering, properly describing the electron density tail and associated charge spill-out, and assessing the accuracy of local exchange and kinetic energy potentials. The calculations are performed on a high-resolution real-space grid to ensure numerical precision. Significant discrepancies are observed between the exchange energy given by the Hartree-Fock approximation and the local spin density approximation (LSDA) in both the inner and outer regions of the nanoparticle. To address these differences, a refined expression of the one-electron exchange energy density as an explicit function of the charge density is proposed. Similarly, the failure of the Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy model near the surface of the nanoparticle is resolved by introducing an improved expression for the one-electron kinetic energy density.

Title: Non-ergodic one-magnon magnetization dynamics of the kagome lattice antiferromagnet
Authors: H. Schlüter, J. Schnack, J. Eckseler (Bielefeld University)
Abstract: The present view of modern physics on non-equilibrium dynamics is that generic systems equilibrate or thermalize under rather general conditions, even closed systems under unitary time evolution. The investigation of exceptions thus not only appears attractive, in view of quantum computing where thermalization is a threat it also seems to be necessary. Here, we present aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons lead to disorder-free localization and prevent the system from equilibration.

Title: Anderson-Skin dualism
Authors: Shan-Zhong Li, Linhu Li, Shi-Liang Zhu, Zhi Li
Abstract: We report a novel localization phenomenon that emerges in non-Hermitian and quasiperiodic coupled systems, which we dub ``Anderson-Skin (AS) dualism". The emergence of AS dualism is due to the fact that non-Hermitian topological systems provide non-trivial topological transport channels for disordered systems, causing the originally localized Anderson modes to transform into skin modes, i.e., the localized states within the point gap regions have dual characteristics of localization under periodic boundary condition (PBC) and skin effects under open boundary conditions (OBC). As an example, we analytically prove the 1D AS dualism through the transfer matrix method. Moreover, by discussing many-body interacting systems, we confirm that AS dualism is universal.

Title: Geometry-Induced Chiral Currents in a Mesoscopic Helicoidal Quantum Well
Authors: Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: We introduce a mesoscopic quantum well whose confinement and chirality emerge solely from the intrinsic torsion of a finite helicoidal metric. This purely geometric construction requires no external gates or fields: the metric itself induces both a harmonic radial potential and a torsion-driven Zeeman term that breaks the $m \leftrightarrow -m$ degeneracy. By imposing hard-wall boundary conditions at $z = \pm L/2$, we quantize the axial motion and obtain a genuinely zero-dimensional helicoidal quantum dot. An exact analytic solution reveals an energy spectrum with chiral splitting linear in both the torsion parameter $\Omega$ and the axial quantum number $n_z$. For realistic InAs nanoroll parameters ($L = 100$ nm, $\Omega = 5\times10^{6} \mathrm{m^{-1}}$), this geometric effect results in a measurable splitting of $\sim 0.5$ meV. We propose three viable experimental platforms, ultracold atoms in optical traps, femtosecond-written photonic waveguides, and strain-engineered semiconductor nanorolls, where this torsion-induced phenomenon should be accessible with current technology.

Title: A Generative Diffusion Model for Amorphous Materials
Authors: Kai Yang, Daniel Schwalbe-Koda
Abstract: Generative models show great promise for the inverse design of molecules and inorganic crystals, but remain largely ineffective within more complex structures such as amorphous materials. Here, we present a diffusion model that reliably generates amorphous structures up to 1000 times faster than conventional simulations across processing conditions, compositions, and data sources. Generated structures recovered the short- and medium-range order, sampling diversity, and macroscopic properties of silica glass, as validated by simulations and an information-theoretical strategy. Conditional generation allowed sampling large structures at low cooling rates of 10$^{-2}$ K/ps to uncover a ductile-to-brittle transition and mesoporous silica structures. Extension to metallic glassy systems accurately reproduced local structures and properties from both computational and experimental datasets, demonstrating how synthetic data can be generated from characterization results. Our methods provide a roadmap for the design and simulation of amorphous materials previously inaccessible to computational methods.

Title: Machine Learning Study of the Surface Reconstructions of Cu$_{2}$O(111) Surface
Authors: Payal Wadhwa, Michael Schmid, Georg Kresse
Abstract: The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$)R30° and (2$\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strong oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.

Title: Particle-scale origin of quadrupolar non-affine displacement fields in granular solids
Authors: Evan P. Willmarth, Weiwei Jin, Dong Wang, Amit Datye, Udo D. Schwarz, Mark D. Shattuck, Corey S. O'Hern
Abstract: In this work, we identify the local structural defects that control the non-affine displacement fields in jammed disk packings subjected to athermal, quasistatic (AQS) simple shear. While complex non-affine displacement fields typically occur during simple shear, isolated effective quadrupoles are also observed and their probability increases with increasing pressure. We show that the emergence of an isolated effective quadrupole requires the breaking of an interparticle contact that is aligned with low-frequency, spatially extended vibrational modes. Since the Eshelby inhomogeneity problem gives rise to quadrupolar displacement fields in continuum materials, we reformulate and implement Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method (EIM) for jammed disk packings. Using EIM, we show that we can reconstruct the non-affine displacement fields for jammed disk packings in response to applied shear as a sum of discrete Eshelby-like defects that are caused by mismatches in the local stiffnesses of triangles formed from Delaunay triangulation of the disk centers.

Title: Moiré-assisted charge instability in ultrathin RuO$_2$
Authors: Philipp Keßler, Andreas Feuerpfeil, Armando Consiglio, Hendrik Hohmann, Ronny Thomale, Jonas Erhardt, Bing Liu, Vedran Jovic, Ralph Claessen, Patrick Härtl, Matteo Dürrnagel, Simon Moser
Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_2$) has been in the focus of contemporary condensed matter research as a prototypical candidate material for altermagnetism. In the face of daunting evidence for bulk magnetic order despite promising theoretical predictions, it naturally suggests the focus on thin films where Coulomb interactions are dimensionally quenched and may yield a more strongly correlated environment prone to magnetic ordering. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), density functional theory (DFT), and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to investigate atomically ordered ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) grown on Ru(0001). Contrary to predictions of magnetic order, we observe a nonmagnetic charge density wave (CDW) instability that is driven by Fermi surface nesting within the flat-band surface state, and stabilized by the incommensurate moiré stacking with the substrate. We further identify a nonmagnetic and metastable 2 $\times$ 2 surface reconstruction that breaks in-plane mirror symmetry and can be reversibly toggled via STM tip manipulation. Our spin-polarized STM measurements find no sign of any magnetic instability at the RuO$_2$ surface. As much as our findings refute proposals for either bulk or surface magnetism in RuO$_2$, we establish ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) as an intriguing platform for exploring Moiré-assisted electronic surface order.

Title: Looping metal-support interaction in heterogeneous catalysts during redox reactions
Authors: Yue Pan, Shiyu Zhen, Xiaozhi Liu, Mengshu Ge, Jianxiong Zhao, Lin Gu, Dan Zhou, Liang Zhang, Dong Su
Abstract: Metal-support interfaces fundamentally govern the catalytic performance of heterogeneous systems through complex interactions. Here, utilizing operando transmission electron microscopy, we uncovered a type of looping metal-support interaction in NiFe-Fe3O4 catalysts during hydrogen oxidation reaction. At the NiFe-Fe3O4 interfaces, lattice oxygens react with NiFe-activated H atoms, gradually sacrificing themselves and resulting in dynamically migrating interfaces. Meanwhile, reduced iron atoms migrate to the {111} surface of Fe3O4 support and react with oxygen molecules. Consequently, the hydrogen oxidation reaction separates spatially on a single nanoparticle and is intrinsically coupled with the redox reaction of the Fe3O4 support through the dynamic migration of metal-support interfaces. Our work provides previously unidentified mechanistic insight into metal-support interactions and underscores the transformative potential of operando methodologies for studying atomic-scale dynamics.

Title: The Hitchhiker's Guide to Differential Dynamic Microscopy
Authors: Enrico Lattuada, Fabian Krautgasser, Maxime Lavaud, Fabio Giavazzi, Roberto Cerbino
Abstract: Over nearly two decades, Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) has become a standard technique for extracting dynamic correlation functions from time-lapse microscopy data, with applications spanning colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions, active fluids, and biological systems. In its most common implementation, DDM analyzes image sequences acquired with a conventional microscope equipped with a digital camera, yielding time- and wavevector-resolved information analogous to that obtained in multi-angle Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). With a widening array of applications and a growing, heterogeneous user base, lowering the technical barrier to performing DDM has become a central objective. In this tutorial article, we provide a step-by-step guide to conducting DDM experiments -- from planning and acquisition to data analysis -- and introduce the open-source software package fastDDM, designed to efficiently process large image datasets. fastDDM employs optimized, parallel algorithms that reduce analysis times by up to four orders of magnitude on typical datasets (e.g., 10,000 frames), thereby enabling high-throughput workflows and making DDM more broadly accessible across disciplines.

Title: Spin liquid state in a three-dimensional pyrochlore-like frustrated magnet
Authors: U. Jena, S. Kundu, Suheon Lee, Q. Faure, F. Damay, S. Rols, Adam Berlie, S. Petit, Kwang-Yong Choi, P. Khuntia
Abstract: The three-dimensional frustrated spin lattice in MgCrGaO4, where Cr3+ ions occupy a pyrochlore-like network, exemplifies a quantum magnet with competing interactions, macroscopic degeneracy, and exotic low-energy excitations. Using thermodynamic, electron spin resonance (ESR), muon spin relaxation (muSR), and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) techniques, we observe no magnetic order or spin freezing down to 57 mK, despite a sizable exchange interaction (J= 58 K) between Cr3+ (S=3/2) moments and inherent site disorder. Below the characteristic exchange energy scale, all experimental probes detect the emergence of antiferromagnetic short-range spin correlations, corroborated by magnetic diffuse scattering in the wave vector dependence of low-energy magnetic excitations centered on Q = 1.5 A^-1 in inelastic neutron scattering experiments. The low-temperature specific heat follows a near-quadratic dependence without a gap, consistent with algebraic spin correlations. These results establish MgCrGaO4 as a rare three-dimensional classical spin liquid featuring a highly degenerate ground-state manifold and gapless excitations, offering a strong impetus for the experimental realization of spin liquids in higher-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets.

Title: Quantum Spin Glass in the Two-Dimensional Disordered Heisenberg Model via Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States
Authors: Luciano Loris Viteritti, Riccardo Rende, Giacomo Bracci Testasecca, Jacopo Niedda, Roderich Moessner, Giuseppe Carleo, Antonello Scardicchio
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional frustrated quantum Heisenberg model with bond disorder on nearest-neighbor couplings using the recently introduced Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States framework, which enables accurate and efficient computation of disorder-averaged observables with a single variational optimization. Simulations on large lattices reveal an extended region of the phase diagram where long-range magnetic order vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, while the overlap order parameter, which characterizes quantum spin glass states, remains finite. These findings, supported by a semiclassical analysis based on a large-spin expansion, provide compelling evidence that the spin glass phase is stable against quantum fluctuations, unlike the classical case where it disappears at any finite temperature.

Title: Atomistic study of dislocation formation during Ge epitaxy on Si
Authors: Luis Martín-Encinar, Luis A. Marqués, Iván Santos, Lourdes Pelaz
Abstract: We performed classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate, from an atomistic point of view, the formation of dislocations during the epitaxial growth of Ge on Si. We show that simulations at 900 and 1000 K with deposition rates of 10$^8$ monolayers per second provide a good compromise between computational cost and accuracy. In these conditions, the ratio between the Ge deposition rate and the ad-atom jump rate is analogous to that of out-of-equilibrium experiments. In addition, the main features of the grown film (intermixing, critical film thickness, dislocation typology, and surface morphology) are well described. Our simulations reveal that dislocations originate in low-density amorphous regions that form under valleys of the rough Ge film surface. Atoms are squeezed out of these regions to the surface, releasing the stress accumulated in the film and smoothing its surface. Amorphous regions grow until atoms begin to rearrange in dislocation half-loops that propagate throughout the Ge film. The threading arm ends of the dislocation half-loops move along the surface following valleys and avoiding islands. The film surface morphology affects the propagation path of the dislocation half-loops and the resulting dislocation network.

Title: Instability of the Haldane Phase: Roles of Charge Fluctuations and Hund's Coupling
Authors: Satoshi Nishimoto
Abstract: We systematically investigate the stability of the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase in spin-1/2 Heisenberg and half-filled Hubbard ladders coupled by ferromagnetic Hund's interactions. Using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we analyze key signatures of the Haldane phase: long-range string order, finite spin gap, and characteristic entanglement spectrum degeneracies. In spin-only Heisenberg ladders, we find immediate onset and continuous strengthening of the Haldane phase with increasing Hund's coupling. In contrast, the inclusion of charge fluctuations in Hubbard ladders leads to a nontrivial stability regime, revealing a robust yet bounded region where SPT order persists despite significant charge fluctuations. We identify distinct boundaries separating a trivial insulating phase from the Haldane SPT phase, governed by both Coulomb repulsion and Hund's coupling. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom in correlated itinerant systems and establish essential criteria for observing Haldane physics experimentally in fermionic ladder materials.

Title: Topological defect modes in bilayer acoustic networks
Authors: Renaud Cote, Marc Pachebat, Antonin Coutant
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence, which relates topological properties of a material in the bulk to the presence of robust modes localized on the edge, is at the core of the now mature field of topological wave physics. More recently, it was realized that in crystalline structures, certain types of defects can host localized modes, in which case the bulk-boundary correspondence has to be replaced by a bulk-defect correspondence. These defect-localized modes are expected to have robust properties owing to their topological origin. In this work, we show how to obtain topological defect modes in a lattice possessing both mirror and chiral symmetry. The defect is obtained by endowing a plaquette with a non-trivial gauge flux. We show that the bulk-defect correspondence is satisfied by introducing appropriate topological invariants. Moreover, the topological defect modes are shown to be highly robust to the introduction of symmetry-preserving disorder. The model is then realized in an acoustic system made of a network of tubes, and the presence of topological defect mode is experimentally clearly demonstrated.

Title: Variational first-principles approach to self-trapped polarons
Authors: Vasilii Vasilchenko, Matteo Giantomassi, Samuel Poncé, Xavier Gonze
Abstract: The behavior of charge carriers in polar materials is governed by electron-phonon interactions, which affect their mobilities via phonon scattering and may localize carriers into self-induced deformation fields, forming self-trapped polarons. We present a first-principles study of self-trapped polaron formation in paradigmatic polar semiconductors and insulators using the variational polaron equations framework and self-consistent gradient optimization. Our method incorporates long-range corrections to the electron-phonon interaction, essential for finite-size systems. We demonstrate how the variational approach enables the identification of multiple polaronic states and supports the analysis of polarons with arbitrarily large spatial extent via energy filtering. The potential energy surfaces of the resulting polarons exhibit multiple local minima, reflecting distinct, symmetry-broken polaronic configurations in systems with degenerate band edges. Our findings align with previous theoretical studies and establish a robust foundation for future ab initio studies of polarons, especially those employing variational methods.

Title: Self-consistent moment dynamics for networks of spiking neurons
Authors: Gianni Valerio Vinci, Roberto Benzi, Maurizio Mattia
Abstract: A novel approach to moment closure problem is used to derive low dimensional laws for the dynamics of the moments of the membrane potential distribution in a population of spiking neurons. Using spectral expansion of the density equation we derive the recursive and nonlinear relation between the moments, such as the mean potential, and the population firing rates. The self-consistent dynamics found relies on the dominant eigenvalues of the evolution operator, tightly related to the moments of the single-neuron inter-spike interval distribution. Contrary to previous attempts our system can be applied both in noise- and drift-dominated regime, and both for weakly and strongly coupled population. We demonstrate the applicability of the theory for the case of a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons deriving closed analytical expressions. Truncating the mode decomposition to the first few more relevant moments, results to effectively describe the population dynamics both out-of-equilibrium and in response to strongly-varying inputs.

Title: Pseudo-likelihood produces associative memories able to generalize, even for asymmetric couplings
Authors: Francesco D'Amico, Dario Bocchi, Luca Maria Del Bono, Saverio Rossi, Matteo Negri
Abstract: Energy-based probabilistic models learned by maximizing the likelihood of the data are limited by the intractability of the partition function. A widely used workaround is to maximize the pseudo-likelihood, which replaces the global normalization with tractable local normalizations. Here we show that, in the zero-temperature limit, a network trained to maximize pseudo-likelihood naturally implements an associative memory: if the training set is small, patterns become fixed-point attractors whose basins of attraction exceed those of any classical Hopfield rule. We explain quantitatively this effect on uncorrelated random patterns. Moreover, we show that, for different structured datasets coming from computer science (random feature model, MNIST), physics (spin glasses) and biology (proteins), as the number of training examples increases the learned network goes beyond memorization, developing meaningful attractors with non-trivial correlations with test examples, thus showing the ability to generalize. Our results therefore reveal pseudo-likelihood works both as an efficient inference tool and as a principled mechanism for memory and generalization.

Title: Statistical characterization of valley coupling in Si/SiGe quantum dots via $g$-factor measurements near a valley vortex
Authors: Benjamin D. Woods, Merritt P. Losert, Nasir R. Elston, M. A. Eriksson, S. N. Coppersmith, Robert Joynt, Mark Friesen
Abstract: The presence of low-energy valley excitations in Si/SiGe heterostructures often causes spin qubits to fail. It is therefore important to develop robust protocols for characterizing the valley coupling. Here, we show that realistically sized samplings of valley energy distributions tend to dramatically overestimate the average valley coupling. But we find that knowledge of the valley phase, in addition to the valley splitting, can significantly improve our estimates. Motivated by this understanding, we propose a novel method to probe the valley phase landscape across the quantum well using simple $g$-factor measurements. An important calibration step in this procedure is to measure $g$ in a loop enclosing a valley vortex, where the valley phase winds by $\pm 2\pi$ around a zero of the valley splitting. This proposal establishes an important new tool for probing spin qubits, and it can be implemented in current experiments.

Title: Defect-induced displacement of topological surface state in quantum magnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
Authors: Felix Lüpke, Marek Kolmer, Hengxin Tan, Hao Chang, Adam Kaminski, Binghai Yan, Jiaqiang Yan, Wonhee Ko, An-Ping Li
Abstract: The topological magnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT), with gapped topological surface state, is an attractive platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall and Axion insulator states. However, the experimentally observed surface state gaps fail to meet theoretical predictions, although the exact mechanism behind the gap suppression has been debated. Recent theoretical studies suggest that intrinsic antisite defects push the topological surface state away from the MBT surface, closing its gap and making it less accessible to scanning probe experiments. Here, we report on the local effect of defects on the MBT surface states and demonstrate that high defect concentrations lead to a displacement of the surface states well into the MBT crystal, validating the theorized mechanism. The local and global influence of antisite defects on the topological surface states are studied with samples of varying defect densities by combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES), and density functional theory (DFT). Our findings identify a combination of increased defect density and reduced defect spacing as the primary factors underlying the displacement of the surface states and suppression of surface gap, shedding light to further development of topological quantum materials.

Title: Dynamics and chaotic properties of the fully disordered Kuramoto model
Authors: Iván León, Diego Pazó
Abstract: Frustrated random interactions are a key ingredient of spin glasses. From this perspective, we study the dynamics of the Kuramoto model with quenched random couplings: the simplest oscillator ensemble with fully disordered interactions. We answer some open questions by means of extensive numerical simulations and a perturbative calculation (the cavity method). We show frequency entrainment is not realized in the thermodynamic limit and that chaotic dynamics are pervasive in parameter space. In the weak coupling regime, we find closed formulas for the frequency shift and the dissipativeness of the model. Interestingly, the largest Lyapunov exponent is found to exhibit the same asymptotic dependence on the coupling constant irrespective of the coupling asymmetry, within the numerical accuracy.

Title: Magnetic force microscopy versus scanning quantum-vortex microscopy: Probing pinning landscape in granular niobium films
Authors: A. Yu. Aladyshkin, R. A. Hovhannisyan, S. Yu. Grebenchuk, S. A. Larionov, A. G. Shishkin, O. V. Skryabina, A. V. Samokhvalov, A. S. Mel'nikov, D. Roditchev, V. S. Stolyarov
Abstract: We provide an overview of the methodology and fundamental principles associated with newly developed experimental technique -- scanning quantum-vortex microscopy [Hovhannisyan et al., Commun. Mater., vol. 6, 42 (2025)]. This approach appears promising for experimental studies of vortex pinning phenomena in superconducting films and nanodevices. In particular, we studied the magnetic properties of magnetron-sputtered niobium (Nb) films by low-temperature magnetic force microscopy. As the temperature approaches the superconducting critical temperature, the pinning potential caused by structural defects weakens; consequently, the attractive interaction between the magnetic tip of the cantilever and a single-quantum vortex begins to dominate. In this scenario the magnetic probe is capable of trapping a vortex during the scanning process. Because the dragged vortex continues interacting with structural defects, it serves as an efficient nano-probe to explore pinning potentials and visualize grain boundaries in granular Nb films, achieving resolutions (30 nm) comparable to the superconducting coherence length.

Title: Guidelines for the optimization of hafnia-based ferroelectrics through superlattice engineering
Authors: Johanna van Gent, Binayak Mukherjee, Ewout van der Veer, Ellen M. Kiens, Gertjan G. Koster, Bart J. Kooi, Jorge Íñiguez-González, Beatriz Noheda
Abstract: Hafnia-based ferroelectrics are revolutionizing the data storage industry and the field of ferroelectrics, with improved materials and devices being reported monthly. However, full understanding and control has not been reached yet and the ideal material still needs to be found. Here we report ferroelectric hafnia-zirconia superlattices made out of zirconium-substituted hafnia (Hf$_{1-x}$Zr$_x$O$_2$) sublayers of varying stoichiometries alternating with pure ZrO$_2$ sublayers. It is observed that the ZrO$_2$ layers in these superlattices act as a booster for the total remnant polarization (P$_r$). By combining the benefits of the ZrO$_2$ layers and the added interfaces, which help prevent breakdown, we fabricate superlattices with a total 87.5% ZrO$_2$ content, exhibiting record polarizations with a 2P$_r$ value of 84 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ that can be cycled 10$^9$ times, while maintaining a 2P$_r$ > 20 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Next to these attractive properties, substitution of HfO$_2$ by the much more abundant ZrO$_2$ offers a significant step towards the sustainable application of these devices.

Title: Moiré excitons and exciton-polaritons: A review
Authors: Saúl A. Herrera-González, Hugo A. Lara-García, Giuseppe Pirruccio, David A. Ruiz-Tijerina, Arturo Camacho-Guardian
Abstract: Distinguished by their long lifetimes, strong dipolar interactions, and periodic confinement, moiré excitons provide a fertile territory for realizing interaction-driven excitonic phases beyond conventional semiconductor systems. Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids, potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities, moiré excitons hybridize with photons to form moiré exciton-polaritons, a new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and novel topological features. In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental progress in the field of moiré excitons and polaritons. We begin by introducing the formation mechanisms of moiré patterns in two-dimensional semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in the realization of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moiré polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems, moiré excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation, optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.

Title: Doping Induced Magnetic and Electronic phase Transition in Ferrimagnetic Half-metallic Mn$_{4}$Al$_{11}$ Compound
Authors: Sujoy Datta, Prashant Singh
Abstract: The future of spintronic and semiconductor applications demands materials with tailored electronic and magnetic properties. This study uses density functional theory to investigate the electronic structure of the half-metallic compound Mn$_{4}$Al$_{11}$ under uniaxial strain and in its Ge-substituted derivatives. Strain analysis shows that although the half-metallic band-gap collapses under strain beyond $-2\%$, the ferrimagnetic character remains stable. Ge substitution at six inequivalent Al-sites in Mn$_{4}$Al$_{11}$ results in varying degrees of metallicity and magnetic properties. Substitution at Al$=(000)$ induces a metal-to-insulator transition with an indirect semiconducting gap of $0.14~ eV$. Bonding and hybridization analysis reveals that local Mn-Al interactions due to Ge substitution significantly modify the local electronic structure, causing both electronic and magnetic phase transitions. This work highlights the effectiveness of substitutional doping in tuning half-metallicity and magnetic properties in inorganic solids, enabling the design of materials for future technological applications.

Title: Tunable Intraband and Interband Polarizability in three-dimensional nodal line semimetals
Authors: Vivek Pandey, Snehasish Nandy, Pankaj Bhalla
Abstract: Polarizability plays an essential role in characterizing the key phenomena, such as the screening effects, collective excitations, and dielectric functions present in the system. In this study, we investigate the intraband and interband polarizability within the random phase approximation for the three-dimensional nodal line semimetals, specifically for Ca$_3$P$_2$ and ZrSiS. We find both intraband and interband contributions show tunable behavior with the chemical potential, which adds a resonance signature in the behavior of the polarizability. Further, in the long wavelength limit, the results reveal the quadratic dependence on the wave vector by the non-resonant intraband and interband parts of the polarizability. On the other hand, the resonant interband part gives a cubic dependence on the wave vector. In addition, the total polarizability is dominated by the intraband part in the low frequency regime, while in the mid and high frequency regimes, the interband part takes the lead. This study opens avenues for further theoretical and experimental exploration of frequency dependent dielectric properties, paving the way for potential applications in tunable plasmonic devices.

Title: Acceleration of the CASINO quantum Monte Carlo software using graphics processing units and OpenACC
Authors: B. Thorpe, M. J. Smith, P. J. Hasnip, N. D. Drummond
Abstract: We describe how quantum Monte Carlo calculations using the CASINO software can be accelerated using graphics processing units (GPUs) and OpenACC. In particular we consider offloading Ewald summation, the evaluation of long-range two-body terms in the Jastrow correlation factor, and the evaluation of orbitals in a blip basis set. We present results for three- and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gases and ab initio simulations of bulk materials, showing that significant speedups of up to a factor of 2.5 can be achieved by the use of GPUs when several hundred particles are included in the simulations. The use of single-precision arithmetic can improve the speedup further without significant detriment to the accuracy of the calculations.

Title: Hydrodynamic Trapping of Tracer Particles Induced by Spatially Correlated Noise in Thermal Equilibrium
Authors: Sijie Huang, Ayush Saurabh, Steve Presse
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuating Stokes equation in the presence of spatially correlated noise -- characterized by a single length scale -- while preserving thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation-dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends nonmonotonically on the ratio $\ell/r$ between the correlation length $\ell$ and the particle radius $r$: the MSD decreases as $\ell$ approaches $r$, reaches a minimum near $\ell\simeq r$, and rises again for $\ell > r$. The initial suppression stems from transient trapping, where sluggish momentum diffusion at short wavelengths confines the particle. When $\ell>r$, the particle hops between traps and eventually recovers normal diffusion ($\text{MSD}\propto t$) consistent with the fact that momentum diffusion crosses over to the standard Laplacian at long wavelengths. We further illustrate that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equations, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.

Title: On the Underlying Mechanism of Light-Induced Patterning of N719-Stained Photoanodes for "Photovoltaic Photographs"
Authors: Allyson Robert, Nico Fransaert, Willem Awouters, Wouter Marchal, Peter Adriaensens, Roland Valcke, Jean V. Manca
Abstract: Recently, "photovoltaic photographs" were proposed as a creative application of photovoltaic technologies, relevant in fields such as architecture or the automotive industry. In this application an image is created by light-induced patterning of the photoactive layer, causing a local change in the appearance of the solar cell. In order to further develop this concept, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanism underlying these local changes. Here, UV-VIS and infrared spectroscopic techniques, as well as Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, have been used to investigate the physico-chemical changes induced by this process in the photoactive layer of proof-of-concept photo-patterned dye-sensitized solar cells. We show that, for N719 photovoltaic photographs, TiO2 plays a crucial role and that the dye undergoes a multi-step chemical degradation, related to its isothiocyanate ligand. These insights are of importance for a better understanding of the photo-induced degradation of N719, a more substantiated control of the light-induced patterning process, and to design appropriate light-induced patterning techniques for other classes of solar cells.

Title: Mass Transfer Through Vapor-Liquid Interfaces From Hydrodynamic Density Functional Theory
Authors: B. Bursik, F. Bender, R. Stierle, G. Bauer, J. Gross
Abstract: We assess the capabilities of hydrodynamic density functional theory (DFT) to predict mass transfer across vapor-liquid interfaces by studying the response of an initially equilibrated pure component vapor-liquid system to the localized insertion of a second component. Hydrodynamic DFT captures the effect of interfaces on the dynamics by modeling the chemical potential gradients of an inhomogeneous system based on classical DFT. Hydrodynamic DFT effectively connects molecular models with continuum fluid dynamics. Away from interfaces the framework simplifies to the isothermal Navier-Stokes equations. We employ Maxwell-Stefan diffusion with a generalized driving force to model diffusive molecular transport in inhomogeneous systems. For the considered Lennard--Jones truncated and shifted (LJTS) fluid, we utilize a non-local Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed truncated and shifted (PeTS) equation of state. The model provides noise-free partial densities and fluxes for the mass transfer near the interface, as well as profiles of these quantities across the interface. A comparison with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations shows that hydrodynamic DFT accurately predicts mass transfer across the interface, including microscopic phenomena such as the temporary enrichment and repulsion of the light boiling component at the interface. Combining generalized entropy scaling with generalized Maxwell-Stefan diffusion allows for an accurate description of diffusive molecular transport in the system. This approach can accurately predict phase behavior, equilibrium interfaces, and mass transfer across interfaces based on molecular interactions for mixtures of strongly dissimilar components. Our results suggest that hydrodynamic DFT can accurately predict the dynamics of mixtures at vapor-liquid interfaces.

Title: Machine Learning Guided Multiscale Design of DNA-functionalized Nanoparticles for Targeted Self-Assembly of the Double Gyroid
Authors: Luis Nieves-Rosado (1), Fernando Escobedo (1) ((1) Cornell University)
Abstract: In soft matter science, it is often the goal to design new materials with targeted properties. These materials can be used in many applications, each requiring specific features to be optimized for maximum fitness. The use of self-assembly processes, where a target structure is attained from suitably designed building blocks, is a powerful tool for this optimization. However, it is still an open question how to generally design realizable building blocks that lead to the desired phases. In this work, the double gyroid is chosen as target structure and DNA functionalized nanoparticles are used as our building blocks. Using existing pair potentials as inspiration, a large design space is defined for exploration of the target structure. An effective search strategy is implemented, where free energy calculations are first used to coarse grain our originally fine-grained model of the building blocks and then quickly evaluate the fitness of each design. These data are then fed into a machine learning algorithm that allows obtaining predictions for all candidates in our design space through an active learning loop. Successful coarse-grained designs are identified and evaluated again through interfacial pinning calculations with the fine-grained model. This work leads to the development of specific, experimentally relevant designs of DNA functionalized nanoparticles that self-assembly into the target phase. The methodology used can be extended to other types of building blocks and target structures.

Title: The Effect of Spike Geometry on the Linear and Nonlinear Plasmonic Properties of Gold Nanourchins
Authors: Domantas Peckus, Fatima Albatoul Kasabji, Maziar Moussavi, Loic Vidal, Hana Boubaker, Asta Tamuleviciene, Arnaud Spangenberg, Tomas Tamulevicius, Joel Henzie, Karine Mougin, Sigitas Tamulevicius
Abstract: Wet-chemistry synthesized Gold nanourchins (Au NUs), characterized by spiky morphologies with spherical cores, exhibit complex and geometry-dependent plasmonic properties distinct from those of symmetrical nanostructures. While plasmon hybridization and mode coupling in branched nanostructures have been broadly studied, the specific optical behavior of Au NUs-particularly regarding spike length distribution and ultrafast dynamics-remains underexplored. This study investigates the steady-state and transient absorption spectra of Au NUs with 50-80 nm cores and 5-20 nm spikes, revealing multiple resonance bands. Transient absorption spectroscopy at various excitation wavelengths confirmed the presence of distinct resonances. Electromagnetic simulations based on TEM tomography-inspired models identified two key extinction bands: a green-wavelength dark mode resonance and a red-nIR spike-induced resonance attributed to the lightning rod effect. Simulations further showed that short, uniformly distributed spikes (aspect ratio <= 1) weakly excite dark resonances, while longer spikes (aspect ratio > 1) induce hybridized longitudinal resonances and significant redshifts. Broad spike length distributions result in multiple coexisting resonances, aligning with experimental extinction spectra. A preliminary surface-enhanced Raman scattering study using 2-naphthalene thiol confirmed stronger enhancement for long-spiked Au NUs under 785 nm excitation, validating the field enhancement potential of the identified resonances.

Title: Latent Thermodynamic Flows: Unified Representation Learning and Generative Modeling of Temperature-Dependent Behaviors from Limited Data
Authors: Yunrui Qiu, Richard John, Lukas Herron, Pratyush Tiwary
Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work, we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow, important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive computational results.

Title: Mimicking Surface Plasmons with Structured Surfaces
Authors: JB Pendry, L Martin-Moreno, FJ Garcia-Vidal
Abstract: Metals such as silver support surface plasmons: electromagnetic surface excitations localised near the surface which originate from the free electrons of the metal. Surface modes are also observed on highly conducting surfaces perforated by holes. We establish a close connection between the two, showing that electromagnetic waves in both materials are governed by an effective permittivity of the same plasma form. Because the size and spacing of holes can readily be controlled on all relevant length scales, this gives the opportunity to create designer surface plasmons with almost arbitrary dispersion in frequency and in space, opening new vistas in surface plasmon optics.

Title: Controlling Electromagnetic Fields
Authors: J. B. Pendry, D. Schurig, D. R. Smith
Abstract: Using the freedom of design which metamaterials provide, we show how electromagnetic fields can be redirected at will and propose a design strategy. The conserved fields: electric displacement field, D, magnetic induction field, B, and Poynting vector, S, are all displaced in a consistent manner. A simple illustration is given of the cloaking of a proscribed volume of space to exclude completely all electromagnetic fields. Our work has relevance to exotic lens design and to the cloaking of objects from electromagnetic fields

Title: Tunable and low-noise WSe$_2$ quantum emitters for quantum photonics
Authors: Athanasios Paralikis, Pawel Wyborski, Pietro Metuh, Niels Gregersen, Battulga Munkhbat
Abstract: Low-noise and tunable single-photon sources are essential components of photonic quantum technologies. However, in WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, charge noise from fluctuations in their local electrostatic environment remains a major obstacle to achieving transform-limited single-photon emission and high photon indistinguishability. Here, we systematically investigate two noise mitigation strategies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation and electrostatic biasing. We demonstrate that hBN encapsulation alone suppresses spectral wandering (from $\sim$170 $\mu$eV to $\sim$40 $\mu$eV) and narrows emission linewidths (from $\sim$500 $\mu$eV to $\sim$150 $\mu$eV), while applied bias enables stable Stark tuning over a 280 $\mu$eV range and further linewidth narrowing down to $\sim$100 $\mu$eV reaching the resolution-limited regime. Time-resolved and second-order correlation measurements confirm stable mono-exponential decay and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0) \approx 0.01$) with no observable blinking. To quantify progress toward the transform limit, we define two figures of merit: the linewidth ratio $R = W_{\text{exp}} / W_{\text{rad}}$ and total broadening $\Delta W = W_{\text{exp}} - W_{\text{rad}}$, with both being reduced more than five-fold in optimized devices. These results provide a robust framework for developing and evaluating low-noise, tunable WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, potentially realizing electrically controllable sources of indistinguishable single-photons for future photonic quantum technologies.

Title: Disentangling temperature and Reynolds number effects in quantum turbulence
Authors: Juan Ignacio Polanco, Philippe-E. Roche, Luminita Danaila, Emmanuel Lévêque
Abstract: The interplay between viscous and frictional dissipation is key to understanding quantum turbulence dynamics in superfluid $^4$He. Based on a coarse-grained two-fluid description, an original scale-by-scale energy budget that identifies each scale's contribution to energy dissipation is derived. Using the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) model to further characterize mutual friction, direct numerical simulations at temperatures $1.44 \, \mathrm{K} \lesssim T \lesssim 2.16 \, \mathrm{K}$ indicate that mutual friction promotes intense momentum exchanges between the two fluids to maintain a joint energy cascade despite their viscosity mismatch. However, the resulting overall frictional dissipation remains small (compared to the viscous dissipation) and confined to far-dissipative scales. This remarkable feature allows us to define an effective Reynolds number for the turbulence intensity in a two-fluid system, helping to disentangle the effects of Reynolds number and temperature in quantum turbulence. Thereby, simple physical arguments predict that the distance $\ell$ between quantized vortices (normalized by the turbulence integral scale $L_0$) should behave as $\ell/L_0 \approx 0.5 \, \mathrm{Re}_\kappa^{-3/4}$ with the Reynolds number based on the quantum of circulation $\kappa$. This law is well supported by a large set of experimental and numerical data within the temperature range of the HVBK model. Finally, this new approach offers the possibility of revisiting the ongoing controversy on intermittency in quantum turbulence. It is shown that observed changes in intermittency arise from Reynolds number effects rather than from temperature variations, as proposed in recent studies.

Here, we utilize a coordinate transformation in which a hole is opened up in space. The transformation provides a complete prescription for an electromagnetic cloak which, although complex, can be readily constructed with metamaterials

Title: Optimising germanium hole spin qubits with a room-temperature magnet
Authors: Cecile X. Yu, Barnaby van Straaten, Alexander S. Ivlev, Valentin John, Stefan D. Oosterhout, Lucas E. A. Stehouwer, Francesco Borsoi, Giordano Scappucci, Menno Veldhorst
Abstract: Germanium spin qubits exhibit strong spin-orbit interaction, which allow for high-fidelity qubit control, but also provide a strong dependence on the magnetic field. Superconducting vector magnets are often used to minimize dephasing due to hyperfine interactions and to maximize spin control, but these compromise the sample space and thus challenge scalability. Here, we explore whether a permanent magnet outside the cryostat can be used as an alternative. Operating in a hybrid mode with an internal and external magnet, we find that we can fine-tune the magnetic field to an in-plane orientation. We obtain a qubit dephasing time T2*=13 microseconds, Hahn-echo times T2H=88 microseconds, and an average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelity above 99.9%, from which we conclude that room temperature magnets allow for high qubit performance. Furthermore, we probe the qubit resonance frequency using only the external magnet, with the internal superconducting magnet switched off. Our approach may be used to scale semiconductor qubits and use the increased sample space for the integration of cryogenic control circuitry and wiring to advance to large-scale quantum processors.

Title: Spatial Leggett-Garg Inequalities
Authors: Guillem Müller-Rigat, Donato Farina, Maciej Lewenstein, Andrea Tononi
Abstract: We formulate a spatial extension of the Leggett-Garg inequality by considering three distant observers locally measuring a many-body system at three subsequent times. The spatial form, in particular, is specially suited to analyze propagation of quantum perturbations through spin chains, by capturing how a measurement at one site can later affect distant sites due to the interactions. We illustrate our proposal for a Heisenberg chain in a magnetic field, showing indeed that the first inequality-violation time scales proportionally to the distance between measuring parties. We attribute this phenomenon to Lieb-Robinson physics and, confirming this connection, we find that violations are anticipated when increasing the interaction range. The inequality violation, readily observable in current experiments, demonstrates the incompatibility between two-point correlation functions and the macrorealistic hypothesis. In outlook, spatial Leggett-Garg inequalities constitute a new tool for analyzing the non-relativistic dynamics of many-body quantum systems.

Title: Complex Absorbing Potential Green's Function Methods for Resonances
Authors: Loris Burth, Fábris Kossoski, Pierre-François Loos
Abstract: The complex absorbing potential (CAP) formalism has been successfully employed in various wavefunction-based methods to study electronic resonance states. In contrast, Green's function-based methods are widely used to compute ionization potentials and electron affinities but have seen limited application to resonances. We integrate the CAP formalism within the $GW$ approximation, enabling the description of electronic resonances in a Green's function framework. This approach entails a fully complex treatment of orbitals and quasiparticle energies in a non-Hermitian setting. We validate our CAP-$GW$ implementation by applying it to the prototypical shape resonances of \ce{N2^-}, \ce{CO^-}, \ce{CO_2^-}, \ce{C2H2-}, \ce{C2H4-}, and \ce{CH2O-}. It offers a fast and practical route to approximate both the lifetimes and positions of resonance states, achieving an accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art wavefunction-based methods.

Title: Hybrid Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks To Inverse Design Metasurfaces For Incident Angle-Independent Unidirectional Transmission
Authors: Sreeraj Rajan Warrier, Jayasri Dontabhaktuni
Abstract: Optimization of metasurface designs for specific functionality is a challenging problem due to the intricate relation between structural features and electromagnetic responses. Recently, many researchers resolved to inverse design of metasurfaces for efficient design parameters based on methods such as parameter optimization, evolutionary optimization and machine learning. In this paper a hybrid quantum machine learning method which uses quantum encoders to enhance the performance of a classical GAN is applied to implement inverse design of a metasurface. Aiming towards angle-independent unidirectional transmission, this approach combines a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to optimize metasurface designs. Incident-angle independent uni-directional transmission has potential applications in efficient solar cells, thermal cooling, non-reciprocal devices, etc. However, it is very challenging to achieve such a metasurface design via forward methods and hence very few studies exist till now in this direction. The methodology employed in this work reduces the data requirement for inverse design by 30% compared to conventional GAN-based methods. More importantly, the developed metasurface designs show high fidelity of 95% with regard to the targeted far-field radiation patterns. We also provide a material look-up table for feasible substitutes of the obtained material design with real materials and yet maintaining performance accuracy. Further, we embed the inverse-designed metasurfaces into Perovskite solar cell layers to demonstrate the improvement in its performance. We observe that the conversion efficiency of the example perovskite solar cell improves by 95% and remains independent of incident angle in the range -60$^\circ$ to 60$^\circ$ within the desired frequency range.

Title: Elastohydrodynamics of 3D chemically active filaments
Authors: Matthew D Butler, Benjamin J Walker, Thomas Montenegro-Johnson, Panayiota Katsamba
Abstract: Active deformable filaments exhibit a large range of qualitatively different three-dimensional dynamics, depending on their flexibility, the strength of the active forcing, and the surrounding environment. For a sufficiently strong activity, the resulting forces buckle the filament into different shapes, altering its dynamic behaviour. We investigate the dynamic behaviour of elastic, chemically propelled phoretic filaments, combining two existing models; a local version of slender phoretic theory, which determines the resulting slip flows for chemically propelled filaments with a given shape and chemical patterning, is paired with an efficient method for capturing the elastohydrodynamics of a deformable filament in viscous flow to study the chemoelastohydrodynamics of filaments. As the activity increases, or equivalently the filament stiffness decreases, these filaments undergo buckling instabilities that alter their behaviour from rigid rods. We follow their behaviour well beyond the buckling threshold to find a rich array of dynamics, including motions that may be described as planar swimming, circling, pinwheeling, flapping and diffusive.

Title: High-power readout of a transmon qubit using a nonlinear coupling
Authors: Cyril Mori, Vladimir Milchakov, Francesca D'Esposito, Lucas Ruela, Shelender Kumar, Vishnu Narayanan Suresh, Waël Ardati, Dorian Nicolas, Quentin Ficheux, Nicolas Roch, Tomás Ramos, Olivier Buisson
Abstract: The field of superconducting qubits is constantly evolving with new circuit designs. However, when it comes to qubit readout, the use of simple transverse linear coupling remains overwhelmingly prevalent. This standard readout scheme has significant drawbacks: in addition to the Purcell effect, it suffers from a limitation on the maximal number of photons in the readout mode, which restricts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) nature of the readout. Here, we explore the high-power regime by engineering a nonlinear coupling between a transmon qubit and its readout mode. Our approach builds upon previous work by Dassonneville et al. [Physical Review X 10, 011045 (2020)], on qubit readout with a non-perturbative cross-Kerr coupling in a transmon molecule. We demonstrate a readout fidelity of 99.21% with 89 photons utilizing a parametric amplifier. At this elevated photon number, the QND nature remains high at 96.7%. Even with up to 300 photons, the QNDness is only reduced by a few percent. This is qualitatively explained by deriving a critical number of photons associated to the nonlinear coupling, yielding a theoretical value of $\bar{n}_r^\text{crit} = 377$ photons for our sample's parameters. These results highlight the promising performance of the transmon molecule in the high-power regime for high-fidelity qubit readout.

Abstract: We give some results relating asymptotic characterisations of maximum entropy probability measures to characterisations of Bayes optimal classifiers. Our main theorems show that maximum entropy is a universally Bayes optimal decision rule given constraints on one's knowledge about some observed data in terms of an expected loss. We will extend this result to the case of uncertainty in the observations of expected losses by generalising Sanov's theorem to distributions of constraint values.

Title: Universal quantum melting of quasiperiodic attractors in driven-dissipative cavities
Authors: Caroline Nowoczyn, Ludwig Mathey, Kilian Seibold
Abstract: Nonlinear classical mechanics has established countless intriguing and profound phenomena. These include limit tori defined by toroidal attractors that support quasiperiodic motion of at least two incommensurate frequencies. Here we address the question, whether and how such phenomena persist in open quantum systems. We develop a quantum description of limit tori within the Lindblad master-equation formalism for a system of two coupled driven-dissipative Kerr cavities. Using the spectral theory of the Liouvillian and the truncated Wigner approximation, we analyze the system across the quantum-to-classical transition. In the classical limit, we identify two pairs of purely imaginary Liouvillian eigenvalues, corresponding to persistent quasiperiodic modes of the limit torus. Quantum fluctuations induce small negative real parts to these eigenvalues, giving rise to finite lifetimes of these modes. The corresponding Liouvillian gaps vanish algebraically in the classical limit. This behavior signals a genuine continuous dynamical phase transition, marked by the spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry. Analysis of individual quantum trajectories reveals quantum-fluctuation-induced dephasing as the primary mechanism behind this "quantum melting" of the torus. We quantify this dephasing using a circular-variance-based order parameter, revealing universal scaling with both system size and time. These scaling laws are robust and independent of microscopic parameters. Our results establish the quantum melting of limit tori as a distinct non-equilibrium critical phenomenon and provide concrete signatures for experimental observation in trapped ions and superconducting circuits.

Title: Entanglement transitions in structured and random nonunitary Gaussian circuits
Authors: Bastien Lapierre, Liang-Hong Mo, Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: We study measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum circuits consisting of kicked Ising models with postselected weak measurements, whose dynamics can be mapped onto a classical dynamical system. For a periodic (Floquet) non-unitary evolution, such circuits are exactly tractable and admit volume-to-area law transitions. We show that breaking time-translation symmetry down to a quasiperiodic (Fibonacci) time evolution leads to the emergence of a critical phase with tunable effective central charge and with a fractal origin. Furthermore, for some classes of random non-unitary circuits, we demonstrate the robustness of the volume-to-area law phase transition for arbitrary random realizations, thanks to the emergent compactness of the classical map encoding the circuit's dynamics.

Title: Geometric Modeling of a Line of Alternating Disclinations: Application to Grain Boundaries in Graphene
Authors: A. M. de M. Carvalho, C. Furtado
Abstract: We develop a conformal geometric model for grain boundaries in graphene based on a periodic line of alternating disclinations. Within the framework of (2+1)-dimensional gravity, we solve a reduced form of the Einstein equations to determine the conformal factor, from which the induced metric, scalar curvature, and holonomy are obtained analytically. Each pentagon-heptagon pair is modeled as a disclination dipole, forming a continuous distribution that captures the geometric signature of experimentally observed 5-7 grain boundaries. We show that the curvature is localized near the defect line and that the geometry becomes asymptotically flat, with trivial holonomy at large distances. This construction provides a tractable and physically consistent realization of the Katanaev-Volovich framework, connecting topological defect theory with atomistic features of graphene.

Title: Distributed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Large-Scale Electronic Structure Prediction
Authors: Manasa Kaniselvan, Alexander Maeder, Chen Hao Xia, Alexandros Nikolaos Ziogas, Mathieu Luisier
Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases. However, as interactions between atomic orbitals typically extend over 10+ angstroms, the graph representations required for this task tend to be densely connected, and the memory requirements to perform training and inference on these large structures can exceed the limits of modern GPUs. Here we present a distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to 128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.

Title: Understanding Reaction Mechanisms from Start to Finish
Authors: Rik S. Breebaart, Gianmarco Lazzeri, Roberto Covino, Peter G. Bolhuis
Abstract: Understanding mechanisms of rare but important events in complex molecular systems, such as protein folding or ligand (un)binding, requires accurately mapping transition paths from an initial to a final state. The committor is the ideal reaction coordinate for this purpose, but calculating it for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems has long been considered intractable. Here, we introduce an iterative path sampling strategy for computing the committor function for systems with high free energy barriers. We start with an initial guess to define isocommittor interfaces for transition interface sampling. The resulting path ensemble is then reweighted and used to train a neural network, yielding a more accurate committor model. This process is repeated until convergence, effectively solving the long-standing circular problem in enhanced sampling where a good reaction coordinate is needed to generate efficient sampling, and vice-versa. The final, converged committor model can be interrogated to extract mechanistic insights. We demonstrate the power of our method on a benchmark 2D potential and a more complex host-guest (un)binding process in explicit solvent.

Title: Ergotropy of a Photosynthetic Reaction Center
Authors: Trishna Kalita, Manash Jyoti Sarmah, Javed Akhtar, Himangshu Prabal Goswami
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the Photosystem II reaction center using a quantum master equation approach, where excitonic and charge-transfer rates are computed at the Redfield and Förster levels with realistic spectral densities. The focus is on ergotropy, the maximum work extractable from a quantum state without energy loss. We compute the ergotropy by constructing passive states in the thermodynamic sense. Among the electron transfer pathways, those involving charge separation between $Chl_{D1}$ and $Phe_{D1}$, as well as a route passing through three sequential charge-separated states, yield higher ergotropy, suggesting greater capacity for work extraction, akin to quantum energy capacitors. A third pathway, bypassing the $Chl_{D1},Phe_{D1}$ pair, shows significantly reduced ergotropy. These differences arise from population-induced transitions between active and passive regimes. Our findings highlight how biological systems may exploit non-equilibrium population structures to optimize energy conversion, connecting quantum thermodynamic principles to biological energy harvesting.

Title: Unraveling Quantum Size-Dependent Optoelectrical Phenomena in Hot Carrier Quantum Well Structures
Authors: Nil Selen Aydin, Leopold Rothmayer, Nabi Isaev, Pavel Avdienko, Nori N. Chavira Leal, Kai Müller, Jonathan J. Finley, Gregor Koblmüller, Hamidreza Esmaielpour
Abstract: The enhancement of power conversion efficiency beyond the theoretical limit of single-junction solar cells is a key objective in the advancement of hot carrier solar cells. Recent findings indicate that quantum wells (QWs) can effectively generate hot carriers by confining charged carriers within their potential wells and by optimizing material properties. Here, we investigate the impact of quantum confinement on the thermodynamic properties of photogenerated hot carriers in p-i-n InGaAs/InAlAs heterostructure diodes, utilizing QW thicknesses of 4 nm, 5.5 nm, and 7.5 nm. The optical properties of these nanostructures reveal significant hot carrier effects at various lattice temperatures, with a pronounced effect noted at lower temperatures. The experimental results indicate that the widest QW exhibits stronger hot carrier effects than the thinner QWs. Additionally, the open-circuit voltage of the samples demonstrates a correlation with the degree of quantum confinement, mirroring trends observed in the quasi-Fermi level splitting of hot carriers. However, the magnitudes recorded exceed the bandgap of the quantum structures, suggesting that this behavior may be influenced by the barrier layer. Furthermore, the short-circuit current of the samples reveals a strong dependence on excitation power, but not on the degree of quantum confinement. This indicates that the majority of the photocurrent is generated in the barrier, with negligible contributions from photogenerated carriers within the QWs. This study provides insights into the role of quantum confinement on the opto-electrical properties of non-equilibrium hot carrier populations in QW structures.

Title: Model selection for stochastic dynamics: a parsimonious and principled approach
Authors: Andonis Gerardos
Abstract: This thesis focuses on the discovery of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) from noisy and discrete time series. A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible correct model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard information criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited. We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information criterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\mathcal{B} \ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of candidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model ($n_\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance threshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more parameters than necessary when comparing many models. Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for SDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC, cross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model identification and predictive capability. Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals ($\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\sigma$), which can impair model learning and selection capabilities. To address this, we have developed robust variants of PASTIS, PASTIS-$\Delta t$ and PASTIS-$\sigma$, thus extending the applicability of the approach to imperfect experimental data. PASTIS thus provides a statistically grounded, validated, and practical methodological framework for discovering simple models for processes with stochastic dynamics.

Title: Transfer Learning in Infinite Width Feature Learning Networks
Authors: Clarissa Lauditi, Blake Bordelon, Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling, feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment on the utility of transfer learning.

Title: New Molecular Dynamics Methods for Simulating Neutron Star Crusts with Superfluid Vortices
Authors: M. E. Caplan, N. T. Smith
Abstract: Superfluid vortices in neutron star crusts are thought to be pinned to the lattice of nuclei in the crust. The unpinning of superfluid vortices in spin glitches therefore motivates us to study the vortex-crust interaction explicitly with molecular dynamics. In this work, we present a new molecular dynamics methods to characterize the response of the crust to a rigid vortex. When vortex pinning forces and nearest neighbor Coulomb forces are comparable, we observe a qualitatively new phenomena of lattice entrainment with implications for the elastic evolution of the crust.

Title: Exceptional point rings and $PT$-symmetry in the non-Hermitian XY model
Authors: Robert A. Henry, D.C. Liu, Murray T. Batchelor
Abstract: The XY spin chain is a paradigmatic example of a model solved by free fermions, in which the energy eigenspectrum is built from combinations of quasi-energies. In this article we show that by extending the XY model's anisotropy parameter $\lambda$ to complex values, it is possible for two of the quasi-energies to become degenerate. In the non-Hermitian XY model these quasi-energy degeneracies give rise to exceptional points (EPs) where two of the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. The distinct $\lambda$ values at which EPs appear form concentric rings in the complex plane which are shown in the infinite system size limit to converge to the unit circle coinciding with the boundary between distinct topological phases. The non-Hermitian model is also seen to possess a line of broken $PT$ symmetry along the pure imaginary $\lambda$-axis. For finite systems, there are four EP values on this broken $PT$-symmetric line if the system size is a multiple of 4.

Title: Numerical search for states with constant enstrophy flux over finite time intervals in two-dimensional turbulence
Authors: Kyo Yoshida
Abstract: An ensemble model of turbulence based on states with constant flux in wavenumber space was proposed in [K. Yoshida, Phys. Rev. E, 106, 045106 (2022)]. The justification of this ensemble model relies on the conjecture that almost all states with constant flux correspond to turbulence states. To verify this conjecture, a numerical search for states with constant enstrophy flux in wavenumber space over finite time intervals in two-dimension turbulence is conducted using a Monte Carlo method. Properties of the obtained states, such as energy spectrum and spectra related to fourth-order moments, are examined and compared with those of turbulence states obtained from direct numerical simulations. The dependence of the obtained states on the time interval and the initial conditions used in the numerical search is also discussed.

Title: Spin-dependent routing of optical beams in the bulk of twisted anisotropic media
Authors: Chandroth P. Jisha, Lorenzo Marrucci, Stefan Nolte, Alessandro Alberucci
Abstract: We theoretically discuss a new kind of photonic spin-Hall effect (PSHE) for optical beams propagating inside an inhomogeneously twisted anisotropic material. The rotation angle plays the role of an effective gauge field. When the twisting distribution is odd symmetric, the optical beams move along mirror-symmetric trajectories according to their helicity. Connection of this volumetric PSHE with the geometric phase and the Kapitza effect is elucidated.

Title: What is emergence, after all?
Authors: Abbas K. Rizi
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable, physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By disentangling emergence from vague overuse, we emphasize its role as a rigorous tool for understanding complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.

Title: Universal Bound States in Long-range Spin Chains with an Impurity
Authors: Ning Sun, Lei Feng, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: Understanding how quasi-particles interact with impurities is crucial for unveiling novel properties of quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the enhanced scattering between electrons and magnetic impurities in the low-energy limit, which gives rise to the Kondo effect. In this letter, motivated by recent developments in quantum simulation platforms, we investigate the universal behavior of long-range quantum spin chains with a single local impurity, focusing on systems that conserve the magnon number. Using effective field theory, we show that distinct classes of universal three-magnon states can emerge when the impurity-mediated two-magnon interaction is on resonance. When the long-range coupling decays as $1/r^\alpha$, we find that (i) for $\alpha\in (2,2.89)$, the system exhibits Efimov effects, with the three-body binding energy forming a geometric series $\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-n (\alpha-1) \pi/s_0(\alpha)$, (ii) for $\alpha=2$, the system shows semi-super Efimov effects with $\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-(n\pi-\theta)^2/8$. Our theoretical prediction is validated by the numerical solution of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian equation. Our results could be tested experimentally in the future on quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Structure and dynamics jointly stabilize the international trade hypergraph
Authors: Jung-Ho Kim, Sudo Yi, Sang-Hwan Gwak, K.-I. Goh, D.-S. Lee
Abstract: Understanding how fluctuations arise and spread in the international trade system can help assess the current state and guide future developments. We analyze the world trade data to investigate strong adverse fluctuations, characterized here as `collapsed trades' -- individual trades that experience significant declines in annual trade volume compared to the previous year. Adopting a hypergraph framework for a fine-scale trade-centric representation of international trade, we find that collapsed trades are clustered similar to infectious disease outbreaks in societies. Moreover, the portion of collapsed trades is found to be negatively correlated with trade volume. We develop a collapse propagation model, an epidemic-like model with a weight-dependent infection rate, that reproduces all the essential empirical features. Through both analytical and numerical analysis, we identify two key factors that synergistically suppress the onset of global collective collapse and serve as a joint stabilizing mechanism for the international economy: i) a positive correlation between a trade's degree (the number of adjacent trades) and its volume and ii) an algebraically decaying infection rate with trade volume. In particular, the second factor weakened during the 2008--2009 global economic recession, possibly explaining the broader spread of collapse.

Title: Work and entropy of mixing in isolated quantum systems
Authors: Budhaditya Bhattacharjee, Rohit Kishan Ray, Dominik Šafránek
Abstract: The mixing of two different gases is one of the most common natural phenomena, with applications ranging from CO$_2$ capture to water purification. Traditionally, mixing is analyzed in the context of local thermal equilibrium, where systems exchange energy with a heat bath. Here, we study mixing in an isolated system with potentially non-equilibrium initial states, characterized solely by macroscopic observables. We identify the entropy of mixing as a special case of observational entropy within an observer-dependent framework, where both entropy and extractable work depend on the resolution of measurement. This approach naturally resolves the Gibbs mixing paradox in quantum systems: while an observer experiences a discontinuous increase in entropy upon learning of the existence of two particle types, this knowledge does not provide an advantage in work extraction if the types of particles remain operationally indistinguishable in their measurements. Finally, we derive a Landauer-like bound on the difference in energy extracted by two observers, where an "observational temperature" emerges, determined by the accessible information. These results provide a foundation for rigorously determining the energy required to unmix in non-equilibrium settings and extend beyond quantum systems, offering insights into the thermodynamics of isolated classical gases.

Title: Disentangling strategies and entanglement transitions in unitary circuit games with matchgates
Authors: Raúl Morral-Yepes, Marc Langer, Adam Gammon-Smith, Barbara Kraus, Frank Pollmann
Abstract: In unitary circuit games, two competing parties, an "entangler" and a "disentangler", can induce an entanglement phase transition in a quantum many-body system. The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which we characterize both numerically and analytically.

Title: Electronic Bridge processes in $^{229}$Th-doped LiCAF and LiSAF
Authors: Tobias Kirschbaum, Martin Pimon, Andreas Grüneis, Thorsten Schumm, Adriana Pálffy
Abstract: Electronic bridge mechanisms driving the $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition in the vacuum-ultraviolet-transparent crystals $^{229}$Th:LiCAF (LiCaAlF$_6$) and $^{229}$Th:LiSAF (LiSrAlF$_6$) are investigated theoretically. Due to doping-induced symmetry breaking within the host crystal, electronic defect states emerge around the thorium nucleus and can facilitate nuclear (de)excitation via laser-assisted electronic bridge mechanisms. We investigate spontaneous and laser-assisted electronic bridge schemes for different charge compensation mechanisms. While the calculated spontaneous electronic bridge rates are very small, laser-assisted electronic bridge schemes for nuclear (de)excitation turn out to be significantly more efficient than both spontaneous nuclear decay and direct laser excitation, offering promising prospects for the future clock operation.

Title: Deep Learning to Automate Parameter Extraction and Model Fitting of Two-Dimensional Transistors
Authors: Robert K. A. Bennett, Jan-Lucas Uslu, Harmon F. Gault, Asir Intisar Khan, Lauren Hoang, Tara Peña, Kathryn Neilson, Young Suh Song, Zhepeng Zhang, Andrew J. Mannix, Eric Pop
Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g., mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional (2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500 devices, a factor >40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently, fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models, including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination ($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets online.

Title: Intuitive dissection of the Gaussian information bottleneck method with an application to optimal prediction
Authors: Vahe Galstyan, Age Tjalma, Pieter Rein ten Wolde
Abstract: Efficient signal representation is essential for the functioning of living and artificial systems operating under resource constraints. A widely recognized framework for deriving such representations is the information bottleneck method, which yields the optimal strategy for encoding a random variable, such as the signal, in a way that preserves maximal information about a functionally relevant variable, subject to an explicit constraint on the amount of information encoded. While in its general formulation the method is numerical, it admits an analytical solution in an important special case where the variables involved are jointly Gaussian. In this setting, the solution predicts discrete transitions in the dimensionality of the optimal representation as the encoding capacity is increased. Although these signature transitions, along with other features of the optimal strategy, can be derived from a constrained optimization problem, a clear and intuitive understanding of their emergence is still lacking. In our work, we advance our understanding of the Gaussian information bottleneck method through multiple mutually enriching perspectives, including geometric and information-theoretic ones. These perspectives offer novel intuition about the set of optimal encoding directions, the nature of the critical points where the optimal number of encoding components changes, and about the way the optimal strategy navigates between these critical points. We then apply our treatment of the method to a previously studied signal prediction problem, obtaining new insights on how different features of the signal are encoded across multiple components to enable optimal prediction of future signals. Altogether, our work deepens the foundational understanding of the information bottleneck method in the Gaussian setting, motivating the exploration of analogous perspectives in broader, non-Gaussian contexts.

Title: An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice
Authors: David E. Evans, Corey Jones
Abstract: We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the invariant operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries of a tensor product spin chain if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an on-site action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem. Using this, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exists gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain. Finally, we apply our framework to show that any state covariant under an anomalous Kramers-Wannier type duality must be gapless.

Title: Physics-Guided Dual Implicit Neural Representations for Source Separation
Authors: Yuan Ni, Zhantao Chen, Alexander N. Petsch, Edmund Xu, Cheng Peng, Alexander I. Kolesnikov, Sugata Chowdhury, Arun Bansil, Jana B. Thayer, Joshua J. Turner
Abstract: Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this, we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.

Title: Stealthy-Hyperuniform Wave Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Photonic Crystals
Authors: Maria Barsukova, Zeyu Zhang, Brian Gould, Koorosh Sadri, Christian Rosiek, Søren Stobbe, Jonas Karcher, Mikael C. Rechtsman
Abstract: Hyperuniform structures are spatial patterns whose fluctuations disappear on long length scales, making them effectively homogeneous when observed from afar. Mathematically, this means that their spectral density, $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, approaches zero for low wavenumber, $|\textbf{k}|$. Crystalline lattices are hyperuniform, as are certain quasicrystals, maximally random jammed packing of spheres, and electrons in the fractional quantum Hall state. Stealthy-hyperuniformity is an even stronger constraint on the spectral density: it requires that $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$ is strictly zero in a finite range of wavevectors around $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{0}$, called the stealthy regime, or exclusion region. Since the degree of scattering by disorder is, to leading order, proportional to $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, waves propagating through such structures may do so without scattering for sufficiently long wavelengths and short distances. Here, we measure scattering by disorder in photonic crystal slabs with stealthy-hyperuniform disorder by measuring the linewidths of the photonic bands. We observe the transition between the stealthy and non-stealthy regimes, marked by a sharp increase in linewidth. We also observe the effects of multiple scattering in the stealthy regime, which implies diminishing transparency. Moreover, we show that residual single scattering in the stealthy regime arises from an intrinsically non-Hermitian effect: propagating light has a complex effective mass due to radiative loss out of the slab.

Title: Circuit complexity and functionality: a thermodynamic perspective
Authors: Claudio Chamon, Andrei E. Ruckenstein, Eduardo R. Mucciolo, Ran Canetti
Abstract: Circuit complexity, defined as the minimum circuit size required for implementing a particular Boolean computation, is a foundational concept in computer science. Determining circuit complexity is believed to be a hard computational problem [1,2,3]. Recently, in the context of black holes, circuit complexity has been promoted to a physical property, wherein the growth of complexity is reflected in the time evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (``wormhole'') connecting the two sides of an AdS ``eternal'' black hole [4]. Here we are motivated by an independent set of considerations and explore links between complexity and thermodynamics for functionally-equivalent circuits, making the physics-inspired approach relevant to real computational problems, for which functionality is the key element of interest. In particular, our thermodynamic framework provides a new perspective on the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length -- an important problem in cryptography -- as thermalization through recursive mixing of neighboring sections of a circuit, which can be viewed as the mixing of two containers with ``gases of gates''. This recursive process equilibrates the average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies that there are circuits of same size and functionality that cannot be connected via a polynomial number of local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide.

Title: Clay metaBrick-based motif to enhance thermal and acoustic insulation
Authors: Brahim Lemkalli, Saad Bensallam, Muamer Kadic, Sébastien Guenneau, Hicham Jakjoud, Abdellah Mir, Younes Achaoui
Abstract: Acoustic metamaterials have gained popularity as promising materials for enhancing noise reduction. Here, we explore the use of metamaterials, based on Helmholtz resonators (HRs), to enhance the performance of standard clay hollow brick. By incorporating HRs in the upper and lower hollows, we transform the standard brick into metaBrick, which is essentially designed based on metamaterial principles. We evaluate the acoustic and thermal performance of walls constructed with clay metaBricks, focusing on sound transmission loss and heat resistance. Both the finite element method and experimental analysis were employed to highlight the performance of metaBricks compared to standard clay bricks. Results show that metaBricks significantly enhance acoustic and thermal insulation, achieving an attenuation of $20$ \si{dB} across a broad frequency range from $500$ to $2500$ \si{Hz} and an $8$\% increase in thermal resistance. However, compressive strength is reduced by $33$\%, though it remains above the standard requirements for building materials. These findings indicate that metaBrick is a promising building material, offering improved sound and thermal insulation.

Title: Fractional corner charges in threefold-symmetric two-dimensional materials with fragile topology
Authors: Olga Arroyo-Gascón, Sergio Bravo, Leonor Chico, Mónica Pacheco
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of the signatures of fragile topology in over 50 nonmagnetic two-dimensional materials with formula AB$_2$, belonging to space group $P$-$3m1$. Using group theory analysis in the framework of topological quantum chemistry, we find fragile bands near the Fermi level for all the materials studied. Since stable topological bands are also present in these systems, the interplay of both phases is discussed, showing that corner charges appear in over 80% of the materials and are linked to fragile topology. Using first-principles calculations, we predict fractionally-charged corner charges protected by $C_3$ symmetry. Our work aims to broaden the scope of materials with experimentally accessible fragile bands.

Title: Density-matrix renormalization group algorithm for non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Peigeng Zhong, Wei Pan, Haiqing Lin, Xiaoqun Wang, Shijie Hu
Abstract: A biorthonormal-block density-matrix renormalization group algorithm is proposed to accurately compute properties of large-scale non-Hermitian many-body systems, in which a renormalized-space partition of the non-Hermitian reduced density matrix is implemented to fulfill the prerequisite for the biorthonormality of the renormalization group (RG) transformation and to optimize the construction of saved Hilbert spaces. A redundancy in saved spaces of the reduced density matrix is exploited to reduce a condition number resulting from the non-unitarity of the left and right transformation matrices, in order to ensure the numerical stability of the RG procedure. The algorithm is successfully applied to an interacting fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with nonreciprocal hoppings and staggered complex chemical potential, exhibiting novel many-body phenomena.

Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated nanoparticles derived from natural cellulose, with potential applications ranging from rheological modifiers and emulsion stabilizers to photonic pigments and sensors. For most applications, precise control over CNC morphology and surface chemistry is essential, but the relationship between process parameters, CNC characteristics, and their resulting behavior is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of centrifugation and ionic strength on CNC morphology after dialysis using transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and scanning electron diffraction. We find that the centrifugation step commonly applied during CNC purification promotes the formation of compact composite nanoparticles made of aligned crystallites, referred to as 'bundles', that are associated preferentially along their hydrophobic faces. In stark contrast, transient exposure to high ionic strength leads to fractal-like, irregular composite nanoparticles. We then examine the consequence of these morphological differences on the cholesteric self-organization of the CNCs: aligned bundles reduce the cholesteric pitch in suspension, causing a blue-shift in the color of dish-cast photonic films, while misaligned particles promote gelation, producing colorless films. This study reveals the importance of sample history, in particular, the often-disregarded purification steps, on CNC characteristics and their ensemble behavior, thereby unlocking new routes for tailoring this promising nanomaterial.

Title: Low-rank quantics tensor train representations of Feynman diagrams for multiorbital electron-phonon models
Authors: Hirone Ishida, Natsuki Okada, Shintaro Hoshino, Hiroshi Shinaoka (Department of Physics, Saitama University, Japan.)
Abstract: Feynman diagrams are an essential tool for simulating strongly correlated electron systems. However, stochastic quantum Monte Carlo sampling suffers from the sign problem, particularly when solving a multiorbital quantum impurity model. Recently, two approaches have been proposed for efficient numerical treatment of Feynman diagrams: Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI) to replace stochastic sampling and the Quantics Tensor Train (QTT) representation for compressing space-time dependence. One of the remaining challenges is the nontrivial task of identifying low-rank structures in weak-coupling Feynman diagrams for multiorbital electron-phonon systems. In particular, the traditional TCI algorithm faces an ergodicity problem, which prevents it from fully exploring the multiorbital space. To address this, we incorporate a new algorithm called global search, which resolves this issue. By combining this approach with QTT, we uncover low-rank structures and achieve efficient numerical integration with exponential resolution in time and faster-than-power-law convergence of error relative to computational cost. Additionally, our approach does not require the division of discontinuous regions necessary in non-quantics TCI.

Title: Thermally-induced mimicry of quantum cluster excitations and implications for the magnetic transition in FePSe$_3$
Authors: Harry Lane, Martin Mourigal
Abstract: In two dimensional magnets, the interplay of thermal fluctuations and spin anisotropy control the existence of long-range magnetic order. In the van der Waals antiferromagnets FePX$_3$, orbital degeneracy in the $t2g$ levels of the Fe$^{2+}$ ions in octahedral coordination yields strong uniaxial anisotropy, which stabilizes magnetic order up to T$\approx$100 K. Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements around the magnetic ordering transition have shown the existence of a broad spectrum of magnetic fluctuations with nontrivial momentum dependence, which has been interpreted as evidence for localized entangled cluster excitations. In this paper, we offer an alternative interpretation using classical nonlinear spin dynamics simulations. We present stochastic Landau Lifshitz dynamics simulations that reproduce the neutron scattering measurements of Chen et al. [npj Quantum Mater. 9, 40 (2024)] on FePSe$_3$. These calculations faithfully explain the dynamical structure factor's momentum and energy dependence and point to a classical origin for the excitations observed in neutron spectroscopy and that the order-disorder transition can be understood in terms of thermal fluctuations overcoming the anisotropy energy.

Title: Superconductivity from spin-canting fluctuations in rhombohedral graphene
Authors: Zhiyu Dong, Étienne Lantagne-Hurtubise, Jason Alicea
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports soft magnon modes. In particular, we show that these soft modes can mediate pairing through inter-band scattering events that are symmetry-forbidden in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, thus providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.

Title: Discrete-time thermodynamic speed limit
Authors: Sangyun Lee, Jae Sung Lee, Jong-Min Park
Abstract: As a fundamental thermodynamic principle, speed limits reveal the lower bound of entropy production (EP) required for a system to transition from a given initial state to a final state. While various speed limits have been developed for continuous-time Markov processes, their application to discrete-time Markov chains remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the speed limits in discrete-time Markov chains, focusing on two types of EP commonly used to measure the irreversibility of a discrete-time process: time-reversed EP and time-backward EP. We find that time-reversed EP satisfies the speed limit for the continuous-time Markov processes, whereas time-backward EP does not. Additionally, for time-reversed EP, we derive practical speed limits applicable to systems driven by cyclic protocols or with unidirectional transitions, where conventional speed limits become meaningless or invalid. We show that these relations also hold for continuous-time Markov processes by taking the time-continuum limit of our results. Finally, we validate our findings through several examples.

Title: Pair Density Waves and Supercurrent Diode Effect in Altermagnets
Authors: GiBaik Sim, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: Metallic altermagnets are unusual collinear magnets that feature zero net magnetization with momentum-dependent spin splitting. Here, we show that this spin splitting can induce pair density wave states even in the absence of external magnetic fields. Focusing on BCS-type attractive interactions, we find the stabilization of symmetrically distinct pair density wave states depending on the chemical potential. These states include Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states, both of which break inversion symmetry. We investigate the supercurrent properties and discover non-reciprocal supercurrents for both the Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states with distinct spatial dependencies. We propose that the supercurrent diode effect can serve as an experimental tool for distinguishing between different pair density waves in metallic altermagnets and discuss the relation to material candidates.

Title: Left-left-right-right magnetic order in spin-1/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg chain
Authors: Wang Yang, Chao Xu, Shicheng Ma, Alberto Nocera, Ian Affleck
Abstract: In this work, we perform a combination of analytical and numerical studies on the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg chain in the region of negative Kitaev and positive Heisenberg couplings. Apart from the antiferromagnetic phase, we find a magnetically ordered phase with left-left-right-right order and a gapless phase with central charge value $c=1$, resolving the existing contradictory results in literature regarding this parameter region. In particular, the origin of the left-left-right-right order is clarified based on a perturbative Luttinger liquid analysis. The left-left-right-right phase is further shown to persist in the Kitaev-Heisenberg-Gamma model when a small nonzero Gamma interaction is introduced. Using a coupled-chain method, we also demonstrate that the one-dimensional (1D) left-left-right-right order gives a quasi-1D explanation for the 2D stripy order of the same model on the honeycomb lattice.

Title: Large-$N$ SU(4) Schwinger boson theory for coupled-dimer antiferromagnets
Authors: Shang-Shun Zhang, Yasuyuki Kato, E. A. Ghioldi, L. O. Manuel, A. E. Trumper, Cristian D. Batista
Abstract: We develop a systematic large-$N$ expansion based on the Schwinger boson representation of SU(4) coherent states of dimers for the paradigmatic spin-$1/2$ bilayer square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. This system exhibits a quantum phase transition between a quantum paramagnetic state and a Néel order state, driven by the coupling constant $g = J'/J$, which is defined as the ratio between the inter-dimer $J'$ and intra-dimer $J$ exchange interactions. We demonstrate that this approach accurately describes static and dynamic properties on both sides of the quantum phase transition. The critical coupling constant $g_c \approx 0.42$ and the dynamic spin structure factor reproduce quantum Monte Carlo results with high precision. Notably, the $1/N$ corrections reveal the longitudinal mode of the magnetically ordered phase along with the overdamping caused by its decay into the two-magnon continuum. The present large-$N$ $SU(N)$ Schwinger boson theory can be extended to more general cases of quantum paramagnets that undergo a quantum phase transition into magnetically ordered states.

Title: Breakdown of boundary criticality and exotic topological semimetals in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems
Authors: Hong Wu, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: It was recently found that, going beyond the tendfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and violating the bulk-boundary correspondence of the usual topological phases, PT-invariant systems support a real Chern insulator with the so-called boundary criticality, which forbids the transition between different orders of topological phases accompanied by the closing and reopening of the bulk-band gap. Here, we fnd that the periodic driving can break the boundary criticality of a PT-invariant system. Setting free from the the boundary criticality, diverse first- and second-order topological phases absent in the static case are found in both the zero and Pi/T modes. The application of our result in the three-dimensional PT-invariant system permits us to discover exotic second-order Dirac and nodal-line semimetals with coexisting surface and hinge Fermi arcs. Enriching the family of the topological phases in PT-invariant systems, our result provides us a useful way to explore novel topological phases.

Title: The Basins of Attraction of Soft Sphere Packings Are Not Fractal
Authors: Praharsh Suryadevara, Mathias Casiulis, Stefano Martiniani
Abstract: The energy landscape plays a central role in understanding the dynamics of low-temperature and athermal systems, which are characterized by a plethora of minima and the intricate geometry of their basins of attraction. Due to their complexity, these landscapes resist analytical treatment and must instead be studied numerically. We focus on jammed soft spheres, a paradigmatic model of glasses and granulars, to expose the limitations of standard numerical methods in resolving the true structure of energy landscapes. We show that CVODE is the ODE solver with the best time-for-error trade-off, outperforming commonly used steepest-descent solvers by several orders of magnitude. Using this numerical approach, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies of soft sphere packings destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderately low dimensions. Employing a range of geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that earlier claims on the fractality of basins of attraction originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies. In reality, the basins of attraction of soft sphere packings are smooth structures with well-defined length scales.

Title: Simulation of charged nanotubes self-assembly during evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate
Authors: Konstantin S. Kolegov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya, Andrei V. Eserkepov, Ludia T. Khusainova
Abstract: The ability to control the morphology of the nanotube deposit formed during the evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate is of theoretical and practical interest. Such deposits are required for various applications including nanotechnology, medicine, biotechnology, and optronics. In the experiment of Zhao et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 440, 68 (2015)], an annular deposit was formed near the contact line. The deposition geometry is caused by the coffee ring effect. This deposit is unusual in its morphology. It changes gradually in space from a disordered structure in the inner part of the ring to an aligned structure of nanotubes close to the periphery. To understand the mechanisms that lead to this, we have developed a mathematical model that takes into account the effects of advection, diffusion, and electrostatic interactions on particle transport. Results of numerical calculations have confirmed that all these factors together have an influence on the formation of such a variable morphology. Qualitative agreement with the experiment is shown for some values of the model parameters.

Title: Collective action and entanglement of magnetically active liquid crystal elastomer ribbons

Abstract: Interactions between active individuals in animal collectives lead to emergent responses that remain elusive in synthetic soft matter. Here, shape-morphing polymers are used to create bio-inspired transient solids that self-assemble with controlled mechanical properties and disassemble on demand. Dilute-suspensions of magnetic, heat-responsive liquid crystal elastomer ribbons mechanically interlock, inducing reversible aggregation. A mathematical model is developed that sheds light on the role of topological mechanisms in aggregation. Aggregation was favored for ribbons with moderate curvature at 25C above crosslinking temperature as compared to flat ribbons or higher curvature ribbons at higher temperatures. The ribbon suspensions reversibly transition between fluid- and solid-like states, exhibiting up to 6 orders-of-magnitude increase in the storage moduli of the entangled aggregates compared with the liquid dispersions. Controlled dissociation is induced by imparting kinetic energy to the individual ribbons at high magnetic field rotation speeds (> 200 RPM). Ribbon shape and the medium in which dissociation occurs were shown to govern disassembly. Imparting dynamic collective behaviors into synthetic systems may enable a range of potential applications from bio-inspired soft robotics to injectable biomaterials.

Title: Imaging the Meissner effect in pressurized bilayer nickelate with integrated multi-parameter quantum sensor

Abstract: Recent reports on the signatures of high-temperature superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc close to 80 K have triggered great research interest and extensive follow-up studies. Although the zero resistance has been successfully achieved under improved hydrostatic pressure conditions, the Meissner effect of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ under high pressure remains controversial. Here, using shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers implanted on the culet of diamond anvils as in-situ quantum sensors, we observe compelling evidence for the Meissner effect in polycrystalline bilayer nickelate samples: the magnetic field expulsion during both field cooling and field warming processes. In particular, we explore the multiparameter measurement capacity of the diamond quantum sensors to extract the weak demagnetization signal of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$. The correlated measurements of Raman spectra and magnetic imaging indicate an incomplete structural transformation related to the displacement of oxygen ions emerging in the non-superconducting region. Our work clarifies the controversy about the Meissner effect of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ and contributes to the development of quantum sensing of weak signals under high-pressure conditions.

Title: Macroscopic Quantum States and Universal Correlations in a Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over a 1D Ground State
Authors: Vanja Marić, Florent Ferro, Maurizio Fagotti
Abstract: We consider translationally invariant quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains with local interactions and a discrete symmetry that is spontaneously broken at zero temperature. We envision experimenters switching off the couplings between two parts of the system and preparing them in independent equilibrium states. One side of the chain is prepared in a disordered phase, and the other in a symmetry-breaking ground state. When the couplings are switched back on, time evolution ensues. We argue that in integrable systems the front separating the ordered region recedes at the maximal velocity of quasiparticle excitations over the ground state. We infer that, generically, the order parameters should vary on a subdiffusive scale of order $t^{1/3}$, where $t$ is time, and their fluctuations should exhibit the same scaling. This interfacial region exhibits full range correlations, indicating that it cannot be decomposed into nearly uncorrelated subsystems. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a case study, we demonstrate that all order parameters follow the same universal scaling functions. Through an analysis of the skew information, we uncover that the breakdown of cluster decomposition has a quantum contribution: each subsystem within the interfacial region, with extent comparable to the region, exists in a macroscopic quantum state.

Title: The transition from homeostasis to stochasticity induced catastrophe
Authors: Rudro R. Biswas, Charles S. Wright, Kunaal Joshi, Srividya Iyer-Biswas
Abstract: What are the signatures of the onset of catastrophe? Here we present the rich system physics characterizing the transition from homeostasis to stochasticity driven breakdown in an experimentally motivated minimal model. Recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing repeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown intergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic map governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative insights into the transition from the "conspiracy principle" regime (homeostasis) to the "catastrophe principle" regime and then to system breakdown. In fact, upon closer examination, the stochastic map turns out to be a one-dimensional Kesten process; these transitions occur as a single parameter, the strength of the multiplicative noise term, is continuously tuned. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with quantifiable power law tails, outlier driven extremal behavior and reverse monotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution characterize this transition to catastrophe. In turn, prevention of rapid increase in the extremal event-driven rate of failure, in the interest of system preservation, causes the catastrophe regime to be strategically unfavorable.

Title: Crystal Structure and Collective Oxygen Transport in the High-Temperature Phase of Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$
Authors: Sung-Hoon Lee, Ki-Ha Hong
Abstract: In crystalline materials, atomic motion is typically confined to vibrations within a fixed lattice, with substantial movement generally associated with defect migration. Here, we report an extraordinary collective ionic transport pathway in the high-temperature tetragonal phase of tantalum pentoxide (H-Ta$_2$O$_5$), whose crystal structure has remained unresolved until now. Our density functional theory calculations unequivocally determine the tetragonal structure to possess a four-fold screw-symmetric configuration derived from the known orthorhombic phase. The proposed structure aligns excellently with experimental lattice constants and transmission electron microscopy observations, resolving longstanding ambiguities regarding the atomic arrangement of H-Ta$_2$O$_5$. Remarkably, ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal an unexpected ionic transport mechanism: coordinated, floating-like motion of specific oxygen atoms occurring at temperatures as low as 500 K. This collective oxygen motion beyond simple vibrations occurs within the stoichiometric lattice. The calculated energy barrier is exceptionally low (~0.2 eV), an order of magnitude below typical crystalline diffusion barriers. This drastic barrier reduction arises from flexible lattice coordination around screw-rotation planes, providing extensive positional flexibility and effectively dissipating local charge imbalances near oxygen pathways. Our findings elucidate the intriguing phenomena of intrinsic and anisotropic oxygen conductivity in H-Ta$_2$O$_5$ and offer valuable insights for designing novel crystalline materials with enhanced ionic mobility.

Title: Bilayer Excitons in the Laughlin Fractional Quantum Hall State
Authors: Ron Q. Nguyen, Naiyuan J. Zhang, Navketan Khurana-Batra, Xiaoxue Liu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, D. E. Feldman, J.I.A. Li
Abstract: The Laughlin state embodies a universal class of fractional quantum Hall effects arising in two-dimensional electron systems subjected to strong perpendicular magnetic fields. Conventionally described by a single-component wavefunction, the Laughlin state features fractionally charged quasiparticles arising from correlations within one electron species. Here, we explore a novel physical situation by introducing inter-species Coulomb coupling between two intra-species Laughlin states in a quantum Hall graphene bilayer structure. Although quasiparticle excitations typically exhibit charge gaps of tens of Kelvin, we observe that this energy scale is significantly lowered through interlayer excitonic pairing between quasiparticles and quasiholes. Identified via transport measurements, these excitons belong to an unprecedented category of charge-neutral anyons, opening a new avenue for investigating exotic quantum statistics and phases of matter.

Title: Evidence for valence-bond pairing in a one-dimensional two-orbital system
Authors: M. Mierzejewski, E. Dagotto, J. Herbrych
Abstract: Valence bond (VB) states as the formation mechanism of Cooper pairs, eventually leading to high-temperature superconductivity, remain a controversial topic. Although various VB-like states find variational relevance in the description of specific spin models and quantum spin liquids, in the realm of many-body fermionic Hamiltonians, the evidence for such states as ground states wave functions remains elusive, challenging the valence-bond pairing mechanism. Here, we present evidence of a VB ground state with pairing tendencies, particularly at finite doping. We achieved this for the generic two-orbital Hubbard model in low dimension, where the VB states can be associated with the presence of the topological order manifested by edge states.

Title: Free energy of self-avoiding polymer chain confined between parallel walls
Authors: Marcio S. Gomes-Filho, Eugene M. Terentjev
Abstract: Understanding and computing the entropic forces exerted by polymer chains under confinement is important for many reasons, from research to applications. However, extracting properties related to the free energy, such as the force (or pressure) on confining walls, does not readily emerge from conventional polymer dynamics simulations due to the entropic contributions inherent in these free energies. Here we propose an alternative method to compute such forces, and the associated free energies, based on empirically measuring the average force required to confine a polymer chain between parallel walls connected by an artificial elastic spring. This measurement enables us to interpolate the expression for the free energy of a confined self-avoiding chain and offer an analytical expression to complement the classical theory of ideal chains in confined spaces. Therefore, the significance of our method extends beyond the findings of this paper: it can be effectively employed to investigate the confinement free energy across diverse scenarios where all kinds of polymer chains are confined in a gap between parallel walls.

Title: Strongly Magnetically Tuned Coupling Strength and Nonlinearity in CrSBr Exciton-Polaritons
Authors: Chun Li, Chao Shen, Xuekai Ma, Kwok Kwan Tang, Nai Jiang, Xinyi Deng, Qing Wan, Jiepeng Song, Jiaqi Guo, Tian Lan, Feng Li, Yilin Wang, Xinfeng Liu, Qing Zhang
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors CrSBr offer an ideal platform to achieve exciton-polaritons correlated with magnetic orders for developing solid-state quantum, spintronic, and photonic devices. However, for the exciton-polaritons formed by lower-energy excitons (XL = 1.37 eV), the coupling strength and nonlinear optical response are almost inert to the external magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate robust strong coupling between higher-energy excitons (XH = 1.8 eV) and photons that persists up to room temperature, along with giant magnetic-field tunability. The Rabi splitting energy is tuned up to 100 meV within a moderate 0.45 T in-plane magnetic field due to changes in excitonic states during the spin transitions. Besides, we observe significantly enhanced polariton nonlinearity in the intermediate magnetic phase, which exhibits a distinct mode-number dependence and originates from magnon-assisted long-range attractive interactions and coupling strength reduction. These results advance the development of on-demand polariton platforms for spin-correlated quantum optoelectronics.

Title: mumax+: extensible GPU-accelerated micromagnetics and beyond
Authors: Lars Moreels, Ian Lateur, Diego De Gusem, Jeroen Mulkers, Jonathan Maes, Milorad V. Milošević, Jonathan Leliaert, Bartel Van Waeyenberge
Abstract: We present mumax+, an extensible GPU-accelerated micromagnetic simulator with a Python user interface, to address the challenges posed by current magnetism research into systems with complex magnetic ordering and interfaces. It is a general solver for the space- and time-dependent evolution of the magnetization and related vector quantities, using finite difference discretization. Here, we present its application and design and discuss features not available in \mumaxthree{}, such as the modeling of antiferromagnets with magnetoelastic coupling. As an illustration of its capabilities, we use \mumaxp{} to simulate state of the art magnetic systems. Specifically, we demonstrate the current induced domain wall motion in a polycrystalline antiferromagnet, we simulate the working principle of a strain-driven antiferromagnetic racetrack memory and we reproduce experimentally observed domain structures in a non-collinear antiferromagnet.

Title: The morphology and interface structure of titanium on graphene
Authors: Joachim Dahl Thomsen, Wissam A. Saidi, Kate Reidy, Jatin J. Patil, Serin Lee, Frances M. Ross, Prineha Narang
Abstract: Titanium (Ti) is an adhesion and contact metal commonly used in nanoelectronics and two-dimensional (2D) materials research. However, when Ti is deposited on graphene (Gr), we obtain dramatically different film morphology depending on the experimental conditions. Through a combination of transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio density functional theory calculations, we show that the most critical parameters are the number of Gr layers, the nature of the Gr support, and the deposition temperature. Particularly distinctive is the island morphology and large defect density of Ti on monolayer Gr, compared to bilayer or thicker Gr. We propose that this results from structural and mechanical differences between monolayer and thicker Gr flakes, where monolayer Gr is more flexible, exhibits larger surface roughness and therefore lower Ti diffusivity, and is more easily damaged. Our results highlight the extreme sensitivity of Ti morphology on Gr to processing and substrate conditions, allowing us to propose design rules for controlling Ti-Gr interface properties and morphology and to discuss the implications for other technologically relevant metal deposition processes.

Title: Universal approach to light driven "superconductivity" via preformed pairs
Authors: Ke Wang, Zhiqiang Wang, Qijin Chen, K. Levin
Abstract: While there are many different mechanisms which have been proposed to understand the physics behind light induced ``superconductivity", what seems to be common to the class of materials in which this is observed are strong pairing correlations, which are present in the normal state. Here we argue, that the original ideas of Eliashberg are applicable to such a pseudogap phase and that with exposure to radiation the fermions are redistributed to higher energies where they are less deleterious to pairing. What results then is a photo-induced state with dramatically enhanced number of nearly condensed fermion pairs. In this phase, because the a.c. conductivity, $\sigma(\omega) = \sigma_1(\omega) + i \sigma_2(\omega)$, is dominated by the bosonic contribution, it can be computed using conventional (Aslamazov Larkin) fluctuation theory. We, thereby, observe the expected fingerprint of this photoinduced ``superconducting" state which is a $1/\omega$ dependence in $\sigma_2$ with fits to the data of the same quality as found for the so-called photo-enhanced (Drude) conductivity scenario. Here, however, we have a microscopic understanding of the characteristic low energy scale which appears in transport and which is necessarily temperature dependent. This approach also provides insight into recent observations of concomitant diamagnetic fluctuations. Our calculations suggest that the observed light-induced phase in these strongly paired superconductors has only short range phase coherence without long range superconducting order.

Title: Non-relativistic linear Edelstein effect in helical EuIn2As2
Authors: Nayra A. Álvarez Pari, Rodrigo Jaeschke-Ubiergo, Atasi Chakraborty, Libor Šmejkal, Jairo Sinova
Abstract: Motivated by the ongoing interest in understanding the actual magnetic ground state of the promising axion insulator candidate EuIn2As2, we present here a spin symmetry analysis and ab-initio calculations, aiming to identify specific exchange-dominated physics that could offer insights into the current debate. We investigate two non-collinear coplanar magnetic orders reported in this compound: the helical and broken helical phases. Our symmetry analysis shows that magnetic-exchange alone results in the formation of an out-of-plane odd-wave order in momentum space with a single un-polarized nodal plane in both phases. Additionally, we identified an in-plane g-wave order that emerges exclusively in the broken helical phase, providing a distinguishing feature for this phase. Furthermore, we report a non-relativistic Edelstein effect with a distinct out-of-plane polarized spin density that dominates over spin-orbit coupling effects. Our ab-initio calculations reveal a significant contrast in the magnitude of this effect between both phases, which could serve as a means to identify the magnetic transition and distinguish them from other magnetic ground states proposed for this compound.

Title: Field-Induced Magnon Decay, Magnon Shadows, and Roton-like Excitations in the Honeycomb Antiferromagnet YbBr$_3$

Abstract: Although the search for quantum many-body phenomena in magnetic materials has a strong focus on highly frustrated systems, even unfrustrated quantum magnets show a multitude of unconventional phenomena in their spin excitation spectra. YbBr$_3$ is an excellent realization of the $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, and we have performed detailed spectroscopic experiments with both unpolarized and polarized neutrons at all applied magnetic fields up to saturation. We observe extensive excitation continua, which cause strong renormalization and the decay of single magnons at higher fields, while coherent features include field-induced ``shadows'' of the single magnons and the spectacular emergence of a roton-like excitation. To guide and interpret our experiments, we performed systematic calculations by the method of cylinder matrix-product states that provide quantitative agreement with the neutron scattering data and a qualitative benchmark for the spectral signatures of strong quantum fluctuations even in the absence of magnetic frustration.

Title: Thermal Quench Dynamics of Visons in Gapless Kitaev Spin Liquid
Authors: Yang Yang, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: The relaxation dynamics of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a thermal quench is dominated by the quasi-stochastic diffusion and pair annihilation of visions, which are gapped flux excitations of an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field of the Kitaev spin liquid. Both the diffusion energy barrier as well as the effective interactions between visons are mediated by the Majorana fermions which are fractionalized quasiparticles of the spin liquid. Through extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the interplay between the thermal diffusion and nonlocal multi-vision interactions leads to a variety of temperature-dependent dynamical behaviors ranging from diffusion-limited and terminal-velocity-limited annihilation to dynamical arresting and freezing. Notably, we show that the freezing phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of metastable $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ vison crystals and a hidden coarsening of super-clusters associated with a broken $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry.

Title: Kinetic theory of decentralized learning for smart active matter
Authors: Gerhard Jung, Misaki Ozawa, Eric Bertin
Abstract: Smart active matter has the ability to control its motion guided by individual policies to achieve collective goals. We introduce a theoretical framework to study a decentralized learning process in which agents can locally exchange policies to adapt their behavior and maximize a predefined reward function. We use our formalism to derive explicit hydrodynamic equations for the policy dynamics. We apply the theory to two different microscopic models where policies correspond either to fixed parameters similar to evolutionary dynamics, or to state-dependent controllers known from the field of robotics. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and agent-based simulations. By deriving fundamental control parameters and uncertainty relations, our work lays the foundations for a statistical physics analysis of decentralized learning.

Title: Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach
Authors: Veljko Janković
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier--phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier--phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the general explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring appropriate hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).

Title: Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime
Authors: Veljko Janković
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side on timescales comparable to the phonon period. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum--classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.

Title: Classical Fractons: Local chaos, global broken ergodicity and an arrow of time
Authors: Aryaman Babbar, Ylias Sadki, Abhishodh Prakash, S. L. Sondhi
Abstract: We report new results on classical nonrelativistic dipole conserving particles - fractons. These have been previously shown to exhibit "Machian" dynamics where the motion of one particle requires the presence of others in its proximity, such that dynamics produces ergodicity breaking steady states characterized by clusters. In this work, we show that although the global state breaks ergodicity, a limited version of ergodic behavior is retained within the clusters which may or may not be chaotic, depending on the nature of the microscopic Hamiltonian. In certain cases, we show that the dynamics can be mapped to that of a billiards particle in various stadiums. We also show that the many-fracton trajectories characteristically exhibit a central time or "Janus point" and thus a generic nonequilibrium bidirectional arrow of time.

Title: Quasi-aperiodic grain boundary phases of Σ5 tilt grain boundaries in refractory metals
Authors: Enze Chen, Timofey Frolov
Abstract: We report new ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma$5[001] tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma$5 tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon, as validated through density functional theory calculations. Moreover, the atoms in the split kite phase demonstrate distinct collective diffusion dynamics. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.

Title: A Microcanonical Inflection Point Analysis via Parametric Curves and its Relation to the Zeros of the Partition Function
Authors: Julio Cesar Siqueira Rocha, Rodrigo Alves Dias, Bismarck Vaz da Costa
Abstract: In statistical physics, phase transitions are arguably among the most extensively studied phenomena. In the computational approach to this field, the development of algorithms capable of estimating entropy across the entire energy spectrum in a single execution has highlighted the efficacy of microcanonical inflection point analysis, while Fisher's zeros technique has re-emerged as a powerful methodology for investigating these phenomena. This paper presents an alternative protocol for analyzing phase transitions using a parametrization of the entropy function in the microcanonical ensemble. We also provide a clear demonstration of the relation of the linear pattern of the Fisher's zeros on the complex inverse temperature map (a circle in the complex $x=e^{-\beta \varepsilon}$ map) with the order of the transition, showing that the latent heat is inversely related to the distance between the zeros. We study various model systems, including the Lennard-Jones cluster, the Ising, the XY, and the Zeeman models. By examining the behavior of thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and its derivatives in the microcanonical ensemble, we identify key features-such as loops and discontinuities in parametric curves-which signal phase transitions' presence and nature. This approach can facilitate the classification of phase transitions across various physical systems.

Title: Unified description of viscous, viscoelastic, or elastic thin active films on substrates
Authors: Henning Reinken, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: It is frequent for active or living entities to find themselves embedded in a surrounding medium. Resulting composite systems are usually classified as either active fluids or active solids. Yet, in reality, particularly in the biological context, a broad spectrum of viscoelasticity exists in between these two limits. There, both viscous and elastic properties are combined. To bridge the gap between active fluids and active solids, we here systematically derive a unified continuum-theoretical framework. It covers viscous, viscoelastic, and elastic active materials. Our continuum equations are obtained by coarse-graining a discrete, agent-based microscopic dynamic description. In our subsequent analysis, we mainly focus on thin active films on supporting substrates. Strength of activity and degree of elasticity are used as control parameters that control the overall behavior. We concentrate on the analysis of transitions between spatially uniform analytical solutions of collective migration. These include isotropic and polar, orientationally ordered states. A stationary polar solution of persistent directed collective motion is observed for rather fluid-like systems. It corresponds to the ubiquitous swarming state observed in various kinds of dry and wet active matter. With increasing elasticity, persistent motion in one direction is prevented by elastic anchoring and restoring forces. As a consequence, rotations of the spatially uniform migration direction and associated flow occur. Our unified description allows to continuously tune the material behavior from viscous, via viscoelastic, to elastic active behavior by variation of a single parameter. Therefore, it allows in the future to investigate the time evolution of complex systems and biomaterials such as biofilms within one framework.

Title: Rheologically tuned modes of collective transport in active viscoelastic films
Authors: Henning Reinken, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: While many living biological media combine both viscous and elastic properties, most theoretical studies employ either purely fluid- or solid-like descriptions. We here use a unified framework for active films on substrates capable of describing a broad range of viscoelastic behavior to explore the interplay between activity and rheology. The core of the study is a comprehensive state diagram showing a rich world of spatiotemporal dynamic states. Our results demonstrate the potential of tunable rheology to realize modes of controlled active transport on the microscale.

Title: When Homogeneous Systems Meet Dissipation and Disorder
Authors: Xixi Feng, Ao Zhou, Feng Lu, Gao Xianlong, Shujie Cheng
Abstract: We investigate the localization and topological properties of the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in a one-dimensional homogeneous system. Our results demonstrate that, despite the absence of disorder in the initial system, the NESS can exhibit localization under bond dissipation. These dissipation-driven localization and delocalization phenomena are clearly distinguished using Wigner distributions. Furthermore, we find that the initial localization characteristics of the system significantly influence the localization properties of the NESS. Drawing upon the concept of Bose-Einstein condensate broadening in cold-atom experiments, along with experimental data, we systematically characterize the impact of bond dissipation and disorder on the localization and topological properties of the NESS. The phase diagram reveals that the NESS can be topologically non-trivial even when the initial system is topologically trivial, and that the topological triviality of the initial system strengthens the topological non-triviality of the NESS. This work provides new insights into the localization and topological phase transitions in homogeneous systems induced by bond dissipation and disorder.

Title: Phase-change materials for volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal device applications
Authors: Huandong Chen, Jayakanth Ravichandran
Abstract: Volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal oscillations in phase-change materials, specifically those undergoing metal-to-insulator transitions, offer unique attributes such as fast and low-field volatile switching, tunability, and stochastic dynamics. These characteristics are particularly promising for emulating neuronal behaviors and solving complex computational problems. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of volatile resistive switching devices and neuronal oscillators based on three representative materials with coincident electronic and structural phase transitions, at different levels of technological readiness: the well-studied correlated oxide VO2, the charge-density-wave transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2, and the emerging phase-change chalcogenide perovskite BaTiS3. We discuss progresses from the perspective of materials development and device implementation. Finally, we emphasize the major challenges that must be addressed for practical applications of these phase-change materials and provide our outlook on the future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Title: Fine-tuning foundation models of materials interatomic potentials with frozen transfer learning
Authors: Mariia Radova, Wojciech G. Stark, Connor S. Allen, Reinhard J. Maurer, Albert P. Bartók
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials are revolutionising atomistic materials simulations by providing accurate and scalable predictions within the scope covered by the training data. However, generation of an accurate and robust training data set remains a challenge, often requiring thousands of first-principles calculations to achieve high accuracy. Foundation models have started to emerge with the ambition to create universally applicable potentials across a wide range of materials. While foundation models can be robust and transferable, they do not yet achieve the accuracy required to predict reaction barriers, phase transitions, and material stability. This work demonstrates that foundation model potentials can reach chemical accuracy when fine-tuned using transfer learning with partially frozen weights and biases. For two challenging datasets on reactive chemistry at surfaces and stability and elastic properties of tertiary alloys, we show that frozen transfer learning with 10-20% of the data (hundreds of datapoints) achieves similar accuracies to models trained from scratch (on thousands of datapoints). Moreover, we show that an equally accurate, but significantly more efficient surrogate model can be built using the transfer learned potential as the ground truth. In combination, we present a simulation workflow for machine learning potentials that improves data efficiency and computational efficiency.

Title: Local signatures of altermagnetism
Authors: Jannik Gondolf, Andreas Kreisel, Mercè Roig, Yue Yu, Daniel F. Agterberg, Brian M. Andersen
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a class of collinear compensated Néel ordered magnets that break time-reversal symmetry and feature spin-split band structures. Based on versatile microscopic models able to capture the altermagnetic sublattice degrees of freedom, we study characteristic local signatures of altermagnetism near disorder sites. We give a complete list of two-dimensional models that exhibit altermagnetism classified by their corresponding layer groups. Specifically, we calculate the local density of states in the vicinity of pointlike nonmagnetic impurities and expose its spatial dependence for two minimal models showcasing $d$-wave and $g$-wave altermagnetism. The momentum structure of the nodes ($d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc.) is directly imprinted on the total local density of states, thus measurable by scanning tunneling conductance experiments. This signature is present both in the spin-resolved as well as the spin-summed local density of states. We find a weaker response in the nonmagnetic state from the anisotropic crystal environment and uncover the importance of the sublattice degree of freedom to model altermagnets. We also study coexistence phases of altermagnetism and superconductivity and provide predictions for the local impurity response of in-gap bound states. The response of impurity bound states strongly enhances the distinct altermagnetic signature.

Title: Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii theory for a spin-1 Bose gas: Application to superfluidity in two dimensions
Authors: Andrew P. C. Underwood, P. B. Blakie
Abstract: This paper develops and implements the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation for spin-1 Bose gases, addressing key considerations for numerical simulations. As an application of the theory we explore equilibrium phases in a two-dimensional spin-1 gas, where quasi-long-range order emerges via a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Our analysis includes definition of superfluid densities for both mass and spin degrees of freedom, in a manner suitable for implementation within a stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We present a finite-temperature phase diagram for the ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose gas and identify three distinct superfluid phases: two exhibiting conventional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like behavior and a novel phase that simultaneously supports independent mass and spin superflows. As temperature increases, the stability region of this novel phase shrinks. We provide characterization of the phase transitions through consideration of the spin-component densities and the unbinding of multiple types of vortices. This work provides a foundation for further studies of nonequilibrium and finite-temperature phenomena in spinor Bose gases.

Title: Atomistic modeling of functionalized magnetite surfaces with oxidation states
Authors: Emre Gürsoy, Robert H. Meißner, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer
Abstract: Understanding the atomic structure of magnetite-carboxylic acid interfaces is crucial for tailoring nanocomposites involving this interface. We present a Monte Carlo (MC)-based method utilizing iron oxidation state exchange to model magnetite interfaces with tens of thousands of atoms, scales typically inaccessible by electronic structure calculations. Charge neutrality is ensured by the oxidation of Fe ions. The MC approach allows magnetite to adapt to its environment at interfaces without requiring interface-specific rescaling of force-field parameters. This enables a simple, versatile method. By comparing adsorption sites, layer distances, and bond lengths with results from electronic structure calculations and experiments, we validated the accuracy of our method. We found that the oxidation state distribution and, consequently, binding site preference depend on coverage and surface thickness, with a critical thickness signaling the transition from layered to bulk-like oxidation states. The method ensures seamless compatibility with popular biomolecular force fields providing transferability and simplifying the study of magnetite interfaces in general.

Title: Orbital splitter effect and spatial resolution of current-induced orbital accumulation
Authors: Niels Henrik Aase, Erik Wegner Hodt, Karl Bergson Hallberg, Asle Sudbø, Jacob Linder
Abstract: The emergence of an orbital angular momentum (OAM) response to a charge current holds promise for technological applications, allowing electrical control of magnetization dynamics. Often, the OAM current is invoked in explaining experimental results for very large orbital transport effects, but this is conceptually challenging as the OAM current is not a conserved quantity. Instead of utilizing the orbital conductivity associated with the non-conserved OAM current, we here use non-equilibrium Green's functions to directly image the OAM density in real space under an applied electric current bias. We find strong spatial variations in OAM density, with the lattice acting as a source and sink of OAM. Moreover, we show that the OAM response depends sensitively on the angle between the charge current and the crystal axis. This enables the generation of a transverse OAM response in one current direction and solely a longitudinal response in another. We refer to this as an orbital splitter effect, analogous to the spin splitter effect in altermagnets.

Title: Dislocation correlations in GaN epitaxial films revealed by EBSD and XRD
Authors: Vladimir M. Kaganer, Domenik Spallek, Philipp John, Oliver Brandt, Jonas Lähnemann
Abstract: Correlations between dislocations in crystals reduce the elastic energy via screening of the strain by the surrounding dislocations. We study the correlations of threading dislocations in GaN epitaxial films with dislocation densities of $5\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1.8\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in reciprocal space and by high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) in real space, where the strain is derived from a cross-correlation analysis of the Kikuchi patterns. The measured XRD curves and HR-EBSD strain and rotation maps are compared with Monte Carlo simulations within one and the same model for the dislocation distributions. The screening of the dislocation strains is modeled by creating pairs of dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors, with the mean distance between dislocations in a pair equal to the screening distance. The pairs overlap and cannot be distinguished as separate dipoles. The HR-EBSD-measured autocorrelation functions of the strain and rotation components follow the expected logarithmic law for distances smaller than the screening distances and become zero for larger distances, which is confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations. The kink in the plot of the autocorrelation function allows a robust and accurate determination of the screening distance without making any simulation or fit. Screening distances of 2 $\mu$m and 0.3 $\mu$m are obtained for the samples with low and high dislocation densities, respectively. The dislocation strain is thus screened by only 4 neighboring dislocations. In addition, an anisotropic resolution of the HR-EBSD measurements is observed and quantified.

Title: Electrons and phonons in pentacene, insights from comparison between experiment and simulations
Authors: Luca Gnoli, Elisabetta Venuti, Matteo Masino, Patrizio Graziosi
Abstract: We have performed a comprehensive computational study of the vibrational properties and electron-phonon couplings in the three known polymorphs of pentacene. Vibrational patterns and electron-phonon interactions were calculated at several q-points of the Brillouin zone, allowing for a detailed mapping of the phonon landscape and the associated coupling mechanisms relevant to charge transport. Using a pool of post-processing tools, we analyze the different phonon dispersions. Thus, we shed light on how low-frequency phonons modulate the transport differently in the polymorphs via their distinct electron-phonon coupling (EPC) signatures in reciprocal space. In fact, we show that distinct phonons dominate in high-temperature and thin-film polymorphs with respect to the high mobility low-temperature polymorph, and that these lead to different decoherence/localization trends. We describe the microscopic origin of the mobility in bulk polymorph, demonstrating that polymorphism not only modulates the transfer integral but also the phonon pattern. For the first time we show that different EPC patterns lead to very different mobility values even in similar structures. Also, we explain how phonon confinement is responsible for the increased mobility observed in 2D phase. Finally, we address the problem of possible coexistence of multiple polymorphs within a single specimen, frequently encountered in organic crystals due to their subtle energy landscape and processing conditions. In this context, we consider the implications of polymorph intergrowth, structural defects and disorder.

Title: Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2
Authors: Zhongzheng Yang, Fanbang Zheng, Dingsong Wu, Bin-Bin Zhang, Ning Li, Wenhui Li, Chaofan Zhang, Guang-Ming Zhang, Xi Chen, Yulin Chen, Shichao Yan
Abstract: The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.

Title: Active wetting transitions induced by rotational noise at solid interfaces
Authors: Suchismita Das, Raghunath Chelakkot
Abstract: We investigate the wetting transitions displayed by the collection of active Brownian particles (ABPs) confined within rigid, impenetrable, flat walls. In our computational study using Brownian dynamics simulations, the wall-particle interactions are implemented with a short-range repulsive potential. An enhanced rotational diffusion at the walls is used as a control parameter for wetting transitions. Increasing the wall rotational diffusion destabilizes complete wetting, and the aggregate shows morphological transitions. We observe a sequence of morphological transitions with an increase in wall rotational diffusion: symmetric complete wetting (SCW), asymmetric complete wetting (ACW), partial wetting (PW) with droplet formation, and drying. In the PW state, we compute the contact angle as a function of activity and rotational noise. Our analysis indicates that these transitions are linked to enhanced kinetic energy fluctuations of particles and bubble formations in the dense state. We further characterize the nature of these transitions by systematically analyzing an order parameter. Our work shows that modifying local reorientation rates alone is sufficient to induce wetting transitions in active systems.

Title: BaZrS$_\text{3}$ Lights Up: The Interplay of Electrons, Photons, and Phonons in Strongly Luminescent Single Crystals
Authors: Rasmus Svejstrup Nielsen, Ángel Labordet Álvarez, Yvonne Tomm, Galina Gurieva, Andres Ortega-Guerrero, Joachim Breternitz, Lorenzo Bastonero, Nicola Marzari, Carlo Antonio Pignedoli, Susan Schorr, Mirjana Dimitrievska
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials for the next generation of optoelectronic applications, with BaZrS$_\text{3}$ attracting significant attention due to its wide bandgap, earth-abundant composition, and thermal and chemical stability. However, previous studies have consistently reported weak and ambiguous photoluminescence (PL), regardless of synthesis method, raising questions about the intrinsic optoelectronic quality of this compound. In this work, we demonstrate strong, band-to-band-dominated PL at room temperature in high-quality BaZrS$_\text{3}$ single crystals, with a PL quantum yield of $\sim$0.005\%. Despite the narrow, single-component PL emission band, time-resolved PL measurements reveal a carrier lifetime of $1.0\pm0.2$ ns. To understand the origin of the strong PL and short carrier lifetime, we perform multiwavelength excitation and polarization-dependent Raman measurements, supported by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. We identify all 23 theoretically predicted Raman-active modes and their symmetries, providing a comprehensive reference for future studies. Our results indicate that phonon-assisted carrier decay and nontrivial electron-phonon interactions contribute to the short carrier lifetimes, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further studies on compositional variations or partial cation/anion substitutions could mitigate electron-phonon coupling and enhance carrier lifetimes. By establishing a detailed reference for the intrinsic vibrational and optoelectronic properties of BaZrS$_\text{3}$, this work paves the way for further advancements in chalcogenide perovskites for energy and optoelectronic technologies.

Title: High-performance Andreev interferometer-based electronic coolers
Authors: Francesco Cioni, Fabio Taddei
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an electronic refrigerator based on a ballistic Andreev interferometer that allows to reach a maximum cooling power per channel up to five orders of magnitude larger than that of the conventional normal metal-insulator-superconductor cooler. This effect is achieved by exploiting the destructive interference that occurs when the superconducting phase difference equals $\pi$. This results in a strongly suppressed charge current below the superconducting gap, while still allowing the extraction of excitations above the gap, leading to a cooler with enhanced performance. Interestingly, we find that such a large cooling power per channel enables the achievement of an electronic temperature close to the theoretical lower bound. Additionally, we derive an approximate expression for this bound in the regime of low bath temperatures. Finally, we propose potential implementations of the ballistic Andreev interferometer cooler using semiconductors, graphene, and topological insulators.

Title: Wafer scale reactive sputtering of highly oriented and ferroelectric Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N from 300 mm AlSc Targets
Authors: Tom-Niklas Kreutzer, Muhammad Zubair Ghori, Md Redwanul Islam, Fabian Lofink, Fabian Stoppel, Axel Müller-Groeling, Simon Fichtner
Abstract: This paper presents progress towards the large-scale manufacturability of piezo- and ferroelectric Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N thin films with very high Sc content. Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N layers were deposited by reactive sputtering from a 300 mm diameter Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N target on standard 200 mm Si wafers with Pt bottom- and Mo top-electrodes. The deposited films were analyzed in depth with X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Reciprocal Space Mapping (RSM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) showing well oriented c-axis growth over the full wafer with slight variation in the film thickness and Sc content over the wafer radius. An overall low density of abnormally oriented grains (AOG) was found. Further wafer mapping for piezoelectric and dielectric properties showed a piezoelectric performance increase by 40 % in comparison to Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N while only moderately increasing the permittivity and loss factor. Switching measurements revealed ferroelectric behavior of the film on all measured positions with an average remanent polarization of 88.36 uC/cm$^2$ and an average coercive field of 244 V/um. This successful demonstration opens new opportunities for MEMS applications with demands for high forces like microspeakers or quasi static micromirrors.

Abstract: CeO$_x$-based nanoforms are widely used in catalysis, or biomedical applications due to their redox activity and oxygen storage capacity. The key parameters determining their surface chemistry are the Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratio and the ability to transition between Ce$^{4+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ states. We synthesized Au@CeO$_x$ core@shell nanoparticles with different thicknesses of CeO$_x$ shells and different Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratios through a photothermal reaction driven by localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) at the Au nanoparticle surface induced by visible light. We introduce a way to further enhance the Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratio in the shell by exposing the Au@CeO$_x$ nanoparticles to visible light using a green laser (532 nm, 50 mW). Our findings based on photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the Ce$^{4+}$-to-Ce$^{3+}$ transition results from LSPR-induced superheating of the Au@CeO$_x$ interface, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies and reduction of Ce$^{4+}$ ions. This process is reversible upon air exposure suggesting that the ability to transition between the Ce$^{4+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ states is retained in the Au@CeO$_x$ nanoparticles. Our study presents the CeO$_x$-based nanoforms with a tunable cerium valence state ratio, highlighting the potential of plasmonic control in optimizing their photocatalytic and enzyme-mimetic properties.

Title: Minimal thermodynamic cost of computing with circuits
Authors: Abhishek Yadav, Mahran Yousef, David Wolpert
Abstract: All digital devices have components that implement Boolean functions, mapping that component's input to its output. However, any fixed Boolean function can be implemented by an infinite number of circuits, all of which vary in their resource costs. This has given rise to the field of circuit complexity theory, which studies the minimal resource cost to implement a given Boolean function with any circuit. Traditionally, circuit complexity theory has focused on the resource costs of a circuit's size (its number of gates) and depth (the longest path length from the circuit's input to its output). In this paper, we extend circuit complexity theory by investigating the minimal thermodynamic cost of a circuit's operation. We do this by using the mismatch cost (MMC) of a given circuit that is run multiple times in a row to calculate a lower bound on the entropy production (EP) incurred in each such run. Specifically, we discuss conditions under which MMC of a circuit is proportional to the size of a circuit, and conditions for them to diverge. We also use our results to compare the thermodynamic costs of different circuit families implementing the same family of Boolean functions. In addition we analyze how heterogeneity in the underlying physical processes implementing the gates in a circuit influences the minimal thermodynamic cost of the overall circuit. These and other results of ours lay the foundation for extending circuit complexity theory to include mismatch cost as a resource cost.

Title: Understanding and Design of Interstitial Oxygen Conductors
Authors: Jun Meng
Abstract: Highly efficient oxygen active materials that react with, absorb, and transport oxygen is essential for fuel cells, electrolyzers and related applications. While vacancy mediated oxygen ion conductors have long been the focus of research, they are limited by high migration barriers at intermediate temperatures, which hinder their practical applications. In contrast, interstitial oxygen conductors exhibit significantly lower migration barriers enabling faster ionic conductivity at lower temperatures. This review systematically examines both well established and recently identified families of interstitial oxygen ion conductors, focusing on how their unique structural motifs such as corner sharing polyhedral frameworks, isolated polyhedral, and cage like architectures, facilitate low migration barriers through interstitial and interstitialcy diffusion mechanisms. A central discussion of this review focuses on the evolution of design strategies, from targeted donor doping, element screening, and physical intuition descriptor material discovery, which leverage computational tools to explore vast chemical spaces in search of new interstitial conductors. The success of these strategies demonstrates that a significant, largely unexplored space remains for discovering high performing interstitial oxygen conductors. Crucial features enabling high performance interstitial oxygen diffusion include the availability of electrons for oxygen reduction and sufficient structural flexibility with accessible volume for interstitial accommodation. This review concludes with a forward looking perspective, proposing a knowledge driven methodology that integrates current understanding with data centric approaches to identify promising interstitial oxygen conductors outside traditional search paradigms.

Title: Inertia-induced power-law scaling in martensites
Authors: Oğuz Umut Salman, Alphonse Finel, Lev Truskinovsky
Abstract: Martensites subjected to quasistatic deformation are known to exhibit power law distributed acoustic emission in a broad range of scales, however, the origin of the observed scaling behavior and the mechanism of self-organization towards apparent criticality remains obscure. Here we argue that the power law structure of intermittent fluctuations can be at least partially interpreted as an effect of inertia. We build on the insight that inertial dynamics, evidenced by acoustic emission, can become an important factor if the underlying mechanical system is only marginally stable. We first illustrate the possibility of inertia-induced \textit{heavy-tailed} avalanche size distributions using a prototypical example of a discrete chain with bi-stable springs. We then explore the effects of inertia in fully realistic two- and three-dimensional continuum models of elastic phase transitions. In particular, we demonstrate that a three-dimensional model can produce not only qualitative but also quantitative agreement with experiment.

Title: Lift force in chiral, compressible granular matter
Authors: Jarosław Pawłowski, Marcin Dudziak, Matteo Baggioli, Jie Zhang, Piotr Surówka
Abstract: Micropolar fluid theory, an extension of classical Newtonian fluid dynamics, incorporates angular velocities and rotational inertias and has long been a foundational framework for describing granular flows. We propose a macroscopic model of granular matter based on active micropolar fluid dynamics, which incorporates internal rotations, couple stresses, and broken parity through odd viscosity. Our framework extends traditional micropolar theory to describe chiral granular flows driven far from equilibrium, where energy is continuously injected and dissipated. In particular, we focus on steady states and explicitly neglect energy conservation, reflecting the dissipative nature of granular systems maintained in non-equilibrium by external forcing. Within this setup, we study the lift force experienced by a test bead embedded in a compressible, parity-breaking granular flow. We analyze how odd viscosity and microrotation modify the transverse forces, using both analytical results in the linearized Stokes regime and nonlinear finite element simulations. Our results demonstrate that active micropolar fluids provide a physically consistent and symmetry-informed continuum description of chiral granular matter, capable of capturing lift forces that emerge uniquely from odd transport effects.

Authors: Andrés Bejarano, Moritz Frankerl, Rémi Avriller, Thomas Frederiksen, Fabio Pistolesi
Abstract: We develop a microscopic model to investigate current-induced light emission in single-molecule tunnel junctions, where a two-level system interacts with a plasmonic field. Using the quantum master equation, we explore the transition from weak to strong plasmon-molecule coupling, identifying three distinct regimes governed by cooperativity, which quantifies the interplay between interaction strength and losses. Our findings establish a framework to detect strong coupling, unveiling resonance-dependent features in the emission spectrum and photon correlations.

Title: Spin and energy diffusion vs. subdiffusion in disordered spin chains
Authors: J. Herbrych, P. Prelovšek
Abstract: While the high-temperature spin diffusion in spin chains with random local fields has been the subject of numerous studies concerning the phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the energy diffusion in the same models has been much less explored. We demonstrate that energy diffusion is faster at weak random fields but becomes essentially equal at strong fields; hence, both diffusions determine the slowest relaxation time scale (Thouless time) in the system. Numerically reachable finite-size systems reveal the anomalously large distribution of diffusion constants with respect to actual field configurations. Despite the exponential-like dependence of diffusion on field strength, the results for sensitivity to twisted boundary conditions are incompatible with the Thouless criterion for localization and the presumed transition to MBL, at least for numerically reachable sizes. In contrast, we find indications of the scenario of subdiffusive transport, particularly in the dynamical diffusivity response.

Abstract: Transformations in bcc-$\beta$, hcp-$\alpha$, and the $\omega$ phases of Ti alloys are studied using Density Functional Theory for pure Ti and Ti alloyed with Al, Si, V, Cr, Fe, Cu, Nb, Mo, and Sn. The $\beta$-stabilization caused by alloying Si, Fe, Cr, and Mo was observed, but the most stable phase appears between the $\beta$ and the $\alpha$ phases, corresponding to the martensitic $\alpha''$ phase. Next, the $\{112\}\langle11\bar1\rangle$ bcc twins are separated by a positive barrier, which further increases by alloying w.r.t. pure Ti. The $\{332\}\langle11\bar3\rangle$ twinning yields negative barriers for all species but Mo and Fe. This is because the transition state is structurally similar to the $\alpha$ phase, which is preferred over the $\beta$ phase for the majority of alloying elements. Lastly, the impact of alloying on twin boundary energies is discussed. These results may serve as design guidelines for novel Ti-based alloys with specific application areas.

Title: Visualization of defect-induced interband proximity effect at the nanoscale
Authors: Thomas Gozlinski, Qili Li, Rolf Heid, Oleg Kurnosikov, Alexander Haas, Ryohei Nemoto, Toyo Kazu Yamada, Joerg Schmalian, Wulf Wulfhekel
Abstract: The vast majority of superconductors have more than one Fermi surface, on which the electrons pair below the critical temperature $T_C$, yet their superconducting behavior can be well described by a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. This is mostly due to interband scattering, especially in superconductors in the dirty limit, rigidly linking the pairing amplitude of the different bands. This effect has severely limited experimental studies of the complex physics of multiband superconductivity. In this study, we utilize the fact that elementary Pb - as a clean limit system - has two Fermi surfaces that are only weakly coupled by interband scattering, allowing the formation of two separate condensates. By studying crystallographic defects in the form of stacking fault tetrahedra with our millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope, we show how to locally tune interband coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling and modify the superconducting order parameters from two well separated gaps to one merged gap around defects. The experiments critically test the theory of multiband superconductors and give a route to access a wide range of predicted quantum effects in these systems.

Title: Phase field model for viscous inclusions in anisotropic networks
Authors: Aakanksha Gubbala, Anika M. Jena, Daniel P. Arnold, Sho C. Takatori
Abstract: The growth of viscous two-dimensional lipid domains in contact with a viscoelastic actin network was recently shown to exhibit unusual lipid domain ripening due to the geometry and anisotropy of the actin network [Arnold & Takatori. Langmuir. 40, 26570-26578 (2024)]. In this work, we interpret previous experimental results on lipid membrane-actin composites with a theoretical model that combines the Cahn-Hilliard and Landau-de Gennes liquid crystal theory. In our model, we incorporate fiber-like characteristics of actin filaments and bundles through a nematic order parameter, and elastic anisotropy through cubic nematic gradients. Numerical simulations qualitatively agree with experimental observations, by reproducing the competition between the thermodynamic forces that coarsen lipid domains versus the elastic forces generated by the surrounding actin network that resist domain coarsening. We observe a decrease in the growth of domain sizes, finding $R(t) \sim t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha < 1/4$ for different actin network stiffnesses, in sharp contrast to the $\sim t^{1/3}$ scaling for diffusive growth of domains in the absence of the actin network. Our findings may serve as a foundation for future developments in modeling elastic ripening in complex systems.

Abstract: The spontaneous Hall effect (SHE), a finite voltage occurring transversal to the electrical current in zero-magnetic field, has been observed in both conventional and unconventional superconductors, appearing as a peak near the superconducting transition temperature. The origin of SHE is strongly debated, with proposed explanations ranging from intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms such as spontaneous symmetry breaking and time-reversal symmetry breaking (BTRS), Abrikosov vortex motion, or extrinsic factors like material inhomogeneities, such as non-uniform critical temperature (Tc) distributions or structural asymmetries. This work is an experimental study of the SHE in various superconducting materials. We focused on conventional, low-Tc, sharp transition Nb and unconventional, intermediate-Tc, smeared transition Fe(Se,Te). Our findings show distinct SHE peaks around the superconducting transition, with variations in height, sign and shape, indicating a possible common mechanism independent of the specific material. We propose that spatial inhomogeneities in the critical temperature, caused by local chemical composition variations, disorder, or other forms of electronic spatial inhomogeneities could explain the appearing of the SHE. This hypothesis is supported by comprehensive finite elements simulations of randomly distributed Tc by varying Tc-distribution, spatial scale of disorder and amplitude of the superconducting transition. The comparison between experimental results and simulations suggest a unified origin for the SHE in different superconductors, whereas different phenomenology can be explained in terms of amplitude of the transition temperature in respect to Tc-distribution.

Title: Shubnikov-de Haas Oscillations in 2D $\text{PtSe}_2$: A fermiological Charge Carrier Investigation
Authors: Julian Max Salchegger, Rajdeep Adhikari, Bogdan Faina, Alberta Bonanni
Abstract: High magnetic field and low temperature transport is carried out in order to characterize the charge carriers of $\text{PtSe}_2$. In particular, the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising at applied magnetic field strengths $\gtrsim 4.5\,\text{T}$ are found to occur exclusively in plane and emerge at a layer thickness of $\approx 18\,\text{nm}$, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency for thinner $\text{PtSe}_2$ flakes. Moreover, the quantum transport time, Berry phase, Dingle temperature and cyclotron mass of the charge carriers are ascertained. The emergence of weak antilocalization (WAL) lies in contrast to the presence of magnetic moments from Pt vacancies. An explanation is provided on how WAL and the Kondo effect can be observed within the same material. Detailed information about the charge carriers and transport phenomena in $\text{PtSe}_2$ is obtained, which is relevant for the design of prospective spintronic and orbitronic devices and for the realization of orbital Hall effect-based architectures.

Title: Finding the right path: statistical mechanics of connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems
Authors: Damien Barbier
Abstract: We define and study a statistical mechanics ensemble that characterizes connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Built around a well-known local entropy bias, it allows us to better identify hardness transitions in problems where the energy landscape is dominated by isolated solutions. We apply this new device to the symmetric binary perceptron model (SBP), and study how its manifold of connected solutions behaves. We choose this particular problem because, while its typical solutions are isolated, it can be solved using local algorithms for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. With this new ensemble, we unveil the presence of a cluster composed of delocalized connected solutions. In particular, we demonstrate its stability until a critical threshold $\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$ (dependent on $\alpha$). This transition appears as paths of solutions shatter, a phenomenon that more conventional statistical mechanics approaches fail to grasp. Finally, we compared our predictions to simulations. For this, we used a modified Monte-Carlo algorithm, designed specifically to target these delocalized solutions. We obtained, as predicted, that the algorithm finds solutions until $\kappa\approx\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$.

Title: Molecular dynamics simulation of the effects of neutron irradiation on Caesium Lead Bromide
Authors: Zhongming Zhang, Samuel Murphy, Michael Aspinall
Abstract: With the development of fast neutron reactors and nuclear fusion reactors, it is necessary to find new radiation-hardened high-flux core neutron detectors. The use of perovskite Caesium Lead Bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) for neutron radiation detection is a new research direction. However, at high temperatures, the effects of neutron radiation, especially the Primary Knock-out Atom (PKA) and Displacement Per Atom (DPA), and the defect distribution at the molecular level have not been reported. This study investigated the effect on CsPbBr$_3$ produced by 14 MeV neutron irradiation under 100 K to 400 K. Molecular dynamics methods are used to model the distribution of vacancies and interstitial atoms at the molecular level of materials. This study obtained the displacement threshold energies of three atoms in CsPbBr$_3$ and obtained the distribution of vacancies and interstitial atoms within the material over time. Monte Carlo simulations were used to obtain PKA and DPA information in CsPbBr$_3$ under neutron irradiation. This research will help to further study the performance changes of halide perovskites under neutron irradiation to verify the possibility of using them as radiation-hardened neutron detectors.

Title: One dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with long range hopping
Authors: Edmond Orignac
Abstract: Interacting one-dimensional bosons with long range hopping decaying as a power law $r^{-\alpha}$ with distance $r$ are considered with the renormalization group and the self-consistent harmonic approximation. For $\alpha\ge 3$, the ground state is always a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, whereas for $\alpha <3$, a ground state with long range order breaking the continuous global gauge symmetry becomes possible for sufficiently weak repulsion. At positive temperature, continuous symmetry breaking becomes restricted to $\alpha<2$, and for $2<\alpha<3$, a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with the Tomonaga-Luttinger exponent diverging at low temperature is found.

Title: «Anticommuting» $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquids
Authors: Sumiran Pujari, Harsh Nigam
Abstract: We discuss a class of lattice $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum Hamiltonians with bond-dependent Ising couplings and a mutually «anticommuting» algebra of extensively many local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ conserved charges that was explicated in [arXiv:2407.06236]. This mutual algebra is reminiscent of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Pauli matrix algebra but encoded in the structure of \emph{local conserved charges}. These models have finite residual entropy density in the ground state with a simple but non-trivial degeneracy counting and concomitant quantum spin liquidity as proved in [arXiv:2407.06236]. The spin liquidity relies on a geometrically site-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that is rather natural in presence of an «anticommuting» structure, as opposed to for example the bond-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ hexagonal plaquette charges of the Kitaev honeycomb spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ model which leads to a mutually commuting local algebra. In this work, we make several exact statements on the many-body order that can be present within the class of «anticommuting» quantum spin liquids. We elucidate the differences between the many-body order in these models and that found in some gapped quantum spin liquids with mutually commuting local algebras, e.g. the Kitaev toric code or Levin-Wen models. We also point out a mutually commuting algebra with local support that are naturally expressed as multi-linear Majorana forms in the Kitaev representation of these quantum spin liquids. They capture non-trivial quantum resonances throughout the lattice in these «anticommuting» $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid Hamiltonians.

Title: Magnetic field-free braiding and nontrivial fusion of Majorana bound states in high-temperature planar Josephson junctions
Authors: Pankaj Sharma, Narayan Mohanta
Abstract: Demonstration of non-Abelian statistics of Majorana bound states (MBS) is crucial for the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Two-dimensional platforms such as planar Josephson junctions require an in-plane magnetic field to generate a pair of MBS at its non-superconducting channel ends; however, the fixed direction of the in-plane magnetic field puts a constraint on the realization of a multi-terminal topological planar junction, and hence its ability to physically move multiple MBS -- which is necessary for performing the fusion and braiding operations. Here we show that in a planar Josephson junction coupled to a skyrmion crystal, which can generate multiple pairs of MBS in the absence of any external magnetic field, the non-trivial fusion and braiding operations can be performed. Our numerical calculations, designed for realistic two-dimensional quantum systems, certify the feasibility of experimental realization of the proposed device schemes. We find that both $s$-wave and $d$-wave superconducting leads can generate the MBS; indicating that the MBS movement operations can be performed at higher temperatures using $d$-wave superconducting leads. Our results establish that the skyrmion crystal-coupled planar Josephson junction is a viable platform for the generation and controlled movement of the MBS.

Title: Probing quantum geometry with two-dimensional nonlinear optical spectroscopy
Authors: Paul Froese, Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Yong Baek Kim
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the nonlinear optical response of crystalline systems is fundamentally a quantum geometric property. In this work, we propose two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), which measures the nonlinear conductivity as a function of two independent frequencies using two time-delayed light pulses, as a probe of quantum geometry. We show how the two-frequency second-order nonlinear conductivity, which is naturally measured by 2DCS, decomposes into distinct quantum geometric contributions. We identify a term arising from the multi-band quantum connection that does not appear in linear response, and show that it can be measured in isolation by considering specific polarizations and enforcing time-reversal symmetry. We explore this finding via model calculations for transition metal dichalcogenides and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Through these examples, we demonstrate how 2DCS enables study of the quantum connection, providing a way to compare the quantum geometry of different materials. We also show that one can gain rough momentum-resolved knowledge of the quantum geometry by varying the chemical potential.

Abstract: Complex chalcogenides in the $M$PS$_3$ family of materials ($M$ = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) display remarkably different phase progressions depending upon the metal center orbital filling, character of the P-P linkage, and size of the van der Waals gap. There is also a stacking pattern and spin state difference between the lighter and heavier transition metal-containing systems that places CoPS$_3$ at the nexus of these activities. Despite these unique properties, this compound is under-explored. Here, we bring together Raman scattering spectroscopy and infrared absorption spectroscopy with X-ray techniques to identify a structural component to the 119 K magnetic ordering transition as well as a remarkable lower temperature set of magnon-phonon pairs that engage in avoided crossings along with a magnetic scattering continuum that correlates with phonon lifetime effects. These findings point to strong spin-phonon entanglement as well as opportunities to control these effects under external stimuli.

Title: Superconductivity and inhomogeneous charge-ordered state in the two-Dimensional Hubbard model -- Off-Diagonal Wave Function Monte Carlo Studies of Hubbard Model IV
Authors: Takashi Yanagisawa
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, based on the off-diagonal wave function variational Monte Carlo method. We use an optimized wave function that is improved from an initial one-body wave function by multiplying by multiple correlation operators that are given by the form of exp($-S$)-type where $S$ is a suitable operator. We examine the inhomogeneous ground state at near 1/8 doping in the strongly correlated region where the on-site Coulomb interaction is larger than the bandwidth. The $d$-wave superconductivity with a spatially oscillating gap function can coexist with the charge ordering in the ground state without magnetic ordering, and superconducting condensation energy increases by this coexistence. We also show the $d$-wave pair correlation function as a function of lattice sites. The correlation function indicates that the long-range superconducting order indeed exists, and also that the strong electron correlation suppresses the pair correlation function.

Title: Modeling the g-factors, hyperfine interaction and optical properties of semiconductor QDs: the atomistic and eight-band $k \cdot p$ approaches
Authors: Krzysztof Gawarecki, Alina Garbiec, Jakub Stanecki, Michał Zieliński
Abstract: We present a detailed comparative study of two important theoretical approaches: atomistic sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding and continuum eight-band $k \cdot p$ methods, for modeling the spin and optical properties of quantum dots (QDs). Our investigation spans key physical observables, including single-particle energy levels, g-factors, exciton radiative lifetimes, and hyperfine-induced Overhauser field fluctuations. We perform our calculations for self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs QD systems as representative case studies. While both methods yield qualitatively consistent trends, quantitative discrepancies arise due to different treatment of atomistic details, strain effects, and confinement. We introduce targeted corrections to the eight-band $k \cdot p$ framework, including a modified deformation potential scheme and adjusted remote-band contributions, to improve agreement with atomistic results, especially for electron g-factors and single-particle energies. Furthermore, we validate the eight-band implementation of hyperfine interactions by benchmarking it against the tight-binding model, showing reasonable convergence for both electrons and holes. Our results establish criteria for selecting the appropriate modeling framework based on the desired physical accuracy and computational efficiency in spin-optical studies of semiconductor QDs.

Title: Spin Seebeck Effect of Triangular-lattice Spin Supersolid
Authors: Yuan Gao, Yixuan Huang, Sadamichi Maekawa, Wei Li
Abstract: Using the developed thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling behaviors of the normalized spin current across the interface. Using the 1D Heisenberg chain as a benchmark system, we observe a negative spinon spin current exhibiting algebraic scaling $T^{\alpha}$, with exponent $\alpha$, in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with distinct spin-current signatures - particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence - distinguishing different spin states. Remarkably, we discover a persistent, negative spin current in the spin supersolid phase. It saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit, and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits provide sensitive probes for spin-supersolid compounds such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Furthermore, our results establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.

Title: Density functional theory study of effect of NO annealing on electronic structure and carrier-scattering property of 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface
Authors: Nahoto Funaki, Kosei Sugiyama, Mitsuharu Uemoto, Tomoya Ono
Abstract: The effect of the nitrided layer introduced by NO annealing on the electronic structure and carrier scattering property of the 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface is investigated by the density functional theory calculation using the interface models where the areal N atom density corresponds to that in practical devices. The areal N atom density is one third of the areal C atom density in practical devices. It is found that the nitrided layer screens the unfavorable Coulomb interaction of O atoms in the SiO$_2$. However, the electrons flowing under the nitrided layer are significantly scattered by the fluctuation of potential due to the low areal N atom density. These results imply that the areal N atom density should be increased so that the fluctuation of potential is suppressed.

Title: Testing the spin-bath view of self-attention: A Hamiltonian analysis of GPT-2 Transformer
Authors: Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Seung-Cheol Lee
Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians we obtain analytic \textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. This validation not only furnishes a tractable, physics-inspired lens for interpretability but also provides the groundwork for novel generative models, bridging the gap between theoretical condensed matter physics and AI.

Title: Magnetocrystalline anisotropy of FeNi and FeCo along the Bain path
Authors: Nica Jane B. Ferrer, Gregory A. Fiete
Abstract: We theoretically investigate magnetic anisotropy in materials with non-critical elements to determine which symmetry conditions and atomic shell filling favor enhanced magnetic anisotropy. We study the magnetocrystalline anisotropies (MCA) of the equiatomic ferrous compounds FeCo and FeNi using ab initio calculations and analytical approaches via the diatomic pair model. We find that when these materials undergo a Bain transformation, that is, the variation of the a and c lattice parameters adjust to interpolate between the B2 and L10 structural phases while keeping the unit cell volume constant, the MCA versus r = c/a ratio varies differently for FeCo and FeNi despite Co and Ni differing only by one valence electron. To uncover the physics governing these trends, we use a diatomic pair model to perform a theoretical analysis of the ab initio results. We find that the MCA variation along the Bain path is correlated with the structural phase of the material as well as the occupation of (l, m)-resolved states for each equiatomic ferrous compound. Accordingly, the MCA was found to differ depending on the element paired with Fe to form the Fe-X compound (X = Co, Ni). Our work could help guide the scientific community in solving the supply crisis of hard/strong permanent magnets that are crucial for various technological applications such as those depending on motors and generators for energy conversion and clean energy applications.

Title: About the Strain-Coupled Molecular Dynamics in the Ferroelastic Phase Transition of TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$
Authors: A. Nonato, R. X. Silva, C.C. Santos, A. P. Ayala, C.W.A. Paschoal
Abstract: Tetramethylammonium (TMA) cadmium azide, is a new perovskite-like compound which undergoes a series of first-order phase transitions, including a ferroelastic transition above room temperature. Understanding the order-disorder structural phase transition (SPT) mechanism in hybrid organic--inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) is crucial for designing new compounds with enhanced barocaloric efficiency, as well as unlocking other multifunctional properties. In this paper, we employed the energy fluctuation (EF) model to investigate the experimental linewidth of Raman modes in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ near the critical phase transition temperature ($T_C = {322}{K}$), aiming to gain insights into the molecular dynamics around the SPT. The temperature dependence of the strain, used as an order parameter, was obtained using the appropriate thermodynamic potential for the first-order phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, expressed through a Landau expansion, which can be successfully employed to model first-order ferroelastic phase transitions. We show that the EF model suitably captures the behavior of the Raman linewidths in the vicinity of the structural phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The activation energies obtained for TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ are comparable to those of DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, as well as to $k_B T_C$. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the relaxation reveals that the torsional and librational modes require longer to renormalize after the phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ when compared with DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The discussion based on these new parameters provides a new perspective for understanding molecular dynamics in systems undergoing order-disorder phase transitions, particularly in ferroelastic transitions, where order-disorder mechanisms are coupled to symmetry-breaking lattice distortions.

Title: Investigating the Fermi-Hubbard model by the Tensor-Backflow method
Authors: Xiao Liang
Abstract: Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.

Title: Magnetic octupole Hall effect in heavy transition metals
Authors: Insu Baek, Seungyun Han, Hyun-Woo Lee
Abstract: d-wave altermagnets have the magnetic octupole as their primary order parameter. A recent study [Han et al. arXiv 2409.14423 (2024)] demonstrated that magnetic octupole current can induce Néel vector dynamics. Therefore, identifying materials that can efficiently generate a magnetic octupole current is essential. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic octupole Hall effect in 4d and 5d transition metals. By employing atomic magnetic octupole operators, we calculate the magnetic octupole Hall conductivity using first-principles calculations. We also explore the microscopic origin of the magnetic octupole Hall effect and find that it results from the combined effect of orbital texture and spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, we analyze the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to magnetic octupole Hall conductivity across various materials and identify those that are optimal for observing magnetic octupole physics. We also discuss potential applications arising from the magnetic octupole Hall effect. Our work serves as a valuable reference for identifying materials suitable for studying magnetic octupole physics.

Title: A unifying approach to self-organizing systems interacting via conservation laws
Authors: Frank Barrows, Guanming Zhang, Satyam Anand, Zizi Chen, Jonathan Lin, Amman Desai, Stefano Martiniani, Francesco Caravelli
Abstract: We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.

Title: Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnets via spin torque exerted by photocurrent of excitons: Signatures in charge pumping and THz emission
Authors: Jalil Varela-Manjarres, Yafei Ren, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by fsLP are coupled self-consistently to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductor. This theory explains how fsLP, of central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a {\em nonequilibrium spintronic mechanism}. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) decodes frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by {\em nonlocal} damping with the LLG equation due to, explicitly included via TDNEGF, electronic bath. The TDNEGF part of the loop is also used to include excitons via mean-field treatment, utilizing off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, of Coulomb interaction binding conduction-band electrons and valence-band holes. Finally, our theory predicts how excited magnons will {\em pump} time-dependent charge currents into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor that will then emit electromagnetic radiation. The windowed FFT of these signals contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.

Title: Tailoring the Electronic Properties of Monoclinic (InxAl1-x)2O3 Alloys via Substitutional Donors and Acceptors
Authors: Mohamed Abdelilah Fadla, Myrta Grüning, Lorenzo Stella
Abstract: Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors such as \b{eta}-Ga2O3 are ideal materials for next-generation power electronic devices. Electronic and mechanical properties of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 can be tuned by alloying with other sesquioxides, notably Al2O3 and In2O3. Moreover, by tuning the In content of a (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloy, its lattice constants can be matched to those of Ga2O3, while preserving a large conduction-band offset. In view of potential applications to \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based heterostructure, we performed atomistic modelling of (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloys using density functional theory to investigate thermodynamic and electrical properties of conventional group IV dopants (Si, Sn, C, Ge), alternative metal donors (Ta, Zr, Hf), and acceptors (Mg, Zn, Cu). The hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional (HSE06) is used to accurately quantify the defect formation energies, ionization levels, and concentrations over a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions for the oxygen chemical potential and temperature. In our atomistic models, Hf and Zr show favourable properties as alternative donors to Si and other group IV impurities, especially under oxygen-poor conditions. Our findings also suggest that acceptors Mg, Zn, and Cu, while they cannot promote p-doping, can be still beneficial for the compensation of unintentionally n-doped materials, e.g., to generate semi-insulating layers and improve rectification.

Abstract: The generalized Levy-Leblond equation (GLL) is used to study the bound state problem for a non-relativistic Fermi field in external potentials. A condition when the rest energy term can be removed from the GLL equation is determined. For external potentials which do not obey the condition, the bound state spectrum is affected non-trivially by the rest energy of the Fermi field. This is demonstrated for a spherical finite-depth well potential. The existence, number, and energies of bound states depend on the value of the rest energy.

Title: Hyperfine Structure of Quantum Entanglement
Authors: Liang-Hong Mo, Yao Zhou, Jia-Rui Sun, Peng Ye
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent advantages and limitations. In this work, we introduce the hyperfine structure of entanglement, which decomposes entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases, especially topological gapped state and trivial gapped state. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.

Title: Quantum Enhanced Sensitivity through Many-Body Bloch Oscillations
Authors: Hassan Manshouri, Moslem Zarei, Mehdi Abdi, Sougato Bose, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on the resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from quantum-enhanced scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes. This is due to the induced localization by increasing the interaction between the excitations. We show that a simple particle configuration measurement together with a maximum likelihood estimation can closely reach the ultimate precision limit in both single- and multi-particle probes.

Title: Coherent information for CSS codes under decoherence
Authors: Ryotaro Niwa, Jong Yeon Lee
Abstract: Stabilizer codes lie at the heart of modern quantum-error-correcting codes (QECC). Of particular importance is a class called Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, which includes many important examples such as toric codes, color codes, and fractons. Recent studies have revealed that the decoding transition for these QECCs could be intrinsically captured by calculating information-theoretic quantities from the mixed state. Here we perform a simple analytic calculation of the coherent information for general CSS codes under local incoherent Pauli errors via diagonalization of the density matrices and mapping to classical statistical mechanical (SM) models. Our result establishes a rigorous connection between the decoding transition of the quantum code and the phase transition in the random classical SM model. It is also directly confirmed for CSS codes that exact error correction is possible if and only if the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder always succeeds in the thermodynamic limit. Thus, the fundamental threshold is saturated by the optimal decoder.

Title: Periodic classical trajectories and quantum scars in many-spin systems
Authors: Igor Ermakov, Oleg Lychkovskiy, Boris V. Fine
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.

Abstract: Disorder-induced phenomena in quantum many-body systems pose significant challenges for analytical methods and numerical simulations at relevant time and system scales. To reduce the cost of disorder-sampling, we investigate quantum circuits initialized in states tunable to superpositions over all disorder configurations. In a translationally-invariant lattice gauge theory (LGT), these states can be interpreted as a superposition over gauge sectors. We observe localization in this LGT in the absence of disorder in one and two dimensions: perturbations fail to diffuse despite fully disorder-free evolution and initial states. However, Rényi entropy measurements reveal that superposition-prepared states fundamentally differ from those obtained by direct disorder sampling. Leveraging superposition, we propose an algorithm with a polynomial speedup in sampling disorder configurations, a longstanding challenge in many-body localization studies.

Title: Terahertz chiral photonic-crystal cavities for Dirac gap engineering in graphene
Authors: Fuyang Tay, Stephen Sanders, Andrey Baydin, Zhigang Song, Davis M. Welakuh, Alessandro Alabastri, Vasil Rokaj, Ceren B. Dag, Junichiro Kono
Abstract: Strong coupling between matter and vacuum electromagnetic fields in a cavity can induce novel quantum phases in thermal equilibrium via symmetry breaking. Particularly intriguing is the coupling with circularly polarized cavity fields, which can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and lead to topological bands. This has spurred significant interest in developing chiral cavities that feature broken TRS, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a design for high-quality-factor THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) that achieves broken TRS using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. We incorporate ab initio density functional theory calculations into the derived microscopic model, allowing a realistic estimate of the vacuum-induced gap in graphene when coupled to our chiral cavity. Our calculations show an enhancement in the light-matter interaction due to Dirac nodes and predict an energy gap on the order of 1 meV. The THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken TRS.

Title: A Universal Circuit Set Using the $S_3$ Quantum Double
Authors: Liyuan Chen, Yuanjie Ren, Ruihua Fan, Arthur Jaffe
Abstract: One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to remotely measure the total charge of well-separated anyons; this avoids fusion, which would compromise fault tolerance. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize robust universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.

Title: Analytical Solution of the Nonlinear Relativistic Boltzmann Equation
Authors: Jin Hu
Abstract: We provide an exact analytical solution to the nonlinear relativistic Boltzmann equation for a homogeneous, anisotropically scattering massless gas. Utilizing a BKW-like trial solution, we cast the Boltzmann equation into a set of nonlinear coupled equations for scalar moments, based on which the analytical solution is derived. One remarkable feature of our analytical solution lies in the nontrivial scattering angle dependence. We also show that this analytical solution admits a stable fixed point corresponding to the equilibrium solution as long as the parameters are physically feasible. Furthermore, a clear correspondence between our solution and the BKW solution pertaining to nonrelativistic Maxwell molecules is established, thereby clarifying the non-existence of a BKW-type solution in the relativistic domain for massive particles.

Title: Hypermodularity and community detection in hypergraphs
Authors: Charo I. del Genio
Abstract: Numerous networked systems feature a structure of nontrivial communities, which often correspond to their functional modules. Such communities have been detected in real-world biological, social and technological systems, as well as in synthetic models thereof. While much effort has been devoted to developing methods for community detection in traditional networks, the study of community structure in networks with higher-order interactions is still not as extensively explored. In this article, we introduce a formalism for the hypermodularity of higher-order networks that allows us to use spectral methods to detect community structures in hypergraphs. We apply this approach to synthetic random networks as well as to real-world data, showing that it produces results that reflect the nature and the dynamics of the interactions modelled, thereby constituting a valuable tool for the extraction of hidden information from complex higher-order data sets.

Title: Machine Learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery in CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion
Authors: Prajwal Pisal, Ondrej Krejci, Patrick Rinke
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.

Title: Autonomous Microscopy Experiments through Large Language Model Agents
Authors: Indrajeet Mandal, Jitendra Soni, Mohd Zaki, Morten M. Smedskjaer, Katrin Wondraczek, Lothar Wondraczek, Nitya Nand Gosvami, N. M. Anoop Krishnan
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing self driving laboratories (SDLs) for materials research, promising unprecedented acceleration of scientific discovery. However, current SDL implementations rely on rigid protocols that fail to capture the adaptability and intuition of expert scientists in dynamic experimental settings. We introduce Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant (AILA), a framework automating atomic force microscopy through LLM driven agents. Further, we develop AFMBench a comprehensive evaluation suite challenging AI agents across the complete scientific workflow from experimental design to results analysis. We find that state of the art models struggle with basic tasks and coordination scenarios. Notably, Claude 3.5 sonnet performs unexpectedly poorly despite excelling in materials domain question answering (QA) benchmarks, revealing that domain specific QA proficiency does not necessarily translate to effective agentic capabilities. Additionally, we observe that LLMs can deviate from instructions, raising safety alignment concerns for SDL applications. Our ablations reveal that multi agent frameworks outperform single-agent architectures. We also observe significant prompt fragility, where slight modifications in prompt structure cause substantial performance variations in capable models like GPT 4o. Finally, we evaluate AILA's effectiveness in increasingly advanced experiments AFM calibration, feature detection, mechanical property measurement, graphene layer counting, and indenter detection. Our findings underscore the necessity for rigorous benchmarking protocols and prompt engineering strategies before deploying AI laboratory assistants in scientific research environments.

Title: Ferromagnets from higher $SU(N)$ representations
Authors: Alexios P. Polychronakos, Konstantinos Sfetsos
Abstract: We present a general formalism for deriving the thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of "atoms" carrying an arbitrary irreducible representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through long-range two-body quadratic interactions. Using this formalism, we derive the thermodynamics and phase structure of ferromagnets with atoms in the doubly symmetric or doubly antisymmetric irreducible representations. The symmetric representation leads to a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase with transitions similar to the ones for the fundamental representation studied before. The antisymmetric representation presents qualitatively new features, leading to a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist over a range of temperatures, two of them becoming metastable. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems of atoms with reduced symmetry in their interactions compared to the fundamental case.

Title: Fractonic self-duality and covariant magnetic fractons
Authors: Erica Bertolini, Giandomenico Palumbo
Abstract: Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics, revealing deep connections to gauge theories and gravity. Here, we propose a tensorial generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. Notably, we find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case, precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.

Title: Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field
Authors: E. Medina-Guerra, I. V. Gornyi, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.

Title: Spin-$s$ $Q$-systems: Twist and Open Boundaries
Authors: Yi-Jun He, Jue Hou, Yi-Chao Liu, Zi-Xi Tan
Abstract: In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.

Title: Study of double kicked top: a classical and quantum perspective
Authors: Avadhut V. Purohit, Udaysinh T. Bhosale
Abstract: We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.

Title: Reversing Hydrogen-Related Loss in $α$-Ta Thin Films for Quantum Device Fabrication
Authors: D. P. Lozano, M. Mongillo, B. Raes, Y. Canvel, S. Massar, A. M. Vadiraj, Ts. Ivanov, R. Acharya, J. Van Damme, J. Van de Vondel, D. Wan, A. Potocnik, K. De Greve
Abstract: $\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500°C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.

Title: Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries
Authors: Zijian Liang, Jens Niklas Eberhardt, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: Although high-threshold and low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, such as bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, can reduce the physical-qubit cost by an order of magnitude compared to the Kitaev toric code, their torus layout remains difficult for physical implementation. In this work, we introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully planar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present planar code families with logical dimensions $k=6\sim13$, e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically local weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a $[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of magnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary anyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding high-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware architectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose distance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC codes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold fault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic two-dimensional hardware.

Title: Role of scrambling and noise in temporal information processing with quantum systems
Authors: Weijie Xiong, Zoë Holmes, Armando Angrisani, Yudai Suzuki, Thiparat Chotibut, Supanut Thanasilp
Abstract: Scrambling quantum systems have attracted attention as effective substrates for temporal information processing. Here we consider a quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove that memory decays exponentially in time for local noisy channels. These results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum models.

Title: Quantum Simulation of Charge and Exciton Transfer in Multi-mode Models using Engineered Reservoirs
Authors: Visal So, Midhuna Duraisamy Suganthi, Mingjian Zhu, Abhishek Menon, George Tomaras, Roman Zhuravel, Han Pu, Peter G. Wolynes, José N. Onuchic, Guido Pagano
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.

Huang, Wee Han Lim, Kok Wai Chan, Will Gilbert, Arne Laucht, Andrea Morello, Andre Saraiva, Christopher C. Escott, Sorin P. Voinigescu, Andrew S. Dzurak, Tuomo Tanttu
Abstract: Many quantum technologies require a precise electrical current standard that can only be achieved with expensive cryogenics, or through the secondary standards, such as resistance or voltage. Silicon-based charge pumps could provide such a standard in an inherently scalable way, through their compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication methods. However, coherent quantized charge transfer has so far been demonstrated only in nanoscale devices that are custom-fabricated in academic cleanrooms or research technology foundries. Here, we show that a CMOS device manufactured with commercial 22-nm process node can be used to define a quantum current standard in the International System of Units (SI). We measure an accuracy of (1.2 +/- 0.1)E-3 A/A at 50 MHz with reference to SI voltage and resistance standards in a pumped helium system. We then propose a practical monolithic CMOS chip that incorporates one million parallel connected charge pumps along with on-chip control electronics. This chip could be operated as a table-top primary standard that can be easily integrated with CMOS electronics, generating quantum currents of up to microampere levels.

Title: Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK
Authors: Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez, Jiuci Xu
Abstract: We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.

Title: Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK
Authors: Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.

Title: Neural models of multiscale systems: conceptual limitations, stochastic parametrizations, and a climate application
Authors: Fabrizio Falasca
Abstract: This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.

Title: Passive Quantum Interconnects: High-Fidelity Quantum Networking at Higher Rates with Less Overhead
Authors: Seigo Kikura, Kazufumi Tanji, Akihisa Goban, Shinichi Sunami
Abstract: High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.
