Title: Exact solvability of an Ising-type model, and exact solvability of the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models
Authors: Pete Rigas
Abstract: We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.

Title: Exact solution of two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with a transverse field: a low-dimensional quantum spin system
Authors: Zhidong Zhang
Abstract: The exact solution of ferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with a transverse field, which can be used to describe the critical phenomena in low-dimensional quantum spin systems, is derived by equivalence between the ferromagnetic 2D Ising model with a transverse field and the ferromagnetic three-dimensional (3D) Ising model. The results obtained in this work can be extended to be suitable for the antiferromagnetic 2D Ising model with a transverse field in the cases without frustration.

Title: Odd-parity Magnetism Driven by Antiferromagnetic Exchange
Authors: Yue Yu, Magnus B. Lyngby, Tatsuya Shishidou, Mercè Roig, Andreas Kreisel, Michael Weinert, Brian M. Andersen, Daniel F. Agterberg
Abstract: Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.

Title: Topological insights into dense frictional suspension rheology: Third order loops drive discontinuous shear thickening
Authors: Alessandro D'Amico, Sidong Tu, Abhinendra Singh
Abstract: Dense suspensions exhibit significant viscosity changes under external deformation, a phenomenon known as shear thickening. Recent studies have identified a stress-induced transition from lubricated, unconstrained interactions to frictional contacts, which play a crucial role in shear thickening. This work investigates the rheological behavior and contact network evolution during continuous and discontinuous shear thickening (CST and DST) in two-dimensional simulations. We find that at low stress, during weak thickening, the frictional contact network is composed of quasilinear chains along the compression axis. With increasing stress, the contact network becomes more isotropic, and forms loop-like structures. We show that third-order loops within the frictional contact network are key to this behavior. Our findings revealed a strong correlation between the number of edges in the third-order loops and the viscosity of the suspension. Notably, this relationship remains independent of the packing fraction, applied stress, and interparticle friction, highlighting the fundamental role of the mesoscale network topology in governing macroscopic rheology.

Title: Magnetoelectric effect in van der Waals magnets
Authors: Kai-Xuan Zhang, Giung Park, Youjin Lee, Beom Hyun Kim, Je-Geun Park
Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.

Title: Laws of thermodynamics for exponential families
Authors: Akshay Balsubramani
Abstract: We develop the laws of thermodynamics in terms of general exponential families. By casting learning (log-loss minimization) problems in max-entropy and statistical mechanics terms, we translate thermodynamics results to learning scenarios. We extend the well-known way in which exponential families characterize thermodynamic and learning equilibria. Basic ideas of work and heat, and advanced concepts of thermodynamic cycles and equipartition of energy, find exact and useful counterparts in AI / statistics terms. These ideas have broad implications for quantifying and addressing distribution shift.

Title: ALADYN: a set of Anharmonic LAttice DYNamics codes to compute thermodynamic and thermal transport properties of crystalline solids
Authors: Keivan Esfarjani, Harold Stokes, Safoura Nayeb Sadeghi, Yuan Liang, Bikash Timalsina, Han Meng, Junichiro Shiomi, Bolin Liao, Ruoshi Sun
Abstract: We introduce a lattice dynamics package which calculates elastic, thermodynamic and thermal transport properties of crystalline materials from data on their force and potential energy as a function of atomic positions. The data can come from density functional theory (DFT) calculations or classical molecular dynamics runs performed in a supercell. First, the model potential parameters, which are anharmonic force constants are extracted from the latter runs. Then, once the anharmonic model is defined, thermal conductivity and equilibrium properties at finite temperatures can be computed using lattice dynamics, Boltzmann transport theories, and a variational principle respectively. In addition, the software calculates the mechanical properties such as elastic tensor, Gruneisen parameters and the thermal expansion coefficient within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). Phonons, elastic constants and thermodynamic properties results applied to the germanium crystal will be illustrated. Using the force constants as a force field, one may also perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to investigate the combined effects of anharmonicity and defect scattering beyond perturbation theory.

Title: Spiral Spin Liquid State in the Corrugated Honeycomb Lattice of CaMn$_2$P$_2$
Authors: Farhan Islam, Nikita D. Andriushin, Thaís V. Trevisan, Santanu Pakhira, Simon X. M. Riberolles, Zachary Morgan, Arianna Minelli, David C. Johnston, Robert J. McQueeney, Feng Ye, Peter P. Orth, David Vaknin
Abstract: CaMn$_2$P$_2$ exemplifies the realization of a frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg model of a corrugated honeycomb magnetic lattice. Previous studies show that below the Néel temperature ($T_{\rm N}$), the system forms a cycloidal $6\times 6$ $ab$-plane magnetic unit cell that conforms with various magnetic space groups. Here, we present single-crystal neutron-diffraction studies across expansive reciprocal-space volumes, confirming the cycloidal magnetic structure while uncovering further distinctive features. We find evidence for three magnetic domains, the analysis of which narrows the possible magnetic model structures. At $T_{\rm N}$, the insulator exhibits a sharp phase transition, above which the spin structure transforms into a spiral spin liquid state, evident via a continuous ring of scattering with degenerate wavevectors corresponding to a collection of short-range spiral spin configurations. These degenerate states emerge as thermal fluctuations effectively reduce the $J_3$ interaction. The integration of experimental, theoretical, and real-space simulation results reveals the intricate balance of exchange interactions ($J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$) that stabilizes the ground-state magnetic structure and drives the emergence of a sought-after $U$(1)-symmetric spiral spin-liquid state with easy-plane anisotropy above the transition temperature.

Title: The space writhes and signatures of polymer knots
Authors: Finn Thompson, Maria Maalouf, Alexander R. Klotz
Abstract: The space writhe of a knot is a property of its three-dimensional embedding that contains information about its underlying topology, but the correspondence between space writhe and other topological invariants is not fully understood. We perform Langevin dynamics simulations of knotted semiflexible polymers and measure their ensemble average space writhe. We show that for all knots up to 10 crossings, alternating and non-alternating, the average space writhe is almost equal to that of the tightest known configuration of the same knot, with minor differences. Using this equivalence, we show that for more complex knots with up to 38 crossings, the average space writhe is strongly correlated with the signature of the knot. This establishes that the connection between signature and space writhe holds at larger crossing numbers.

Title: Establishing baselines for generative discovery of inorganic crystals
Authors: Nathan J. Szymanski, Christopher J. Bartel
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials discovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds - against three generative models: a variational autoencoder, a large language model, and a diffusion model. Our results show that established methods such as ion exchange perform comparably well in generating stable materials, although many of these materials tend to closely resemble known compounds. In contrast, generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus while maintaining a high stability rate. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward more effective generative strategies for materials discovery.

Title: Note on two-point mean square displacement
Authors: Naoya Katayama, Takahiro Sakaue
Abstract: When probe molecules of interest are embedded in a container or aggregate under stochastic motion, one needs to rely on the so-called two-point mean square displacement (MSD) measurement to extract the intrinsic mobility of the probes. We discuss two versions, based on the time series of relative vector or distance between two probes, and summarize their basic properties compared to the standard MSD. We also propose a way to extract (i) the non-Gaussianity in the displacement statistics and (ii) the motional correlation between probes from the two-point MSD. The results are presented not only for independent probes, but also for intramolecular probes within a long polymer, which could be useful in quantifying the dynamics of chromatin loci in living cell nucleus.

Title: Enhanced Phonon-Phonon Interactions and Weakened Electron-Phonon Coupling in Charge-Density-Wave Topological Semimetal EuAl4 with a Possible Intermediate Electronic State
Authors: Shize Cao, Feng Jin, Yun-Ze Long, Jianlin Luo, Qingming Zhang, Zhi-Guo Chen
Abstract: The origin of charge density wave (CDW) is a long-term open issue. Furthermore, the evolution of phonon-phonon interactions (PPI) across CDW transitions has rarely been investigated. Besides, whether electron-phonon coupling (EPC) would be weakened or enhanced after CDW transitions is still under debate. Additionally, CDW provides a fertile ground for uncovering intriguing intermediate electronic states. Here, we report a Raman spectroscopy study of the PPI and EPC in topological semimetal EuAl4 exhibiting a CDW phase below temperature Tc ~ 145 K. The free-charge-carrier-density (nc) and temperature dependences of the Fano asymmetric factors (1/|q|) of the two phonon modes A1g and B1g indicates that below Tc, the EPC becomes weakened probably due to the reduction of the nc. Interestingly, in the temperature range from 50 to 145 K, the steep growth of the 1/|q| leading to the significant deviation from the linear dependence on the nc, together with the shoulder-like features in the temperature evolutions of the 1/|q| and the nc around 50 K, implies the possible existence of an intermediate electronic state with the EPC distinctly larger than the CDW ground state in EuAl4. Furthermore, below Tc, the faster decrease in the full width at half maxima of the B1g phonon mode representing the collective vibrations of the CDW-modulated Al1 atoms suggests that a remarkable growth of the PPI for the B1g phonon mode after the CDW phase transition, which is in contrast to the weakening of the EPC and thus may mainly arise from the strengthening of lattice anharmonicity in EuAl4. Our results not only highlight the significance of the enhanced PPI and the weakened EPC in completely understanding the formation of the CDW phase but also initiate the exploration of novel intermediate electronic states in EuAl4.

Title: Quasi-one-dimensional Supersolids in Luther-Emery Liquids
Authors: Ying-Ming Xie, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: The supersolid is a long-sought phase in condensed matter physics, characterized by the coexistence of density wave and superfluid orders. This phase is counterintuitive, as different symmetry-breaking orders typically compete with one another. A deeper understanding of how such a state forms in condensed matter systems remains an open question, especially in quasi-one-dimensional correlated systems. In this work, we investigate the emergence of supersolids in Luttinger-Emery liquids using a variational method. As the system consists of coupled Luttinger-Emery liquid chains, we refer to this phase as a quasi-one-dimensional supersolid. Notably, we demonstrate that the quasi-one-dimensional supersolid phase is energetically favorable in chains with finite size or short-range order. Furthermore, we investigate the collective dynamics of these coexisting charge density waves and superconducting states, identifying a quasi-Goldstone mode. Our theory provides valuable insights into both the ground state and the dynamic properties of supersolids in strongly correlated systems.

Title: Jamming transition and normal modes of polydispersed soft particle packing
Authors: Kuniyasu Saitoh, Brian P. Tighe
Abstract: The jamming transition of soft particles characterized by narrow size distributions has been well studied by physicists. However, polydispersed systems are more relevant to engineering, and the influence of polydispersity on jamming phenomena is still unexplored. Here, we numerically investigate jamming transitions of polydispersed soft particles in two dimensions. We find that polydispersity strongly influences contact forces, local coordination, and the jamming transition density. In contrast, the critical scaling of pressure and elastic moduli is not affected by the particle size distribution. Consistent with this observation, we find that the vibrational density of states is also insensitive to the polydispersity. Our results suggest that, regardless of particle size distributions, both mechanical and vibrational properties of soft particle packings near jamming are governed by the distance to jamming.

Title: Nucleation line in three-component Bose-Einstein condensates in Gross-Pitaevskii theory
Authors: Nguyen Van Thu
Abstract: By means of Gross-Pitaevskii theory we investigate the possibility of wetting phase transition in three-component Bose-Einstein condensates within the strong segregation between components 1 and 2. Third component plays the role of a surfactant, which can wet the interface formed by components 1 and 2. The case of symmetry of components 1 and 2, the equation for nucleation line and wetting phase diagram are studied.

Title: The underappreciated role of nonspecific interactions in the crystallization of DNA-coated colloids
Authors: Hunter Seyforth, Sambarta Chatterjee, Thomas E. Videbæk, Manodeep Mondal, William M. Jacobs, W. Benjamin Rogers
Abstract: Over the last decade, the field of programmable self-assembly has seen an explosion in the diversity of crystal lattices that can be synthesized from DNA-coated colloidal nanometer- and micrometer-scale particles. The prevailing wisdom has been that a particular crystal structure can be targeted by designing the DNA-mediated interactions, to enforce binding between specific particle pairs, and the particle diameters, to control the packing of the various species. In this article, we show that other ubiquitous nonspecific interactions can play equally important roles in determining the relative stability of different crystal polymorphs and therefore what crystal structure is most likely to form in an experiment. For a binary mixture of same-sized DNA-coated colloidal micrometer-scale particles, we show how changing the magnitudes of nonspecific steric and van der Waals interactions gives rise to a family of binary body-centered tetragonal crystals, including both cesium-chloride and copper-gold crystals. Simulations using pair potentials that account for these interactions reproduce our experimental observations quantitatively, and a theoretical model reveals how a subtle balance between specific and nonspecific forces determines the equilibrium crystal structure. These results highlight the importance of accounting for nonspecific interactions in the crystal-engineering design process.

Title: Strong superconducting pairing strength and pseudogap features in a putative multiphase heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh2As2 by soft point-contact spectroscopy
Authors: Qingxin Dong, Tong Shi, Pengtao Yang, Xinyang Liu, Xiaofan Shi, Lei Wang, Junsen Xiang, Hanming Ma, Zhaoming Tian, Jianping Sun, Yoshiya Uwatoko, Genfu Chen, Xinbo Wang, Jie Shen, Rui Wu, Xin Lu, Peijie Sun, Grzegorz Chajewski, Dariusz Kaczorowski, Bosen Wang, Jinguang Cheng
Abstract: CeRh2As2 is a newly discovered candidate of multiphase heavy-fermion superconductor (Tc=0.3 K) with intriguing physical properties. Here, we employ soft point-contact spectroscopy to investigate its energy gap behaviors in both the normal and superconducting states. The differential conductance below Tc reveals an estimated superconducting energy gap of 2{\Delta}SC=0.24 meV and thus an extremely strong superconducting pairing strength 2{\Delta}SC/kBTc=8.8, which is comparable to those of cuprates and iron-based high-Tc superconductors as well as infinite-layer nickelates. Above Tc, a well-defined pseudogap feature is manifested as a V-shaped dip in the differential conductance spanning an energy scale of 2{\Delta}g=0.95-3.0 meV. The pseudogap feature persists to the highest characteristic temperature of Tg=8-9 K and is gradually suppressed by magnetic field of Bg=9.0T regardless of its direction relative to the crystallographic axes. The observation of pseudogap features prior to the superconducting phase transition enriches the phase diagram of CeRh2As2 and provides a novel platform to study the interplay of unconventional superconductivity and pseudogap phenomena.

Title: Decoding active force fluctuations from spatial trajectories of active systems
Authors: Anisha Majhi, Biswajit Das, Subhadeep Gupta, Anand Dev Ranjan, Amirul Islam Mallick, Shuvojit Paul, Ayan Banerjee
Abstract: Mesoscopic active systems exhibit various unique behaviours - absent in passive systems - due to the forces generated by the corresponding constituents by converting their available free energies. However, finding out these forces - which are also stochastic and remain intertwined with the thermal noise - is especially non-trivial. Here, we introduce a technique to extract such fluctuating active forces, with statistical accuracy, acting on a passive particle immersed in an active bath by filtering out the related thermal noise. First, we test the efficacy of our method under numerical scenarios and then apply it to the experimental trajectories of a microscopic particle (optically) trapped inside an active bath consisting of motile this http URL. bacteria. We believe that our approach would be rather effective in the actual measurement of unknown active forces, which are a crucial component in processes involving living matter.

Title: Generalized Onsager's Relation in Magnon Hall Effect and Its Implication
Authors: Jikun Zhou, Yang Gao, Qian Niu
Abstract: By analyzing the spin-group symmetry of magnons, we establish two generalized Onsager's relations in the magnon Hall effect, which reveals the rich and complicated structures of the magnon Berry curvature in the parameter space of different types of the exchange coupling. As an important consequence, we find that the isotropic exchange coupling is equally important as the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya (DM) interaction in determining the magnon Hall effect, and it can transform to the latter under proper gauge transformation. Moreover, the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the symmetric anisotropic exchange coupling together can support the magnon Hall effect without the DM interaction. Both features are exemplified in ferromagnetic honeycomb lattices. Our work lays the ground for decoding the coupling between magnon transport and different types of exchange interactions.

Title: Entropic organization of topologically modified ring polymers in spherical confinement
Authors: Kingkini Roychoudhury, Shreerang Pande, Indrakanty S. Shashank, Debarshi Mitra, Apratim Chatterji
Abstract: It has been shown that under high cylindrical confinement, two ring polymers with excluded volume interactions between monomers, segregate to two halves of the cylinder to maximize their entropy. In contrast, two ring polymers remain mixed within a sphere, as there is no symmetry breaking direction [Nat Rev Microbiol, 8, 600-607 (2010)]. Therefore, in order to observe emergent organization of ring polymers in a sphere, we can introduce an asymmetric topological modification to the polymer architecture by creating a small loop and a big loop within the ring polymer. We consider the bead-spring model of polymers where there are only repulsive excluded volume interactions between the monomers ensuring that the organization we observe is purely entropy-driven. We find that for a single topologically modified polymer within a sphere, the monomers of the bigger loop are statistically more probable to be found closer to the periphery. However, the situation is reversed when we have multiple such topologically modified polymers in a sphere. The monomers of the small loops are found closer to the walls of the sphere. We can increase this localization and radial organization of polymer segments by increasing the number of small loops in each ring polymer. We study how these loops interact with each other within a polymer, as well as with loops of other polymers in spherical confinement. We compare contact maps of multiple such topologically modified polymers in a sphere. Finally, we discuss the plausible relevance of our studies to eukaryotic chromosomes that are confined within a spherical nucleus.

Title: Nonlinear bias of collective oscillation frequency induced by asymmetric Cauchy noise
Authors: Maria V. Ageeva, Denis S. Goldobin
Abstract: We report the effect of nonlinear bias of the frequency of collective oscillations of sin-coupled phase oscillators subject to individual asymmetric Cauchy noises. The noise asymmetry makes the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz inapplicable. We argue that, for all stable non-Gaussian noises, the tail asymmetry is not only possible (in addition to the trivial shift of the distribution median) but also generic in many physical and biophysical set-ups. For the theoretical description of the effect, we develop a mathematical formalism based on the circular cumulants. The derivation of rigorous asymptotic results can be performed on this basis but seems infeasible in traditional terms of the circular moments (the Kuramoto-Daido order parameters). The effect of the entrainment of individual oscillator frequencies by the global oscillations is also reported in detail. The accuracy of theoretical results based on the low dimensional circular cumulant reductions is validated with the high-accuracy "exact" solutions calculated with the continued fraction method.

Title: Topological phase diagram and quantum magnetotransport effects in (Pb,Sn)Se quantum wells with magnetic barriers (Pb,Eu)Se
Authors: Alexander Kazakov, Valentine V. Volobuev, Chang-Woo Cho, Benjamin A. Piot, Zbigniew Adamus, Tomasz Wojciechowski, Tomasz Wojtowicz, Gunther Springholz, Tomasz Dietl
Abstract: Despite several theoretical predictions regarding the physics and application of quantum wells (QWs) of topological crystalline insulators (TCI), no quantized charge transport via helical or chiral edge states has been experimentally demonstrated for such a class of systems. In this study, we report here on a successful growth by molecular beam epitaxy of high crystalline quality Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se:Bi/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs with $x = 0.25$ and $y = 0.1$, and on their magnetotransport characterization as a function of the QW thickness between 10 and 50 nm, temperatures down to 300 mK, perpendicular and tilted magnetic fields up to 36 T. The character of weak antilocalization magnetoresistance and universal conductance fluctuations points to a notably long phase coherence length. It is argued that a relatively large magnitude of the dielectric constant of IV-VI compounds suppresses the decoherence by electron-electron scattering. The observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations and the quantum Hall effect, together with multiband $k\cdot p$ modelling, have enabled us to assess valley degeneracies, the magnitude of strain, subbands effective masses, the Berry phases, and the topological phase diagram as a function of the QW thickness. Our results demonstrate that further progress in controlling Sn content, carrier densities, and magnetism in Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs will allow for the exploration of the topologically protected quantized edge transport even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Furthermore, a reduced strength of electron-electron interactions will result in the absence of unpaired localized spins in the topological gap and, thus, in a substantially longer topological protection length compared to the quantum spin Hall materials explored so far.

Title: Ultrafast Chirality-dependent Dynamics from Helicity-resolved Transient Absorption Spectroscopy
Authors: Xiu Zhang, Lu Zhang, Junzhi Zhu, Tingxiao Qin, Haiyun Huang, Baixu Xiang, Haiyun Liu, Qihua Xiong
Abstract: Chirality, a pervasive phenomenon in nature, is widely studied across diverse fields including the origins of life, chemical catalysis, drug discovery, and physical optoelectronics. The investigations of natural chiral materials have been constrained by their intrinsically weak chiral effects. Recently, significant progress has been made in the fabrication and assembly of low-dimensional micro and nanoscale chiral materials and their architectures, leading to the discovery of novel optoelectronic phenomena such as circularly polarized light emission, spin and charge flip, advocating great potential for applications in quantum information, quantum computing, and biosensing. Despite these advancements, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the generation, propagation, and amplification of chirality in low-dimensional chiral materials and architectures remain largely unexplored. To tackle these challenges, we focus on employing ultrafast spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of chirality evolution, with the aim of attaining a more profound understanding of the microscopic mechanisms governing chirality generation and amplification. This review thus provides a comprehensive overview of the chiral micro-/nano-materials, including two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), chiral halide perovskites, and chiral metasurfaces, with a particular emphasis on the physical mechanism. This review further explores the advancements made by ultrafast chiral spectroscopy research, thereby paving the way for innovative devices in chiral photonics and optoelectronics.

Title: First principles phase diagram calculation and theoretical investigation of electronic structure properties of $\mathrm{KCuTe_{1-x}Se_{x}}$ for photocathode applications
Authors: Arini Kar, K.R. Balasubramaniam, Dayadeep S. Monder
Abstract: Recent high-throughput studies of copper-based semiconductors have identified potassium-based copper chalcogenides, KCuA (A $\in$ Te, Se, S) as optimal light absorbers in photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical devices. In this work, we investigate the applicability of $\mathrm{KCuTe_{1-x}Se_{x}}$ as photocathode materials using first-principles calculations. The calculated temperature-composition phase diagram predicts the formation of the solid solution of $\mathrm{KCuTe_{1-x}Se_{x}}$ in the hexagonal structure beyond a maximum critical temperature of 322 K. Structure relaxation in the alloy competes with volume deformation of the parent lattice and charge exchange between (Te, Se) anions to produce a net linear variation in the bandgap with the alloy concentration. The following results suggest that this alloy is a suitable photocathode: i) lower effective mass, and hence a higher mobility of electrons in the alloy compared to the end compounds, ii) an absorption coefficient of the order of $\mathrm{10^{5}\ cm^{-1}}$, and iii) an appropriate alignment of the conduction band with respect to the hydrogen reduction reaction.

Abstract: The diversity of 2D materials and their van der Waals (vdW) stacking presents a fertile ground for engineering novel multifunctional materials and quantum states of matter. This permits unique opportunities to tailor the electronic properties of vdW heterostructures by the insertion of only a single 2D material layer. However, such vdW materials engineering at the atomic scale has yet to be investigated for spin-charge interconversion phenomena. Here, we report on the control of these effects at the monolayer level, where drastic increase in intensity and change in sign of THz spintronic emission are demonstrated by inserting a single layer of MoSe$_2$ between PtSe$_2$ and graphene in a fully epitaxial, large area stacked structure. By using a combination of spin and angle resolved photoemission and density functional theory to reveal the electronic and spin structures, we illustrate two different mechanisms relying on charge transfer and electronic hybridization for the formation of Rashba states, which are responsible for spin-charge conversion and hence the THz spintronic emission. These findings open new pathways to design, at the atomic scale, efficient THz spintronic emitters made of 2D materials and other spintronic devices based on spin-charge interconversion phenomena.

Title: Kovacs-like memory effect in a sheared colloidal glass: role of non-affine flows
Authors: Maitri Mandal, Abhishek Ghadai, Rituparno Mandal, Sayantan Majumdar
Abstract: Memory effect reflects a system's ability to encode, retain and retrieve information about its past. Such effects are essentially an out-of-equilibrium phenomenon providing insight into the complex structural and dynamical behavior of the system. Kovacs effect is one such memory effect that is traditionally associated with thermal history. Although studies on the Kovacs-like memory effect have been extended to mechanical perturbations such as compression-decompression, whether such effects can also be observed under volume-conserving perturbations like shear, remains unclear. Combining experiments, simulations and linear response theory we demonstrate Kovacs-like memory effect in a sheared colloidal glass. Moreover, we explore the influence of non-linear perturbations and establish a correlation between the deviation from linear response prediction and microscopic non-affine flows generated due to such large deformations in affecting the memory effect. Our study not only extends Kovacs-like memory effect in the domain of volume-conserving mechanical perturbations, it also highlights the importance of the nature of underlying microscopic flows in controlling the memory effect in amorphous matter.

Title: High Temperature Superconductivity in the Cuprates: Phenomena from a Theorist's Point of View
Authors: T. V. Ramakrishnan
Abstract: I present a selection of experimental results on metallic cuprates, both above the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ (often called the strange metal state) and in the superconducting state. It highlights this still poorly understood part of the physical world. After an introduction, I talk briefly about the pseudogap regime and about the unusual linear resistivity phenomenon. Several empirical correlations between observed quantities are mentioned, e.g. $T_c$ and superfluid density (Uemura), $T_c$ and next nearest neighbour hopping, slope of the linear resistivity and $T_c$. In the belief that a comprehensive explanation may need an understanding of the extremely strongly correlated metal, a few initial steps in this direction are outlined.

Title: Valley-mediated singlet- and triplet-polaron interactions and quantum dynamics in a doped WSe$_2$ monolayer
Authors: Yue Ni, Di Huang, Danfu Liang, Albert Liu, Xiaohui Liu, Kevin Sampson, Zhida Liu, Jianmin Quan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Dmitry K. Efimkin, Jesper Levinsen, Meera M. Parish, Xiaoqin Li
Abstract: In doped transition metal dichalcogenides, optically created excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) can strongly interact with a Fermi sea of electrons to form Fermi polaron quasiparticles. When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as is the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive) polarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi sea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence evolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable Fermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with these resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley coherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond time scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion process leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization, persisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet polaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides valuable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley indexes in atomically thin semiconductors.

Title: Electron-Phonon Temperature Inversion in Nanostructures under Pulsed Photoexcitation
Authors: Qian Ye, Stephen K. Sanders, Andrea Schirato, Alessandro Alabastri
Abstract: Photoexcitation of metallic nanostructures with short optical pulses can drive non-thermal electronic states, which, upon decay, lead to elevated electronic temperatures ($T_e \gtrapprox 1000\,\mathrm{K}$) eventually equilibrating with the lattice ($T_p$) through electron-phonon scattering. Here, we show that, in spatially extended nanostructures, the lattice temperature can locally exceed that of the electrons, a seemingly counterintuitive transient effect termed hereafter ``temperature inversion'' ($T_p > T_e$). This phenomenon, fundamentally due to inhomogeneous absorption patterns and absent in smaller particles, emerges from a complex spatio-temporal interplay, between the electron-phonon coupling and competing electronic thermal diffusion. By combining rigorous three-dimensional (3D) finite-element-method-based simulations with practical reduced zero-dimensional (0D) analytical models, we identify the electron-phonon coupling coefficient ($G_{e-p}$) as the critical parameter governing this behavior. An optimal $G_{e-p}$ range allows the inversion, whereas a weak or overly strong coupling suppresses it. Among common plasmonic metals, platinum (Pt) exhibits the most pronounced and long-lived inversion, while gold (Au) and silver (Ag) show no significant inversion. Moreover, the close agreement between the 0D and 3D results, once an appropriate characteristic length is selected, highlights that the essential physics governing the inversion can be captured without full spatial complexity. These results provide insights for optimizing nanoscale energy transfer and hot-carrier-driven processes, guiding the strategic design of materials, geometries, and excitation conditions for enhanced ultrafast photothermal control.

Title: The effect of stereochemical constraints on the radius of gyration of folded proteins
Authors: Jack A. Logan, Jacob Sumner, Alex T. Grigas, Mark D. Shattuck, Corey S. OHern
Abstract: Proteins are composed of linear chains of amino acids that fold into complex three-dimensional structures. A general feature of folded proteins is that they are compact with a radius of gyration $R_g(N) \sim N^{\nu}$ that obeys power-law scaling with the number of amino acids $N$ in each protein and $\nu \sim 1/3$. In this study, we investigate the {\it internal} scaling of the radius of gyration $R_g(n)$ versus the chemical separation $n$ between amino acids for all subchains of length $n$. We show that for globular proteins $R_g(n) \sim n^{\nu_{1,2}}$ with a larger exponent $\nu_1 > 1/3$ for small $n$ and a smaller exponent $\nu_{2} < 1/3$ for large $n$, such that $R_g(N) \propto N^\nu$. To describe this scaling behavior for $R_g(n)$, we carry out folding simulations for a series of coarse-grained models for proteins beginning with the freely-jointed and freely-rotating chain models composed of spherical monomers and varying degrees of stereochemical constraints. We show that a minimal model, which coarse-grains amino acids into a single spherical backbone atom and one variable-sized spherical side-chain atom, and enforces bend- and dihedral-angle constraints, can recapitulate $R_g(n)$ for x-ray crystal structures of globular proteins. In addition, this model predicts the correct average packing fraction and size of the hydrophobic core, which are two key physical features that can be used to distinguish between computational `decoys' and correctly folded proteins in protein design applications.

Title: High-temperature field-free superconducting diode effect in high-Tc cuprates
Authors: Shichao Qi, Jun Ge, Chengcheng Ji, Yiwen Ai, Gaoxing Ma, Ziqiao Wang, Zihan Cui, Yi Liu, Ziqiang Wang, Jian Wang
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.

Title: Efficient periodic density functional theory calculations of charged molecules and surfaces using Coulomb kernel truncation
Authors: Sudarshan Vijay, Martin Schlipf, Henrique Miranda, Ferenc Karsai, Merzuk Kaltak, Martijn Marsman, Georg Kresse
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of charged molecules and surfaces are critical to applications in electro-catalysis, energy materials and related fields of materials science. DFT implementations such as the Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) compute the electrostatic potential under 3D periodic boundary conditions, necessitating charge neutrality. In this work, we implement 0D and 2D periodic boundary conditions to facilitate DFT calculations of charged molecules and surfaces respectively. We implement these boundary conditions using the Coulomb kernel truncation method. Our implementation computes the potential under 0D and 2D boundary conditions by selectively subtracting unwanted long-range interactions in the potential computed under 3D boundary conditions. By combining the Coulomb kernel truncation method with a computationally efficient padding approach, we remove nonphysical potentials from vacuum in 0D and 2D systems. To illustrate the computational efficiency of our method, we perform large supercell calculations of the formation energy of a charged chlorine defect on a sodium chloride (001) surface and perform long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations on a stepped gold (211) | water electrode-electrolyte interface.

Title: Connecting Shear Thinning and Dynamic Heterogeneity in Supercooled Liquids by Localized Elasticity
Authors: Ke-Qi Zeng, Dong-Xu Yu, Zhe Wang
Abstract: Dynamic heterogeneity and shear thinning are two universal dynamic phenomena in supercooled liquids, respectively at the microscopic level and the macroscopic level. With simulation, we show that they are quantitatively bridged by localized elasticity embodied as transient clusters that elastically respond to shear. Prominent dynamic heterogeneity emerges right after the massive yielding of these clusters, which is initiated by shear transformation zones and facilitated by elastically mediated interaction. With this picture, a scaling law relating shear thinning to the characteristic length scale of dynamic heterogeneity is found.

Title: Large upper critical fields and strong coupling superconductivity in the medium-entropy alloy (Ti1/3Hf1/3Ta1/3)1-xNbx
Authors: Longfu Li, Hongyan Tian, Xunwu Hu, Lingyong Zeng, Kuan Li, Peifeng Yu, Kangwang Wang, Rui Chen, Zaichen Xiang, Dao-Xin Yao, Huixia Luo
Abstract: Since the discovery of high-entropy superconductors in 2014, superconductivity has remained a focal point of interest in medium- and high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs). Here, we report a series of (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors crystallized in the BCC structure, whose superconductivity was characterized by resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. The study found that the (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEAs exhibit bulk superconductivity. With the doping of Nb, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) increases from 5.31 K to 9.11 K, and the normalized Cel jumps at Tc, and the logarithmically averaged characteristic phonon frequency exhibit dome-shaped curves. Results from specific heat measurements indicate that the superconductivity is of a strongly coupled s-wave type observed. Furthermore, at low Nb content, the upper critical field of the samples is larger than the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The strongly coupling behavior and large upper critical field in s-wave type (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors are unusual, as they typically occur in other unconventional superconductors. Thus, (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx may have significant potential in the research and understanding of physical mechanisms.

Title: Anomalous bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear Rice-Mele model
Authors: Chenxi Bai, Zhaoxin Liang
Abstract: Bulk-edge correspondence (BEC) constitutes a fundamental concept within the domain of topological physics, elucidating the profound interplay between the topological invariants that characterize the bulk states and the emergent edge states. A recent highlight along this research line consists of establishing BEC under the eigenvalue's nonlinearity in a linear Hamiltonian by introducing auxiliary eigenvalues [\href{this https URL}{ T. Isobe {\it et al.,} Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)}]. The purpose of this work aims to extend Isobe's analysis to uncover BEC of eigenvalue's nonlinearity in intrinsic nonlinear Hamiltonians. To achieve this, we numerically solve the nonlinear Rice-Mele (RM) model and identify two distinct types of nonlinear eigenvalues: the intrinsically nonlinear eigenvalues and the eigenvalue's nonlinearity introduced through the incorporation of auxiliary eigenvalues. Furthermore, we establish a novel form of BEC based on these auxiliary nonlinear eigenvalues, which we term the anomalous BEC of a nonlinear physical system. The concept of the anomalous BEC defined herein provides a novel perspective on the intricate interplay between topology and nonlinearity in the context of BEC.

Title: Materials Discovery in Combinatorial and High-throughput Synthesis and Processing: A New Frontier for SPM
Authors: Boris N. Slautin, Yongtao Liu, Yu Liu, Reece Emery, Seungbum Hong, Astita Dubey, Vladimir V. Shvartsman, Doru C. Lupascu, Sheryl L. Sanchez, Mahshid Ahmadi, Yunseok Kim, Evgheni Strelcov, Keith A. Brown, Philip D. Rack, Sergei V. Kalinin
Abstract: For over three decades, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been a key method for exploring material structures and functionalities at nanometer and often atomic scales in ambient, liquid, and vacuum environments. Historically, SPM applications have predominantly been downstream, with images and spectra serving as a qualitative source of data on the microstructure and properties of materials, and in rare cases of fundamental physical knowledge. However, the fast growing developments in accelerated material synthesis via self-driving labs and established applications such as combinatorial spread libraries are poised to change this paradigm. Rapid synthesis demands matching capabilities to probe structure and functionalities of materials on small scales and with high throughput, which are characteristically inherent to SPM. Here, we overview SPM methods applicable to these emerging applications and emphasize their quantitativeness, focusing on piezoresponse force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy, conductive, and surface photovoltage measurements. We discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead, asserting that SPM will play a crucial role in closing the loop from material prediction and synthesis to characterization.

Title: Orbital Order Triggered Out-of-Plane Ferroelectricity in Magnetic Transition Metal di-halide Monolayers
Authors: Xiao-Feng Luo, Xu He, Rui Wang, Hongjun Xiang, Jin-Zhu Zhao
Abstract: Although multiferroics have undergone extensive examination for several decades, the occurrence of ferroelectricity induced by orbital order is only scarcely documented. In this study, we propose the existence of spontaneous ferroelectric states featuring a finite out-of-plane polarization in monolayer compounds of magnetic transition metal di-halides. Our first principles analysis reveals that partially occupied d-orbital states within octahedra exhibit a preference for spatial orbital order within a two-dimensional lattice. The absence of inversion symmetry, arising from orbital order, serves as the driving force introducing additional electric polarization along the out-of-plane direction. Unlike previous reported orbital orders arising from metal states in lattice, the non-colinear ones we studied in this work relate to the transition between two insulator states. The resultant asymmetric Jahn-Teller distortions are accompanied as the consequence producing additional ionic polarization. Importantly, our findings indicate that this mechanism is not confined to a specific material but is a shared characteristic among a series of monolayer transition metal magnetic di-halides, proposing an innovative form of intrinsic two-dimensional multiferroic physics.

Title: Time-reversal symmetry breaking fractional quantum spin Hall insulator in moir\'e MoTe2
Authors: Kaifei Kang, Yichen Qiu, Bowen Shen, Kihong Lee, Zhengchao Xia, Yihang Zeng, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jie Shan, Kin Fai Mak
Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moiré lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}<1 all the way to {\nu}>6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.

Title: Universal classes of disorder scatterings in in-plane anomalous Hall effect
Authors: Guoao Yang, Tao Qin, Jianhui Zhou
Abstract: The in-plane anomalous Hall effect (IPAHE) with planar Hall current and magnetization/magnetic fields in various quantum materials has received increasing attentions. Most of current efforts are devoted to the intrinsic part due to the Berry curvature of electronic bands, however, how the disorder scatterings affect the extrinsic part (skew scattering and side jump) still remains largely elusive. Here we theoretically investigated the three universal classes of disorder scatterings (scalar, spin-conserving and spin-flipping) on the IPAHE based on the prototypical two-dimensional massive Dirac fermion model with warping term under generic Zeeman fields. We find the different disorder scatterings result in distinct dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity on disorder strength and recover previous known results in some limits. Remarkably, the spin-flipping scattering could give rise to nontrivial contributions featuring sinusoidal oscillation with periods of $\pi$ and $2\pi$ to the extrinsic part, in contrast to the standard two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. Our work unveils the rich features of anomalous transport in planar Hall geometry in the presence of disorder scatterings and provides some useful insights into the magnetotransport phenomena.

Title: Investigation of magnetic ordering with spin reorientation transition and optical properties in DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ nanomaterials
Authors: M. M. Islam, M. A. Islam, Rana Hossain, M. J. Hosen, M. D. I. Bhuyan
Abstract: This study reports the synthesis and physical properties of polycrystalline DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ (DCCO) nanoparticles. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using Rietveld refinement showed that the compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm. The particle size of approximately 57 nm was confirmed through micrographs obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations identified a mixed-valence state of Co and Cr cations. Magnetic susceptibility data indicated Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 140-340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 119 K. At 31 K, DCCO shows spin reorientation transition from $\Gamma_4$(G$_x$A$_y$F$_z$) to $\Gamma_2$(F$_x$C$_y$G$_z$). Furthermore, room-temperature magnetization measurements demonstrated the antiferromagnetic behavior with weak ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Additionally, DCCO exhibited semiconducting behavior with a direct optical bandgap of 1.97 eV, indicating promise for visible-light-driven energy harvesting and catalytic applications.

Title: Impact of Composition and Chain Length on the Interfacial and Thermodynamic Properties of Cyclic and Linear Polymer Blends
Authors: Oluwatumininu Emmanuel Ayo-Ojo, Nkosinathi Dlamini
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the structural properties of a cyclic and linear polymer blend confined within interfaces, comparing the properties of the different polymer systems as their composition and length vary through molecular dynamics simulations. Our analysis reveals that the local composition orderings of cyclic and linear polymers near the surface exhibit distinct differences. However, at longer lengths and increasing the cyclic concentration, it was shown that heat capacity increases until it gets to a threshold whereby increasing the length or cyclic concentration results in decrease and subsequently similar values. Notably, our findings indicate the stress-related properties of polymer blends and the influence of molecular weight and chain structure on developing sustainable strategies for lessening the environmental impact of polymers

Title: Inverted Temperature Gradients in Gold-Palladium Antenna-Reactor Nanoparticles
Authors: Felix Stete, Shivani Kesarwani, Charlotte Ruhmlieb, Florian Schulz, Matias Bargheer, Holger Lange
Abstract: In addition to enhanced fields and possible charge transfer, the concentration of photothermal energy at the nanoscale is a foundation of plasmon-driven photochemistry. We demonstrate a further enhancement of heat localization during the dissipation of energy in a bimetallic antenna--reactor system with palladium satellites attached to a gold nanoparticle. After pulsed excitation of the gold core, the satellites collect nearly all photothermal energy and heat up by 180\,K while the light-absorbing gold core remains much colder. By comparing transient absorption dynamics of a series of bimetallic nanoparticles with a three-temperature model, we can precisely assess the temperatures of the electronic and vibrational subsystems. We find a strong inverted temperature gradient that opposes the direction of energy input and concentrates the light energy at the active catalytic nanosite.

Title: Phase diagram of a biaxial nematogenic lattice model: A Monte Carlo simulation study
Authors: Mrinal Kanti Debnath, Soumyajit Pramanick, Sudeshna DasGupta, Nababrata Ghoshal
Abstract: The phase diagram for a lattice system of biaxial molecules possessing $D_{2h}$ symmetry and interacting with Straley's quadrupolar pair potential in Sonnet-Virga-Durand parameterization [A. M. Sonnet, E. G. Virga, and G. E. Durand, Phys. Rev. E {\bf67}, 061701 (2003)] has been determined using Monte Carlo simulation. Our results confirm that the nematogenic model yields both the uniaxial and biaxial nematic macroscopic phases along with a tricritical point in the transition from uniaxial to biaxial nematics as predicted in mean field theory. By analyzing the behavior of a free-energy-like function, derived from the probability distributions of energy, the order of phase transitions is detected. A conclusive numerical evidence in support of the existence of a tricritical point on the uniaxial-biaxial transition line in the phase diagram is reported. Although the nature of the phase diagram is qualitatively identical as obtained in the mean-field study however the location of the triple point differs significantly from theoretical prediction.

Title: Intrinsic thermal Hall effect of optical phonons enhanced by discrete rotational symmetry
Authors: Xuesong Hu, Junren Shi
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity contributed by optical phonons in a cubic system. The discrete rotational symmetry of the system splits the degeneracy of transverse modes across most regions of wave-vector space, except along a few high-symmetry lines. Consequently, in the presence of an external magnetic field, phonon Berry curvatures become sharply peaked near the high-symmetry lines. We find that the singular distribution of the Berry curvature induces an intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity that is significantly enhanced compared to an isotropic system. It exhibits a nonlinear $B\ln B$ dependence on the magnetic field $B$ and a non-monotonic temperature dependence. At elevated temperatures, it reverses sign and approaches a non-vanishing value asymptotically. Our analysis indicates that the behavior results from competition between contributions from Berry curvatures near different high-symmetry lines.

Title: Hierarchical self-assembly for high-yield addressable complexity at fixed conditions
Authors: Miranda Holmes-Cerfon, Matthieu Wyart
Abstract: There is evidence that the self-assembly of complex molecular systems often proceeds hierarchically, by first building subunits that later assemble in larger entities, in a process that can repeat multiple times. Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon and its performance is limited. Here we introduce a simple model for hierarchical addressable self-assembly, where interactions between particles can be optimised to maximise the fraction of a well-formed target structure, or yield. We find that a hierarchical strategy leads to an impressive yield up to at least five generations of the hierarchy, and does not require a cycle of temperatures as used in previous methods. High yield is obtained when the microscopic interaction decreases with the scale of units considered, such that the total interaction between intermediate structures remains identical at all scales. We provide thermodynamic and dynamical arguments constraining the interaction strengths where this strategy is effective. Overall, our work characterizes an alternative strategy for addressable self-assembly at a fixed temperature, and provides insight into the mechanisms sustaining hierarchical assembly in biology.

Title: Random transverse and longitudinal field Ising chains
Authors: Tamás Petö, Ferenc Iglói, István A. Kovács
Abstract: Motivated by experimental results on compounds like ${\rm LiHo}_x{\rm Y}_{1-x}{\rm F}_4$, we consider an Ising chain with random bonds in the simultaneous presence of random transverse and longitudinal fields. We study the low-energy properties of the model at zero temperature by the strong disorder renormalization group (SDRG) this http URL the absence of random longitudinal fields, the model showcases a trivial quantum-ordered and quantum-disordered fixed-point and a non-trivial infinite disorder critical point. In the absence of random transverse fields, the behavior is dictated by the classical random-field Ising fixed-point. In the simultaneous presence of both a longitudinal and transverse random field, the RG trajectories are attracted to one of the two disordered fixed-points and the relevant scaling direction at the infinite disorder fixed-point is along the separatrix, where the correlation-length is shown to diverge with an exponent $\nu_h \approx 1$.

Title: Comparative study on radiation resistance of WTaCrV high-entropy alloy and tungsten in helium-containing conditions
Authors: Amin Esfandiarpour, Damian Kalita, Zbigniew Koziol, Mikko Alava
Abstract: W and W-based high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are promising candidates for plasma-facing materials in fusion reactors. While irradiation studies on W have revealed a tendency for helium (He) bubble formation and radiation-induced defects, investigations of WTaCrV HEA have demonstrated superior radiation resistance, whether under He+ irradiation or heavy ion irradiation. To assess material performance under conditions relevant to fusion reactors - characterized by fast neutrons and gas production from transmutation reactions - complex irradiation environments need to be modeled. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we examined defect evolution in W and equimolar WTaCrV HEA with and without preexisting He atoms under cascade overlap conditions up to 0.2 dpa at 300 K. In W, dislocation loops and large interstitial clusters formed readily, with increasing He content leading to higher dislocation densities and the formation of polygonal interstitial networks. In contrast, the WTaCrV alloy exhibited strong resistance to the formation of dislocation loops and large interstitial clusters but was more susceptible to the formation of bubbles at higher He concentrations. Bubble growth was driven by helium trapping at vacancy sites and the coalescence of smaller bubbles. Larger bubbles remained stable against cascade overlap, limiting further growth by coalescence.

Title: Slow modulation of the contraction patterns in Physarum polycephalum
Authors: Raphael Saiseau, Valentin Busson, Marc Durand
Abstract: Physarum polycephalum, a biological transport network, has emerged as a model for the study of self-organisation and coordination at large spatial scales. This self-organisation is largely due to cytoplasmic fluid flows driven by propagating contractile waves that are delocalised over the entire organism. Furthermore, complex modulation of these contractile waves on long time scales has also been observed, but is scarcely studied. In this study, we comprehensively characterise this long-time scale modulation by confining the organism within ring this http URL findings reveal a clear correlation between contractile wave direction, amplitude modulation, and the moving mean vein diameter. We observe simultaneous spatio-temporal travelling and standing wave patterns that bear a resemblance to the ring oscillating fundamental modes. Furthermore, we ascertain that the time periods of these modes scale with the system size and correspond to multiples of the statistically observed intrinsic modulation time scale. This suggests the presence of a common mechanism. These findings serve to reinforce the hypothesis that the flows patterns modulation is the result of the transport of a chemical agent responsible for modifying the local rigidity of the membrane, which would act as a signaling mechanism for the organism.

Title: Interacting topological magnons in the Kitaev-Heisenberg honeycomb ferromagnet with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
Authors: Jie Wang, Jin Wen Li, Pei Chen, Bing Tang
Abstract: The study of the Heisenberg-Kitaev honeycomb ferromagnets has recently drawn attention because of their rich topological properties. Topological phase transitions may arise when there exist two or more distinct topological phases, and they are often revealed by a gap-closing phenomenon. In this work, we investigate the magnonic properties of honeycomb ferromagnets exhibiting Kitaev and DMI interactions in the presence of a Heisenberg exchange and magnetocrystalline anisotropy exposed to a magnetic field. We employ the Self-Consistent Renormalization (SCR) spin wave theory to investigate the effects of magnon-magnon interactions (MMIs) and thermal fluctuations on the properties of magnons. Our findings demonstrate that the magnon system undergoes topological phase transitions driven by temperature and magnetic fields, which are attributed to MMIs. Specifically, as the temperature rises, the magnon band gap at the Dirac points closes and reopens at the critical temperature Tc , which is below the Curie temperature. By showing that the Chern numbers of the magnonic bands are distinct above and below Tc , we confirm that the gap-closing phenomenon is indeed a signature for the topological phase transitions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the thermal Hall conductivity in the magnonic system exhibits a sign reversal at Tc , which can serve as an experimental probe of its topological nature.

Title: Stacking-dependent Electronic and Topological Properties in van der Waals Antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ Films
Authors: Jiaheng Li, Quansheng Wu, Hongming Weng
Abstract: Combining first-principles calculations and tight-binding Hamiltonians, we study the stack-dependent behaviour of electronic and topological properties of layered antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Lateral shift of top septuple-layer greatly modify electronic properties, and even induce topological phase transition between quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with $C=1$ and trivial magnetic insulators with $C=0$. The local energy minimum of ``incorrect" stacking order exhibits thickness-dependent topology opposite to the usual stacking order, which is attribute to relatively weakened interlayer Te-Te interaction in ``incorrect" stacking configuration. Our effective model analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved, and we also propose two optical setups that can effectively differentiate between different stacking configurations. Our findings underscores the nuanced and profound influence that interlayer sliding in magnetic topological materials can have on the macroscopic quantum states, opening new avenues for the design and engineering of topological quantum materials.

Title: Anomalous Magnetotransport in the Paramagnetic State of a Magnetic Kagome Metal EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4}
Authors: Yun Shu, Xinrun Mi, Yuhao Wei, Sixue Tao, Aifeng Wang, Yisheng Chai, Dashuai Ma, Xiaolong Yang, Mingquan He
Abstract: We investigate the electrical transport properties of a magnetic kagome metal EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4}, which undergoes magnetic ordering below $T_\mathrm{C}=10.5$ K. Unlike typical magnets showing anomalous magnetotransport in their ordered states, EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4} exhibits unusual magnetotransport behaviors in its paramagnetic phase. Specifically, the magnetoconductivity shows a linear dependence on magnetic field at low fields below $\sim 1$ T, and the Hall conductivity undergoes a sign change below about 2 T. These behaviors resemble those observed in the charge density wave (CDW) phase of kagome metals \textit{A}V\textsubscript{3}Sb\textsubscript{5} (\textit{A} = K, Rb, Cs). The anomalous magnetotransport in \textit{A}V\textsubscript{3}Sb\textsubscript{5} has commonly been attributed to the possible emergence of a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral CDW order. However, given the absence of CDW in EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4} and its manifestation exclusively in the paramagnetic state, the anomalous magnetotransport observed in EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4} is likely associated with multiband transport and/or the van Hove singularities near the Fermi level.

Title: Generalized Huang's Equation for Phonon Polariton in Polyatomic Polar Crystal
Authors: Weiliang Wang, Ningsheng Xu, Yingyi Jiang, Zhibing Li, Zebo Zheng, Huanjun Chen, Shaozhi Deng
Abstract: The original theory of phonon polariton is Huang's equation which is suitable for diatomic polar crystals only. We proposed a generalized Huang's equation without fitting parameters for phonon polariton in polyatomic polar crystals. We obtained the dispersions of phonon polariton in GaP (bulk), hBN (bulk and 2D), {\alpha}-MoO3 (bulk and 2D) and ZnTeMoO6 (2D), which agree with the experimental results in the literature and of ourselves. We also obtained the eigenstates of the phonon polariton. We found that the circular polarization of the ion vibration component of these eigenstates is nonzero in hBN flakes. The result is different from that of the phonon in hBN.

Title: Floquet geometric squeezing in fast-rotating condensates
Authors: Li Chen, Fei Zhu, Yunbo Zhang, Han Pu
Abstract: Constructing and manipulating quantum states in fast-rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) has long stood as a significant challenge as the rotating speed approaching the critical velocity. Although the recent experiment [Science, 372, 1318 (2021)] has realized the geometrically squeezed state of the guiding-center mode, the remaining degree of freedom, the cyclotron mode, remains unsqueezed due to the large energy gap of Landau levels. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a Floquet-based state-preparation protocol by periodically driving an anisotropic potential. This protocol not only facilitates the single cyclotron-mode squeezing, but also enables a two-mode squeezing. Such two-mode squeezing offers a richer set of dynamics compared to single-mode squeezing and can achieve wavepacket width well below the lowest Landau level limit. Our work provides a highly controllable knob for realizing diverse geometrically squeezed states in ultracold quantum gases within the quantum Hall regime.

Title: Emergence of Giant Magnetic Chirality during Dimensionality Crossover of Magnetic Materials
Authors: Dae-Yun Kim, Yun-Seok Nam, Younghak Kim, Kyoung-Whan Kim, Gyungchoon Go, Seong-Hyub Lee, Joon Moon, Jun-Young Chang, Ah-Yeon Lee, Seung-Young Park, Byoung-Chul Min, Kyung-Jin Lee, Hyunsoo Yang, Duck-Ho Kim, Sug-Bong Choe
Abstract: Chirality, an intrinsic preference for a specific handedness, is a fundamental characteristic observed in nature. In magnetism, magnetic chirality arises from the anti-symmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in competition with the symmetric Heisenberg exchange interaction. Traditionally, the anti-symmetric interaction has been considered minor relative to the symmetric interaction. In this study, we demonstrate an observation of giant magnetic chirality during the dimensionality crossover of magnetic materials from three-dimensional to two-dimensional. The ratio between the anti-symmetric and symmetric interactions exhibits a reversal in their dominance over this crossover, overturning the traditional consideration. This observation is validated theoretically using a non-local interaction model and tight-binding calculation with distinct pairing schemes for each exchange interaction throughout the crossover. Additional experiments investigating the asphericity of orbital moments corroborate the robustness of our findings. Our findings highlight the critical role of dimensionality in shaping magnetic chirality and offer strategies for engineering chiral magnet states with unprecedented strength, desired for the design of spintronic materials.

Title: Image-charge detection of electrons on helium in an on-chip trapping device
Authors: Mikhail Belianchikov, Natalia Morais, Denis Konstantinov
Abstract: Electrons trapped on the surface of superfluid helium have been thought of as a useful resource for quantum computing. Such electrons show long coherence of their surface-bound (Rydberg) states combined with their easy electrostatic manipulation. Recent proposals explored the possibility of coupling the spin state of an electron and the state of its quantized motion with a promise of a highly scalable 2D architecture for a quantum computer. However, despite recent progress in the detection of quantized lateral motion of electrons using a circuit-QED setup, the manipulation of a small number of electrons and their quantum state detection remains a challenging problem. Here, we report on the detection of the Rydberg transition of electrons on superfluid helium in an on-chip microchannel device in which electrons are moved and trapped by a set of electrostatic gates. A highly sensitive image-charge detection system allows us not only to resolve the transition spectra of such electrons, but also to perform the device characterization. The demonstrated sensitivity shows the feasibility of detecting the Rydberg transition of a single electron, which can open a new pathway for a non-destructive spin-state readout.

Title: Polarization-induced Quantum Spin Hall Insulator and Topological Devices in InAs Quantum Wells
Authors: Chenhao Liang, Sheng Zhang, Haohao Sheng, Quansheng Wu, Hongming Weng, Zhong Fang, Zhijun Wang
Abstract: In this work, we predict the emergence of a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) in conventional semiconductors, specifically InAs quantum wells, driven by a built-in polarization field. We propose QSHI InAs quantum wells as a platform to engineer topological field effect devices. More precisely, we first present a novel topological logic device that operates without a topological phase transition. Subsequently, we design a high-performance topological transistor due to the presence of edge states. Our approach provides a potential framework for harnessing the unique features of QSHI in device design, paving the way for future topological devices.

Title: Supertetragonal BaSnO3 induced giant ferroelectricity in SrTiO3/BaSnO3 superlattices
Authors: Jing Li, Qing Zhang, Karin M. Rabe, Xiaohui Liu
Abstract: Perovskite BaSnO3 has an Sn s-orbital conduction band minimum, which makes it of interest as a transparent-conducting oxide parent compound but also contraindicates the ferroelectric instability characteristic of the related compound BaTiO3. In this work, we studied the effect of (001) compressive strain on BaSnO3 using first-principles methods. We found that, with low compressive strain, symmetry breaking takes cubic BaSnO3 to a nonpolar tetragonal state, with a first-order phase transition to a hidden highly-polarized ferroelectric supertetragonal state at about -5%. Based on the facts that the mismatch of lattice constant in experiment between BaSnO3 and SrTiO3 is about -5.2% and coherent growth of BaSnO3 on SrTiO3 has been experimentally realized for BaSnO3 layers thinner than 3 unit-cells, we studied a series of SrTiO3/BaSnO3 superlattices with one or two unit-cells of BaSnO3 and several unit-cells of SrTiO3. We found that the superlattices are ferroelectric with large polarizations. We propose that the origin of ferroelectricity in the superlattices is the mechanical and electrical coupling of the BaSnO3 and SrTiO3 layers, with polarized supertetragonal state of BaSnO3 induced by compressive-strain from the SrTiO3 layers and polarization of the SrTiO3 layers by the polar BaSnO3 layers. Due to the distinctive electronic states in the BaSnO3 layers, the realization of ferroelectricity holds promise for the design of novel electronic devices.

Title: Topology meets time-reversal symmetry breaking in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ superconductor
Authors: M. Roppongi, Y. Cai, K. Ogawa, S. Liu, G. Q. Zhao, M. Oudah, T. Fujii, K. Imamura, S. Fang, K. Ishihara, K. Hashimoto, K. Matsuura, Y. Mizukami, M. Pula, C. Young, I. Markovic, D. A. Bonn, T. Watanabe, A. Yamashita, Y. Mizuguchi, G. M. Luke, K. M. Kojima, Y. J. Uemura, T. Shibauchi
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in magnetic topological insulators induces a Dirac gap in the topological surface state (TSS), leading to exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Yet, the interplay between TRSB and topology in superconductors remains underexplored due to limited suitable materials. Here we employ zero-field muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) as a sensitive probe of TRSB to map out the electronic phase diagrams of iron-chalcogenide superconductors FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. For the Te composition $x=0.64$ with the highest superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}=14.5$ K, which is known to host a TSS and Majorana zero modes within vortices, we detect spontaneous magnetic fields below $T_{\rm c}$ distinct from a magnetic order. This signifies a TRSB superconducting state in the bulk, revealing the convergence of unconventional TRSB superconductivity with topologically nontrivial electronic structures in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. Given the relatively high $T_{\rm c}$ and the tunability of the Fermi level through chemical substitution, iron-chalcogenide superconductors offer an intriguing platform for investigating the synergy between topological superconductivity and TRSB.

Title: BaTiO$_3$ -- SrTiO$_3$ composites: a microscopic study on paraelectric cubic inclusions
Authors: Sheng-Han Teng, Chinwendu Anabaryone, Anna Grünebohm
Abstract: Composites of ferroelectric and paraelectric perovskites have attracted a lot of attention due to their application potential in energy storage as well as novel computing and memory devices. So far the main focus of research has been on superlattices and ferroelectric particles in a paraelectric matrix, while the impact of paraelectric inclusions on the ferroelectric matrix is surprisingly underrepresented. To close this gap in knowledge we perform molecular dynamics simulations using an $ab\ initio$ derived effective Hamiltonian for BaTiO$_3$--SrTiO$_3$ and reveal the dependency of phase stability and phase transitions on the size of paraelectric inclusions. We discuss how the combination of compressive strain and depolarization fields at the SrTiO$_3$ interfaces induces large local polarization, complex domain structures and coexisting phases as well as diffuse phase transitions and reduced coercive fields.

Title: The importance of shear on the collective charge transport in CDWs revealed by an XFEL source
Authors: David Le Bolloc'h, Ewen Bellec, Darine Ghoneim, Antoine Gallo-Frantz, Pawel Wzietek, Luc Ortega, Anders Madsen, Pierre Monceau, Mathieu Chollet, Isabel Gonzales-Vallejo, Vincent.L.R. Jacques, Aleksandr Sinchenko
Abstract: Charge transport in materials has an impact on a wide range of devices based on semiconductor, battery or superconductor technology. Charge transport in sliding Charge Density Waves (CDW) differs from all others in that the atomic lattice is directly involved in the transport process. To obtain an overall picture of the structural changes associated to the collective transport, the large coherent X-ray beam generated by an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) source was used. The CDW phase can be retrieved over the entire sample from diffracted intensities using a genetic algorithm. For currents below threshold, increasing shear deformation is observed in the central part of the sample while longitudinal deformation appears above threshold when shear relaxes. Shear thus precedes longitudinal deformation, with relaxation of one leading to the appearance of the other. Moreover, strain accumulates on surface steps in the sliding regime, demonstrating the strong pinning character of these surface discontinuities. The sliding process of nanometric CDW is based on an impressive spatial coherence involving the macroscopic sample dimensions.

Title: Anomalous Magneto-transport and Anisotropic Multigap Superconductivity in Architecturally Misfit Layered System (PbS)$_{1.13}$TaS$_2$
Authors: Tarushi Agarwal, Chandan Patra, Poulami Manna, Shashank Srivastava, Priya Mishra, Suhani Sharma, Ravi Prakash Singh
Abstract: Misfit-layered compounds, naturally occurring bulk heterostructures, present a compelling alternative to artificially engineered ones, offering a unique platform for exploring correlated phases and quantum phenomena. This study investigates the magnetotransport and superconducting properties of the misfit compound (PbS)$_{1.13}$TaS$_2$, comprising alternating PbS and 1$H$-TaS$_2$ layers. It exhibits distinctive transport properties, including a prominent planar Hall effect and a four-fold oscillatory Butterfly-shaped anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). Moreover, it shows multigap two-dimensional superconductivity with an exceptionally high in-plane upper critical field, exceeding the Pauli limit. The coexistence of unconventional superconductivity and anomalous transport - two distinct quantum phenomena, within the same material, suggests that misfit compounds provide an ideal platform for realizing quantum effects in the two-dimensional limit of bulk crystals. This opens the door to the development of simpler and more efficient quantum devices.

Title: Fibonacci-Modulation-Induced Multiple Topological Anderson Insulators
Authors: Ruijiang Ji, Zhihao Xu
Abstract: We uncover the emergence of multiple topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) in a 1D spin-orbit coupled (SOC) chain driven by Fibonacci modulation, transforming a trivial band structure into a cascade of topologically nontrivial phases. This intriguing phenomenon is marked by the appearance of zero-energy modes and transitions in the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ topological quantum number. Strikingly, as the SOC amplitude decreases, the number of TAI phases grows, a behavior intricately linked to the fractal structure of the energy spectrum induced by Fibonacci modulation. Unlike conventional TAI phases, which exhibit fully localized eigenstates, the wave functions in the Fibonacci-modulated TAI phases exhibit multifractal behavior. Furthermore, this model can be experimentally realized in a Bose-Einstein condensate along the momentum lattice, where its topological transitions and multifractal properties can be probed through quench dynamics. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic disorder-induced topological phases and their intricate multifractal nature.

Title: Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations for Oxidative Aging of Polymers under Various O2 Concentration
Authors: Takato Ishida, Kazuya Haremaki, Yusuke Koide, Takashi Uneyama, Yuichi Masubuchi
Abstract: Modeling of polymer oxidative aging has been actively studied since the 1990s. Insights from these studies suggest that the transport of oxygen and radicals significantly influences aging heterogeneity, alongside chemical reaction kinetics. A recent simulation study [Ishida et al., Macromolecules, 56(21), 8474-8483, 2023] demonstrated that mesoscale heterogeneity arises when the H-abstraction reaction occurs faster than the relaxation times of polymer chains. In this study, the simulations were extended by modeling the rate of oxygen addition to polymer radicals (k_2) to reflect the effects of the O2 concentration. Three key aspects of oxidative aging behavior were found to be influenced by the O2 addition rate: (i) reaction kinetics, (ii) the degree of heterogeneity, and (iii) amount of crosslinking. Namely, reducing O2 concentration slows the conversion of polymer radicals into H-abstractable peroxyl radicals. This deceleration delays H-abstraction reactions, increases the number of polymer radicals, and promotes crosslinking reactions between two polymer radicals.

Title: Nonrelativistic spin-splitting multiferroic antiferromagnet and compensated ferrimagnet with zero net magnetization
Authors: Jianting Dong, Kun Wu, Meng Zhu, Fanxing Zheng, Xinlu Li, Jia Zhang
Abstract: Spin-splitting antiferromagnets with spin-polarized band structures in momentum space have garnered intensive research attention due to their zero net magnetic moments, ultras fast spin dynamics as conventional antiferromagnets, and spin-polarized transport properties akin to ferromagnets, making them promising candidates for antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, unlike spin-torque switching of ferromagnets by electric current, efficient electric control of spin-splitting antiferromagnetic order remains challenges. In this work, we identify prototypes of multiferroic spin-splitting antiferromagnets, including BiFeO3, Fe2Mo3O8 and compensated ferrimagnet GaFeO3 with ferroelectric polarization as well as spin-polarized electronic structures. We establish design principles for the spin-splitting multiferroic antiferromagnets and compensated ferrimagnets, elucidating the band symmetry features in Brillouin zone. We demonstrate that the spin polarization in spin-splitting magnets, despite of zero net magnetic moment, can be switched by ferroelectric polarization, providing an efficient means of controlling the antiferromagnetic order. Our work may inspire future development of novel multiferroic functional magnets with zero magnetic moments and pave the way for their applications in magnetoelectric spintronic devices.

Title: Ensemble-averaged mean-field many-body level density: an indicator of integrable versus chaotic single-particle dynamics
Authors: Georg Maier, Carolyn Echter, Juan Diego Urbina, Caio Lewenkopf, Klaus Richter
Abstract: According to the quantum chaos paradigm, the nature of a system's classical dynamics, whether integrable or chaotic, is universally reflected in the fluctuations of its quantum spectrum. However, since many-body spectra in the mean field limit are composed of independent single-particle energy levels, their spectral fluctuations always display Poissonian behavior and hence cannot be used to distinguish underlying chaotic from integrable single-particle dynamics. We demonstrate that this distinction can, instead, be revealed from the mean many-body level density (at fixed energy) and its variance after averaging over ensembles representing different types of single-particle dynamics. This is in strong contrast to the energy-averaged mean level density (of a given system) that is assumed not to carry such information and is routinely removed to focus on universal signatures. To support our claim we systematically analyze the role of single-particle level correlations, that enter through Poisson and random matrix statistics (of various symmetry classes) into the ensemble-averaged density of states and its variance, contrasting bosonic and fermionic many-body systems. Our analytical study, together with extensive numerical simulations for systems with $N \ge 5$ particles consistently reveal significant differences (up to an order of magnitude for fermions and even larger for bosons) in the mean many-body level densities, depending on the nature of the underlying dynamics. Notably, in the fermionic case Poisson-type single-particle level fluctuations precisely cancel contributions from indistinguishability, such that the average many-body spectral density equals the (Thomas-Fermi) volume term. We further highlight the difference between the mean level density and its variance as functions of the total energy $E$ and the excitation energy $Q$.

Title: Predicting band gap from chemical composition: A simple learned model for a material property with atypical statistics
Authors: Andrew Ma, Owen Dugan, Marin Soljačić
Abstract: In solid-state materials science, substantial efforts have been devoted to the calculation and modeling of the electronic band gap. While a wide range of ab initio methods and machine learning algorithms have been created that can predict this quantity, the development of new computational approaches for studying the band gap remains an active area of research. Here we introduce a simple machine learning model for predicting the band gap using only the chemical composition of the crystalline material. To motivate the form of the model, we first analyze the empirical distribution of the band gap, which sheds new light on its atypical statistics. Specifically, our analysis enables us to frame band gap prediction as a task of modeling a mixed random variable, and we design our model accordingly. Our model formulation incorporates thematic ideas from chemical heuristic models for other material properties in a manner that is suited towards the band gap modeling task. The model has exactly one parameter corresponding to each element, which is fit using data. To predict the band gap for a given material, the model computes a weighted average of the parameters associated with its constituent elements and then takes the maximum of this quantity and zero. The model provides heuristic chemical interpretability by intuitively capturing the associations between the band gap and individual chemical elements.

Abstract: We present 50-fs, single-shot measurements of the x-ray thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) from copper foils that have been shocked via nanosecond laser-ablation up to pressures above 135~GPa. We hence deduce the x-ray Debye-Waller (DW) factor, providing a temperature measurement. The targets were laser-shocked with the DiPOLE 100-X laser at the High Energy Density (HED) endstation of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL). Single x-ray pulses, with a photon energy of 18 keV, were scattered from the samples and recorded on Varex detectors. Despite the targets being highly textured (as evinced by large variations in the elastic scattering), and with such texture changing upon compression, the absolute intensity of the azimuthally averaged inelastic TDS between the Bragg peaks is largely insensitive to these changes, and, allowing for both Compton scattering and the low-level scattering from a sacrificial ablator layer, provides a reliable measurement of $T/\Theta_D^2$, where $\Theta_D$ is the Debye temperature. We compare our results with the predictions of the SESAME 3336 and LEOS 290 equations of state for copper, and find good agreement within experimental errors. We thus demonstrate that single-shot temperature measurements of dynamically compressed materials can be made via thermal diffuse scattering of XFEL radation.

Title: Geometric Brownian Information Engine: Time evolution of extractable work, power, and efficiency
Authors: Syed Yunus Ali, Rafna Rafeek, Debasish Mondal
Abstract: We explore the effects of finite cycle period time ($\tau$) on the extractable work, power, and efficiency of the Geometric Brownian Information Engine (GBIE). The GBIE consists of overdamped Brownian particles confined within a monolobal geometry. It incorporates an error-free feedback controller that converts the information obtained about the state of the trapped Brownian particles into extractable work. The engine transitions from a high non-equilibrium steady state to a completely relaxed state. The performance of the information engine depends on the cycle period $(\tau)$, measurement distance $(x_m)$, and feedback location $(x_f)$ of the confinement. When $\tau$ is shorter than the characteristic relaxation time, it has been observed that the maximum power is achieved when the value of $\tilde{x}_f$ is less than 2. In contrast, when cycle period times are longer than the characteristic relaxation time, the maximum power is achieved when the scaled feedback location $\tilde{x}_f$ is exactly at 2. As the $\tau$ increases, the maximum average power decreases. We found that the average extractable work and efficiency of the GBIE increases as the feedback location increases up to a certain point, after which it decreases. In the limit of a long $\tau$, the highest efficiency as well extractable work is attained when $\tilde{x}_f$ is located at 2, regardless of the level of entropic control. As the dominance of entropic control increases, the extractable work and efficiency in the fully relaxed state decrease due to higher information loss during relaxation.

Title: Colour symmetry and non-collinear altermagnetism
Authors: Paolo G. Radaelli, Gautam Gurung
Abstract: We present a formalism based on colour symmetry to analyse the momentum-space spin textures of non-collinear magnets. We show that, out of the spin textures allowed by the magnetic point group, one can extract an `altermagnetic' component that is invariant by general rotations in spin space, and can exist in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate this approach in the case of three complex, non-collinear magnets, Mn$_3$Ir(Ge,Si), Pb$_2$MnO$_4$ and Mn$_3$GaN. For Mn$_3$GaN, we also show that the predictions of colour-symmetry analysis are consistent with density functional theory calculations performed on the same system both with and without spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Comparing the Extrinsic Orbital Hall Effect in Centrosymmetric and Noncentrosymmetric Systems: Insights from Bilayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Azadeh Faridi, Reza Asgari
Abstract: Both intrinsic and extrinsic orbital Hall effects (OHE) in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are investigated in the presence of short-range disorder using quantum kinetic theory. Bilayer TMDs provide an ideal platform to study the effects of inversion symmetry breaking on transport properties due to their unique structural and electronic characteristics. While bilayer TMDs are naturally inversion symmetric, applying a finite gate voltage to create a bias between the layers effectively breaks this symmetry. Our findings reveal that slightly away from the band edges, the extrinsic OHE becomes the dominant contribution in both inversion-symmetric and asymmetric cases, with its prominence increasing significantly as the Fermi energy rises. Furthermore, we demonstrate that breaking inversion symmetry greatly enhances the extrinsic OHE. This enhancement arises from the fundamentally distinct behavior of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in centrosymmetric systems, where intraband components vanish due to symmetry constraints. As a result, in centrosymmetric systems, only the off-diagonal components of the density matrix contribute to the extrinsic OHE. In contrast, in noncentrosymmetric systems, both diagonal and off-diagonal components play a role. Our study suggests that in experimentally relevant, highly doped systems, the OHE is predominantly extrinsic in nature, regardless of whether the system is centrosymmetric or noncentrosymmetric. Importantly, we infer that even a weakly breaking of inversion symmetry can lead to a dramatic enhancement of the OHE, a finding with significant implications for experimental investigations.

Title: Propagation velocity measurements of substrate phonon bursts using MKIDs for superconducting circuits
Authors: Guy Moshel, Omer Rabinowitz, Eliya Blumenthal, Shay Hacohen-Gourgy
Abstract: High-energy bursts in superconducting quantum circuits from various radiation sources have recently become a practical concern due to induced errors and their propagation in the chip. The speed and distance of these disturbances have practical implications. We used a linear array of multiplexed MKIDs on a single silicon chip to measure the propagation velocity of a localized high-energy burst, introduced by driving a Normal metal- Insulator-Superconductor (NIS) junction. We observed a reduction in the apparent propagation velocity with NIS power, which is due to the combined effect of reduced phonon flux with distance and the existence of a minimum detectable QP density in the MKIDs. A simple theoretical model is fitted to extract the longitudinal phonon velocity in the substrate and the conversion efficiency of phonons to QPs in the superconductor.

Title: Why a Bose-Einstein condensate cannot exist in a system of interacting bosons at ultrahigh temperatures
Authors: Maksim D. Tomchenko
Abstract: It is well known that a Bose-Einstein (BE) condensate of atoms exists in a system of interacting Bose atoms at $T\lesssim T^{(i)}_{c}$, where $T^{(i)}_{c}$ is the BE condensation temperature of an ideal gas. It is also generally accepted that BE condensation is impossible at ``ultrahigh'' temperatures $T\gg T^{(i)}_{c}$. While the latter property has been theoretically proven for an ideal gas, no such proof exists for an interacting system, to our knowledge. In this paper, we propose an approximate mathematical proof for a finite, nonrelativistic, periodic system of $N$ spinless interacting bosons. The key point is that, at $T\gg T^{(i)}_{c}$, the main contribution to the occupation number $N_{0}=\frac{1}{Z}\sum_{\wp}e^{-E_{\wp}/k_{B}T}\langle \Psi_{\wp}|\hat{a}^{+}_{\mathbf{0}}\hat{a}_{\mathbf{0}}|\Psi_{\wp}\rangle$, corresponding to atoms with zero momentum, originates from the states containing $N$ elementary quasiparticles. These states do not contain the BE condensate of zero-momentum atoms, implying that an ultrahigh temperature should ``blur'' such a condensate.

Title: Operating semiconductor qubits without individual barrier gates
Authors: A.S. Ivlev, D.R. Crielaard, M. Meyer, W.I.L. Lawrie, N.W. Hendrickx, A. Sammak, G. Scappucci, C. Déprez, M. Veldhorst
Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits have emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing, following a significant improvement in their control fidelities over recent years. Increasing the qubit count remains challenging, beginning with the fabrication of small features and complex fanouts. A particular challenge has been formed by the need for individual barrier gates to control the exchange interaction between adjacent spin qubits. Here, we propose a method to vary two-qubit interactions without applying pulses on individual barrier gates while also remaining insensitive to detuning noise in first order. By changing plunger gate voltages over 300 mV we tune the exchange energy $J$ from 100 kHz to 60 MHz. This allows us to perform two-qubit operations without changing the barrier gate voltage. Based on these findings we conceptualize a spin qubit architecture without individual barrier gates, simplifying the fabrication while maintaining the control necessary for universal quantum computation.

Title: New polymorph {\gamma}-CuWO4 inspired by {\gamma}-CuMoO4: experimental identification and theoretical verification
Authors: Jiri Houska, Stanislav Haviar, Jiri Capek, Radomir Cerstvy, Kalyani Shaji, Nirmal Kumar, Petr Zeman
Abstract: In the context of our efforts to develop hydrogen gas sensors, two samples of ternary CuWO4 with the same crystalline structure have been prepared by two different non-equilibrium techniques. We show that the materials' structure is significantly different from the known stable one, and we identify that it is very similar to that of previously reported {\gamma}-CuMoO4. We use ab initio calculations to confirm that the newly identified phase, {\gamma}-CuWO4, represents a local energy minimum. We present very similar calculated and measured lattice constants and X-ray diffractograms. We make a case that the low-temperature formation of the metastable {\gamma}-CuWO4 phase is facilitated by easier kinetics and/or by Cu-rich composition of our samples, and we show that it converts to the stable phase after annealing to 600 °C.

Title: Exploring strong electronic correlations in the breathing kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn
Authors: Shivalika Sharma, Liviu Chioncel, Igor Di Marco
Abstract: Kagome metals have emerged as pivotal materials in condensed matter physics due to their unique geometric arrangement and intriguing electronic properties. Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material.

Title: Large Scale Finite-Temperature Real-time Time Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculation with Hybrid Functional on ARM and GPU Systems
Authors: Rongrong Liu, Zhuoqiang Guo, Qiuchen Sha, Tong Zhao, Haibo Li, Wei Hu, Lijun Liu, Guangming Tan, Weile Jia
Abstract: Ultra-fast electronic phenomena originating from finite temperature, such as nonlinear optical excitation, can be simulated with high fidelity via real-time time dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) calculations with hybrid functional. However, previous rt-TDDFT simulations of real materials using the optimal gauge--known as the parallel transport gauge--have been limited to low-temperature systems with band gaps. In this paper, we introduce the parallel transport-implicit midpoint (PT-IM) method, which significantly accelerates finite-temperature rt-TDDFT calculations of real materials with hybrid function. We first implement PT-IM with hybrid functional in our plane wave code PWDFT, and optimized it on both GPU and ARM platforms to build a solid baseline code. Next, we propose a diagonalization method to reduce computation and communication complexity, and then, we employ adaptively compressed exchange (ACE) method to reduce the frequency of the most expensive Fock exchange operator. Finally, we adopt the ring\_based method and the shared memory mechanism to overlap computation and communication and alleviate memory consumption respectively. Numerical results show that our optimized code can reach 3072 atoms for rt-TDDFT simulation with hybrid functional at finite temperature on 192 computing nodes, the time-to-solution for one time step is 429.3s, which is 41.4 times faster compared to the baseline.

Title: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in a Quantum Point Contact Geometry
Authors: G. C. Levine, B. A. Friedman
Abstract: It is known that the long-range quantum entanglement exhibited in free fermion systems is sufficient to "thermalize" a small subsystem in that the subsystem reduced density matrix computed from a typical excited eigenstate of the combined system is approximately thermal. Remarkably, fermions without any interactions are thus thought to satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We explore this hypothesis when the fermion subsystem is only minimally coupled to a quantum reservoir (in the form of another fermion system) through a quantum point contact (QPC). The entanglement entropy of two 2-d free fermion systems connected by one or more quantum point contacts (QPC) is examined at finite energy and in the ground state. When the combined system is in a typical excited state, it is shown that the entanglement entropy of a subsystem connected by a small number of QPCs is sub-extensive, scaling as the linear size of the subsystem ($L_A$). For sufficiently low energies ($E$) and small subsystems, it is demonstrated numerically that the entanglement entropy $S_A \sim L_A E$, what one would expect for the thermodynamics of a one-dimensional system. In this limit, we suggest that the entropy carried by each additional QPC is quantized using the one-dimensional finite size/temperature conformal scaling: $\Delta S_A = \alpha \log{(1/E)\sinh{(L_AE)}}$. The sub-extensive entropy in the case of a small number of QPCs should be contrasted with the expectation for both classical, ergodic systems and quantum chaotic systems wherein a restricted geometry might affect the equilibrium relaxation times, but not the equilibrium properties themselves, such as extensive entropy and heat capacity.

Title: Probing Magnetism in Self-Assembled Organometallic Complexes using Kondo Spectroscopy
Authors: Wantong Huang, Paul Greule, Máté Stark, Joris van Slageren, Christoph Sürgers, Wolfgang Wernsdorfer, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Christoph Wolf, Philip Willke
Abstract: Control of individual spins at the atomic level holds great promise for miniaturized spintronics, quantum sensing, and quantum information processing. Both single atomic and molecular spin centers are prime candidates for these applications and are often individually addressed and manipulated using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In this work, we present a hybrid approach and demonstrate a robust method for self-assembly of magnetic organometallic complexes consisting of individual iron (Fe) atoms and molecules on a silver substrate using STM. We employ two types of molecules, bis(dibenzoylmethane) copper(II) [Cu(dbm)2] and iron phthalocyanine (FePc). We show that in both cases the Fe atoms preferentially attach underneath the benzene ring ligand of the molecules, effectively forming an organometallic half-sandwich arene complex, Fe(C6H6), that is akin to the properties of metallocenes. In both situations, a molecule can be combined with up to two Fe atoms. In addition, we observe a change in the magnetic properties of the attached Fe atoms in scanning tunneling spectroscopy, revealing a distinct Kondo signature at the Fe sites. We explain the latter using density functional theory calculations, and find that the bond formation between the Fe 3d-orbitals and the benzene {\pi}-molecular orbitals creates a favorable situation for Kondo screening of the d_xz- and d_yz-like orbitals. Thus, this work establishes a reliable design principle for forming hybrid organometallic complexes and simultaneous tuning of their atomic spin states.

Title: Application of $J$-Integral to a Random Elastic Medium
Authors: Jan Eliáš, Josef Martinásek, Jia-Liang Le
Abstract: This study investigates the use of the $J$-integral to compute the statistics of the energy release rate of a random elastic medium. The spatial variability of the elastic modulus is modeled as a homogeneous lognormal random field. Within the framework of Monte Carlo simulation, a modified contour integral is applied to evaluate the first and second statistical moments of the energy release rate. These results are compared with the energy release rate calculated from the potential energy function. The comparison shows that, if the random field of elastic modulus is homogeneous in space, the path independence of the classical $J$-integral remains valid for calculating the mean energy release rate. However, this path independence does not extend to the higher order statistical moments. The simulation further reveals the effect of the correlation length of the spatially varying elastic modulus on the energy release rate of the specimen.

Title: Probing Electrocatalytic Gas Evolution Reaction at Pt by Force Noise Measurements. Part 1-Hydrogen
Authors: Nataraju Bodappa, Zixiao Zhang, Ramin Yazdaanpanah, Wyatt Behn, Kirk H. Bevan, Gregory Jerkiewicz, Peter Grutter
Abstract: Electrocatalytic processes occurring at the heterogeneous interface are complex and their understanding at the molecular level remains challenging. Atomic force microscope (AFM) can detect force interactions down to the atomic level, but so far it has been mainly used to obtain in-situ images of electrocatalysts. Here for the first time, we employ AFM to investigate gas evolution at a platinum ultramicroelectrode (Pt UME) under electrochemical conditions using the force noise method. We detect excess force noise when the individual H2 gas bubble nucleation, growth, and detachment events occur at the Pt UME. The excess noise varies linearly with the applied potential on a semi-log plot. Chronoamperometry current fluctuations indicate that the H2 gas bubble radius increases from 1 to 10 micrometers and the AFM deflection signal measurements indicate that the mean H2 bubble radius is 321 micrometers. These two values point to the coalescence of small bubbles generated at the Pt UME interface. The contribution reports an innovative method to probe the gas bubble dynamics at the heterogenous interface under electrochemical conditions with high sensitivity.

Title: Large deviations of density in the non-equilibrium steady state of boundary-driven diffusive systems
Authors: Soumyabrata Saha, Tridib Sadhu
Abstract: A diffusive system coupled to unequal boundary reservoirs eventually reaches a non-equilibrium steady state. While the full-counting-statistics of current in these non-equilibrium states are well understood for generic systems, results for steady-state density fluctuations remain limited to a few integrable models. By employing an exact solution of the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory, we characterize steady-state density fluctuations in terms of large deviations for a class of systems. Additionally, we quantitatively describe the development of these rare fluctuations. For generic diffusive systems in arbitrary dimensions, we use a perturbation around the equilibrium state to solve for the large deviation functional and the corresponding path to fluctuations, up to non-trivial orders where the non-locality of fluctuations unveils.

Title: Synthetic accessibility and sodium ion conductivity of the Na$_{8-x}$A$^{x}$P$_2$O$_9$ (NAP) high-temperature sodium superionic conductor framework
Authors: Lauren N. Walters, Yuxing Fei, Bernardus Rendy, Xiaochen Yang, Mouhamad Diallo, KyuJung Jun, Grace Wei, Matthew J. McDermott, Andrea Giunto, Tara Mishra, Fengyu Shen, David Milsted, May Sabai Oo, Haegyeom Kim, Michael C. Tucker, Gerbrand Ceder
Abstract: Advancement of solid state electrolytes (SSEs) for all solid state batteries typically focuses on modification of a parent structural framework for improved conductivity, \textit{e.g.} cation substitution for an immobile ion or varying the concentration of the mobile ion. Therefore, novel frameworks can be disruptive by enabling fast ion conduction aided by different structure and diffusion mechanisms, and unlocking optimal conductors with different properties (\textit{e.g.} mechanical properties, sintering needs, electrochemical stability) than previously published. Herein, we perform a high throughput survey of an understudied structural framework for sodium ion conduction, Na$_{8-x}$A$^x$P$_2$O$_9$ (NAP), to understand the family's thermodynamic stability, synthesizability, and ionic conduction. We first show that the parent phase Na$_4$TiP$_2$O$_9$ (NTP) undergoes a structural distortion (with accompanying conductivity transition) due to unstable phonons from a pseduo-Jahn Teller mode in the 1D titanium chains. Then, screening of cation-substituted structural candidates with \textit{ab initio} and machine-learned potential calculations reveal a number of candidates that are thermodynamically stable, likely synthesizable, and have high predicted ionic conductivities. High throughput experimental trials and subsequent methodology optimization of one Na$_4$SnP$_2$O$_9$ (NSP) highlight collective challenges to the synthesis pathways for sodium phosphate materials via solid state synthesis. Our results demonstrate that NAP is a highly tunable conduction framework whose high temperature conductivity transition has heretofore eliminated it from significant research interest. By expanding the structural toolkit for SSE design, we increase the number of useful sodium ion electrolytes for integration into safe and accessible solid state batteries.

Title: Universality in the microwave shielding of ultracold polar molecules
Authors: Joy Dutta, Bijit Mukherjee, Jeremy M. Hutson
Abstract: Microwave shielding is an important technique that can suppress the losses that arise from collisions of ultracold polar molecules. It has been instrumental in achieving molecular Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) for NaCs [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. We demonstrate that microwave shielding is universal, in the sense that the 2-body collision properties of different molecules are very similar when expressed in suitable reduced units of length and energy. This applies to rate coefficients for inelastic scattering and loss, to scattering lengths, and to the properties of 2-molecule bound states. We also explore the small deviations from universality that arise at very large Rabi frequencies. In general, the collision properties are near-universal except when the Rabi frequency exceeds a few percent of the molecular rotational constant. The universality extends to elliptically polarized microwaves and to combinations of multiple fields. Our results indicate that the methods that have been used to achieve BEC for NaCs can be transferred directly to most other polar molecules.

Title: MinD the gap: Membrane proteins form 3D patterns in a suspension of liposomes
Authors: Amélie Chardac, Michael M. Norton, Jonathan Touboul, Guillaume Duclos
Abstract: The self-organization of pattern-forming systems depends not only on the chemical but also physical properties of their components. In this work, we fragmented and dispersed the MinDE protein system's lipid substrate into diffusive sub-micrometer-sized liposomes, and report that the ATP-fueled protein-protein interactions continue to drive spatially extended patterns at scales well separated from those of the requisite liposomes, despite the complete loss of membrane continuity. The patterns form in three-dimensions because the membrane is dispersed in a volume. By varying protein concentration, liposome size distribution, and density, we observed and characterized rich 3D dynamical patterns at steady state, including traveling waves, dynamical spirals and a mixed phase where both patterns coexist. Simulations and linear stability analysis of a coarse-grained model reveal that the dispersed membranes's physical properties effectively rescale two key factors that govern pattern formation and wavelength selection: protein-membrane binding rates and diffusion. This work highlights the robustness of pattern formation in membrane-bulk systems despite membrane fragmentation. It suggests that biological protein systems have the potential to serve as adaptable templates for out-of-equilibrium self-organization in 3D, beyond in vivo biological contexts.

Title: Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of populations of weakly-coupled low-temperature-differential Stirling engines with synchronous and asynchronous transitions
Authors: Songhao Yin, Hiroshi Kori, Yuki Izumida
Abstract: This study developed the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for populations of low-temperature-differential (LTD) Stirling engines weakly-coupled in a general class of networks to clarify the effects of synchronous and asynchronous transitions on the power and thermal efficiency. We first show that synchronous (asynchronous) transitions increase (decrease) the power and thermal efficiency of weakly-coupled LTD Stirling engines based on quasilinear response relations between formally defined thermodynamic fluxes and forces. After that, we construct a conceptual model satisfying the quasilinear response relations to give a physical interpretation of the changes in power and thermal efficiency due to synchronous and asynchronous transitions, and justify the use of this conceptual model. We then show that the conceptual model, rather than the quasilinear response relations, preserves the irreversible nature in the relative motion of the original model and thus shows more accurate results than the analysis using the quasilinear response relations. Finally, we compare the dynamics between the original and the conceptual models for two-engine systems and show that the conceptual model roughly preserves the dynamical characteristics leading up to the synchronous transitions, while some detailed dynamical structures are lost.

Title: Universality in quantum critical flow of charge and heat in ultra-clean graphene
Authors: Aniket Majumdar, Nisarg Chadha, Pritam Pal, Akash Gugnani, Bhaskar Ghawri, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Subroto Mukerjee, Arindam Ghosh
Abstract: Close to the Dirac point, graphene is expected to exist in quantum critical Dirac fluid state, where the flow of both charge and heat can be described with a dc electrical conductivity $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$, and thermodynamic variables such as the entropy and enthalpy densities. Although the fluid-like viscous flow of charge is frequently reported in state-of-the-art graphene devices, the value of $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$, predicted to be quantized and determined only by the universality class of the critical point, has not been established experimentally so far. Here we have discerned the quantum critical universality in graphene transport by combining the electrical ($\sigma$) and thermal ($\kappa_\mathrm{e}$) conductivities in very high-quality devices close to the Dirac point. We find that $\sigma$ and $\kappa_\mathrm{e}$ are inversely related, as expected from relativistic hydrodynamics, and $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$ converges to $\approx (4\pm 1)\times e^2/h$ for multiple devices, where $e$ and $h$ are the electronic charge and the Planck's constant, respectively. We also observe, (1) a giant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law where the effective Lorentz number exceeds the semiclassical value by more than 200 times close to the Dirac point at low temperatures, and (2) the effective dynamic viscosity ($\eta_\mathrm{th}$) in the thermal regime approaches the holographic limit $\eta_\mathrm{th}/s_\mathrm{th} \rightarrow \hbar/4\pi k_\mathrm{B}$ within a factor of four in the cleanest devices close to the room temperature, where $s_\mathrm{th}$ and $k_\mathrm{B}$ are the thermal entropy density and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. Our experiment addresses the missing piece in the potential of high-quality graphene as a testing bed for some of the unifying concepts in physics.

Title: Extrinsic Mechanisms of Phonon Magnetic Moment
Authors: Rui Xue, Zhenhua Qiao, Yang Gao, Qian Niu
Abstract: We develop a general formalism of phonon magnetic moment by including the relaxation process. We then identify the skew-scattering and side-jump contributions to the phonon magnetic moment originating from the non-adiabaticity, both of which are related to the nonlocal phonon Berry curvature and are in close analogy to those in the electronic Hall effect. All contributions of the phonon magnetic moment are exemplified in a honeycomb lattice, showing that the extrinsic contribution can be as important as the intrinsic one and that the resulting phonon angular momentum varies significantly across the Brillouin zone. Our work offers a systematic framework of the phonon chirality and paves the way of tuning the phonon magnetic moment through the non-adiabaticity.

Title: Multivalued Wess-Zumino-Novikov Functional and Chiral Anomaly in Hydrodynamics
Authors: P.B. Wiegmann
Abstract: We present a hydrodynamic framework derived from the action of a perfect fluid, modified by the hydrodynamic analog of Novikov's multivalued functional. This modification introduces spin degrees of freedom into the fluid. The structure closely resembles the Abelian version of the Wess-Zumino functional, commonly applied in field theories with chiral anomalies. The deformation incorporates the transport properties of Weyl fermions and exhibits the chiral anomaly in the case of a charged fluid. It is also consistent with Onsager's semiclassical quantization of circulation. Additionally, we discuss the hydrodynamic analog of instantons and related topological invariants.

Title: Hierarchical Plant Protein Microcapsules for Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Cargo Molecules
Authors: Ngoc-Duy Dinh, Marc Rodriguez-Garcia, Zenon Toprakcioglu, Yi Shen, Tuomas Knowles
Abstract: Microscale hydrogels comprised of macromolecular networks have increasingly been used for applications involving cell encapsulation, tissue engineering and for the storage and release of active cargo molecules. However, the majority of such microgels are formed from nonbiodegradable synthetic polymers, involving harmful solvents, or using animal proteins, such as silk and gelatin, which can have a negative environmental impact and lack sustainability. Furthermore, most encapsulation techniques involve either protecting hydrophobic or hydrophilic cargo, but rarely both. In order to address these issues, we employed droplet-microfluidics to develop novel, plant protein microcapsules capable of containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic cargo molecules. The microcapsule structure and cargo release rates were controlled by balancing osmotic pressures between the outer and inner phases of the capsules. Moreover, the digestibility of the microcapsules was comparable with that of pure pea protein, thereby enabling the use of these microcapsules for food and beverage applications. In addition, digestive enzymes can trigger the release of the encapsulated active ingredients, and hence, these microcapsules are well suited for the controlled delivery of active nutraceutical or pharmaceutical ingredients. Finally, we investigated the biodegradability of the microcapsules. It was determined that the plant protein microcapsules exhibited 98.0% biodegradability (as compared with cellulose), thereby fulfilling the biodegradability standards stipulated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 14851) for microplastics in freshwater conditions (90%). Hence, the plant protein microcapsules can have numerous applications in the food, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, personal care, and agriculture industries.

Title: Thermodynamics and transport in molten chloride salts and their mixtures
Authors: Cillian Cockrell, Margaret-Ann Withington, Harvey L. Devereux, Alin M. Elena, Ilian T. Todorov, Zi-Kui Liu, Shun-Li Shang, James S. McCloy, Paul A. Bingham, Kostya Trachenko
Abstract: Molten salts are important in a number of energy applications, but the fundamental mechanisms operating in ionic liquids are poorly understood, particularly at higher temperatures. This is despite their candidacy for deployment in solar cells, next-generation nuclear reactors, and nuclear pyroprocessing. We perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations over a variety of molten chloride salt compositions at varying temperature and pressures to calculate the thermodynamic and transport properties of these liquids. Using recent developments in the theory of liquid thermophysical properties, we interpret our results on the basis of collective atomistic dynamics (phonons). We find that the properties of ionic liquids well explained by their collective dynamics, as in simple liquids. In particular, we relate the decrease of heat capacity, viscosity, and thermal conductivity to the loss of transverse phonons from the liquid spectrum. We observe the singular dependence of the isochoric heat capacity on the mean free path of phonons, and the obeyance of the Stokes-Einstein equation relating the viscosity to the mass diffusion. The transport properties of mixtures are more complicated compared to simple liquids, however viscosity and thermal conductivity are well guided by fundamental bounds proposed recently. The kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity lie very close to one another and obey the theoretical fundamental bounds determined solely by fundamental physical constants. Our results show that recent advances in the theoretical physics of liquids are applicable to molten salts mixtures, and therefore that the evolution and interplay of properties common to all liquids may act as a guide to a deeper understanding of these mixtures.

Title: Anti-counterfeiting tags with camouflaged QR codes on nanocavities, using polymer-dispersed-liquid-crystals
Authors: Giuseppe Nicoletta, Mauro Daniel Luigi Bruno, Peng Yu, Zhiming Wang, Maria Penelope De Santo, Roberto Caputo, Antonio Ferraro
Abstract: Counterfeiting poses an evergrowing challenge, driving the need for innovative and sophisticated anti-counterfeiting strategies and technologies. Many solutions focus on tags characterized by optical features that are partially or completely camouflaged to the human eye, thus discouraging scammers. In this paper, a QR code is laser printed on a thin plastic foil previously coated by a specific nanocavity consisting of a metal/insulator/metal/insulator (MIMI) multilayer. This metamaterial possesses unique features in terms of light transmission that are due to the specific design. A thin layer of polymer dispersed liquid crystals, fabricated incorporating specific nematic liquid crystals in a polymer matrix, is able to camouflage the QR code that becomes, then, readable only under specific thermal conditions. Three anti-counterfeiting tags were fabricated, each using a distinct LC with its own nematic-isotropic transition temperature. The peculiar combination of the unique optical properties of nematic liquid crystals and optical nanocavities results in the creation of a novel type of tags showing two different encoding levels. Stress tests including water immersion, bending test, and prolonged heating have been performed ensuring the long-term stability of the tags. The realized two security-level anti-counterfeiting tags are cost-effective, straightforward to manufacture and, thanks to their flexibility, can be easily integrated into packaging and products.

Title: Distribution of regularized three-body phase-volume
Authors: Yogesh Dandekar, Barak Kol
Abstract: The micro-canonical phase-space volume for the three-body problem is a topic of intrinsic interest. Within the flux-based statistical theory, it provides a means to predict the scale of disintegration times for non-hierarchical systems. While the bare phase-volume diverges, arXiv:2205.04294 (Paper I) showed that a regularized version can be defined. Building on Paper I, which determined the regularized phase-volume for a given energy $\bar\sigma(E)$, this paper extends the analysis to its distribution over angular momentum, $\bar\sigma(E,L)$. Through analytical integrations, we reduce the problem to a 3d numerical integration, a step up in complexity from the 2d integration required for $\bar\sigma(E)$. We provide regularized phase-volume values for several mass sets across a range of $E$ and $L$, validated through an $L$-integration test. Notably, the values remain positive for all tested parameters, lending further support to the validity of the chosen regularization procedure. For high values of $L$ at fixed masses and $E$, we observe a strong suppression of $\bar\sigma(E,L)$.

Title: Active Learning Enables Extrapolation in Molecular Generative Models
Authors: Evan R. Antoniuk, Peggy Li, Nathan Keilbart, Stephen Weitzner, Bhavya Kailkhura, Anna M. Hiszpanski
Abstract: Although generative models hold promise for discovering molecules with optimized desired properties, they often fail to suggest synthesizable molecules that improve upon the known molecules seen in training. We find that a key limitation is not in the molecule generation process itself, but in the poor generalization capabilities of molecular property predictors. We tackle this challenge by creating an active-learning, closed-loop molecule generation pipeline, whereby molecular generative models are iteratively refined on feedback from quantum chemical simulations to improve generalization to new chemical space. Compared against other generative model approaches, only our active learning approach generates molecules with properties that extrapolate beyond the training data (reaching up to 0.44 standard deviations beyond the training data range) and out-of-distribution molecule classification accuracy is improved by 79%. By conditioning molecular generation on thermodynamic stability data from the active-learning loop, the proportion of stable molecules generated is 3.5x higher than the next-best model.

Title: Symmetry and causality constraints on Fermi liquids
Authors: Luca V. Delacrétaz, Subham Dutta Chowdhury, Umang Mehta
Abstract: We investigate symmetry and causality constraints on interacting Fermi liquids. Whereas Galilean or Lorentz boost symmetry leads to a well-known constraint on the first Landau parameter $F_1$, we show that scale invariance similarly constrains $F_0$. In the case of conformal Fermi liquids, we show that causality constraints on the particle-hole continuum and on zero sound strongly restrict the available parameter space for interacting Fermi liquids. We also consider nonlinear response, which we show is sensitive to additional ``generalized Landau parameters'' even at lowest orders in the long wavelength limit. We impose Galilean, Lorentz and scale symmetry on these generalized Landau parameters, obtaining further nonlinear constraints. We test our constraints in several microscopic models that enter a Fermi liquid phase.

Title: Ferroelectric AlScN thin films with enhanced polarization and low leakage enabled by high-power impulse magnetron sputtering
Authors: Federica Messi (1), Jyotish Patidar (1), Nathan Rodkey (1), Christoph W. Dräyer (2), Morgan Trassin (2), Sebastian Siol (1) ((1) Laboratory for Surface Science and Coating Technologies, Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Switzerland (2) Department of Materials, ETH Zürich, Switzerland)
Abstract: The demand for efficient data processing motivates a shift toward in-memory computing architectures. Ferroelectric materials, particularly AlScN, show great promise for next-generation memory devices. However, their widespread application is limited due challenges such as high coercive fields, leakage currents and limited stability. Our work introduces a novel synthesis approach for ferroelectric AlScN thin films using high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). Through a combinatorial study, we investigate the effect of scandium content and substrate bias on the ferroelectric properties of AlScN films deposited using metal-ion synchronized (MIS) HiPIMS. Leveraging the high ionization rates of HiPIMS and optimally timed substrate bias potentials, we enhance the adatom mobility at low temperatures. Our films exhibit a high degree of texture and crystallinity as well as low roughness at temperatures as low as 250°C. Most importantly, the films exhibit coercive fields comparable to state-of-the-art values (5 MV/cm) with significantly enhanced remanent polarization (158-172.0 {\mu}C/cm2). Notably, the remanent polarization remains stable across varying scandium concentrations. We further evaluate cycling stability and leakage current to assess suitability for memory applications. This study demonstrates HiPIMS as a scalable and CMOS compatible technique for synthesizing high-quality ferroelectric AlScN films, paving the way for their application in non-volatile memory applications.

Title: High-throughput calculations of spin Hall conductivity in non-magnetic 2D materials
Authors: Jiaqi Zhou, Samuel Poncé, Jean-Christophe Charlier
Abstract: Spin Hall effect (SHE) in two-dimensional (2D) materials is promising to effectively manipulate spin angular momentum and identify topological properties. In this work, we implemented an automated Wannierization with spin-orbit coupling on 426 non-magnetic monolayers including 210 metal and 216 insulators. Intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) has been calculated to find candidates exhibiting novel properties. We discover that Y$_2$C$_2$I$_2$ has an unconventional SHE with canted spin due to low crystal symmetry, Ta$_4$Se$_2$ is a metallic monolayer with exceptionally high SHC, and the semi-metal Y$_2$Br$_2$ possesses efficient charge-to-spin conversion induced by anti-crossing in bands. Moreover, quantum spin Hall insulators are investigated for quantized SHC. The present work provides a high-quality Wannier Hamiltonian database of 2D materials, and paves the way for the integration of 2D materials into high-performance and low-power-consumption spintronic devices.

Title: Relaxation-assisted reverse annealing on nonnegative/binary matrix factorization
Authors: Renichiro Haba, Masayuki Ohzeki, Kazuyuki Tanaka
Abstract: Quantum annealing has garnered significant attention as meta-heuristics inspired by quantum physics for combinatorial optimization problems. Among its many applications, nonnegative/binary matrix factorization stands out for its complexity and relevance in unsupervised machine learning. The use of reverse annealing, a derivative procedure of quantum annealing to prioritize the search in a vicinity under a given initial state, helps improve its optimization performance in matrix factorization. This study proposes an improved strategy that integrates reverse annealing with a linear programming relaxation technique. Using relaxed solutions as the initial configuration for reverse annealing, we demonstrate improvements in optimization performance comparable to the exact optimization methods. Our experiments on facial image datasets show that our method provides better convergence than known reverse annealing methods. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of relaxation-based initialization methods on randomized datasets, demonstrating a relationship between the relaxed solution and the optimal solution. This research underscores the potential of combining reverse annealing and classical optimization strategies to enhance optimization performance.

Title: Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention for Adaptive Dynamics in Transformers
Authors: Markus J. Buehler
Abstract: We present an approach to modifying Transformer architectures by integrating graph-aware relational reasoning into the attention mechanism, merging concepts from graph neural networks and language modeling. Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.

Title: Mixed state topological order: operator algebraic approach
Authors: Yoshiko Ogata
Abstract: We study the classification problem of mixed states in two-dimensional quantum spin systems in the operator algebraic framework of quantum statistical mechanics. We associate a braided $C^*$-tensor category to each state satisfying a mixed-state version of the approximate Haag duality. We study how this category behaves under decoherence: suppose the state is acted by a finite depth quantum channel. We prove that the braided $C^*$-tensor category of the final state is a braided $C^*$-tensor subcategory of the initial state.

Title: Low voltage graphene interface engineered organic ferroelectric tunnel junction devices
Authors: S. Natani, P. Khajanji, L. Cheng, K. Eshraghi, Z. Zhang, W. Shipley, A. Tao, P.R. Bandaru
Abstract: It has been indicated that the path forward for the widespread usage of ferroelectric (FE) materials may be considerably facilitated through the reduction of programming voltages to on-chip logic compatible values of < 1 V. Obstacles involve issues related to the scaling of the FEs to lower thickness as well as the presence of an interfacial layer (IL) between the high permittivity FE and the substrate -- resulting in wasted voltage across the IL. Here, we show how lower operating voltages along with a higher tunneling electroresistance (TER) could be achieved through IL engineering. We use piezoresponse force microscopy and fabricated ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) to show that ultra-thin FE films deposited on single layer graphene can exhibit polarization switching at ~ 0.8 V with significant TER.

Title: Disentangling Cation-Polyanion Coupling in Solid Electrolytes: Which Anion Motion Dominates Cation Transport?
Authors: Ke Li, Jitai Yang, Yu Zhai, Hui Li
Abstract: Lithium and sodium solid electrolytes feature polyanion frameworks and highly mobile cations. Understanding and quantifying the impact of polyanion dynamics on cations will help us to unravel the complex role that anion play in superionic conductors. However, no experimental or computational method can directly extract this information, as polyanion dynamics are always coupled with other factors that affect ion mobility. Here, we present the pioneering study that combines constraint algorithm and machine-learning molecular dynamics to quantitatively reveal the effects of polyanion translation, rotation, and vibration on cation mobility across a diverse material class. Ultralong-time, large-scale machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations with selective constraints on each anion motion mode unequivocally yield results at near room and elevated temperatures. In sharp contrast to the previous understanding that facile anion rotation primarily facilitates cation transport, the strong coupling between anion translation and vibration with cation diffusion has been unraveled for the first time; we find that translation, rotation, and vibration can each directly drive superionicity, with one typically dominant in each class of materials. Anion rotation dominates cation transport when the rotation frequency matches the cation hopping frequency, whereas anion translation prevails at higher and vibration at lower rotation frequencies. The impact of anion dynamics on cation diffusion becomes more prominent at lower temperatures.

Title: Surfacic networks
Authors: Marc Barthelemy, Geoff Boeing, Alain Chiarada, Chris Webster
Abstract: Surfacic networks are structures built upon a two-dimensional manifold. Many systems, including transportation networks and various urban networks, fall into this category. The fluctuations of node elevations imply significant deviations from typical plane networks and require specific tools to understand their impact. Here, we present such tools, including lazy paths that minimize elevation differences, graph arduousness which measures the tiring nature of shortest paths, and the excess effort, which characterizes positive elevation variations along shortest paths. We illustrate these measures using toy models of surfacic networks and empirically examine pedestrian networks in selected cities. Specifically, we examine how changes in elevation affect the spatial distribution of betweenness centrality. We also demonstrate that the excess effort follows a non-trivial power law distribution, with an exponent that is not universal, which illustrates that there is a significant probability of encountering steep slopes along shortest paths, regardless of the elevation difference between the starting point and the destination. These findings highlight the significance of elevation fluctuations in shaping network characteristics. Surfacic networks offer a promising framework for comprehensively analyzing and modeling complex systems that are situated on or constrained to a surface environment.

Title: Limiting distributions of generalized money exchange models
Authors: Hironobu Sakagawa
Abstract: The "Money Exchange Model" is a type of agent-based simulation model used to study how wealth distribution and inequality evolve through monetary exchanges between individuals. The primary focus of this model is to identify the limiting wealth distributions that emerge at the macroscopic level, given the microscopic rules governing the exchanges among agents. In this paper, we formulate generalized versions of the immediate exchange model and the uniform saving model both of which are types of money exchange models, as discrete-time interacting particle systems and characterize their stationary distributions. Furthermore, we prove that under appropriate scaling, the asymptotic wealth distribution converges to a Gamma distribution or an exponential distribution for both models. The limiting distribution depends on the weight function that affects the probability distribution of the number of coins exchanged by each agent. In particular, our results provide a mathematically rigorous formulation and generalization of the assertions previously predicted in studies based on numerical simulations and heuristic arguments.

Title: Effect of Impurity on Inhomogeneous Vacuum and Interacting Vortices
Authors: SeungJun Jeon, Yoonbai Kim, Hanwool Song
Abstract: We study the inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model with a magnetic impurity. The vacuum configuration of the symmetry-broken phase is not simply the constant Higgs vacuum but is a nontrivial function of spatial coordinates, satisfying the Euler-Lagrange equations. The vacuum of zero winding number has zero magnetic flux but its non-zero magnetic field depends on spatial coordinates. The corresponding vacuum energy is negative for weak coupling $(\lambda < 1)$, zero for critical BPS coupling $(\lambda = 1)$, and positive for strong coupling $(\lambda > 1)$ by an over-, exact-, and under-cancellation of the huge positive impurity energy. This distinct vacuum energies are consistent with classification of the type I and I$\!$I superconductivity in dirty conventional superconductors. Non-BPS vortex configurations are also obtained in the presence of inhomogeneity. Their rest energies favor energetically vortex-impurity composite in conventional type I$\!$I superconductivity, consistent with imperfect diamagnetism. The delta function limit of Gaussian type impurity suggests the formation of vortex-lattice composite which elucidates flux-pinning in the context of inhomogeneous field theory.

Title: Foam stabilization in salt solutions : the role of capillary drainage and Marangoni stresses
Authors: Ekta Sharma, Suraj Borkar, Philipp Baumli, Xinfeng Shi, James Y.Wu, David Myung, Gerald G. Fuller
Abstract: The long-standing question of why foaming is easier in seawater than in freshwater remains unresolved. In this study, we address this issue through precise interferometry single bubble experiments, demonstrating that the theory proposed by G. Marrucci (1969) provides a compelling explanation. Electrolyte solutions with varying concentrations of phosphate salts were used to study film formation and drainage, with thickness tracked by interferometry. In deionized water, bubbles rupture within seconds due to repaid dimple collapse. However, in phosphate salt solutions, bubbles persisted for several minutes. While surface tension gradients from evaporation-driven salt concentration gradients have been thought to create Marangoni stresses, our results show that despite film thinning being capillary-dominated, Marangoni-driven influx can be observed. Marrucci's theory explains this by showing that an increased interfacial area as the film thins, leads to higher salt concentration in the film due to Gibbs surface excess. This concentration gradient induces Marangoni stresses, causing flow reversal, increased film thickness, and enhanced foam stability. We show that Marrucci's theory has been incorrectly dismissed, and the predicted critical heights where fluid influx occurs closely match our findings and other studies using sodium chloride. Additionally, we extend the theory's applicability to foam films in non-aqueous film mixtures, highlighting its broader relevance.

Title: Refining Coarse-Grained Molecular Topologies: A Bayesian Optimization Approach
Authors: Pranoy Ray, Adam P. Generale, Nikhith Vankireddy, Yuichiro Asoma, Masataka Nakauchi, Haein Lee, Katsuhisa Yoshida, Yoshishige Okuno, Surya R. Kalidindi
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.

Title: Photo-luminescence properties of ion implanted Er3+-defects in 4H-SiCOI towards integrated quantum photonics
Authors: Joshua Bader, Shao Qi Lim, Faraz Ahmed Inam, Brett C. Johnson, Alberto Peruzzo, Jeffrey McCallum, Qing Li, Stefania Castelletto
Abstract: Colour centres hosted in solid-state materials such as silicon carbide and diamond are promising candidates for integration into chip-scale quantum systems. Specifically, the incorporation of these colour centres within photonic integrated circuits may enable precise control over their inherent photo-physical properties through strong light-matter interaction. Here, we investigate ion-implanted erbium ($\text{Er}^{3+}$) defects embedded in thin-film 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator (4H-SiCOI). Optimized implantation conditions and thermal annealing processes designed to enhance the emission characteristics of the $\text{Er}^{3+}$-defect are reported. By examining key properties such as photoluminescence intensity, optical lifetime, and polarization, we present an analysis of ensemble $\text{Er}^{3+}$-defects within 4H-SiCOI, providing insights into their potential for future quantum applications.

Title: Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements
Authors: Yaoling Yang, Victor Montenegro, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.

Title: Viscotaxis of chiral microswimmer in viscosity gradients
Authors: Takuya Kobayashi, Ryoichi Yamamoto
Abstract: Microswimmers display an intriguing ability to navigate through fluids with spatially varying viscosity, a behavior known as viscotaxis, which plays a crucial role in guiding their motion. In this study, we reveal that the orientation dynamics of chiral squirmers in fluids with uniform viscosity gradients can be elegantly captured using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations, originally developed for spin systems. Remarkably, we discover that chiral swimmers demonstrate negative viscotaxis, tracing spiral trajectories as they move. Specifically, a chiral squirmer with a misaligned source dipole and rotlet dipole exhibits a steady-state spiral motion-a stark contrast to the linear behavior observed when the dipoles are aligned. This work provides fresh insights into the intricate interplay between microswimmer dynamics and fluid properties.

Title: $\eta$ invariant of massive Wilson Dirac operator and the index
Authors: Shoto Aoki, Hidenori Fukaya, Mikio Furuta, Shinichiroh Matsuo, Tetsuya Onogi, Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We revisit the lattice index theorem in the perspective of $K$-theory. The standard definition given by the overlap Dirac operator equals to the $\eta$ invariant of the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass. This equality is not coincidental but reflects a mathematically profound significance known as the suspension isomorphism of $K$-groups. Specifically, we identify the Wilson Dirac operator as an element of the $K^1$ group, which is characterized by the $\eta$-invariant. Furthermore, we prove that, at sufficiently small but finite lattice spacings, this $\eta$-invariant equals to the index of the continuum Dirac operator. Our results indicate that the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and the associated exact chiral symmetry are not essential for understanding gauge field topology in lattice gauge theory.

Title: Gearing of nitrate ions in ammonium nitrate
Authors: Na Du, Xintian Wang, Yu Ying Zhu, Chanreingam Long, Peng Ren, Fei Yen
Abstract: Reorienting polyatomic ions such as NH4+ and NO3- exhibit weak magnetic fields because the ions at the extremities trace out current loops; if the periodic reorientations become long-range ordered (i.e. gearing of neighboring NO3-), then the magnetic susceptibility should exhibit a unique signature along the different crystallographic axes. For the case of ammonium nitrate NH4NO3, we report the presence of two successive sharp steps in the molar magnetic susceptibility along the a- and b-axes upon crossing its order-disorder phase transition (from phase IV to phase II). We suggest the first step pertains to the NO3- planes shifting away from facing only along the b-axis and onto the a-axis by 45°. The second step is attributed to the disordering (ungearing) of the NH4+ and NO3-. In contrast, only one step was observed in the magnetic susceptibility along the c-axis and its large magnitude suggest the NO3- remain weakly correlated even in phase I at 400 K. We also find evidence that the NH4+ become magnetically ordered (geared) along the c-axis only until phase V. The approach employed in this work can be extended to experimentally study the lattice dynamics of other solids possessing planar ions such as amphidynamic crystals.

Title: Analysis of exciton-polariton condensation under different pumping schemes for 1D and 2D microcavities including the effect of strong correlation between polaritons
Authors: Varad R. Pande
Abstract: Strongly correlated polaritons are necessary for entering the quantum photonic regime with many applications. We simulate exciton-polariton condensation using the finite-difference and 4th order Runge-Kutta methods with the strongly correlated polariton condition incorporated in the mean-field equations and analyze the polariton dynamics. This is done for coherent, near-resonant pumping as well as homogeneous, incoherent, non-resonant pumping. We find conditions akin to the polariton blockade in the dynamics.

Title: Analytical solution for the hydrodynamic resistance of a disk in a compressible fluid layer with odd viscosity on a rigid substrate
Authors: Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Andrej Vilfan, Yuto Hosaka
Abstract: Chiral active fluids can exhibit odd viscosity, a property that breaks the time-reversal and parity symmetries. Here, we examine the hydrodynamic flows of a rigid disk moving in a compressible 2D fluid layer with odd viscosity, supported by a thin lubrication layer of a conventional fluid. Using the 2D Green's function in Fourier space, we derive an exact analytical solution for the flow around a disk of arbitrary size, as well as its resistance matrix. The resulting resistance coefficients break the Onsager reciprocity, but satisfy the Onsager-Casimir reciprocity to any order in odd viscosity.

Title: Stable excitations and holographic transportation in tensor networks of critical spin chains
Authors: Zuo Wang, Liang He
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence conjectures a duality between quantum gravity theories in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime and conformal field theories (CFTs) on the boundary. One intriguing aspect of this correspondence is that it offers a pathway to explore quantum gravity through tabletop experiments. Recently, a multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) model of AdS/CFT that can be implemented using contemporary quantum simulators has been proposed [R. Sahay, M. D. Lukin, and J. Cotler, arXiv:2401.13595 (2024)]. Particularly, local bulk excitations (entitled "hologrons") manifesting attractive interactions given by AdS gravity were found. However, the fundamental question concerning the stability of these identified hologrons is still left open. Here, we address this question and find that hologrons are unstable during dynamic evolution. In searching for stable bulk excitations with attractive interactions, we find they can be constructed by the local primary operators in the boundary CFT. Furthermore, we identify a class of boundary excitations that exhibit the bizarre behavior of "holographic transportation", which can be directly observed on the boundary system implemented in experiments.

Title: Cavity quantum electrodynamics of photonic temporal crystals
Authors: Junhyeon Bae, Kyungmin Lee, Bumki Min, Kun Woo Kim
Abstract: Photonic temporal crystals host a variety of intriguing phenomena, from wave amplification and mixing to exotic band structures, all stemming from the time-periodic modulation of optical properties. While these features have been well described classically, their quantum manifestation has remained elusive. Here, we introduce a quantum electrodynamical model of PTCs that reveals a deeper connection between classical and quantum pictures: the classical momentum gap arises from a localization-delocalization quantum phase transition in a Floquet-photonic synthetic lattice. Leveraging an effective Hamiltonian perspective, we pinpoint the critical momenta and highlight how classical exponential field growth manifests itself as wave-packet acceleration in the quantum synthetic space. Remarkably, when a two-level atom is embedded in such a cavity, its Rabi oscillations undergo irreversible decay to a half-and-half mixed state-a previously unobserved phenomenon driven by photonic delocalization within the momentum gap, even with just a single frequency mode. Our findings establish photonic temporal crystals as versatile platforms for studying nonequilibrium quantum photonics and suggest new avenues for controlling light matter interactions through time domain engineering.

Title: Visualizing quantum entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates without state vectors
Authors: Russell B. Thompson
Abstract: Ring polymer self-consistent field theory is used to calculate the critical temperatures and heat capacities of an ideal Bose gas for an order of magnitude more particles than previously reported. A lambda-transition indicative of Bose-Einstein condensation is observed as expected. Using a known proof of spatial mode entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates, a relationship between boson exchange and quantum entanglement is established. This is done without the use of state vectors, since ring polymer quantum theory uses instead a thermal degree of freedom, sometimes called the "imaginary time", to map classical statistical mechanics onto non-relativistic quantum mechanics through the theorems of density functional theory. It is shown that quantum phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, boson exchange, entanglement and contextuality, can be visualized in terms of merging and separating ring polymer threads in thermal-space. A possible extension to fermions is mentioned.

Title: Exhaustive Characterization of Quantum Many-Body Scars using Commutant Algebras
Authors: Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei I. Motrunich
Abstract: We study Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) in the language of commutant algebras, which are defined as symmetry algebras of families of local Hamiltonians. This framework explains the origin of dynamically disconnected subspaces seen in models with exact QMBS, i.e., the large "thermal" subspace and the small "non-thermal" subspace, which are attributed to the existence of unconventional non-local conserved quantities in the commutant; hence this unifies the study of conventional symmetries and weak ergodicity breaking phenomena into a single framework. Furthermore, this language enables us to use the von Neumann Double Commutant Theorem (DCT) to formally write down the exhaustive algebra of all Hamiltonians with a desired set of QMBS, which demonstrates that QMBS survive under large classes of local perturbations. We illustrate this using several standard examples of QMBS, including the spin-1/2 ferromagnetic, AKLT, spin-1 XY $\pi$-bimagnon, and the electronic $\eta$-pairing towers of states; and in each of these cases we explicitly write down a set of generators for the full algebra of Hamiltonians with these this http URL this hidden structure in QMBS Hamiltonians also allows us to recover results of previous "brute-force" numerical searches for such Hamiltonians. In addition, this language clearly demonstrates the equivalence of several unified formalisms for QMBS proposed in the literature, and also illustrates the connection between two apparently distinct classes of QMBS Hamiltonians -- those that are captured by the so-called Shiraishi-Mori construction, and those that lie beyond. Finally, we show that this framework motivates a precise definition for QMBS that automatically implies that they violate the conventional Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), and we discuss its implications to dynamics.

Title: Probabilistic Genotype-Phenotype Maps Reveal Mutational Robustness of RNA Folding, Spin Glasses, and Quantum Circuits
Authors: Anna Sappington, Vaibhav Mohanty
Abstract: Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.

Title: Intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator and axion state in V2WS4
Authors: Yadong Jiang, Huan Wang, Kejie Bao, Jing Wang
Abstract: Intrinsic magnetic topological insulators offers an ideal platform to explore exotic topological phenomena, such as axion electrodynamics, quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect and Majorana edge modes. However, these emerging new physical effects have rarely been experimentally observed due to the limited choice of suitable materials. Here, we predict the van der Waals layered V$_2$WS$_4$ and its related materials show intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. We find extremely rich magnetic topological states in V$_2$WS$_4$, including an antiferromagnetic topological insulator, the axion state with the long-sought quantized topological magnetoelectric effect, three-dimensional QAH state, as well as a collection of QAH insulators and intrinsic axion insulators in odd- and even-layer films, respectively. Remarkably, the Néel temperature of V$_2$WS$_4$ is predicted to be much higher than that of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. These interesting predictions, if realized experimentally, could greatly promote the topological quantum physics research and application.

Title: Probing Fermi surface parity with spin resolved transverse magnetic focussing
Authors: M. J. Rendell, S. D. Liles, S. Bladwell, A. Srinivasan, O. Klochan, I. Farrer, D. A. Ritchie, O. P. Sushkov, A. R. Hamilton
Abstract: Measurements of the Fermi surface are a fundamental technique for determining the electrical and magnetic properties of solids. In 2D systems, the area and diameter of the Fermi surface is typically measured using Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and commensurability oscillations respectively. However, these techniques are unable to detect changes in the parity of the Fermi surface (i.e. when +k $\neq$ -k). Here, we show that transverse magnetic focussing can be used to detect such changes, because focussing only measures a well defined section of the Fermi surface and does not average over +k and -k. Furthermore, our results show that focussing is an order of magnitude more sensitive to changes in the Fermi surface than other 2D techniques, and could be used to investigate similar Fermi surface changes in other 2D systems.

Title: Polarised crowd in motion: insights into statistical and dynamical behavior
Authors: Pratikshya Jena, Shradha Mishra
Abstract: The collection of active agents often exhibits intriguing statistical and dynamical properties, particularly when considering human crowds. In this study, we have developed a computational model to simulate the recent experiment on real marathon races by Bain et al. Our primary goal is to investigate the impact of race staff on crowd dynamics. By comparing simulated races with and without the presence of race staff, our study reveals that the local velocity and density of participants display a wave pattern akin to real races for both the cases. The observed traveling wave in the crowd consistently propagates at a constant speed, regardless of the system size under consideration. The participants dynamics in the longitudinal direction primarily contribute to velocity fluctuations, while fluctuations in the transverse direction are suppressed. In the absence of race staff, density and velocity fluctuations weaken without significantly affecting other statistical and dynamic characteristics of the crowd. Through this research, we aim to deepen our understanding of crowd motion, providing insights that can inform the development of effective crowd management strategies and contribute to the successful control of such events.

Title: Restart uncertainty relation for monitored quantum dynamics
Authors: Ruoyu Yin, Qingyuan Wang, Sabine Tornow, Eli Barkai
Abstract: We introduce a novel time-energy uncertainty relation within the context of restarts in monitored quantum dynamics. Initially, we investigate the concept of ``first hitting time'' in quantum systems using an IBM quantum computer and a three-site ring graph as our starting point. Previous studies have established that the mean recurrence time, which represents the time taken to return to the initial state, is quantized as an integer multiple of the sampling time, displaying pointwise discontinuous transitions at resonances. Our findings demonstrate that, the natural utilization of the restart mechanism in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our newly proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the fluctuations of recurrence time. This work not only contributes to our understanding of fundamental aspects related to quantum measurements and dynamics, but also offers practical insights for the design of efficient quantum algorithms with mid-circuit measurements.

Title: Heavy-fermions in frustrated Hund's metal with portions of incipient flat-bands
Authors: Yilin Wang
Abstract: Flat-bands induced by destructive interference of hoppings in frustrated lattices such as kagome metals, have been extensively studied in recent years. However, such flat-bands usually appear in small portions of Brillouin zone and are away from Fermi level in the non-interacting limit (dubbed as ``incipient"). Whether such incipient flat-band portions can induce very strong electron correlations is an open question. Recently, such incipient flat-bands are found in frustrated kagome CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ and triangular CrB$_2$, which show moderately heavy-fermion behaviors and unconventional superconductivity. Here, by density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we show that both compounds are typical Hund's metals. The incipient flat-band portions induce dips in hybridization functions, which further enhance the Kondo-like effect of Hund's metal, resulting in moderately heavy-fermion behaviors. This explains the origin of the heavy-fermion behaviors and pave the way for understanding the unconventional superconductivity in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ and CrB$_2$. Our work demonstrates a flexible route for generating $d$-electron heavy-fermion and for inducing unconventional superconductivity based on frustrated Hund's metals with portions of incipient flat-bands. A large family of materials with kagome, triangular, pyrochlore lattices consisting of Cr (d$^4$), Ru (d$^4$), Fe (d$^6$) ions are promising candidates.

Title: Electrical Control of Exciton-Polariton Condensate Josephson Junctions via Exciton Stark Effect
Authors: Hua Wang, Hong-Yi Xie, Kieran Mullen
Abstract: We propose harnessing the tools of modern nano-fabrication to provide electrical control of exciton-polariton (EP) condensates. We develop the theory of a device based on the Josephson effect in which electric fields can be used to both switch between and monitor various dynamical modes. In particular, both the bias potential and the Josephson energy can be tuned electrically via the exciton component. We model the device by a Gross-Pitaevskii equation assuming that ideal EP condensates are established with well-balanced pumping and dissipation. We find that the EP condensates can be manipulated through degrees of freedom not easily accessible in other coherent quantum systems, and the dynamics of EP Josephson junctions are richer than that of the conventional superconducting junctions. The ability to control and monitor the condensate by both optical and electrical means allows new ways to study its physics not possible by either, alone.

Title: Hydrodynamic behavior near dynamical criticality of a facilitated conservative lattice gas
Authors: Clément Erignoux, Alexandre Roget, Assaf Shapira, Marielle Simon
Abstract: We investigate a $2d$-conservative lattice gas exhibiting a dynamical active-absorbing phase transition with critical density $\rho_c$. We derive the hydrodynamic equation for this model, showing that all critical exponents governing the large scale behavior near criticality can be obtained from two independent ones. We show that as the supercritical density approaches criticality, distinct length scales naturally appear. Remarkably, this behavior is different from the subcritical one. Numerical simulations support the critical relations and the scale separation.

Title: Magnonic Superconductivity
Authors: Khachatur G. Nazaryan, Liang Fu
Abstract: We uncover a new superconducting state with partial spin polarization induced by a magnetic field. This state, which we call "magnonic superconductor", lacks a conventional pairing order parameter, but is characterized instead by a composite order parameter that represents the binding of electron pairs and magnons. We rigorously demonstrate the existence of magnonic superconductivity with high transition temperature in one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models with repulsive interaction. We further show that magnonic Cooper pairs can attract to form higher-charge bound states, which can give rise to charge-$6e$ superconductivity.

Title: The statistical mechanics and machine learning of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble
Authors: Andrew Jreissaty, Juan Carrasquilla
Abstract: We study the statistical physics of the classical Ising model in the so-called $\alpha$-Rényi ensemble, a finite-temperature thermal state approximation that minimizes a modified free energy based on the $\alpha$-Rényi entropy. We begin by characterizing its critical behavior in mean-field theory in different regimes of the Rényi index $\alpha$. Next, we re-introduce correlations and consider the model in one and two dimensions, presenting analytical arguments for the former and devising a Monte Carlo approach to the study of the latter. Remarkably, we find that while mean-field predicts a continuous phase transition below a threshold index value of $\alpha \sim 1.303$ and a first-order transition above it, the Monte Carlo results in two dimensions point to a continuous transition at all $\alpha$. We conclude by performing a variational minimization of the $\alpha$-Rényi free energy using a recurrent neural network (RNN) ansatz where we find that the RNN performs well in two dimensions when compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. Our work highlights the potential opportunities and limitations associated with the use of the $\alpha$-Rényi ensemble formalism in probing the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of classical and quantum systems.

Title: Ferromagnetism and structural phase transition in monoclinic FeGe film
Authors: Guangdong Nie, Guanghui Han, Erfa S. Z., Kangxi Liu, Shijian Chen, Hao Ding, Fangdong Tang, Licong Peng, Young Sun, Deshun Hong
Abstract: Binary compound FeGe hosts multiple structures, from cubic and hexagonal to monoclinic. Compared to the well-known skyrmion lattice in the cubic phase and the antiferromagnetic charge-density wave in the hexagonal phase, the monoclinic FeGe is less explored. Here, we synthesized the monoclinic FeGe films on Al2O3 (001) and studied their structural, magnetic, and transport properties. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characterizations indicate that the FeGe films are epitaxial to the substrate. Unlike the antiferromagnetic bulk, the monoclinic FeGe films are ferromagnetic with Curie-temperature as high as ~ 800 K, contributing to the anomalous Hall effect in the transport measurements. Similar to the hexagonal FeGe, we captured a structural phase transition in the monoclinic FeGe films at ~ 100 K in real and reciprocal spaces by transmission electron microscope. Our work enriches the phase diagram of the FeGe family and suggests that FeGe offers an ideal platform for studying multiphase transitions and related device applications.

Title: Nonreciprocal Nonlinear Responses in Moving Charge Density Waves
Authors: Ying-Ming Xie, Hiroki Isobe, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: The incommensurate charge density wave states (CDWs) can exhibit steady motion in the flow limit after depinning, behaving as a nonequilibrium system with time-dependent states. Since the moving CDW, like an electric current, breaks both time-reversal and inversion symmetries, one may speculate the emergence of nonreciprocal nonlinear responses from such motion. However, the moving CDW order parameter is intrinsically time-dependent in the lab frame, and it is known to be challenging to evaluate the responses of such a time-varying system. In this work, following the principle of Galilean relativity, we resolve this time-dependent hard problem in the lab frame by mapping the system to the comoving frame with static CDW states through the Galilean transformation. We explicitly show that the nonreciprocal nonlinear responses would be generated by the movement of CDW states through violating Galilean relativity.

Title: Massive Higher-Spin Fields in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Eric Bergshoeff, Andrea Campoleoni, Giandomenico Palumbo, Patricio Salgado-Rebolledo
Abstract: Incompressibility plays a key role in the geometric description of fractional quantum Hall fluids. It is naturally related to quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms and the underlying Girvin-MacDonald-Plazman algebra, which gives rise to an emergent non-relativistic massive spin-2 mode propagating in the bulk. The corresponding metric tensor can be identified with a nematic order parameter for the bulk states. In the linearised regime with a flat background, it has been shown that this mode can be described by a spin-2 Schroedinger action. However, quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms also suggest the existence of higher-spin modes that cannot be described through nematic fractional quantum Hall states. Here, we consider p-atic Hall phases, in which the corresponding p-atic order parameters are related to higher-rank symmetric tensors. We then show that in this framework, non-relativistic massive chiral higher-spin fields naturally emerge and that their dynamics is described by higher-spin Schroedinger actions. We finally show that these effective actions can be derived from relativistic massive higher-spin theories in 2+1 dimensions after taking a non-relativistic limit.

Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.

Title: Non-Hermitian Topology in Hermitian Topological Matter
Authors: Shu Hamanaka, Tsuneya Yoshida, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive topological phenomena absent in Hermitian systems. However, connection between such intrinsic non-Hermitian topology and Hermitian topology has remained largely elusive. Here, considering the bulk and boundary as an environment and system, respectively, we demonstrate that anomalous boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators exhibit non-Hermitian topology. We study the self-energy capturing the particle exchange between the bulk and boundary, and show that it detects Hermitian topology in the bulk and induces non-Hermitian topology at the boundary. As an illustrative example, we reveal non-Hermitian topology and concomitant skin effect inherently embedded within chiral edge states of Chern insulators. We also identify the emergence of hinge states within effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians at surfaces of three-dimensional topological insulators. Furthermore, we comprehensively classify our correspondence across all the tenfold symmetry classes of topological insulators and superconductors. Our work uncovers hidden connection between Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology, and provides an approach to identifying non-Hermitian topology in quantum matter.

Title: Theoretical prediction of a novel Pt3Sn2S2 as a Nonmagnetic Weyl Semimetal in Kagome System
Authors: Ravi Trivedi, Seetha Lakshmy, Heera T. Nair, Alok Shukla, Brahmananda Chakraborty
Abstract: We present a detailed theoretical study of Pt3Sn2S2 a layered kagome type material inspired by recent investigation of Co3Sn2S2 reported in [Nature Communication 11, 3985 (2020) whose physical properties remain largely unexplored. Thermodynamic stability was confirmed via formation energy calculations while mechanical stability was evaluated using Voigt Reuss Hill approximation and elastic stability condition. Dynamical and thermal stability were validated through Phonon dispersion and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics simulations with Pughs criterion classifying the material as ductile. Spin orbit coupling induced band splitting, giving rise to Weyl points and a Weyl semimetal phase accompanied by a SOC driven transition from non relativistic band touching to relativistic band touching making a topological phase shift. Under applied pressure, the coupling of spin and valley degrees of freedom generates spin valley intertwined Dirac cones enabling tunable electronic properties for spintronic and valleytronic applications. Boltzman transport calculations using AMSET reveal a high Seebeck coefficient with SOC and low thermal conductivity highlighting its potential for high performance thermoelectric devices.

Title: Thermodynamic modeling of the LiCl-KCl-LaCl$_3$ system with Bayesian model selection and uncertainty quantification
Authors: Rushi Gong, Shun-Li Shang, Vitaliy G. Goncharov, Cillian Cockrell, Kostya Trachenko, Paul A. Bingham, Xiaofeng Guo, Zi-Kui Liu
Abstract: Chloride molten salts are increasingly used in pyroprocessing techniques for the separation of lanthanides. Understanding thermodynamic properties of these salts is essential to predict their critical characteristics and optimize the separation process. Several thermodynamic models, including the associate model, the two-sublattice ionic model, and the modified quasichemical model with quadruplet approximation (MQMQA), have been utilized in the literature to capture the complexity of molten salts. In the present work, the Bayes factor is used to guide the model selection process for thermodynamic modeling of the KCl-LaCl3 system and provide statistical comparison of various models. The results indicate that the MQMQA model is the most favorable one based on available data. The LiCl-KCl-LaCl3 system has been further modelled with uncertainty quantification (UQ) using MQMQA with the thermodynamic properties of compounds in KCl-LaCl3 predicted by the quasiharmonic approach in terms of first-principles phonon calculations as a function of temperature. The calculated phase stability shows excellent agreement with experimental data, indicating that an appropriate thermodynamic model is important for accurately predicting critical characteristics of complex molten salts.

Title: Random matrix universality in dynamical correlation functions at late times
Authors: Oscar Bouverot-Dupuis, Silvia Pappalardi, Jorge Kurchan, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Laura Foini
Abstract: We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.

Title: Structured light and induced vorticity in superconductors I: Linearly polarized light
Authors: Tien-Tien Yeh, Hennadii Yerzhakov, Logan Bishop-Van Horn, Srinivas Raghu, Alexander Balatsky
Abstract: We propose an approach to use linearly polarized light to imprint superconducting vortices. Within the framework of the generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations we demonstrate the induction of the coherent vortex pairs that are moving in phase with electormagnetic wave oscillations. The overall vorticity of the superconductor remain zero throughout the cycle. Our results uncover rich multiscale dynamics of SC vorticity and suggest new optical applications for various types of structured light. In departure from classical laser printing, the laser printing proposed here can be viewed as quantum print where we induce quantum excitations in the SC liquid.

Abstract: The potential applications of boundary functionals of random processes, such as the extreme values of these processes, the moment of first reaching a fixed level, the value of the process at the moment of reaching the level, the moment of reaching extreme values, the time the process stays above a fixed level, and other functionals, are considered for the description of physical, chemical, and biological problems. Definitions of these functionals are provided, and characteristic functions are presented for the model with an exponential distribution of incoming demands. A generalization of these limitations is also considered. The potential uses of boundary functionals are demonstrated through examples such as a unicyclic network with affinity A, an asymmetric random walk, nonlinear diffusion, two-level model, Brownian motion, and multiple diffusing particles with reversible target-binding kinetics.

Title: Domain-Wall Ferroelectric Polarons in a two-dimensional Rotor Lattice Model
Authors: Florian Kluibenschedl, Georgios M. Koutentakis, Ragheed Alhyder, Mikhail Lemeshko
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of ferroelectric domain-wall polarons in a minimal two-dimensional lattice model of electrons interacting with rotating dipoles. Along the domain-wall, the rotors polarize in opposite directions, causing the electron to localize along a particular lattice direction. The rotor-electron coupling is identified as the origin of a structural instability in the crystal that leads to the domain-wall formation via a symmetry-breaking process. Our results provide the first theoretical description of ferroelectric polarons, as discussed in the context of soft semiconductors.

Title: Scaling of contraction costs for entanglement renormalization algorithms including tensor Trotterization and variational Monte Carlo
Authors: Thomas Barthel, Qiang Miao
Abstract: The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a hierarchical class of tensor network states motivated by the real-space renormalization group. It is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. For prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions and different optimization strategies, we determine the optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction sequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts to employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors are Trotterized, i.e., chosen as circuits of quantum gates, and observables as well as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We investigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform better than the traditional optimization of full MERA based on the exact evaluation of energy gradients. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best MERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the optimal number of Trotter steps with the bond dimension. The results suggest substantial gains due to VMC for two-dimensional systems.

Title: SemiEpi: Self-driving, Closed-loop Multi-Step Growth of Semiconductor Heterostructures Guided by Machine Learning
Authors: Chao Shen, Wenkang Zhan, Kaiyao Xin, Shujie Pan, Xiaotian Cheng, Ruixiang Liu, Zhe Feng, Chaoyuan Jin, Hui Cong, Chi Xu, Bo Xu, Tien Khee Ng, Siming Chen, Chunlai Xue, Zhanguo Wang, Chao Zhao
Abstract: The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks through closed-loop, self-driving experimentation, accelerating the optimization of complex multi-step processes. The emergence of machine learning (ML) has ushered in self-driving processes with minimal human intervention. This work introduces SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed to execute molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of semiconductor heterostructures through multi-step processes, in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard reactor, parameter initialization, and multiple ML models, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for multi-step heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. SemiEpi initializes material growth parameters tailored to specific material characteristics, and fine-tuned control over the growth process is then achieved through ML optimization. We optimize the growth for InAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of SemiEpi, achieving a QD density of 5E10/cm2, 1.6-fold increased photoluminescence (PL) intensity and reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV. This work highlights the potential of closed-loop, ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step growth. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Furthermore, our strategy facilitates developing a hardware-independent process and enhancing process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.

Title: Effective and efficient modeling of the hydrodynamics for bacterial flagella
Authors: Baopi Liu, Lu Chen, Ji Zhang
Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions among bacterial cell bodies, flagella, and surrounding boundaries are essential for understanding bacterial motility in complex environments. In this study, we demonstrate that each slender flagellum can be modeled as a series of spheres, and that the interactions between these spheres can be accurately characterized using a resistance matrix. This approach allows us to effectively and efficiently evaluate the propulsive effects of the flagella. Notably, our investigation into bacterial motility near a colloidal sphere reveals significant discrepancies between results derived from the twin multipole moment and those obtained through resistive force theory. Consequently, neglecting the hydrodynamic interactions among cell bodies, flagella, and colloidal spheres may lead to substantial inaccuracies. Our model simplifies bacteria into a series of spheres, making it well-suited for examining bacterial motility near spherical boundaries, as well as the nonlinear deformation dynamics of elastic flagella.

Title: Topological phase transitions in perovskite superlattices driven by temperature, electric field, and doping
Authors: Jiyuan Yang, Shi Liu
Abstract: Many dipolar topological structures have been experimentally demonstrated in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices, such as flux-closure, vortice, and skyrmion. In this work, we employ deep potential molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the dynamical response of the (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice, supporting polar vortex arrays, to temperature and electric field at the atomic level. Our simulations reveal a unique phase transition sequence from ferroelectric-like to antiferroelectric-like to paraelectric in the in-plane direction as temperature increases. In the ferroelectric-like state, we observe field-driven reversible switching of in-plane polarization coupled with out-of-plane movements of vortex cores during MD simulations. In the antiferroelectric-like region, the polarization-electric field hysteresis loop exhibits a superparaelectric feature, showing nearly no loss. This behavior is attributed to a strong recovering force to form polar vortex arrays, dictated by the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions within the superlattice. The (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice in the antiferroelectric-like state also demonstrates large in-plane susceptibility and tunability. The effect of Pb doping in the SrTiO$_3$ layer on the topological structural transition in the superlattice is investigated. The weakened depolarization field in the PbTiO$_3$ layers leads to new dipolar configurations, such as enlarged skyrmion bubble within $c$ domains in (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$TiO$_3$)$_{10}$, and we quantify their thermal and electrical responses through MD simulations. These quantitative atomistic insights will be useful for the controlled optimization of perovskite superlattices for various device applications.

Title: Transverse Spin current at the normal/p-wave magnet junctions
Authors: Morteza Salehi, Ali Akbar Hedayati
Abstract: We investigate the transmission properties of a junction between a normal metal and a p-wave magnet in the ballistic regime. We introduce a two-dimensional square lattice that confirms the p-wave magnet criteria. The $\alpha$-vector of the magnet breaks the inversion symmetry of the parabolic dispersion, shifting them in $k$-space. These shifts alter the propagation direction of fermions passing through the junction interface. Depending on spin orientation, the transmission process exhibits anisotropic, angle-dependent behavior. We also demonstrate a mirror symmetry between fermions with opposite spin directions, leading to the emergence of a transverse spin current that flows parallel to the interface. Additionally, we show that the $\alpha$-vector acts as a source for the dynamics of the spin-density wave and observe the formation of an indirect gap in the conductance of the junction. Our findings highlight the unique transmission characteristics and spin transport phenomena in normal metal/p-wave magnet junctions, paving the way for potential applications in spintronic devices.

Title: Electronic interferometry with ultrashort plasmonic pulses

Wieck, Michihisa Yamamoto, David Pomaranski, Shintaro Takada, Nobu-Hisa Kaneko, Giorgos Georgiou, Xavier Waintal, Matias Urdampilleta, Hermann Sellier, Christopher Bäuerle
Abstract: Electronic flying qubits offer an interesting alternative to photonic qubits: electrons propagate slower, hence easier to control in real time, and Coulomb interaction enables direct entanglement between different qubits. Although their coherence time is limited, flying electrons in the form of picosecond plasmonic pulses could be competitive in terms of the number of achievable coherent operations. The key challenge in achieving this critical milestone is the development of a new technology capable of injecting 'on-demand' single-electron wavepackets into quantum devices, with temporal durations comparable to or shorter than the device dimensions. Here, we take a significant step towards achieving this regime in a quantum nanoelectronic system by injecting ultrashort single-electron plasmonic pulses into a 14-micrometer-long Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Our results establish that quantum coherence is robust under the on-demand injection of ultrashort plasmonic pulses, as evidenced by the observation of coherent oscillations in the single-electron regime. Building on this, our results demonstrate for the first time the existence of a new "non-adiabatic" regime that is prominent at high frequencies. This breakthrough highlights the potential of flying qubits as a promising alternative to localised qubit architectures, offering advantages such as a reduced hardware footprint, enhanced connectivity, and scalability for quantum information processing.

Title: Phonon-induced modification of polaritonic Rabi oscillations in the presence of the dark excitonic condensate
Authors: Adham Alkady, Victor Fleurov, Anatoly Kuklov
Abstract: Optically inactive (dark) intervalley momentum-forbidden excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, testing their coherence by light directly is impossible. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified, and can be viewed as the photon-exciton-phonon polaritonic effect. The multi-component nature of the dark condensate consistent with the point-group symmetry is taken into account in the limit of weak phonon-exciton interaction. A perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.

Title: Stochastic Scovil--Schulz-DuBois machine and its three types of cycles
Authors: Fei Liu, Jiayin Gu
Abstract: Three types of cycles are identified in the quantum jump trajectories of the Scovil--Schulz-DuBois (SSDB) machine: an R-cycle as refrigeration, an H-cycle as a heat engine, and an N-cycle in which the machine is neutral. The statistics of these cycles are investigated via a semi-Markov process method. We find that in the large time limit, whether the machine operates as a heat engine or refrigerator depends on the ratio between the numbers of R-cycles and H-cycles per unit time. Further increasing the hot bath temperature above a certain threshold does not increase the machine's power output. The cause is that, in this situation, the N-cycle has a greater probability than the H-cycle and R-cycle. Although the SSDB machine operates by randomly switching between these three cycles, at the level of a single quantum jump trajectory, its heat engine efficiency and the refrigerator's coefficient of performance remain constant.

Title: Many-body tunneling in a double-well potential
Authors: Matteo Zendra, Fausto Borgonovi, Giuseppe Luca Celardo, Shmuel Gurvitz
Abstract: We present an approach for evaluating Wannier functions, offering an alternative perspective on their role in many-body systems. Unlike traditional methods, such as the maximally localized Wannier functions approach, which focuses on minimizing the function tails, our approach emphasizes these tails. Using perturbative analytical approximations and extensive numerical simulations on an exactly solvable model, we address nonstandard Hubbard terms and demonstrate their critical influence on many-body dynamics. Specifically, we study tunneling dynamics in arbitrary double-well potentials, moving beyond the standard Hubbard model to include nonstandard terms such as density-induced tunneling and pair tunneling. Our results reveal that these terms significantly modify the dynamics predicted by the standard Hubbard model: density-induced tunneling modifies the single-particle tunneling parameter $\Omega_0$, while pair tunneling enables coherent propagation not captured by the standard model. We show that the discrepancies between the standard and nonstandard Hubbard models grow with increasing interaction strength, potentially leading to novel transport behaviors. However, at lower interaction strengths, both models converge, as nonstandard terms become negligible. These findings have important implications for phenomena such as superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene and metal-insulator transitions. Our model aligns well with numerical simulations of lowest-band parameters and is strongly supported by experimental observations of second-order atom tunneling in optical double-well potentials. This strong agreement with experimental data highlights the accuracy and potential of our approach in providing a more comprehensive framework for describing complex many-body systems than the standard Hubbard model.

Title: Unusually high-density 2D electron gases in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with GaN/AlN superlattice back barriers grown on sapphire substrates
Authors: Maciej Matys, Atsushi Yamada, Toshihiro Ohki
Abstract: We reported on the observation of extremely high-density ($>10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) 2D electron gas in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. Due to introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between the GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer, we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/AlGaN interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only one order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with the changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggests that the strains are responsible for the 2D electron gas density enhancement (reduction of the piezoelectric polarization in the GaN channel). Nevertheless, this finding is probably insufficient to fully explain the observed high 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). Finally, the possibility of application of such high-density 2D electron gas with low sheet resistance to transistors, emitters and detectors was discussed.

Title: Fractional Quantum Hall Effect Based on Weyl Orbits
Authors: Jiong-Hao Wang, Yan-Bin Yang, Yong Xu
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect is a well-known demonstration of strongly correlated topological phases in two dimensions. However, the extension of this phenomenon into a three-dimensional context has yet to be achieved. Recently, the three-dimensional integer quantum Hall effect based on Weyl orbits has been experimentally observed in a topological semimetallic material under a magnetic field. This motivates us to ask whether the Weyl orbits can give rise to the fractional quantum Hall effect when their Landau level is partially filled in the presence of interactions. Here we theoretically demonstrate that the fractional quantum Hall states based on Weyl orbits can emerge in a Weyl semimetal when a Landau level is one-third filled. Using concrete models for Weyl semimetals in magnetic fields, we project the Coulomb interaction onto a single Landau level from the Weyl orbit and find that the ground state of the many-body Hamiltoian is triply degenerate. We further show that the ground states exhibit the many-body Chern number of $1/3$ and the uniform occupation of electrons in both momentum and real space, implying that they are the fractional quantum Hall states. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, the states are spatially localized on two surfaces hosting Fermi arcs. Additionally, our findings suggest that the excitation properties of these states resemble those of the Laughlin state in two dimensions, as inferred from the particle entanglement spectrum of the ground states.

Title: Topological superconductivity in a spin-orbit coupled Kondo lattice
Authors: Zekun Zhuang, Piers Coleman
Abstract: We consider the effect of spin-orbit coupling on a two-dimensional Kondo Lattice model, in which conduction electrons are antiferromagnetically coupled to a Yao-Lee spin liquid. When a Rashba spin-orbit interaction and a nearest-neighbor Kondo interaction is introduced, the low-energy Majorana bands become gapped and develop Chern numbers, protecting unidirectionally propagating Majorana edge modes. Our model describes a chiral topological superconductor with fractionalized charge-$e$ order parameter and spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry, which may be of interest for certain heavy fermion superconductors, such as UTe$_2$.

Title: On inequalities of shear modulus contributions in disordered elastic bodies
Authors: J.P. Wittmer, H. Xu
Abstract: We investigate generic inequalities of various contributions to the shear modulus $\mu$ in ensembles of amorphous elastic bodies. We focus first on a simple elastic network model with connectivity matrices (CMs) which are either annealed or quenched, at or out of equilibrium. The stress-fluctuation formalism relation for $\mu$ is rewritten as $\mu = \mu_1 + \mu_a$ with $\mu_1 \ge 0$ characterizing the variance of the quenched shear stresses and $\mu_a$ being a simple average over all states and CMs. For equilibrium CM-distributions $\mu_a$ becomes equivalent to the shear modulus of annealed systems, i.e. $\mu_a \ge 0$, while more generally $\mu_a$ may become strongly negative as shown by considering a temperature quench and a scalar active two-temperature model. Consistent relations are also found for glass-forming colloids where $\mu-\mu_1=\mu_a=0$ for equilibrium ensembles, i.e. $\mu$ is set by the quenched shear stresses, while $\mu_a$ becomes again negative otherwise.

Title: Thermomajorization Mpemba Effect
Authors: Tan Van Vu, Hisao Hayakawa
Abstract: The Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive physical phenomenon where a hot system cools faster than a warm one. In recent years, theoretical analyses of the Mpemba effect have been developed for microscopic systems and experimentally verified. However, the conventional theory relies on a specific choice of distance measure to quantify relaxation speed, leading to several theoretical ambiguities. In this Letter, we derive a rigorous quantification of the Mpemba effect based on thermomajorization theory, referred to as the thermomajorization Mpemba effect. This approach resolves all existing ambiguities and provides a unification of the conventional Mpemba effect across all monotone measures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the thermomajorization Mpemba effect for Markovian dynamics, rigorously proving that it can occur in any temperature regime with fixed energy levels.

Title: Long-range correlations with finite-size effects from a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with power-law distributed durations
Authors: M. A. Korzeniowska, O. E. Garcia
Abstract: Long-range correlations manifested as power spectral density scaling $1/f^\beta$ for frequency $f$ and a range of exponents $\beta$ are investigated for a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with distributed durations $\tau$. Closed-form expressions for the frequency power spectral density are derived for a one-sided exponential pulse function and several variants of bounded and unbounded power-law distributions of pulse durations ${P_\tau(\tau)\sim1/\tau^\alpha}$ with abrupt and smooth cutoffs. The asymptotic scaling relation $\beta=3-\alpha$ is demonstrated for $1<\alpha<3$ in the limit of an infinitely broad distribution $P_\tau(\tau)$. Logarithmic corrections to the frequency scaling are exposed at the boundaries of the long-range dependence regime, $\beta=0$ and $\beta=2$. Analytically demonstrated finite-size effects associated with distribution truncations are shown to reduce the frequency ranges of scale invariance by several decades. The regimes of validity of the $\beta=3-\alpha$ relation are clarified.

Title: Quantum Kinetic Theory of the Linear Response for Weakly Disordered Multiband Systems
Authors: Thierry Valet, Roberto Raimondi
Abstract: A quantum kinetic theory of the linear response to an electric field is provided from a controlled expansion of the Keldysh theory at leading order, for a multiband electron system with weak scalar disorder. The response is uniquely partitioned into intraband distribution functions and interband quantum coherences. A new explicit formula is provided for the latter, outlining their true nature as local dependent quantities, for which the mesoscopic gradients of the former is uncovered as a source term, opening a new research area. The precise connection with the Kubo formula in the ladder approximation is established. A pedagogical application to spin-orbit torque theory in the two dimensional electron gas demonstrates the striking efficiency of the quantum kinetic approach. Some important implications for the theory of orbital transport are also briefly discussed.

Title: Boundary Criticality in the 2d Random Quantum Ising Model
Authors: Gaurav Tenkila, Romain Vasseur, Andrew C. Potter
Abstract: The edge of a quantum critical system can exhibit multiple distinct types of boundary criticality. We use a numerical real-space renormalization group (RSRG) to study the boundary criticality of a 2d quantum Ising model with random exchange couplings and transverse fields, whose bulk exhibits an infinite randomness critical point. This approach enables an asymptotically numerically exact extraction of universal scaling data from very large systems with many thousands of spins that cannot be efficiently simulated directly. We identify three distinct classes of boundary criticality, and extract key scaling exponents governing boundary-boundary and boundary-bulk correlations and dynamics. We anticipate that this approach can be generalized to studying a broad class of (disordered) boundary criticality, including symmetry-enriched criticality and edge modes of gapless symmetry-protected topological states, in contexts were other numerical methods are restricted to one-dimensional chains.

Title: Spin orbit torque-driven motion of quasi-Bloch domain wall in perpendicularly magnetized W/CoFeB/MgO structure
Authors: Nobuyuki Umetsu, Michael Quinsat, Susumu Hashimoto, Tsuyoshi Kondo, Masaki Kado
Abstract: The motion of chiral magnetic domain walls (DWs) driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied in heavy metal/ferromagnet heterostructures with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. This study specifically focuses on SOT-driven DWs in near Bloch-states, which we refer to as ``quasi-Bloch DWs". These quasi-Bloch DWs exhibit slower motion compared to Neel-type DWs, offering potential for achieving highly controllable DW positions. Here, we investigate the characteristics of SOT-driven motion of quasi-Bloch DWs in perpendicularly magnetized ultra-thin films consisting of W/CoFeB/MgO. For analyzing the DW motion, we employ a one-dimensional model incorporating parameters derived from experimental data obtained from our samples. Our model successfully reproduces the experimental results, which reveal variations in the direction and threshold current density of DW motion among different samples. Through theoretical analysis, we unveil that the DW remains in quasi-Bloch states during motion, with SOT serving as the primary driving force rather than spin transfer torque (STT). The direction of motion is determined not only by the sign combination of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and spin Hall angle but also by the strength of DMI, STT, and extrinsic DW pinning. Furthermore, we provide analytical expressions for the threshold current density required for SOT-driven quasi-Bloch DW motion. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of future DW devices with specific film structures.

Title: Defect engineering in two-dimensional pentagonal PdTe$_2$: Tuning electronic, optical, and magnetic properties
Authors: Poonam Sharma, Vaishali Roondhe, Alok Shukla
Abstract: Recently, the successful synthesis of the pentagonal form of PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$) was reported [Liu~\emph{et al.}, Nature Materials \textbf{23}, 1339 (2024)]. In this work, we present an extensive first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) based computational study of vacancies in this material. Our study covers the evolution of the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of various defect configurations and compares those to the pristine monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$). We find that V$_{Pd}$ (V$_{Te}$) is the most stable defect in the~\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer in the Te-rich (Pd-rich) limit. The defects alter the electronic properties of the monolayer significantly, leading to changes in their magnetic and optical properties due to the emergence of midgap impurity states. The defect complex V$_{Pd+4Te}$ is found to induce spin-polarization in the system with a total magnetic moment of 1.87 $\mu_{B}$. The obtained low diffusion energy barriers of 1.13 eV (in-plane) and 0.063 eV (top-bottom) corresponding to V$_{Te}$ indicates its facile migration probability is higher in the top-bottom direction at room temperature, as revealed by AIMD simulations as well. In order to guide the experimentalists, we also simulated the scanning-tunneling microscope (STM) images corresponding to all the defect configurations. Moreover, we also computed the electron-beam energies required for creating mono-vacancies. In the optical absorption spectra of the defective configurations, finite peaks appear below the band edge that are unique to the respective defective configuration. We have also computed the excess polarizability of the defective configurations with respect to the pristine one and found that maximum changes occur in the infrared and visible regions, providing insights into the change in their optical response as compared to the pristine monolayer.

Title: The orientational structure of a model patchy particle fluid: simulations, integral equations, density functional theory and machine learning
Authors: Alessandro Simon, Luc Belloni, Daniel Borgis, Martin Oettel
Abstract: We investigate the orientational properties of a homogeneous and inhomogeneous tetrahedral 4-patch fluid (Kern--Frenkel model). Using integral equations, either (i) HNC or (ii) a modified HNC scheme with simulation input, the full orientational dependence of pair and direct correlation functions is determined. Density functionals for the inhomogeneous problem are constructed via two different methods. The first, molecular density functional theory, utilizes the full direct correlation function and an isotropic hard-sphere bridge functional. The second method, a machine learning approach, uses a decomposition of the functional into an isotropic reference part and a mean-field orientational part, where both parts are improved by machine learning techniques. Comparison to simulation data at hard walls and around hard tracers show a similar performance of the two functionals. Machine learning strategies are discussed to eliminate residual differences, with the goal of obtaining machine-learning enhanced functionals for the general anisotropic fluid.

Title: Structured light and induced vorticity in superconductors II: Quantum Print with Laguerre-Gaussian beam
Authors: Tien-Tien Yeh, Hennadii Yerzhakov, Logan Bishop-Van Horn, Srinivas Raghu, Alexander Balatsky
Abstract: Challenge to control the quantum states of matter via light have been at the forefront of modern research on driven quantum matter. We explore the imprinting effects of structured light on superconductors, demonstrating how the quantum numbers of light-specifically spin angular momentum, orbital angular momentum, and radial order-can be transferred to the superconducting order parameter and control vortex dynamics. Using Laguerre-Gaussian beams, we show that by tuning the quantum numbers and the amplitude of the electric field, it is possible to manipulate a variety of vortex behaviors, including breathing vortex pairs, braiding vortex pairs, vortex droplets, supervortices, and swirling 2D vortex rings. More complex structure of vortex-clusters, such as vortex-flake structures, and standing wave motions, also emerge under specific quantum numbers. These results demonstrate the ability to control SC vortex motion and phase structures through structured light, offering potential applications in quantum fluids and optical control of superconducting states. Our findings present a diagram that links light's quantum numbers to the resulting SC vortex behaviors, highlighting the capacity of light to transfer its symmetry onto superconducting condensates. We point that this approach represents the extension of the printing to quantum printing by light in a coherent state of electrons.

Title: Insights into Transient Dynamics of Bacteria Laden Liquid Bridges
Authors: Kush Kumar Dewangan, Srinivas Rao S, Durbar Roy, Atish Roy Chowdhury, Dipshikha Chakravortty, Saptarshi Basu
Abstract: We study evaporation and precipitate formation mechanics of bacteria-laden liquid bridge using experimental and theoretical analysis. Aqueous suspension of motile and non-motile Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa typically found in contaminated food and water were used in liquid bridge configuration between hydrophilic substrates. Using inverse logarithmic evaporation flux model, we study volume regression for cylindrical/catenoid volume models with confinement distance as a parameter. For all confinement distances, the regression is linear on normalizing both volume and time as in the case of pure sessile drop. However, in normalized volume and dimensional time space, we observe non-linearities as the evaporation time scales non linearly with the confinement distance. The non-linearities were captured using the catenoid model. The catenoid model conforms to the experimental volume regression data at all confinement distances, and the transient liquid bridge interface evolution profile at high confinement distance. We also study the precipitate pattern and bacterial distribution using micro/nano characterization techniques. We show the average precipitate pattern for both sessile and higher confinement distance resembles coffee ring type deposits although the underlying bacterial distribution differs. For lower confinement, we observe pattern resulting from a combination of coffee ring effect, stick-slick motion, and thin film instability. The reduction in confinement distance causes an altered bacterial agglomeration, resulting in a multi-pattern network instead of a single circumferential edge deposition. We show the aerial size of motile bacteria increases with decreasing confinement, whereas the size for non-motile bacteria remains constant in the precipitate.

Title: Large tunable Josephson diode effect in a side-contacted topological-insulator-nanowire junction
Authors: Ella Nikodem, Jakob Schluck, Max Geier, Michal Papaj, Henry F. Legg, Junya Feng, Mahasweta Bagchi, Liang Fu, Yoichi Ando
Abstract: A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI-nanowire-based Josephson junction.

Title: Direct Comparison of Magnetic Penetration Depth in Kagome Superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb)
Authors: Austin Kaczmarek, Andrea Capa Salinas, Stephen D. Wilson, Katja C. Nowack
Abstract: We report measurements of the local temperature-dependent penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, in the Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb) using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy. Our results suggest that the superconducting order in all three compounds is fully gapped, in contrast to reports of nodal superconductivity in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Analysis of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, $\rho_s(T)$, shows deviations from the behavior expected for a single isotropic gap, but the data are well described by models incorporating either a single anisotropic gap or two isotropic gaps. Notably, the temperature dependences of $\lambda(T)$ and $\rho_s(T)$ in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ are qualitatively more similar to each other than to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, consistent with the superconducting phase reflecting features of the normal-state band structure. Our findings provide a direct comparison of the superconducting properties across the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.

Title: Multiferroic collinear antiferromagnet with hidden altermagnetic split
Authors: Jin Matsuda, Hikaru Watanabe, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit nonrelativistic spin splitting due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry and have been garnering significant attention as promising materials for spintronic applications. In contrast, conventional antiferromagnets without spin splitting seem not to have any symmetry breaking and have drawn less attention. However, we show that conventional antiferromagnets with a nonzero propagation vector (Q vector) bring about nontrivial symmetry breakings. The incompatibility between the Q vector and nonsymmorphic symmetry leads to macroscopic symmetry breaking without lifting spin degeneracy. Moreover, the hidden altermagnetic spin splitting in the electronic structure gives rise to various emergent responses. To examine our prediction, we perform first-principles calculations for MnS2 and investigate its multiferroic properties, such as nonlinear transport and optical activity. Our findings reveal unique properties in conventional antiferromagnets, providing another perspective for designing spintronic materials.

Abstract: "Pasta alla Cacio e pepe" is a traditional Italian dish made with pasta, pecorino cheese, and pepper. Despite its simple ingredient list, achieving the perfect texture and creaminess of the sauce can be challenging. In this study, we systematically explore the phase behavior of Cacio and pepe sauce, focusing on its stability at increasing temperatures for various proportions of cheese, water, and starch. We identify starch concentration as the key factor influencing sauce stability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically, we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1% (relative to cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition determining what we term the "Mozzarella Phase" and corresponding to an unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level, observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model. Finally, we present a scientifically optimized recipe based on our findings, enabling a consistently flawless execution of this classic dish.

Title: Constriction and contact impedance of ceramic solid electrolytes
Authors: Md Salman Rabbi Limon, Curtis Duffee, Zeeshan Ahmad
Abstract: The development of solid-state batteries (SSBs) is hindered by degradation at solid-solid interfaces due to void formation and contact loss, resulting in increased impedance. Here, we systematically investigate the roles of real and unrecoverable interfacial contact areas at the electrode/Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl interface in driving the impedance rise. By controlling contact geometries and applied pressures, we identify their distinct contributions to the impedance spectra and quantify their influence on the interfacial resistance and transport. Experiments reveal that interfacial resistance varies strongly with recoverable contact area and applied pressure following power law scaling, with exponents of -1 and -0.5, respectively. Moreover, distributed contacts result in lower impedance due to smaller potential gradients and a more uniform potential distribution. Continuum simulations of the contact geometries predict interfacial resistances in agreement with experiments. Our work highlights the influence of unrecoverable and recoverable contact losses on SSB impedance while quantifying the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

Title: Genuine and Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling Effect in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions
Authors: Zhi Yan, Xujin Zhang, Jianhua Xiao, Cheng Fang, Xiaohong Xu
Abstract: Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) are promising candidates for data storage devices due to their tunable thickness and capability to exhibit multiple nonvolatile resistance states. However, existing vdW-MFTJs utilize ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism independently, failing to achieve true magnetoelectric coupling, which leads to unnecessary energy dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative vdW-MFTJ design based on a CrBr$_3$/MnPSe$_3$/CrBr$_3$ vertical heterostructure, enabling genuine magnetoelectric coupling without relying on atomic migration induced by inversion symmetry breaking for ferroelectric polarization reversal. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.

Title: A self-learning magnetic Hopfield neural network with intrinsic gradient descent adaption
Authors: Chang Niu, Huanyu Zhang, Chuanlong Xu, Wenjie Hu, Yunzhuo Wu, Yu Wu, Yadi Wang, Tong Wu, Yi Zhu, Yinyan Zhu, Wenbin Wang, Yizheng Wu, Lifeng Yin, Jiang Xiao, Weichao Yu, Hangwen Guo, Jian Shen
Abstract: Physical neural networks using physical materials and devices to mimic synapses and neurons offer an energy-efficient way to implement artificial neural networks. Yet, training physical neural networks are difficult and heavily relies on external computing resources. An emerging concept to solve this issue is called physical self-learning that uses intrinsic physical parameters as trainable weights. Under external inputs (i.e. training data), training is achieved by the natural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modern learning rules via autonomous physical process, eliminating the requirements on external computation this http URL, we demonstrate a real spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN) and unsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution of physical process. Using magnetic texture defined conductance matrix as trainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, the conductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja's learning algorithm in a gradient descent manner. The self-learning HNN is scalable and can achieve associative memories on patterns with high similarities. The fast spin dynamics and reconfigurability of magnetic textures offer an advantageous platform towards efficient autonomous training directly in materials.

Title: Machine learning with tree tensor networks, CP rank constraints, and tensor dropout
Authors: Hao Chen, Thomas Barthel
Abstract: Tensor networks developed in the context of condensed matter physics try to approximate order-$N$ tensors with a reduced number of degrees of freedom that is only polynomial in $N$ and arranged as a network of partially contracted smaller tensors. As we have recently demonstrated in the context of quantum many-body physics, computation costs can be further substantially reduced by imposing constraints on the canonical polyadic (CP) rank of the tensors in such networks [arXiv:2205.15296]. Here, we demonstrate how tree tensor networks (TTN) with CP rank constraints and tensor dropout can be used in machine learning. The approach is found to outperform other tensor-network-based methods in Fashion-MNIST image classification. A low-rank TTN classifier with branching ratio $b=4$ reaches a test set accuracy of 90.3\% with low computation costs. Consisting of mostly linear elements, tensor network classifiers avoid the vanishing gradient problem of deep neural networks. The CP rank constraints have additional advantages: The number of parameters can be decreased and tuned more freely to control overfitting, improve generalization properties, and reduce computation costs. They allow us to employ trees with large branching ratios, substantially improving the representation power.

Title: Hyperballistic transport in dense systems of charged particles under ac electric fields
Authors: Daniele Gamba, Bingyu Cui, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: The Langevin equation is ubiquitously employed to numerically simulate plasmas, colloids and electrolytes. However, the usual assumption of white noise becomes untenable when the system is subject to an external AC electric field. This is because the charged particles in the system, which provide the thermal bath for the particle transport, become themselves responsive to the AC field and the thermal noise is field-dependent and non-Markovian. We theoretically study the particle diffusivity in a Langevin transport model for a tagged charged particle immersed in a dense system of charged particles (plus also, possibly, other neutral particles) that act as the thermal bath, under an external AC electric field. This is done by properly accounting for the effects of the AC field on the thermal bath statistics. We analytically derive the time-dependent generalized diffusivity $D(t)$ for different initial conditions. The generalized diffusivity exhibits damped oscillatory-like behaviour with initial very large peaks, where the generalized diffusion coefficient is enhanced by orders of magnitude with respect to the infinite-time steady-state value. The latter coincides with the Stokes-Einstein diffusivity in the absence of external field. For initial conditions where the external field is already on at $t=0$ and the system is thermalized under DC conditions for $t \leq 0$, the short-time behaviour is hyperballistic, $MSD \sim t^4$ (where MSD is the mean-squared displacement), leading to giant enhancement of the particle transport. Finally, the theory elucidates the role of medium polarization on the local Lorentz field, and allows for estimates of the effective electric charge due to polarization by the surrounding charges.

Title: Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo for computing observables
Authors: Mancheon Han, Hyowon Park, Sangkook Choi
Abstract: The recent development of logical quantum processors marks a pivotal transition from the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era to the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era. These devices have the potential to address classically challenging problems with polynomial computational time using quantum properties. However, they remain susceptible to noise, necessitating noise resilient algorithms. We introduce Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo (QZMC), a classical-quantum hybrid algorithm that demonstrates resilience to device noise and Trotter errors while showing polynomial computational cost for a gapped system. QZMC computes static and dynamic properties without requiring initial state overlap or variational parameters, offering reduced quantum circuit depth.

Title: Chiral Virasoro algebra from a single wavefunction
Authors: Isaac H. Kim, Xiang Li, Ting-Chun Lin, John McGreevy, Bowen Shi
Abstract: Chiral edges of 2+1D systems can have very robust emergent conformal symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical predictions.

Title: A minimal scenario for the origin of non-equilibrium order
Authors: Riccardo Ravasio, Kabir Husain, Constantine G. Evans, Rob Phillips, Marco Ribezzi, Jack W. Szostak, Arvind Murugan
Abstract: Life uses non-equilibrium mechanisms to create ordered structures not attainable at equilibrium; the resulting order is assumed to provide functional benefits that outweigh costs of time and energy needed by these mechanisms. Here, we show that models of DNA replication and self-assembly, when expanded to include known stalling effects, can evolve error correcting mechanisms like kinetic proofreading and dynamic instability through selection for fast replication alone. We abstract these results into a general framework that predicts a counterintuitive ''order through speed'' effect if the distribution of replication times is wide enough. We test our results against recent mutational screens of proofreading polymerases. Our work suggests the intriguing possibility that non-equilibrium order can evolve even before that order is directly functional, with consequences for the evolution of mutation rates, viral capsid assembly, and the origin of life.

Title: Bootstrapping frustrated magnets: the fate of the chiral ${\rm O}(N)\times {\rm O}(2)$ universality class
Authors: Marten Reehorst, Slava Rychkov, Benoit Sirois, Balt C. van Rees
Abstract: We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d < 4$. Our results show that $N_c> 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.

Title: Long-Range Quantum Tunneling via Matter Wave
Authors: Yuan-Xing Yang, Si-Yuan Bai, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: Quantum tunneling is a quantum phenomenon in which a microscopic object crosses through a potential barrier even if its energy cannot overcome the barrier. A general belief is that tunneling occurs only when the barrier width is comparable to, or smaller than the de Broglie's wavelength of the object. Here, we study the tunneling of an ultracold atom among $N$ far-separated trapping potentials in a state-selective optical lattice and present a mechanism to realize long-range tunneling. We find that, mediated by the propagating matter wave emitted from the atom, coherent tunneling of the atom to the remote lattices occurs as long as bound states are present in the energy spectrum of the system formed by the atom and its matter wave. Going beyond the Markovian approximation, and breaking through the conventional distance constraint, our result opens another avenue to realizing tunneling and gives a guideline to developing tunneling devices.

Title: Quantum noise induced nonreciprocity for single photon transport in parity-time symmetric systems
Authors: Dibyendu Roy, G. S. Agarwal
Abstract: We show nonreciprocal light propagation for single-photon inputs due to quantum noise in coupled optical systems with gain and loss. We consider two parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric linear optical systems consisting of either two directly coupled resonators or two finite-length waveguides evanescently coupled in parallel. One resonator or waveguide is filled with an active gain medium and the other with a passive loss medium. The light propagation is reciprocal in such $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric linear systems without quantum noise. We show here that light transmission becomes nonreciprocal when we include quantum noises in our modeling, which is essential for a proper physical description. The quantum nonreciprocity is especially pronounced in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken phase. Transmitted light intensity in the waveguide of incidence is asymmetric for two waveguides even without noise. Quantum noise significantly enhances such asymmetry in the broken phase.

Title: Random unitaries in extremely low depth
Authors: Thomas Schuster, Jonas Haferkamp, Hsin-Yuan Huang
Abstract: We prove that random quantum circuits on any geometry, including a 1D line, can form approximate unitary designs over $n$ qubits in $\log n$ depth. In a similar manner, we construct pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) in 1D circuits in $\text{poly}(\log n)$ depth, and in all-to-all-connected circuits in $\text{poly}(\log \log n)$ depth. In all three cases, the $n$ dependence is optimal and improves exponentially over known results. These shallow quantum circuits have low complexity and create only short-range entanglement, yet are indistinguishable from unitaries with exponential complexity. Our construction glues local random unitaries on $\log n$-sized or $\text{poly}(\log n)$-sized patches of qubits to form a global random unitary on all $n$ qubits. In the case of designs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing constructions of approximate unitary $k$-designs, and hence also inherit an optimal scaling in $k$. In the case of PRUs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing PRU constructions. Applications of our results include proving that classical shadows with 1D log-depth Clifford circuits are as powerful as those with deep circuits, demonstrating superpolynomial quantum advantage in learning low-complexity physical systems, and establishing quantum hardness for recognizing phases of matter with topological order.

Title: Exact projected entangled pair ground states with topological Euler invariant
Authors: Thorsten B. Wahl, Wojciech J. Jankowski, Adrien Bouhon, Gaurav Chaudhary, Robert-Jan Slager
Abstract: We report on a class of gapped projected entangled pair states (PEPS) with non-trivial Euler topology motivated by recent progress in band geometry. In the non-interacting limit, these systems have optimal conditions relating to saturation of quantum geometrical bounds, allowing for parent Hamiltonians whose lowest bands are completely flat and which have the PEPS as unique ground states. Protected by crystalline symmetries, these states evade restrictions on capturing tenfold-way topological features with gapped PEPS. These PEPS thus form the first tensor network representative of a non-interacting, gapped two-dimensional topological phase, similar to the Kitaev chain in one dimension. Using unitary circuits, we then formulate interacting variants of these PEPS and corresponding gapped parent Hamiltonians. We reveal characteristic entanglement features shared between the free-fermionic and interacting states with Euler topology. Our results hence provide a rich platform of PEPS models that have, unexpectedly, a finite topological invariant, forming the basis for new spin liquids, quantum Hall physics, and quantum information pursuits.

Title: Efficient algorithms for surface density of states in topological photonic and acoustic systems
Authors: Yi-Xin Sha, Ming-Yao Xia, Ling Lu, Yi Yang
Abstract: Topological photonics and acoustics have recently garnered wide research interests for their topological ability to manipulate the light and sound at surfaces. Conventionally, the supercell technique is the standard approach to calculating these boundary effects, whereas it consumes increasingly large computational resources as the supercell size grows. Additionally, it falls short in differentiating the surface states at opposite boundaries and from bulk states due to the finite size of systems. To overcome the limitations, here we provide two complementary efficient methods for obtaining the ideal topological surface states of a semi-infinite system. The first one is the cyclic reduction method, which is based on iteratively inverting the Hamiltonian for a single unit cell, and the other is the transfer matrix method, which relies on the eigenanalysis of a transfer matrix for a pair of unit cells. Benchmarks show that, compared to the traditional supercell method, the cyclic reduction method can reduce both memory and time consumption by two orders of magnitude; the transfer matrix method can reduce memory by an order of magnitude, take less than half the time, and achieve high accuracy. Our methods are applicable to more complex scenarios, such as coated structures, heterostructures, and sandwiched structures. As examples, the surface-density-of-states spectra of photonic Chern insulators, valley photonic crystals, and acoustic topological insulators are demonstrated. Our computational schemes enable direct comparisons with near-field scanning measurements and expedite the exploration of topological artificial materials and the design of topological devices.

Title: From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe
Authors: G.E. Volovik
Abstract: The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.

Title: Designing Majorana Quasiparticles in InAsP Quantum Dots in InP Nanowires with Variational Quantum Eigenvalue Solver
Authors: Mahan Mohseni, Iann Cunha, Daniel Miravet, Alina Wania Rodrigues, Hassan Allami, Ibsal Assi, Marek Korkusinski, Pawel Hawrylak
Abstract: This work presents steps toward the design of Majorana zero modes (MZM) in InAsP quantum dots (QD) embedded in an InP semiconducting nanowire in contact with a p-type superconductor described by the Kitaev Hamiltonian. The single particle spectrum is obtained from million atom atomistic calculations with QNANO and many-electron spectra using exact diagonalization (ED) and the hybrid Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) method. A variational ansatz is constructed to capture the ground state of the system by utilizing a generalized form of the analytical solution for a particular set of parameters. By systematically deviating from the analytically solvable regime while maintaining the system in the topological phase (TP), the effectiveness of the variational function in reproducing the correct ground state and topological properties of the system is evaluated. This is done through a quantum algorithm for a many-body state containing MZM. The results are compared with exact solution in topological phase and demonstrate the capability of VQE, along with classical simulations, to accurately model the many-body spectra in topologically nontrivial state.

Title: Symmetry-Agnostic Topology Optimization Framework for Photonic-Crystal Structures
Authors: Aditya Bahulikar, Feng Wang, Mustafa Cenk Gursoy, Rodrick Kuate Defo
Abstract: We present a symmetry-agnostic topology optimization framework for photonic-crystal structures based on computation of the photonic density of states in a manner analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration. We provide a generalization of the approach that allows for computations at different scales with the additional scales being analogous to integration over the full Brillouin zone and to regimes between the two limiting cases of full Brillouin-zone integration and $\Gamma$-point integration, though these other scales do not preserve the symmetry-agnostic nature of the $\Gamma$-point framework. We also demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to the problem of inverting photonic or phononic bandstructures and to the treatment of the frequency-dependent optical response of materials. Finally, we show that at the symmetry-agnostic scale analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration, we can recover a known two-dimensional photonic crystal for the TM polarization. A key insight of our work is the determination of the minimum supercell size and the minimum precision to which the frequencies within the photonic bandgap must be sampled in order to observe photonic-crystal structures.

Title: Parisi-Sourlas Supertranslation and Scale without Conformal symmetry
Authors: Yu Nakayama
Abstract: Inspired by the possibility of emergent supersymmetry in critical random systems, we study a field theory model with a quartic potential of one superfield, possessing the Parisi-Sourlas supertranslation symmetry. Within perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion, we find nine non-trivial scale invariant renormalization group fixed points, but only one of them is conformal. We, however, believe scale invariance without conformal invariance cannot occur without a sophisticated mechanism because it predicts the existence of a non-conserved but non-renormalized vector operator called virial current, whose existence must be non-generic. We show that the virial current in this model is related to the supercurrent by supertranslation. The supertranslation Ward-Takahashi identity circumvents the genericity argument, explaining its non-renormalization property.

Title: On Intersecting Conformal Defects
Authors: Tom Shachar
Abstract: We study the physics of 2 and 3 mutually intersecting conformal defects forming wedges and corners in general dimension. For 2 defects we derive the beta function of the edge interactions for infinite and semi-infinite wedges and study them in the tricritical model in $d=3-\epsilon$ as an example. We discuss the dependency of the edge anomalous dimension on the intersection angle, connecting to an old issue known in the literature. Additionally, we study trihedral corners formed by 3 planes and compute the corner anomalous dimension, which can be considered as a higher-dimensional analog of the cusp anomalous dimension. We also study 3-line corners related to the three-body potential of point-like impurities.

Title: All 4 x 4 solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation
Authors: Marius de Leeuw, Vera Posch
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.

Title: Enhancing Dynamic Range of Sub-Quantum-Limit Measurements via Quantum Deamplification
Authors: Qi Liu, Ming Xue, Xinwei Li, Denis V. Vasilyev, Ling-Na Wu, Vladan Vuletić
Abstract: Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large dynamic range is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends dynamic range at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of dynamic range is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.

Abstract: We carefully review the hierarchical construction by Bouch [Bouch2015] of trees on the square lattice that can be grown from its root in $L!/C^L$ distinct ways, where $L$ denotes the number of bonds constituting the tree, and $C>1$ is a constant. (As discussed in Section IV.A of [ParkerCaoAvdoshkinScaffidiAltman2019] and Appendix A.3 of [ShiraishiTasaki2024], this result has an implication on the operator growth in quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions.)

Title: Luminescent Trityl-based Diradicaloids: A Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Charge-Resonance in Low-Lying Excited States
Authors: Davide Mesto, Michele Orza, Brunella Bardi, Angela Punzi, Imma Ratera, Jaume Veciana, Gianluca Farinola, Anna Painelli, Francesca Terenziani, Davide Blasi, Fabrizia Negri
Abstract: The tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicals and diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low-lying excited states by fine-tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM-derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation on TTM-derived diradicals to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis focuses on a series of symmetric TTM-derived diradicals with singlet ground state, featuring radical moieties linked by pi-conjugated spacers of different length. The nature of the lowest excited electronic states that control their photophysical behaviour is discussed in detail. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM-TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The lowest excited states of the diradicals differ qualitatively from those of TTM: two novel low-lying states emerge in the diradical, due to charge resonance (CR) between the two radical units. The lowest CR state is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue-shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM-ph-TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM-derived diradicals

Title: Flat Bands and Compact Localised States: A Carrollian roadmap
Authors: Nisa Ara, Aritra Banerjee, Rudranil Basu, Bhagya Krishnan
Abstract: We show how Carrollian symmetries become important in the construction of one-dimensional fermionic systems with all flat-band spectra from first principles. The key ingredient of this construction is the identification of Compact Localised States (CLSs), which appear naturally by demanding $\textit{supertranslation}$ invariance of the system. We use CLS basis states, with inherent $\textit{ultra-local}$ correlations, to write down an interacting theory which shows a non-trivial phase structure and an emergent Carroll conformal symmetry at the gapless points. We analyze this theory in detail for both zero and finite chemical potential.
