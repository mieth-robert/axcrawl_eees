Title: Phonon Induced Energy Relaxation in Quantum Critical Metals
Authors: Haoyu Guo, Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: Metals at the brink of electronic quantum phase transitions display high-temperature superconductivity, competing orders, and unconventional charge transport, revealing strong departures from conventional Fermi liquid behavior. Investigation of these fascinating intertwined phenomena has been at the center of research across a variety of correlated materials over the past many decades. A ubiquitous experimental observation is the emergence of a universal timescale that governs electrical transport and momentum relaxation. In this work, we analyze an equally important theoretical question of how the energy contained in the electronic degrees of freedom near a quantum phase transition relaxes to the environment via their coupling to acoustic phonons. Assuming that the bottleneck for energy dissipation is controlled by the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and acoustic phonons, we present a universal theory of the temperature dependence of the energy relaxation rate in a marginal Fermi liquid. We find that the energy relaxation rate exhibits a complex set of temperature-dependent crossovers controlled by emergent energy scales in the problem. We place these results in the context of recent measurements of the energy relaxation rate via non-linear optical spectroscopy in the normal state of hole-doped cuprates.

Title: Superfluid Weight of Inhomogeneous Superconductors
Authors: Jonathan Schirmer, Enrico Rossi
Abstract: In this work, we obtain the expression, within the linear response approximation, of the superfluid weight of a superconductor, taking into account the response of the superconductor's pairing potential to the perturbing vector potential. We find that, in general, the correction is non-zero when the system is spatially non-uniform. We apply the formula to two exemplary cases: the case when strong inhomogeneities in the pairing potential are induced by a periodic potential, and the case when superconducting vortices are induced by an external magnetic field. For both cases we show that the correction to the superfluid weight due to the response of the paring potential to the perturbing vector potential can be significant, it must be included to obtain quantitatively correct results, and that for the case when vortices are present the expression of the superfluid weight that does not include such correction returns qualitatively wrong results.

Title: SDW driven "magnetic breakdown" in a d-wave altermagnet KV$_2$Se$_2$O
Authors: Xu Yan, Ziyin Song, Juntao Song, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng, Quansheng Wu
Abstract: Altermagnets, combining zero net magnetization with intrinsic spin splitting, demonstrate unique quantum phenomena crucial for spintronic applications. KV$_2$Se$_2$O is proven to be a d-wave altermagnet with phase transition from a checkerboard-type (C-type) antiferromagnetic (AFM) state to a spin density wave (SDW) state as the temperature decreases. After phase transition, the apparent paradox emerges where angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) reveals negligible Fermi surface modifications, while physical property measurement system (PPMS) measurements uncover substantial changes in transport properties. Our study explores the microscopic mechanisms governing phase-dependent transport properties of KV$_2$Se$_2$O base on first-principles calculations. The spin canting driven by periodic spin modulation in the SDW phase reduces the magnetic symmetry of KV$_2$Se$_2$O. The resultant band degeneracy lifting and Fermi surface reconstruction induce the ``magnetic breakdown" phenomenon, which alters carrier trajectories, modifies carrier concentration, strengthens electron-hole compensation, and ultimately accounts for the contrasting magnetic-field-dependent Hall resistivity relative to the C-type AFM state. Our work proposes an innovative method for identifying the electronic structure evolution across phase transitions from transport signatures, providing a novel paradigm for altermagnets research.

Title: Materials discovery acceleration by using condition generative methodology
Authors: Caiyuan Ye, Yuzhi Wang, Xintian Xie, Tiannian Zhu, Jiaxuan Liu, Yuqing He, Lili Zhang, Junwei Zhang, Zhong Fang, Lei Wang, Zhipan Liu, Hongming Weng, Quansheng Wu
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, generative models have been increasingly employed in the exploration of novel materials. By integrating traditional computational approaches such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD), existing generative models, including diffusion models and autoregressive models, have demonstrated remarkable potential in the discovery of novel materials. However, their efficiency in goal-directed materials design remains suboptimal. In this work we developed a highly transferable, efficient and robust conditional generation framework, PODGen, by integrating a general generative model with multiple property prediction models. Based on PODGen, we designed a workflow for the high-throughput crystals conditional generation which is used to search new topological insulators (TIs). Our results show that the success rate of generating TIs using our framework is 5.3 times higher than that of the unconstrained approach. More importantly, while general methods rarely produce gapped TIs, our framework succeeds consistently, highlighting an effectively $\infty$ improvement. This demonstrates that conditional generation significantly enhances the efficiency of targeted material discovery. Using this method, we generated tens of thousands of new topological materials and conducted further first-principles calculations on those with promising application potential. Furthermore, we identified promising, synthesizable topological (crystalline) insulators such as CsHgSb, NaLaB$_{12}$, Bi$_4$Sb$_2$Se$_3$, Be$_3$Ta$_2$Si and Be$_2$W.

Title: EuAuSb: A helical variation on altermagnetism

Tranquada (1) ((1) Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science Division, Brookhaven National Laboratory, (2) Department of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, Stony Brook University, (3) Neutron Scattering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, (4) Department of Physics and Astronomy, Stony Brook University)
Abstract: EuAuSb is a triangular-lattice Dirac semimetal in which a topological Hall effect has been observed to develop in association with a magnetically-ordered phase. Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements have identified an incommensurate helical order in which individual ferromagnetic Eu$^{2+}$ layers rotate in-plane by $\sim$120$^{\circ}$ from one layer to the next. An in-plane magnetic field distorts the incommensurate order, eventually leading to a first order transition to a state that is approximately commensurate and that is continuously polarized as the bulk magnetization approaches saturation. From an analysis of the magnetic diffraction intensities versus field, we find evidence for a dip in the ordered in-plane moment at the same field where the topological Hall effect is a maximum, and we propose that this is due to field-induced quantum spin fluctuations. Our electronic structure calculations yield exchange constants compatible with the helical order and show that the bands near the Fermi level lose their spin degeneracy. The occurrence of spin-split bands in a magnetically ordered state with compensated moments suggests that this should be considered a helical flavor of altermagnetism.

Title: Josephson Diode Effect from Nonequilibrium Current in a Superconducting Interferometer
Authors: Daniel Shaffer, Songci Li, Jaglul Hasan, Mikhail Titov, Alex Levchenko
Abstract: We investigate the Josephson diode effect in a superconducting interferometer under nonequilibrium conditions. In contrast to its thermodynamic counterpart, which requires the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetry, we demonstrate that a diode-like asymmetry of the critical current can emerge solely due to a dissipative current in the normal region of an otherwise symmetric Josephson junction. This effect is driven entirely by the nonequilibrium conditions, without the need for additional inversion symmetry breaking. Using the standard quasiclassical Keldysh Green's function formalism, we explicitly calculate the diode coefficient from the supercurrent-phase relation of the interferometer. Remarkably, within certain ranges of control parameters, such as applied voltage, temperature, and the geometric aspect ratio of the device, the diode coefficient can exceed its nominal perfect value.

Title: Nonlinear thermoelectric effects as a means to probe quantum geometry
Authors: Xu Yang, Brian Skinner
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor, which has the quantum metric and Berry curvature as its real and imaginary parts, plays a key role in the transport properties of condensed matter systems. In the nonlinear regime, the quantum metric dipole and Berry curvature dipole provide two distinct mechanisms for generating nonlinear Hall effects, which can both be experimentally observed in systems with suitable symmetries. In this work, we investigate the role of quantum geometry in nonlinear thermoelectric responses. We derive a series of nonlinear thermoelectric effects governed by the Berry curvature dipole and the quantum metric dipole, respectively. Among them, we identify a particularly interesting quantized thermoelectric response that directly measures the total chirality of Weyl points below the Fermi level. For general nonlinear responses, we derive the nonlinear analogs of the Wiedemann-Franz law and Mott's formula. These provide a means to estimate the magnitude of nonlinear thermoelectric responses based on existing nonlinear Hall measurements. Our estimates suggest that these effects should be observable in several candidate materials, with In-doped Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te standing out as the most promising. Our work offers new insights into the experimental study of quantum geometry through nonlinear thermoelectric measurements.

Title: Contemporary tensor network approaches to gapless and topological phases in an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder
Authors: Yuma Watanabe, Ravindra W. Chhajlany, Maciej Lewenstein, Tobias Graß, Utso Bhattacharya
Abstract: The development of numerically efficient computational methods has facilitated in depth studies of various correlated phases of matter including critical and topological phases. A quantum Monte-Carlo study of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder has recently been used to identify an exotic phase with hidden order, where superfluid correlations coexist with string order, dubbed a Haldane superfluid (HSF). However, finite-size methods can struggle to uniquely determine the boundaries of quasi-long-range ordered states with nonlocal, e.g. string-like, correlations. In the present Letter, we revisit the HSF scenario using tensor network algorithms specialized for finite/infinite (quasi-)1D systems, \textit{i.e.} the well-governed finite-size density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and the state-of-the-art infinite-size variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) methods. While DMRG results extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit are compatible with a putative HSF, the results from the VUMPS calculations provide sharper phase boundaries that leave no room for such a topological superfluid. Our results demonstrate the crucial advantage of the VUMPS in characterizing topological and critical interacting phases providing the precise phase boundaries.

Title: Rare Trajectories in a Prototypical Mean-field Disordered Model: Insights into Landscape and Instantons
Authors: Patrick Charbonneau, Giampaolo Folena, Enrico M. Malatesta, Tommaso Rizzo, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first- order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.

Title: Interlayer Coupling-Induced Quantum Phase Transition in Quantum Anomalous Hall Multilayers
Authors: Ling-Jie Zhou, Deyi Zhuo, Ruobing Mei, Yi-Fan Zhao, Kaijie Yang, Ruoxi Zhang, Zijie Yan, Han Tay, Moses H. W. Chan, Chao-Xing Liu, Cui-Zu Chang
Abstract: A quantum phase transition arises from competition between different ground states and is typically accessed by varying a single physical parameter near absolute zero temperature. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect with high Chern number C has recently been achieved in magnetic topological insulator (TI) multilayers. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI penta-layers by varying the thickness of the middle magnetic TI layer, designated as m quintuple layers. Electrical transport measurements demonstrate a quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states. For m 1 and m 2, the sample exhibits the well-quantized C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states, respectively. For 1 m 2, we observe a monotonic decrease in Hall resistance from h/e2 to h/2e2 with increasing m, accompanied by a peak in the longitudinal resistance. The quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states is attributed to the weakening of the interlayer coupling between the top and the bottom C = 1 QAH layers. Our findings provide a scalable strategy for engineering QAH devices with a tunable Chern number. This approach enables precise control and enhanced functionality in chiral edge current-based electronic devices.

Title: Symmetry induced pairing in dark excitonic condensate at finite temperature
Authors: Adham Alkady, Anatoly B. Kuklov
Abstract: Bose Einstein condensate of optically inactive (dark) intervalley excitons must be inherently multi-component because of the point group and the time-reversal symmetries of a crystal. Accordingly, a number of the condensate components N$_v$ is determined by the symmetry. Since the valleys hosting such excitons are separated by large quasi-momenta, the minimal inter-component Josephson-type coupling can only be established between pairs of excitons from the time-reversed valleys. As a result, a paired condensate can emerge at finite temperature, that is, the phase where individual valleys are not characterized by the condensate order, while the order exists for the pairs from the time-reversed valleys. This prediction follows from the elementary mean field analysis regardless of the dimensionality. However, as Monte Carlo simulations show, no such a phase exists in 3D crystals. Instead, the N$_v$-component condensation proceeds as the Ist order transition from the normal state. The paired phase does exist in 2D for N$_v\geq 6$. It forms by Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition from the high temperature (normal) phase. Upon further lowering temperature, a second transition transforms the paired phase into the N$_v$-component condensate.

Abstract: Two dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors are a new class of quantum materials for studying the emergent physics of excitons and spins in the 2D limit. Twist engineering provides a powerful tool to manipulate the fundamental properties of 2D vdW materials. Here, we show that twist engineering of the anisotropic ferromagnetic monolayer semiconductor, CrSBr, leads to bilayer magnetic semiconductors with continuously tunable magnetic moment, dielectric anisotropy, exciton energy and linear dichroism. We furthermore provide a model for exciton energy in the media with tunable anisotropy. These results advance fundamental studies on 2D vdW materials and open doors to applications to nano-optics, twistronics, and spintronics.

Abstract: Electronic-structure theory is the foundation of the description of materials including multiscale modeling of their properties and functions. Obviously, without sufficient accuracy at the base, reliable predictions are unlikely at any level that follows. The software package FHI-aims has proven to be a game changer for accurate free-energy calculations because of its scalability, numerical precision, and its efficient handling of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and van der Waals interactions. It treats molecules, clusters, and extended systems (solids and liquids) on an equal footing. Besides DFT, FHI-aims also includes quantum-chemistry methods, descriptions for excited states and vibrations, and calculations of various types of transport. Recent advancements address the integration of FHI-aims into an increasing number of workflows and various artificial intelligence (AI) methods. This Roadmap describes the state-of-the-art of FHI-aims and advancements that are currently ongoing or planned.

Title: Expanding Active Matter to the Third Dimension: Exploring Short and Long-Range Particle-Wall Interactions
Authors: Sandeep Ramteke, Jordan Dehmel, Touvia Miloh, Jarrod Schiffbauer, Alicia Boymelgreen
Abstract: Most active colloid experiments are quasi-2D. Here a 3D density-matched solution of active particles propelled and aligned with an AC electric field uniquely facilitates measurement of short and long-range particle-wall interactions. Near-wall mobility is reduced by Stokes drag and local electric-field distortion. Long-range attractions concentrate particles at upper and lower walls at a ratio dependent on particle orientation and rate proportional to speed and confinement. This approach may be extended to other active systems to understand particle-wall interactions and non-equilibrium phenomena.

Title: Thermodynamic potentials from a probabilistic view on the system-environment interaction energy
Authors: Mohammad Rahbar, Christopher J. Stein
Abstract: In open systems with strong coupling, the interaction energy between the system and the environment is significant, so thermodynamic quantities cannot be reliably obtained by traditional statistical mechanics methods. The Hamiltonian of mean force $\mathcal{H}^{*}_{\beta}$ offers an in principle accurate theoretical basis by explicitly accounting for the interaction energy. However, calculating the Hamiltonian of mean force is challenging both theoretically and computationally. We demonstrate that when the condition $\text{Var}_{\mathcal{E}_0} (e^{-\beta {V}_{\mathcal{SE}}}) = 0$ is met, the dependence of thermodynamic variables can be shifted from $\{P_{\beta}(x_{\mathcal{S}}), \mathcal{H}^{*}_{\beta}(x_{\mathcal{S}})\}$ to $\{P_{\beta}(x_{\mathcal{S}}), P(V_{\mathcal{SE}})\}$. This change simplifies thermodynamic measurements. As a central result, we derive a general equality that holds for arbitrary coupling strengths and from which an inequality follows - aligned with Jensen's inequality applied to the Gibbs-Bogoliubov-Feynman bound. This equality, analogous in importance to the Jarzynski equality, offers deeper insight into free energy differences in strongly coupled systems. Finally, by combining our result with said Jarzynski equality, we derive additional relations that further clarify thermodynamic behavior in strongly coupled open systems.

Title: Dominant apical-oxygen electron-phonon coupling in HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+δ}$

Abstract: How electron-phonon interactions influence high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates remains contested, and their role outside the CuO$_2$ planes has been largely overlooked. The most conspicuous evidence for such coupling is the ubiquitous 70-meV dispersion kink seen by photoemission, yet its microscopic origin is still debated. Here we use oxygen-$K$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223). When both incident photon energy and polarization are tuned to the apical-oxygen $1s\!\rightarrow\!2p_z$ transition, the RIXS spectra exhibit a ladder of at least ten phonon overtones, evenly spaced by 70 meV, whose intensities follow a Franck-Condon envelope, signalling exceptionally strong electron-phonon coupling. Quantitative modelling that incorporates core-hole lifetime evaluation yields an apical-phonon coupling energy of 0.25(1) eV, significantly larger than that of the planar stretching mode. Such a coupling strength offers a strong contender for explaining the universal 70-meV kink and suggests that the dominant electron-phonon channel resides outside the CuO$_2$ planes. By elevating inter-layer lattice dynamics from a peripheral factor to a central actor, our results provide a fresh starting point for theories seeking to reconcile strong correlations, lattice dynamics and high-temperature superconductivity.

Title: Wilson polygons and the topology of zero-dimensional systems
Authors: Gen Yin, Rameswar Bhattacharjee, Miklos Kertesz
Abstract: We show that zero-dimensional (0-D) systems can host non-trivial topology analogous to macroscopic topological materials in greater dimensions. Unlike macroscopic periodic systems with translational symmetry, zero-dimensional materials such as molecules, clusters and quantum dots can exhibit discrete rotation symmetry. The eigenstates can thus be grouped into discrete bands and Bloch-like wave functions. Since the symmetry is discrete, the Berry phase and the topological indices must be defined by discrete Wilson polygons. Here, we demonstrate non-trivial Z2 orders in two representative 0-D molecules, [m]-Cycloparaphenylene and [m]-iso-thianaphthene, where topological transitions occur when modifying the coupling between the repeating units. Similar to macroscopic topological systems in greater dimensions, localized boundary states emerge in composite nanohoops formed by segments that are topologically distinct. This opens up the possibility of non-trivial topological phases in 0-D systems.

Title: Explorative Curriculum Learning for Strongly Correlated Electron Systems
Authors: Kimihiro Yamazaki, Takuya Konishi, Yoshinobu Kawahara
Abstract: Recent advances in neural network quantum states (NQS) have enabled high-accuracy predictions for complex quantum many-body systems such as strongly correlated electron systems. However, the computational cost remains prohibitive, making exploration of the diverse parameters of interaction strengths and other physical parameters inefficient. While transfer learning has been proposed to mitigate this challenge, achieving generalization to large-scale systems and diverse parameter regimes remains difficult. To address this limitation, we propose a novel curriculum learning framework based on transfer learning for NQS. This facilitates efficient and stable exploration across a vast parameter space of quantum many-body systems. In addition, by interpreting NQS transfer learning through a perturbative lens, we demonstrate how prior physical knowledge can be flexibly incorporated into the curriculum learning process. We also propose Pairing-Net, an architecture to practically implement this strategy for strongly correlated electron systems, and empirically verify its effectiveness. Our results show an approximately 200-fold speedup in computation and a marked improvement in optimization stability compared to conventional methods.

Title: Altermagnetic band splitting in 10 nm epitaxial CrSb thin films
Authors: Sandra Santhosh, Yongxi Ou, Supriya Ghosh, Paul Corbae, Wilson J. Yanez-Parreno, Alexei V. Fedorov, Makoto Hashimoto, Donghui Lu, Christopher J. Jensen, Julie A. Borchers, Alexander J. Grutter, Timothy R. Charlton, Anthony Richardella, K. Andre Mkhoyan, Christopher J. Palmstrøm, Nitin Samarth
Abstract: Altermagnets are a newly identified family of collinear antiferromagnets with momentum-dependent spin-split band structure of non-relativistic origin, derived from spin-group symmetry-protected crystal structures. Among candidate altermagnets, CrSb is attractive for potential applications because of a large spin-splitting near the Fermi level and a high Neel transition temperature of around 700 K. We use molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize CrSb (0001) thin films with thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm. Structural characterization, using reflection high energy electron diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, demonstrates the growth of epitaxial films with good crystallinity. Polarized neutron reflectometry shows the absence of any net magnetization, consistent with antiferromagnetic order. In vacuo angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements probe the band structure in a previously unexplored regime of film thickness, down to 10 nm. These ARPES measurements show a three-dimensional momentum-dependent band splitting of up to 1 eV with g-wave symmetry, consistent with that seen in prior studies of bulk single crystals. The distinct altermagnetic band structure required for potential spin-transport applications survives down to the 10 nm thin film limit at room temperature.

Title: Revisiting the physical properties of (LaS)1+d(NbS2) misfit-layered compounds
Authors: Masanori Nagao, Dan Mouri, Yuki Maruyama, Akira Miura, Yoshihiko Takano, Satoshi Watauchi
Abstract: Electrical transport in polycrystalline and single-crystalline (LaS)1+d(NbS2) misfit-layered compounds was measured. Polycrystalline samples were synthesized using S raw materials of different purities (2N or 6N), and single-crystalline samples were grown using two types of transport agents (2NH4Cl+PbCl2 or NH4Cl) via the chemical vapor transport method. The temperature dependence on resistivity dropped at 1.3-2.0 K for some of the samples, which might be affected by the unknown impurity. (LaS)1+d(NbS2) misfit-layered compounds for the main phase of those obtained samples exhibited no superconductivity above 0.2 K by the resistivity measurement.

Title: Emergent Synaptic Plasticity from Tunable Dynamics of Probabilistic Bits
Authors: Sagnik Banerjee, Shiva T. Konakanchi, Supriyo Datta, Pramey Upadhyaya
Abstract: Probabilistic (p-) computing, which leverages the stochasticity of its building blocks (p-bits) to solve a variety of computationally hard problems, has recently emerged as a promising physics-inspired hardware accelerator platform. A functionality of importance for p-computers is the ability to program-and reprogram-the interaction strength between arbitrary p-bits on-chip. In natural systems subject to random fluctuations, it is known that spatiotemporal noise can interact with the system's nonlinearities to render useful functionalities. Leveraging that principle, here we introduce a novel scheme for tunable coupling that inserts a ''hidden'' p-bit between each pair of computational p-bits. By modulating the fluctuation rate of the hidden p-bit relative to the synapse speed, we demonstrate both numerically and analytically that the effective interaction between the computational p-bits can be continuously tuned. Moreover, this tunability is directional, where the effective coupling from one computational p-bit to another can be made different from the reverse. This synaptic-plasticity mechanism could open new avenues for designing (re-)configurable p-computers and may inspire novel algorithms that leverage dynamic, hardware-level tuning of stochastic interactions.

Title: A$_1$-A$_2$ splitting in pure $^3$He in nematic aerogel
Authors: V.V. Dmitriev, M.S. Kutuzov, D.V. Petrova, A.A. Soldatov, A.N. Yudin
Abstract: Here, we present the results of vibrating wire experiments in pure $^3$He (without $^4$He coverage) in nematic aerogel. We investigated the dependence of splitting of the superfluid transition temperature of $^3$He in aerogel on magnetic field. In addition to our previous work, we used a wider range of magnetic fields (up to 31 kOe) and managed to detect both the "upper" and "lower" superfluid transition temperatures. The solid paramagnetic $^3$He layer on the aerogel strands activates the magnetic scattering channel. According to theory, it should result in linear splitting at high ($\ge20$ kOe) fields, while at lower fields the splitting is expected to be nonlinear. We were able to observe this nonlinearity, but we have a discrepancy with theoretical predictions regarding the range of fields where nonlinearity occurs. Possible reasons for this are discussed.

Title: Non-reciprocal anti-aligning active mixtures: deriving the exact Boltzmann collision operator
Authors: Jakob Mihatsch, Thomas Ihle
Abstract: We consider the effect of non-reciprocity in a binary mixture of self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions, where a particle of type A reacts differently to a particle of type B than vice versa. Starting from a well-known microscopic Langevin-model for the particles, setting up the corresponding exact N-particle Fokker-Planck equation and making Boltzmann's assumptions of low density and one-sided molecular chaos, the non-linear active Boltzmann equation with the exact collision operator is derived. In this derivation, the effect of phase-space compression and the build-up of pair-correlations during binary interactions is explicitly taken into account, leading to a theoretical description beyond mean-field. This extends previous results for reciprocal interactions, where it was found that orientational order can emerge in a system with purely anti-aligning interactions. Although the equations of motion are more complex than in the reciprocal system, the theory still leads to analytical expressions and predictions. Comparisons with agent-based simulations show excellent quantitative agreement of the dynamic and static behavior in the low density and/or small coupling limit.

Title: Site-Percolation-Driven Ionic Conductivity in Random Substitutional Crystal
Authors: Rikuya Ishikawa, Kyohei Takae, Rei Kurita
Abstract: The design of superionic conductors for all-solid-state batteries often faces a fundamental trade-off between stability and ionic conductivity. Random Substitutional Crystals (RSCs), where atomic species are randomly distributed throughout a crystal lattice, present a promising route to overcome this competitive relation. Although extensive studies have focused on local ionic hopping, the role of mesoscale structural organization in determining macroscopic conductivity remains poorly understood, limiting the rational design of optimal compositions. Here, we systematically investigate the ionic conductivity of NaCl-type RSCs as a function of composition using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that ionic conductivity increases sharply once the carrier ion concentration exceeds a critical threshold, without disrupting the underlying crystal structure. Strikingly, this threshold aligns with the site percolation threshold predicted by percolation theory. Our findings establish ion percolation as a universal design principle that reconciles the trade-off between conductivity and stability, offering a simple and broadly applicable strategy for the development of robust, high-performance solid electrolytes.

Title: Tuning relaxation and nonlinear upconversion of valley-exciton-polaritons in a monolayer semiconductor
Authors: Hangyong Shan, Jamie M. Fitzgerald, Roberto Rosati, Gilbert Leibeling, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Seth Ariel Tongay, Falk Eilenberger, Martin Esmann, Sven Höfling, Ermin Malic, Christian Schneider
Abstract: Controlling exciton relaxation and energy conversion pathways via their coupling to photonic modes is a central task in cavity-mediated quantum materials research. In this context, the light-matter hybridization in optical cavities can lead to intriguing effects, such as modified carrier transport, enhancement of optical quantum yield, and control of chemical reaction pathways. Here, we investigate the impact of the strong light-matter coupling regime on energy conversion, both in relaxation and upconversion schemes, by utilizing a strongly charged MoSe2 monolayer embedded in a spectrally tunable open-access cavity. We find that the charge carrier gas yields a significantly modified photoluminescence response of cavity exciton-polaritons, dominated by an intra-cavity like pump scheme. In addition, upconversion luminescence emerges from a population transfer from fermionic trions to bosonic exciton-polaritons. Due to the availability of multiple optical modes in the tunable open cavity, it seamlessly meets the cavity-enhanced double resonance condition required for an efficient upconversion. The latter can be actively tuned via the cavity length in-situ, displaying nonlinear scaling in intensity and fingerprints of the valley polarization. This suggests mechanisms that include both trion-trion Auger scattering and phonon absorption as its underlying microscopic origin.

Abstract: By using molecular dynamics simulations, the research examine how copper and silver nanowires respond to tensile loading in order to clarify their nanoscale deformation mechanisms. The results demonstrate that these two metal nanowires follow notably different stress - strain trends, with silver wires exhibiting greater elastic stiffness and higher yield points at equivalent diameters - an effect likely rooted in silver's stronger atomic bonding and more stable microstructure. A pronounced size effect is observed: as the wire diameter diminishes, both the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength increase substantially, a behavior driven by the higher proportion of surface atoms that enhance dislocation nucleation and mobility. Atomistic analyses further underscore the dominant role of dislocations during plastic deformation, and in particular reveal that surface - initiated dislocations in thinner wires critically affect their fracture behavior.

Title: Characterizing the dissolution states of a fluorescent probe within a lipid bilayer using molec ular dynamics simulations
Authors: Ryo Okabe, Natsuumi Ito, Yuya Matsubara, Nozomi Morishita Watanabe, Hiroshi Umakoshi, Kento Kasahara, Nobuyuki Matubayasi
Abstract: The physicochemical properties of lipid bilayers (membranes) are closely associated with various cellular functions and are often evaluated using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. For instance, by employing fluorescent probes that exhibit spectra reflective of the surrounding membrane environment, one can estimate the membrane polarity. Thus, elucidating how such probes are dissolved within the membranes would be beneficial for enabling a deeper interpretation of the spectra. Here, we apply molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with an enhanced sampling method to investigate the dissolution state of 6-propionyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Prodan) within a membrane composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-\textit{sn}-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), as well as its variation upon the addition of ethanol as a cosolvent to the aqueous phase. In the absence of ethanol, it is found that the bulky moieties of Prodan (propionyl and dimethylamine groups) prefer to be oriented toward the membrane center owing to the voids existing near the center. The structural change in the membrane induced by the addition of ethanol causes a reduction in the void population near the center, resulting in a diminished orientation preference of Prodan.

Title: Effect of Ti$_2$Pd(Ni) on the Transformation Behavior in Sputtered Ti-rich TiNiPd Shape Memory Alloys
Authors: Lars Bumke (1), Niklas Wolff (2), Lorenz Kienle (2), Eckhard Quandt (1) ((1) Inorganic Functional Materials, Institute for Materials Science, Faculty of Engineering, Kiel University, Germany, (2) Synthesis and Real Structure, Institute for Materials Science, Faculty of Engineering, Kiel University, Germany)
Abstract: TiNiPd based shape memory alloys (SMAs) share similar microstructural features as TiNiCu-based SMAs known for their exceptional resistance to functional fatigue due to their high crystallographic compatibility, nanometer sized grains and coherent precipitates, making them an ideal system to further explore the critical factors influencing cyclic stability. In this study, we investigate the effect of heat treatments (500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C and 800 °C) on the cyclic stability and microstructure of free-standing, magnetron-sputtered Ti$_{53.6}$Ni$_{35.2}$Pd$_{11.2}$ films. All heat treatments promote the formation of Ti$_2$Pd(Ni) precipitates and result in a similar grain size (~1-4 $\mu$m). Lower heat treatment temperatures improve the cyclic stability of the stress induced transformation while reducing transformation temperatures and latent heat. Temperature dependent X-ray diffraction reveals a complex microstructure for the martensite phase with Ti$_2$Pd(Ni), Ti$_2$Ni(Pd), TiNiPd(B2), B19/B19$'$ and R-phase. The thermal phase transition changes from a distinct 1st order to a 2nd order like transition, accompanied by increasing amount of remanent austenite and R-phase, with nearly no change for the sample heat treated at 500 °C. In situ stress dependent X-ray diffraction demonstrates a significant difference between the temperature and stress induced phase transformation for this heat treatment. The observed semi crystalline microstructure, featuring nano domains of Ti$_2$Pd(Ni) precipitates in the sample heat-treated at 500 °C, leads to a mixture of long range martensitic and strain glass transition. This study highlights the impact of heat treatment and microstructure on the phase transformation behavior and functional fatigue in Ti-rich TiNiPd alloys.

Title: Approximate calculation of functional integrals arising from the operator approach
Authors: Edik Ayryan, Ján Buša, Michal Hnatič, Tomáš Lučivjanský, Victor Malyutin
Abstract: We apply the operator approach to a stochastic system belonging to a class of death-birth processes, which we introduce utilizing the master equation approach. By employing Doi- Peliti formalism we recast the master equation in the form of a Schrödinger-like equation. Therein appearing pseudo-Hamiltonian is conveniently expressed in a suitable Fock space, constructed using bosonic-like creation and annihilation operators. The kernel of the associated time evolution operator is rewritten using a functional integral, for which we propose an approximate method that allows its analytical treatment. The method is based on the expansion in eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian generating given functional integral. In this manner, we obtain approximate values for the probabilities of the system being in the first and second states for the case of the pure birth process.

Title: Photoengineering the Magnon Spectrum in an Insulating Antiferromagnet

Abstract: Femtosecond optical pulses have opened a new frontier in ultrafast dynamics, enabling direct access to fundamental interactions in quantum materials. In antiferromagnets (AFMs), where the fundamental quantum mechanical exchange interaction governs spin dynamics, this access is especially compelling, enabling the excitation of magnons - collective spin-wave modes - that naturally reach terahertz (THz) frequencies and supersonic velocities. Femtosecond optical pulses provided a route to coherently excite such magnons across the entire Brillouin zone. Controlling their spectral properties - such as the magnon gap and dispersion - represents the next monumental step, enabling dynamic tuning of group velocities, coherence, and interaction pathways. Yet, achieving this remains a challenge, requiring ultrafast and long-lasting manipulation of the underlying exchange interaction. Here, we show that in DyFeO3 - an insulating AFM with strongly coupled electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom - resonant above-bandgap optical excitation leads to a dramatic renormalization of the THz magnon spectrum, including a near-total collapse of the magnon gap. Our analysis reveals this transformation to be consistent with a transient reduction of the exchange interaction by nearly 90% in the near-surface nanoscale region. These findings establish a pathway for light-driven, nanoscale control of AFM spin dynamics, opening opportunities for reconfigurable, high-speed magnonic and spintronic applications.

Title: Field-theoretic Analysis of Dynamic Isotropic Percolation: Three-loop Approximation
Authors: Michal Hnatič, Matej Kecer, Mikhail V. Kompaniets, Tomáš Lučivjanský, Lukáš Mižišin, Yurii G. Molotkov
Abstract: The general epidemic process is a paradigmatic model in non-equilibrium statistical physics displaying a continuous phase transition between active and absorbing this http URL dynamic isotropic percolation universality class captures its universal properties, which we aim to quantitatively study by means of the field-theoretic formulation of the model augmented with a perturbative renormalization group analysis. The main purpose of this work consists in determining the critical dynamic exponent $z$ to the three-loop approximation. This allows us to finalize the quantitative description of the dynamic isotropic percolation class to this order of perturbation theory. The calculations are performed within the dimensional regularization with the minimal subtraction scheme and actual perturbative expansions are carried out in a formally small parameter $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon = 6 - d$ is a deviation from the upper critical dimension $d_c = 6$.

Abstract: Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are promising optical gain materials that require further threshold reduction to realize their full potential. While QD charging theoretically reduces the threshold to zero, its effectiveness has been limited by strong Auger recombination and unstable charging. Here we theoretically reveal the optimal combination of charging number and Auger recombination to minimize the lasing threshold. Experimentally, we develop stable self-charged perovskite quantum rods (QRs) as an alternative to QDs via state engineering and Mn-doping strategy. An unprecedented two-order-of-magnitude reduction in nonradiative Auger recombination enables QRs to support a sufficient charging number of up to 6. The QR liquid lasing is then achieved with a near-zero threshold of 0.098 using quasi-continuous pumping of nanosecond pulses, which is the lowest threshold among all reported QD lasers. These achievements demonstrate the potential of the specially engineered QRs as an excellent gain media and pave the way for their prospective applications.

Title: Accelerating two-dimensional tensor network contractions using QR-decompositions
Authors: Yining Zhang, Qi Yang, Philippe Corboz
Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tool for studying strongly correlated systems directly in the thermodynamic limit. A core component of the algorithm is the approximate contraction of the iPEPS, where the computational bottleneck typically lies in the singular value or eigenvalue decompositions involved in the renormalization step. This is particularly true on GPUs, where tensor contractions are substantially faster than these decompositions. Here we propose a contraction scheme for $C_{4v}$-symmetric tensor networks based on combining the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) with QR-decompositions which are substantially faster -- especially on GPUs. Our approach achieves up to two orders of magnitude speedup compared to standard CTMRG and yields state-of-the-art results for the Heisenberg and $J_1$-$J_2$ models in about one hour on an H100 GPU.

Title: Signatures of three-dimensional photo-induced superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$
Authors: M. Rosenberg, D. Nicoletti, M. Buzzi, A. Iudica, Y. Liu, B. Keimer, A. Cavalleri
Abstract: Resonant optical excitation of apical-oxygen phonon modes in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ has been shown to induce superconducting-like optical properties at temperatures far higher than the equilibrium $T_C$. All of the evidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz frequency $c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer coupling was seen to transform into an inductive response, reminiscent of a superconducting state, an assignement that was strengthened by recent measurements of ultrafast magnetic field expulsion. Here, we report the first experimental determination of the transient in-plane optical properties. These experiements have so far been challenging because of the high in-plane equilibrium reflectivity, from which small changes in the optical response determine the transient conductivity. We observe a photo-induced in-plane optical gap $2\Delta\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity, also consistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these data suggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely equilibrate during the dynamics.

Title: Dynamical control of random telegraph noise in magnetic tunnel junctions
Authors: Mehrdad Elyasi, Shun Kanai, Hideo Ohno, Shunsuke Fukami, Gerrit E. W. Bauer
Abstract: Rapid random telegraph noise (RTN) in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is an important figure of merit for probabilistic computing applications. However, the interactions between the macrospin and spin waves with finite wave numbers reduce the RTN attempt frequency. We theoretically show that mode-selective heating and cooling can substantially tune the RTN frequency. We propose a nonlinear cooling mechanism that accelerates the switching dynamics. We outline experimental pathways to characterize the physics of nonlinear effects on RTN and to maximize the operation speed of MTJ-based probabilistic computing.

Title: Differentiating anomalous and topological Hall effects using first-order reversal curve measurements
Authors: Gregory M. Stephen, Ryan T. Van Haren, Vinay Sharma, Lixuan Tai, Bingqian Dai, Hang Chi, Kang L. Wang, Aubrey T. Hanbicki, Adam L. Friedman
Abstract: Next generation magnetic memories rely on novel magnetic phases for information storage. Novel spin textures such as skyrmions provide one possible avenue forward due to their topological protection and controllability via electric fields. However, the common signature of these spin textures, the topological Hall effect (THE), can be mimicked by other trivial effects. Competing anomalous Hall effect (AHE) components can produce a peak in the Hall voltage similar to that of the THE, making clear identification of the THE difficult. By applying the first-order reversal curve (FORC) technique to the Hall effect in candidate topological Hall systems we can clearly distinguish between the THE and AHE. This technique allows for quantitative investigation of the THE and AHE in magnetic materials and heterostructures with topologically non-trivial spin textures. We demonstrate the technique and apply it to several examples.

Title: Non-Hermitian band topology in twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Kamalesh Bera, Debasish Mondal, Arijit Saha, Debashree Chowdhury
Abstract: Utilizing the established Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we theoretically investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) topological properties of this in the presence of non-reciprocal (NR) hopping on both layers and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) induced mass term incorporated only on the top layer of the tBLG system. It is well known that the hBN mass term breaks the $C_{2}$ symmetry of tBLG and gaps out the Dirac cones inducing a valley Hall insulating phase. However, when NR hopping is introduced, this system transits into a NH valley Hall insulator (NH-VHI). Our analysis reveals that, in the chiral limit, the bandwidth of the system vanishes under NH effects for a wide range of twist angles. Such range can be visibly expanded as we enhance the degree of non-Hermiticity $(\beta)$. At the magic angle, we observe that enhancement of $\beta$ inflates the robustness of the gapless Dirac points, requiring a progressively larger mass term to induce a gap in the NH tBLG system. Additionally, for a fixed NH parameter, we identify a range of twist angles where gap formation is significantly obstructed. To explore the topological aspects of the NH tBLG, we analyze the direct band gap in the Moiré Brillouin zone (mBZ) and compute the Chern number for the NH system. We find that the corresponding topological phase transitions are associated with corresponding direct band gap closings in the mBZ.

Title: Transition States Energies from Machine Learning: An Application to Reverse Water-Gas Shift on Single-Atom Alloys
Authors: Raffaele Cheula, Mie Andersen
Abstract: Obtaining accurate transition state (TS) energies is a bottleneck in computational screening of complex materials and reaction networks due to the high cost of TS search methods and first-principles methods such as density functional theory (DFT). Here we propose a machine learning (ML) model for predicting TS energies based on Gaussian process regression with the Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (WWL-GPR). Applying the model to predict adsorption and TS energies for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction on single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, we show that it can significantly improve the accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on scaling relations or ML models without a graph representation. Further benefitting from the low cost of model training, we train an ensemble of WWL-GPR models to obtain uncertainties through subsampling of the training data and show how these uncertainties propagate to turnover frequency (TOF) predictions through the construction of an ensemble of microkinetic models. Comparing the errors in model-based vs DFT-based TOF predictions, we show that the WWL-GPR model reduces errors by almost an order of magnitude compared to scaling relations. This demonstrates the critical impact of accurate energy predictions on catalytic activity estimation. Finally, we apply our model to screen new materials, identifying promising catalysts for RWGS. This work highlights the power of combining advanced ML techniques with DFT and microkinetic modeling for screening catalysts for complex reactions like RWGS, providing a robust framework for future catalyst design.

Title: Unveiling competitions between carrier recombination pathways in semiconductors via mechanical damping
Authors: Mingyu Xie, Ruitian Chen, Jiaze Wu, Kaiqi Qiu, Mingqiang Li, Huicong Chen, Kai Huang, Yu Zou
Abstract: The total rate of carrier recombination in semiconductors has conventionally been expressed using an additive model, r_total = \Sigma r_i , which rules out the interactions between carrier recombination pathways. Here we challenge this paradigm by demonstrating pathway competitions using our newly developed light-induced mechanical absorption spectroscopy (LIMAS), which allows us to probe genuine recombination dynamics in semiconductors via mechanical damping. We show that the total recombination rate in zinc sulfide (ZnS), a model semiconductor material, follows a multiplicative weighting model, r_total \propto \Pi r_i ^(w_i) with \Sigma w_i=1. Under both steady-state and switch-on illuminations, the weighting factors w_i for each recombination pathway-direct, trap-assisted, and sublinear-are dictated by the carrier generation mechanism: (i) interband transition favors direct recombination; (ii) single-defect level-mediated generation promotes trap-assisted recombination; (iii) generation involving multiple saturated defect levels gives rise to sublinear recombination. Upon light switch-off, localized state changes drive a dynamic evolution of w_i, altering pathway competitions. These findings reshape our fundamental understanding of carrier dynamics and provide a new strategy to optimize next-generation optoelectronic devices.

Title: Planckian scattering and parallel conduction channels in the iron chalcogenide superconductors FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$
Authors: Ralph Romero III, Hee Taek Yi, Seongshik Oh, N. P. Armitage
Abstract: The remarkable linear in temperature resistivity of the cuprate superconductors, which extends in some samples from $T_c$ to the melting temperature, remains unexplained. Although seemingly simple, this temperature dependence is incompatible with the conventional theory of metals that dictates that the scattering rate, $1/\tau$, should be quadratic in temperature if electron-electron scattering dominates. Understanding the origin of this temperature dependence and its connection to superconductivity may provide the key to pick the lock of high-temperature superconductivity. Using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy (TDTS) we elucidate the low temperature conducting behavior of two FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ (FTS) samples, one with almost equal amounts of Se and Te that is believed to be a topological superconductor, and one that is more overdoped. Constrained with DC resistivity, we find two conduction channels that add in parallel, a broad one in frequency with weak temperature dependence and a sharper one whose scattering rate goes as the Planckian limited rate, $\sim kT/h$. Through analysis of its spectral weight we show the superconducting condensate is mainly drawn from the channel that undergoes this Planckian scattering.

Title: Single-site entanglement as a marker for quantum phase transitions at non-zero temperatures
Authors: Willdauany C. de Freitas Silva, Andressa R. Medeiros-Silva, Rubem Mondaini, Vivian V. França, Thereza Paiva
Abstract: Entanglement has been widely investigated in condensed matter systems since they are considered good candidates for developing quantum technologies. Additionally, entanglement is a powerful tool to explore quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated systems, with the von Neumann entropy being considered a proper measure of quantum entanglement for pure bipartite systems. For lattice systems, in particular, the single-site entanglement quantifies how much information about the quantum state of the remaining sites can be obtained by a measurement at a single site. Here, we use Quantum Monte Carlo calculations to obtain the average single-site entanglement for the two-dimensional Hubbard model in different geometries, probing the effects of varying temperature and interaction strength. We find that the average single-site entanglement signals the quantum phase transitions in such systems, allowing us to identify and characterize signatures of quantum phase transitions even at finite temperatures. We also analyze the relation between entanglement and magnetic susceptibility: in all the geometries considered, we find regimes in which the quantities are linearly connected. Our findings could then guide experiments to estimate entanglement via the susceptibility.

Title: Dynamics of Thin Lubricant Films upon Liquid Contact on Slippery Surfaces
Authors: Shivam Gupta, Bidisha Bhatt, Zhaohe Dai, Krishnacharya Khare
Abstract: In recent years, slippery surfaces have attracted significant interest due to their excellent liquid-repellent properties and their potential in diverse commercial applications. Such surfaces are prepared by coating functionalized solid substrates with a thin lubricant film that prevents direct contact between a liquid and the substrate. The morphology of thin films upon liquid contact plays a central role in governing various phenomena, including the coalescence and mobility of liquid droplets, heat transfer efficiency, and the extent of lubricant depletion. However, a detailed understanding of film dynamics upon droplet contact remains limited, both from theoretical and experimental perspectives. Here, by employing principles of fluid dynamics, optics, and surface wetting, we present a comprehensive study that examines both the spatial and temporal variations of lubricant films upon contact with sessile liquid droplets and liquid bridges. Our findings reveal that the film dynamics can be categorized into three distinct stages, each significantly influenced by key system parameters: initial film thickness, three-phase contact line width, and Laplace pressure of liquids. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by optimizing these parameters, it is possible to reverse the lubricant flow in the final stage, thereby causing the liquid to partially lift off from the slippery surface.

Title: Strange correlator and string order parameter for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases in 1+1d
Authors: Da-Chuan Lu, Fu Xu, Yi-Zhuang You
Abstract: In this paper, we construct strange correlators and string order parameters for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (NISPTs) in 1+1d quantum lattice spin models. The strange correlator exhibits long-range order when evaluated between two distinct NISPTs and decays exponentially otherwise. We show that strange charged operators inserted into the strange correlator are linked to the interface algebra (boundary tube algebra) and are non-trivial when all its irreducible representations have dimensions greater than one. We discuss the generalization to higher dimensions. The string order parameter is obtained by contracting the truncated symmetry operator with charge decoration operators, which are determined by the NISPT action tensors. We illustrate the above construction using the three NISPTs of $\text{Rep}(D_8)$ and demonstrate the extraction of categorical data via tensor networks, particularly through the ZX calculus. Finally, we show that the entanglement spectrum degeneracy is determined by the irreducible representations of the interface algebra when assuming non-invertible symmetry on-site condition.

Title: Scrambling Dynamics with Imperfections in a Solvable Model
Authors: Nadie Yiluo LiTenn, Tianci Zhou, Brian Swingle
Abstract: We study how probes of quantum scrambling dynamics respond to two kinds of imperfections -- unequal forward and backward evolutions and decoherence -- in a solvable Brownian circuit model. We calculate a ``renormalized'' out-of-time-order correlator (ROTOC) in the model with $N$ qubits, and we show that the circuit-averaged ROTOC is controlled by an effective probability distribution in operator weight space which obeys a system of $N$ non-linear equations of motion. These equations can be easily solved numerically for large system sizes which are beyond the reach of exact methods. Moreover, for an operator initially concentrated on weight one $w_0=1$, we provide an exact solution to the equations in the thermodynamic limit of many qubits that is valid for all times, all non-vanishing perturbation strengths $p\gtrsim 1/\sqrt{N}$, and all decoherence strengths. We also show that a generic initial condition $w_0 >1$ leads to a metastable state that eventually collapses to the $w_0=1$ case after a lifetime $\sim \log(N/w_0)$. Our results highlight situations where it is still possible to extract the unperturbed chaos exponent even in the presence of imperfections, and we comment on the applications of our results to existing experiments with nuclear spins and to future scrambling experiments.

Title: An unbiased measure over the matrix product state manifold
Authors: Sebastian Leontica, Andrew G. Green
Abstract: Matrix product states are useful representations for a large variety of naturally occurring quantum states. Studying their typical properties is important for understanding universal behavior, including quantum chaos and thermalization, as well as the limits of classical simulations of quantum devices. We show that the usual ensemble of sequentially generated random matrix product states (RMPS) using local Haar random unitaries is not uniform when viewed as a restriction of the full Hilbert space. As a result, the entanglement across the chain exhibits an anomalous asymmetry under spatial inversion. We show how to construct an unbiased measure starting from the left-canonical form and design a Metropolis algorithm for sampling random states. Some properties of this new ensemble are investigated both analytically and numerically, such as the resulting resolution of identity over matrix product states and the typical entanglement spectrum, which is found to differ from the sequentially generated case.

Title: Emergent photons and mechanisms of confinement
Authors: Jeffrey Giansiracusa, David Lanners, Tin Sulejmanpasic
Abstract: We numerically study $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in 4D as prototypical models of systems with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-$\textit{form symmetry}$. For $N \geq 3$, we provide evidence that such systems exhibit not only the expected phases with spontaneously broken/restored symmetry but also a third photon phase. When present, the 1-form symmetry provides a precise notion of confinement, and it is commonly believed that confinement ensues due to the proliferation of extended, string-like objects known as $\textit{center vortices}$, which carry a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ flux. However, this picture is challenged by the three-phase scenario investigated here. We show that both the confined and the photon phases are associated with the proliferation of center vortices and that the key difference between them lies in whether or not vortex-junctions, the $\textit{monopoles}$, proliferate.

Title: Efficient Learning Implies Quantum Glassiness
Authors: Eric R. Anschuetz
Abstract: We show a surprising relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We demonstrate that finding near-ground states of certain sparse disordered quantum systems is average-case hard for "Lipschitz" quantum algorithms if there exists an efficient, local learning algorithm -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- for estimating the energy of a state of the system. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including short-time Lindbladian dynamics, short-time quantum annealing, phase estimation, and shallow-depth variational quantum algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a topological property of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local learning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this topological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms optimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches the best-known time lower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical $p$-spin models. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical quantum $p$-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as intractable as the classical $p$-spin model is for classical algorithms. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.

Title: Approximation theory for Green's functions via the Lanczos algorithm
Authors: Gabriele Pinna, Oliver Lunt, Curt von Keyserlingk
Abstract: It is known that Green's functions can be expressed as continued fractions; the content at the $n$-th level of the fraction is encoded in a coefficient $b_n$, which can be recursively obtained using the Lanczos algorithm. We present a theory concerning errors in approximating Green's functions using continued fractions when only the first $N$ coefficients are known exactly. Our focus lies on the stitching approximation (also known as the recursion method), wherein truncated continued fractions are completed with a sequence of coefficients for which exact solutions are available. We assume a now standard conjecture about the growth of the Lanczos coefficients in chaotic many-body systems, and that the stitching approximation converges to the correct answer. Given these assumptions, we show that the rate of convergence of the stitching approximation to a Green's function depends strongly on the decay of staggered subleading terms in the Lanczos cofficients. Typically, the decay of the error term ranges from $1/\mathrm{poly}(N)$ in the best case to $1/\mathrm{poly}(\log N)$ in the worst case, depending on the differentiability of the spectral function at the origin. We present different variants of this error estimate for different asymptotic behaviours of the $b_n$, and we also conjecture a relationship between the asymptotic behavior of the $b_n$'s and the smoothness of the Green's function. Lastly, with the above assumptions, we prove a formula linking the spectral function's value at the origin to a product of continued fraction coefficients, which we then apply to estimate the diffusion constant in the mixed field Ising model.

Title: A probabilistic approach to system-environment coupling
Authors: Mohammad Rahbar, Christopher J. Stein
Abstract: We introduce a unified statistical framework for quantifying system-environment coupling by treating the interaction energy $V_\mathcal{SE}$ as a stochastic variable. Using a reference-particle decomposition, we derive exact, closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of $V_\mathcal{SE}$ in terms of the single-particle density and up to four-body correlation functions. When $V_\mathcal{SE}$ is approximately Gaussian, these two moments suffice to compute the free energy shift of the strongly coupled system. To validate our framework, we ran explicit Monte Carlo simulations of the full system-environment configurations across a range of system sizes, generating reference distributions of the interaction energy $V_\mathcal{SE}$. We then applied our derived analytical formulas to predict these distributions and found excellent agreement in both the weak- and strong-coupling regimes.

Title: Diffusion and instabilities in large-N holographic Fermi liquids: the vector fluctuations of the electron star
Authors: Vladan Gecin, Mihailo Čubrović
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic response of the AdS electron star in the vector sector, and compute the correlation functions and the transverse conductivity of the dual field theory. The system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior at low temperatures and near the critical temperature where the electron star undergoes the phase transition to the RN black hole. However, at intermediate temperatures the hydrodynamics does not exist. Remarkably, the system has an instability, i.e. a pole on the positive imaginary frequency axis at finite temperature. This instability is found both from analytical arguments and from numerics. Its physical meaning is so far unclear but it might mean that the ideal fluid limit for the star is a false vacuum.

Title: Wideband covariance magnetometry below the diffraction limit
Authors: Xuan Hoang Le, Pavel E. Dolgirev, Piotr Put, Eric L. Peterson, Arjun Pillai, Alexander A. Zibrov, Eugene Demler, Hongkun Park, Mikhail D. Lukin
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a method for measuring correlations of wideband magnetic signals with spatial resolution below the optical diffraction limit. Our technique employs two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale magnetometers, spectrally resolved by inhomogeneous optical transitions. Using high-fidelity optical readout and long spin coherence time, we probe correlated MHz-range noise with sensitivity of 15 nT Hz$^{-1/4}$. In addition, we use this system for correlated $T_1$ relaxometry, enabling correlation measurements of GHz-range noise. Under such externally applied noise, while individual NV centers exhibit featureless relaxation, their correlation displays rich coherent and incoherent dynamics reminiscent of superradiance physics. This capability to probe high-frequency correlations provides a powerful tool for investigating a variety of condensed-matter phenomena characterized by nonlocal correlations.

Title: Tripartite hybrid quantum systems: Skyrmion-mediated quantum interactions between single NV centers and superconducting qubits
Authors: Xue-Feng Pan, Peng-Bo Li
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and superconducting qubits are two promising solid-state quantum systems for quantum science and technology, but the realization of controlled interfaces between individual solid-state spins and superconducting qubits remains fundamentally challenging. Here, we propose and analyze a hybrid quantum system consisting of a magnetic skyrmion, an NV center, and a superconducting qubit, where the solid-state qubits are both positioned in proximity to the skyrmion structure in a thin magnetic disk. We show that it is experimentally feasible to achieve strong magnetic (coherent or dissipative) coupling between the NV center and the superconducting qubit by using the \textit{quantized gyration mode of the skyrmion} as an intermediary. This allows coherent information transfer and nonreciprocal responses between the NV center and the superconducting qubit at the single quantum level with high controllability. The proposed platform provides a scalable pathway for implementing quantum protocols that synergistically exploit the complementary advantages of spin-based quantum memories, microwave-frequency superconducting circuits, and topologically protected magnetic excitations.

Title: Exact treatment of the quantum Langevin equation under time-dependent system-bath coupling via a train of delta distributions

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the quantum Langevin equation for the Caldeira-Leggett model with an arbitrary time-dependent coupling constant. We solve this equation exactly by employing a train of Dirac-delta switchings. This method also enables us to visualize the memory effect in the environment. Furthermore, we compute the two-time correlation functions of the system's quadratures and show that the discrete-time Fourier transform is well-suited for defining spectral densities, as the Dirac-delta switchings turn continuous functions into discretized samples.

Title: Local Information Flow in Quantum Quench Dynamics
Authors: Nicolas P. Bauer, Björn Trauzettel, Thomas Klein Kvorning, Jens H. Bardarson, Claudia Artiaco
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum information in one-dimensional systems undergoing a quantum quench using a local perspective based on the information lattice. This framework provides a scale- and space-resolved decomposition of quantum correlations, enabling a hydrodynamic description of the information flow through well-defined local densities -- termed local information -- and currents. We apply this framework to three local quenches in noninteracting fermionic chains: (i) the release of a single particle into an empty tight-binding chain, (ii) the connection of two critical chains via the removal of a central barrier, and (iii) the coupling of a topological Kitaev chain to a critical chain. In each case, the information lattice reveals the local structure of correlation buildup and information interface effects, going beyond global measures such as the von Neumann entropy. In particular, through the information lattice we uncover the signatures in the local information flow associated with topological edge modes and analytically explain the fractional von Neumann entropy values observed in Majorana quench protocols. Our approach is general and applicable to interacting, disordered, and open systems, providing a powerful tool for characterizing quantum information dynamics.

Title: Frustration, dynamics and catalysis
Authors: R. Gonzalo Parra, Diego U. Ferreiro
Abstract: The controlled dissipation of chemical potentials is the fundamental way cells make a living. Enzyme-mediated catalysis allows the various transformations to proceed at biologically relevant rates with remarkable precision and efficiency. Theory, experiments and computational studies coincide to show that local frustration is a useful concept to relate protein dynamics with catalytic power. Local frustration gives rise to the asperities of the energy landscapes that can harness the thermal fluctuations to guide the functional protein motions. We review here recent advances into these relationships from various fields of protein science. The biologically relevant dynamics is tuned by the evolution of protein sequences that modulate the local frustration patterns to near optimal values.

Title: SA-GAT-SR: Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks with Symbolic Regression for high-fidelity material property prediction
Authors: Liu Junchi, Tang Ying, Tretiak Sergei, Duan Wenhui, Zhou Liujiang
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.

Title: Disorder induced topological phase transition in a driven Majorana chain
Authors: Henry Ling, Philip Richard, Saeed Rahmanian Koshkaki, Michael Kolodrubetz, Dganit Meidan, Aditi Mitra, T. Pereg-Barnea
Abstract: We study a periodically driven one dimensional Kitaev model in the presence of disorder. In the clean limit our model exhibits four topological phases corresponding to the existence or non-existence of edge modes at zero and pi quasienergy. When disorder is added, the system parameters get renormalized and the system may exhibit a topological phase transition. When starting from the Majorana $\pi$ Mode (MPM) phase, which hosts only edge Majoranas with quasienergy pi, disorder induces a transition into a neighboring phase with both pi and zero modes on the edges. We characterize the disordered system using (i) exact diagonalization (ii) Arnoldi mapping onto an effective tight binding chain and (iii) topological entanglement entropy.

Title: Thermodynamic phases in first detected return times of quantum many-body systems
Authors: Benjamin Walter, Gabriele Perfetto, Andrea Gambassi
Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the first return time to the initial state of a quantum many-body system subject to global projective measurements at stroboscopic times. We show that this distribution can be mapped to a continuation of the canonical partition function of a classical spin chain with noninteracting domains at equilibrium, which is entirely characterized by the Loschmidt amplitude of the quantum many-body system. This allows us to conclude that this probability may decay either algebraically or exponentially at long times, depending on whether the spin chain displays a ferromagnetic or a paramagnetic phase. We illustrate this idea on the example of the return time of $N$ adjacent fermions in a tight-binding model, revealing a rich phase behavior, which can be tuned by scaling the probing time as a function of $N$. The analysis presented here provides an overarching understanding of many-body quantum first-detection problems in terms of equilibrium thermodynamic phases. Our theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with exact numerical computations.

Title: Chirped amplitude mode in photo-excited superconductors
Authors: Thomas Blommel, Jason Kaye, Yuta Murakami, Emanuel Gull, Denis Golež
Abstract: Using a state-of-the-art numerical scheme, we show that the Higgs mode under excitation exhibits chirped oscillations and exponential decay when fluctuations are included. This is in stark contrast to conventional BCS collisionless dynamics which predict power-law decay and the absence of chirping. The chirped amplitude mode enables us to determine the local modification of the effective potential even when the system is in a long-lived prethermal state. We then show that this chirped amplitude mode is an experimentally observable quantity since the photoinduced (super)current in pump-probe experiments serves as an efficient proxy for the order parameter dynamics, including the chirped dynamics. Our result is based on the attractive Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory within the symmetry-broken state after a excitation across the superconducting gap. Since the collective response involves long timescales, we extend the hierarchical low-rank compression method for nonequilibrium Green's functions to symmetry-broken states and show that it serves as an efficient representation despite long-lived memory kernels.

Title: Topology of Discrete Quantum Feedback Control
Authors: Masaya Nakagawa, Masahito Ueda
Abstract: A general framework for analyzing the topology of quantum channels of single-particle systems is developed to find a class of genuinely dynamical topological phases that can be realized by means of discrete quantum feedback control. We provide a symmetry classification of quantum channels by identifying ten symmetry classes of discrete quantum feedback control with projective measurements. We construct various types of topological feedback control by using topological Maxwell demons that achieve robust feedback-controlled chiral or helical transport against noise and decoherence. Topological feedback control thus offers a versatile tool for creating and controlling nonequilibrium topological phases in open quantum systems that are distinct from non-Hermitian and Lindbladian systems and should provide a guiding principle for topology-based design of quantum feedback control.

Title: Time-tronics: from temporal printed circuit board to quantum computer
Authors: Krzysztof Giergiel, Peter Hannaford, Krzysztof Sacha
Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.

Title: Hydrodynamically consistent many-body Harada-Sasa relation
Authors: Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: The effect of hydrodynamic interactions on the non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics of particles -- arising from the conservation of momentum in the fluid medium -- is examined in the context of the relationship between fluctuations, response functions, and the entropy production rate. The multiplicative nature of the hydrodynamic interactions is shown to introduce subtleties that preclude a straightforward extension of the Harada-Sasa relation. A generalization of the definitions involved in the framework is used to propose a new form of the relation applicable to systems with hydrodynamic interactions. The resulting framework will enable characterization of the non-equilibrium properties of living and active matter systems, which are predominantly in suspensions.

Title: A one-component patchy-particle icosahedral quasicrystal
Authors: Eva G. Noya, Jonathan P.K. Doye
Abstract: Designing particles that are able to form icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs) and that are as simple as possible is not only of fundamental interest but is also important to the potential realization of IQCs in materials other than metallic alloys. Here we introduce one-component patchy-particle systems that in simulations are able to form face-centred IQCs that are made up of interconnected icosahedra. The directional bonding of the particles facilitates the formation of a network of bonds with icosahedral orientational order and hence quasiperiodic positional order. The assembled quasicrystals have similar energies to periodic approximants but are entropically stabilized by phason disorder. Their long-range quasiperiodic order is confirmed by a higher-dimensional analysis. These materials, which are predicted to have an almost spherical photonic band gap, can potentially be realized via protein design and DNA origami particles.

Title: Nanostructured multiferroic liquids: on the way to fluid ferroelectric magnets
Authors: Hajnalka Nádasi, Peter Medle Rupnik, Melvin Küster, Alexander Jarosik, Rachel Tuffin, Matthias Bremer, Melanie Klasen-Memmer, Darja Lisjak, Nerea Sebastián, Alenka Mertelj, Frank Ludwig, Alexey Eremin
Abstract: Responsiveness to multiple stimuli and adaptivity are paramount for designing smart multifunctional materials. In soft, partially ordered systems, these features can often be achieved via self-assembly, allowing for the combination of diverse components in a complex nanostructured material. Here, we demonstrate an example of a liquid that simultaneously displays both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic types of order. This material is a nanostructured liquid crystalline hybrid comprising ferrimagnetic barium hexaferrite nanoplatelets suspended in a ferroelectric nematic host. Director-mediated interactions drive the self-assembly of nanoplatelets in an intricate network. Due to the couplings between the polar electric and magnetic types of order, this material demonstrates magnetically driven electric and nonlinear optical responses, as well as electrically driven magnetic response. Such multiferroic liquids are highly promising for applications in energy harvesting, nonlinear optics, and sensors.

Electronic Science and Engineering, Kyoto Univ., (2) CSRN-Kyoto, (3) Graduate School of Science, Kyoto Univ., (4) Okayama Univ.)
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), where zero-resistance states appear nonreciprocally during current injection, is receiving tremendous interest in both fundamental and applied physics because the SDE is a novel manifestation of symmetry breaking and enables the creation of a novel diode. In particular, magnetic-field-free SDEs have been extensively investigated because of their potential to serve as building blocks for superconducting circuit technology. In this letter, we report the field-free SDE in a layered superconductor, FeSe. Its underlying physics is clarified by systematic controlled experiments to be an interplay of a large thermoelectric response and geometrical asymmetry in FeSe. Our findings can pave a new avenue for the construction of novel material and device platforms utilizing SDEs.

Title: Direct measurement of terahertz conductivity in a gated monolayer semiconductor
Authors: Su-Di Chen, Qixin Feng, Wenyu Zhao, Ruishi Qi, Zuocheng Zhang, Dishan Abeysinghe, Can Uzundal, Jingxu Xie, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Feng Wang
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors and their moiré superlattices have emerged as important platforms for investigating correlated electrons. However, many key properties of these systems, such as the frequency-dependent conductivity, remain experimentally inaccessible because of the mesoscopic sample size. Here we report a technique to directly measure the complex conductivity of electrostatically gated two-dimensional semiconductors in the terahertz frequency range. Applying this technique to a WSe2 monolayer encapsulated in hBN, we observe clear Drude-like response between 0.1 and 1 THz, in a density range challenging to access even in DC transport. Our work opens a new avenue for studying tunable van der Waals heterostructures using terahertz spectroscopy.

Title: Effects of Ligand vs. Linker on Phase Behavior and Mechanical Properties of Nanoparticle Gels
Authors: Qizan Chen, Dinesh Sundaravadivelu Devarajan, Arash Nikoubashman, Michael P. Howard, Jeetain Mittal
Abstract: Nanoparticle gels have attracted considerable attention due to their highly tunable properties. One strategy for producing nanoparticle gels involves using strong local attractions between polymeric molecules, such as DNA hybridization or dynamic covalent chemistry, to form percolated nanoparticle networks. These molecules can be used in two distinct roles: as "ligands" with one end grafted to a nanoparticle or as "linkers" with both ends free. Here, we explore how these roles shape the phase behavior and mechanical properties of gel-like nanoparticle assemblies using coarse-grained simulations. We systematically vary the interaction strength and bending stiffness of both ligands and linkers. We find that phase separation can be limited to low nanoparticle volume fractions by making the ligands rigid, consistent with previous studies on linked nanoparticle gels. At fixed interaction strength and volume fraction, both ligand- and linker-mediated nanoparticle assemblies show similar mechanical responses as bending stiffness is varied. However, a comparison between the two association schemes reveals that the linked nanoparticles form rigid percolated networks that are less stretchable than the ligand-grafted gels, despite exhibiting similar tensile strength. We attribute these differences between ligands and linkers to the distinct structural arrangement of nanoparticles within the gel. Our findings highlight the potential to use different association schemes to tune specific mechanical properties.

Title: Global Topological Dirac Synchronization
Authors: Timoteo Carletti, Lorenzo Giambagli, Riccardo Muolo, Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental dynamical state of interacting oscillators, observed in natural biological rhythms and in the brain. Global synchronization which occurs when non-linear or chaotic oscillators placed on the nodes of a network display the same dynamics as received great attention in network theory. Here we propose and investigate Global Topological Dirac Synchronization on higher-order networks such as cell and simplicial complexes. This is a state where oscillators associated to simplices and cells of arbitrary dimension, coupled by the Topological Dirac operator, operate at unison. By combining algebraic topology with non-linear dynamics and machine learning, we derive the topological conditions under which this state exists and the dynamical conditions under which it is stable. We provide evidence of 1-dimensional simplicial complexes (networks) and 2-dimensional simplicial and cell complexes where Global Topological Dirac Synchronization can be observed. Our results point out that Global Topological Dirac Synchronization is a possible dynamical state of simplicial and cell complexes that occur only in some specific network topologies and geometries, the latter ones being determined by the weights of the higher-order networks

Title: Supersonic shear waves in dipolar supersolids
Authors: Pramodh Senarath Yapa, Thomas Bland
Abstract: Dipolar supersolids--quantum states that are simultaneously superfluid and solid--have had their superfluid nature rigorously tested, while its solid nature remains uncharted. Arguably, the defining characteristic of a solid is the existence of elastic shear waves. In this work, we investigate transverse wave packet propagation in dipolar supersolids with triangular and honeycomb structure. Remarkably, the honeycomb supersolid displays anomalous dispersion, supporting waves traveling faster than the transverse speed of sound: a supersonic shear wave. While the distinction between anomalous and normal dispersion appears subtle, it has a profound influence on both the transport and scattering properties. For both supersolid phases, we calculate the shear modulus, a key parameter that quantifies the material's rigidity. Our findings are pertinent to current experimental efforts scrutinizing the fundamental properties of supersolids.

Title: Combining integral equation closures with force density functional theory for the study of inhomogeneous fluids
Authors: S. M. Tschopp, H. Vahid, A. Sharma, J. M. Brader
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful framework to study inhomogeneous fluids. Its standard form is based on the knowledge of a generating free energy functional. If this is known exactly, then the results obtained by using standard DFT or its alternative, recently developed version, force-DFT, are the same. If the free energy functional is known only approximately then these two routes produce different outcomes. However, as we show in this work, force-DFT has the advantage that it is also implementable without knowledge of the free energy functional, by using instead liquid-state integral equation closures. This broadens the range of systems that can be explored, since free energy functionals are generally difficult to approximate. In this paper we investigate the utility of using inhomogeneous integral equation closures within force-DFT thus demonstrating the versatility and accuracy of this approach.

Title: The effect of oxygen content on the electrophysical properties of the molybdenum-disulfide-oxide nanoflakes

Abstract: The dependencies of the resistance on the applied voltage of a series of molybdenum-disulfide-oxide (MoSxOy) powders was studied. The MoSxOy samples were prepared by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution followed by aerial oxidation. These materials had the structure of nanoflowers consisting of self-assembled 10-20 nm thin nanoflakes. Chemical composition of the materials was evaluated by XPS and confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The MoSxOy nanoflakes revealed unusual electric transport features. The current-voltage characteristics (I-V curves) grew monotonically with the applied voltage for the samples, containing ca. 25 % of Mo in oxidized species (in contrast to MoS2), being non-ohmic at lower voltages and becoming close to the ohmic at higher voltages. On the other hand, the I-V curves acquire N-like shaped with a strongly pronounced negative differential resistivity (NDR) part for the samples containing more than 50 % of Mo in oxidized forms. In all cases the I-V curves manifested hysteretic behavior with the difference between increasing and decreasing voltage sweeps, and the hysteresis loop parameters depended on the Ts. Important, that the studied nanoflakes were characterized by very long living deep charging and discharging after the voltage switching "on" and "off". The flexo-chemical model of the polar and electro-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes was proposed, and the observed I-V curves were theoretically described. The revealed experimentally and explained features of resistive switching and charge accumulation in the MoSxOy materials look promising for applications in memristors and high-performance supercapacitors.

Title: High-temperature superconductivity from kinetic energy
Authors: Hanbit Oh, Hui Yang, Ya-Hui Zhang
Abstract: Superconductivity is usually assumed to arise from attractive interaction. In this work we show that strong pairing is possible soley from kinetic energy even without a net attraction. We demonstrate a high-temperature kinetic superconductor in a simple lattice model with nearest-neighbor hopping ($t$) projected onto a constrained Hilbert space, analogous to the $t$-$J$ model with $J=0$, where kinetic magnetism has been previously studied. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) on cylinders up to width $L_y=8$, we find a superconducting ground state exhibiting a key difference from high-$T_c$ cuprates: both the pairing gap and phase stiffness \textit{increase} with doping ($x$). We find pairing gaps, determined from spin and single-electron charge gaps, exceeding $1.5t$. This model can be realized within the double Kondo lattice model, relevant to bilayer nickelates, in the limit of strong inter-layer spin coupling ($J_\perp/t \rightarrow +\infty$) and a balancing inter-layer repulsion ($V$). Importantly, the double Kondo model does not fundamentally restrict $J_\perp/t$, suggesting the potential for high critical temperatures ($T_c$) approaching $0.5t$. While this idealized limit predicts large pairing gaps, we show a smooth connection to the more realistic regime with $J_\perp \sim t$, albeit with a reduced pairing gap of approximately $0.1t$. Assuming $t \sim 10^3$ K in typical solid state systems, our model suggests the exciting possibility of achieving $T_c$ of hundreds of Kelvin. We propose searching for bilayer materials with reduced out-of-plane lattice constants to better approximate the conditions of our ideal model.

Title: Layered Multiple Scattering Approach to Hard X-ray Photoelectron Diffraction: Theory and Application
Authors: Trung-Phuc Vo, Olena Tkach, Sylvain Tricot, Didier Sebilleau, Jurgen Braun, Aki Pulkkinen, Aimo Winkelmann, Olena Fedchenko, Yaryna Lytvynenko, Dmitry Vasilyev, Hans-Joachim Elmers, Gerd Schonhense, Jan Minar
Abstract: Photoelectron diffraction (PED) is a powerful and essential experimental technique for resolving the structure of surfaces with sub-angstrom resolution. In the high energy regime, researchers in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) observe modulating patterns attributed to X-ray-PED (XPD) effects. This is accompanied by other challenges such as low cross-sections, significant photon momentum transfer, and non-negligible phonon scattering. Overall, XPD is not only an advantageous approach but also exhibits unexpected effects. To disentangle these diffraction influences, we present a PED implementation for the SPRKKR package that utilizes multiple scattering theory and a one-step model in the photoemission process. Unlike real-space implementations of the multiple scattering XPD formalism, we propose a k-space implementation based on the layer KKR method. The main advantage of this method is its ability to address a very broad kinetic energy range (20-8000 eV) without convergence problems related to angular momentum and cluster size. Furthermore, the so-called alloy analogy model can be used to simulate XPD at finite temperatures as well as XPD effects observed in soft and hard X-ray ARPES. For practical applications, we have calculated the circular dichroism in angular distributions (CDAD) associated with core-level photoemission of 2p from Si(100) and 3p from Ge(100). Photoelectrons are excited by hard X-rays (6000 eV) with right and left circularly polarized radiation (RCP and LCP, respectively).

Title: Ehrenfest dynamics with localized atomic-orbital basis sets within the projector augmented-wave method
Authors: Vladimír Zobač, Mikael Kuisma, Ask Hjorth Larsen, Tuomas Rossi, Toma Susi
Abstract: Density functional theory with linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis sets is useful for studying large atomic systems, especially when it comes to computationally highly demanding time-dependent dynamics. We have implemented the Ehrenfest molecular dynamics (ED) method with the approximate approach of Tomfohr and Sankey within the projector augmented-wave code GPAW. We apply this method to small molecules as well as larger periodic systems, and elucidate its limits, advantages, and disadvantages in comparison to the existing implementation of Ehrenfest dynamics with a real-space grid representation. For modest atomic velocities, LCAO-ED shows satisfactory accuracy at a much reduced computational cost. This method will be particularly useful for modeling ion irradiation processes that require large amounts of vacuum in the simulation cell.

Title: Measurement-induced phase transition in periodically driven free-fermionic systems
Authors: Pallabi Chatterjee, Ranjan Modak
Abstract: It is well known that unitary evolution tends to increase entanglement, whereas continuous monitoring counteracts this growth by pinning the wavefunction trajectories to the eigenstates of the measurement operators. In this work, we investigate the fate of the measurement-induced phase transition in a periodically driven free-fermionic quantum system, where the hopping amplitude is modulated periodically in time using a square pulse. In the high-frequency limit, a renormalization group analysis of the non-Hermitian quantum sine-Gordon model [as proposed in {Phys. Rev. X 11, 041004 (2021)}] reveals that if the hopping amplitude is varied symmetrically around zero, the system always favors the area-law phase, where the steady-state entanglement entropy is independent of subsystem size. In contrast, asymmetry in the drive amplitudes tends to promote entanglement growth. Furthermore, numerical evidence for the system sizes accessible to us suggests that decreasing the drive frequency typically favors entanglement growth. For such driven systems, at least for reasonably small frequency regimes, as a function of measurement strength, we observe a potential signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition between a gapless critical phase, characterized by logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy with subsystem size, and a gapped area-law phase. However, it is almost impossible to rule out the possibility that the transition observed here is not an actual thermodynamic transition, but a finite-size crossover between logarithmic to area law entanglement phase. Even in that scenario, the critical length scale beyond which the area law phase prevails increases with the increasing time period of driving. On the other hand, for a symmetric drive, the system consistently exhibits an area-law phase, regardless of the driving frequency.

Title: Topology of Monitored Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Zhenyu Xiao, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: The interplay between unitary dynamics and quantum measurements induces diverse phenomena in open quantum systems with no counterparts in closed quantum systems at equilibrium. Here, we generally classify Kraus operators and their effective non-Hermitian dynamical generators, thereby establishing the tenfold classification for symmetry and topology of monitored free fermions. Our classification elucidates the role of topology in measurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological terms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics: nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as topologically nontrivial steady states and gapless boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, leading to the topologically protected slowdown of dynamical purification.

Title: Nonlinear Piezomagnetic Effects in $g$-wave Altermagnets
Authors: Yuuki Ogawa, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: We theoretically study the generation of net magnetization induced by static strain in $g$-wave altermagnets, which exhibit the symmetric spin-split band structure under collinear spin textures free from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling. By analyzing a tight-binding model in a two-dimensional tetragonal system, we show that the $g$-wave altermagnets give rise to the nonlinear piezomagnetic effect, where a net magnetization is induced by the second-order strain. We compare the results for the $g$-wave altermagnets with those for the $d$-wave altermagnets, where the linear piezomagnetic effect occurs. As a result, we find that the induced magnetization is enhanced when the Fermi level lies on the band with the large spin splitting in both cases. We also show that the magnitudes of the induced magnetization are comparable to each other. Our results indicate that the nonlinear piezomagnetic effect is a good phenomenon to characterize the physical properties in $g$-wave altermagnets.

Title: Tensor cross interpolation approach for quantum impurity problems based on the weak-coupling expansion
Authors: Shuta Matsuura, Hiroshi Shinaoka, Philipp Werner, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: We apply the tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm to solve equilibrium quantum impurity problems with high precision based on the weak-coupling expansion. The TCI algorithm, a kind of active learning method, factorizes high-dimensional integrals that appear in the perturbative expansion into a product of low-dimensional ones, enabling us to evaluate higher-order terms efficiently. This method is free from the sign problem which quantum Monte Carlo methods sometimes suffer from, and allows one to directly calculate the free energy. We benchmark the TCI impurity solver on an exactly solvable impurity model, and find good agreement with the exact solutions. We also incorporate the TCI impurity solver into the dynamical mean-field theory to solve the Hubbard model, and show that the metal-to-Mott insulator transition is correctly described with comparable accuracy to the Monte Carlo methods. Behind the effectiveness of the TCI approach for quantum impurity problems lies the fact that the integrands in the weak-coupling expansion naturally have a low-rank structure in the tensor-train representation.

Title: Energy symmetry and interlayer wave function ratio of tunneling electrons in partially overlapped graphene
Authors: Ryo Tamura
Abstract: While the exponential decay of tunneling probability with barrier thickness is well known, the accompanying oscillations with thickness have been comparatively less explored. Using a tight binding model, we investigate an AB-stacked bilayer graphene region acting as an energy barrier between two monolayer graphene leads, under a vertical electric field. We discuss the case where the energy gap induced by the vertical electric field is comparable to the interlayer transfer integral. In the up (down) junction, the left and right monolayer leads are connected to different layers (a common layer) of the central bilayer, while the remaining, unconnected layers form armchair-type open edges. We reveal a characteristic relation between the tunneling probability and the wave function structure. Among the valley-resolved transmission probabilities, only the valley-reversed transmission in the up junction exhibits even symmetry with respect to energy $E$. This result is counterintuitive. The interlayer wave function ratio $\beta$ is asymmetric in $E$, i.e., $\beta(-E) \neq \beta(E)$, and electrons cannot bypass the interlayer path in the up junction, whereas they can in the down junction. We attribute this unexpected symmetry to a self-cancellation effect of $\beta$, which arises from chiral and rotational symmetry operations combined with the conservation of probability. Our results demonstrate that the energy dependence of conductance in double junction structures serves as evidence of this effect.

Title: The Effect of the Non-Abelian Quantum Metric on Superfluidity
Authors: Kai Chen, Bishnu Karki, Pavan Hosur
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor, which encodes the full geometric information of quantum states in projective Hilbert space, plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. In this work, we examine the effect of the non-Abelian quantum metric -- the real part of the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor -- on the superfluid weight in time-reversal symmetric systems. For conventional $s$-wave pairing, we demonstrate that the superfluid weight includes a contribution proportional to the trace of the non-Abelian quantum metric. Notably, this contribution remains significant even when the total Chern number of a set of degenerate bands is zero and can exceed the conventional contribution, as confirmed using lattice models. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations for MoS$_2$ and TiSe$_2$ further corroborate these findings, revealing that the non-Abelian quantum metric accounts for up to 20% of the superfluid weight in MoS$_2$ and 50% in TiSe$_2$. Our results provide new insights into the nontrivial relationship between the geometric properties of quantum states and superconductivity, opening avenues for further exploration in topological and superconducting materials.

Title: Exact mobility edges in quasiperiodic network models with slowly varying potentials
Authors: Hai-Tao Hu, Yang Chen, Xiaoshui Lin, Ai-Min Guo, Zijing Lin, Ming Gong
Abstract: Quasiperiodic models are important physical platforms to explore Anderson transitions in low dimensional systems, yet the exact mobility edges (MEs) are generally hard to be determined analytically. To date, the MEs in only a few models can be determined exactly. In this manuscript, we propose a new class of network models characterized by quasiperiodic slowly varying potentials and the absence of hidden self-duality, and exactly determine their MEs. We take the mosaic models with slowly varying potentials as examples to illustrate this result and derive its MEs from the effective Hamiltonian. In this method, we can integrate out the periodic sites to obtain an effective Hamiltonian with energy-dependent potentials $g(E)V$ and effective eigenenergy $f(E)$, which directly yields the MEs at $f(E) = \pm(2t^\kappa \pm g(E)V)$, where $\kappa \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. With this idea in hand, we then generalize our method to more quasiperiodic network models, including those with much more complicated geometries and non-Hermitian features. Finally, we propose the realization of these models using optical waveguides and show that the Anderson transition can be observed even in small physical systems (with lattice sites about $L = 50 - 100$). Our results provide some key insights into the understanding and realization of exact MEs in experiments.

Title: Predicting the Néel temperatures in general helimagnetic materials: a comparison between mean field theory, random phase approximation, renormalized spin wave theory and classical Monte Carlo simulations
Authors: Varun Rajeev Pavizhakumari, Thomas Olsen
Abstract: The critical temperature for magnetic order comprises a crucial property of any magnetic material and ranges from a few Kelvin in certain antiferromagnets to 1400 K in ferromagnetic Co. However, the prediction of critical temperatures based on, for example, a spin wave dispersion is in general non-trivial. For ferromagnets and simple collinear antiferromagnets, estimates may be obtained from the Heisenberg model using either renormalized spin wave theory or the Green's function random phase approximation (RPA), but a systematic assessment of the accuracy of such approaches seems to be lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose generalizations of both renormalized spin wave theory and RPA to calculate the critical temperatures of single-$Q$ helimagnetic ground states, which include ferromagnets and antiferromagnets as special cases. We compare the methods to classical Monte Carlo simulations and Mean field theory, using experimental exchange parameters for a wide range of materials; MnO and NiO (single site Néel ground states), MnF$_2$ (altermagnet), Cr$_2$O$_3$ and Fe$_2$O$_3$ (two site Néel states) and Ba$_3$NbFe$_3$Si$_2$O$_{14}$ (incommensurate helimagnet). In all cases, we observe that predictions from RPA are in excellent agreement with experimental values and RPA thus constitutes a rather reliable all-purpose method for calculating critical temperatures.

Title: Moiré-Driven Interfacial Thermal Transport in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Wenwu Jiang, Ting Liang, Hekai Bu, Jianbin Xu, Wengen Ouyang
Abstract: Cross-plane thermal conductivity in homogeneous transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibits a strong dependence on twist angle, originating from atomic reconstruction within moiré superlattices. This reconstruction redistributes interlayer stacking modes, reducing high-efficiency thermal transport regions and softening the transverse acoustic phonon modes as the twist angle increases. We propose a general theoretical expression to capture this behavior, validated against non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations across both homo- and heterogeneous twisted TMDs structures, as well as homogeneous twisted graphene and hexagonal boron nitride stacks. Our model demonstrates that the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) scales with the twist angle ($\theta$) as $\ln{\left(\text{ITC}\right)} \propto e^{-\sqrt{\theta}}$. These findings advance the understanding of twist-engineered interfacial thermal transport, offering design principles for optimizing thermal management in devices based on van der Waals layered materials.

Title: Two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with spin-orbital coupling in thin spherical-shell geometry
Authors: Yan He, Chih-Chun Chien
Abstract: We present a theory of two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with tunable pairing interaction in a thin spherical shell subject to spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By incorporating SOC into the Fermi superfluid in the BCS-Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover, we obtain the energy spectrum and equations of state. While the order parameter and chemical potential are suppressed by SOC on the BCS side, the former remains positive but the latter may be pushed to negative values by SOC. Meanwhile, the compressibility exhibits kinks as the pairing interaction or SOC varies, indicating singular behavior of higher-derivatives of the free energy despite the presence of the superfluid order parameter. The minimum of the energy dispersion indicates a decoupling of the energy gap from the order parameter, and the compressibility kinks occur when the energy gap approaches zero. We found the particle-hole mixing in the Fermi superfluid essential for the compressibility kinks since a Fermi gas with the same SOC but no pairing interaction only exhibits complicated dispersions but no singular behavior. Therefore, our results show that a combination of superfluid, SOC, and geometry can lead to interesting phenomena. We also discuss possible experimental realizations and implications.

Title: Stochastic Thermodynamics of Non-reciprocally Interacting Particles and Fields
Authors: Atul Tanaji Mohite, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.

Title: Strong ergodicity breaking in dynamical mean-field equations for mixed p-spin glasses
Authors: Vincenzo Citro, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: The analytical solution to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glasses has profoundly shaped our understanding of glassy dynamics, which take place in many diverse physical systems. In particular, the idea that during the aging dynamics, the evolution becomes slower and slower, but keeps wandering in an unbounded space (a manifold of marginal states), thus forgetting any previously found configuration, has been one of the key hypotheses to achieve an analytical solution. This hypothesis, called weak ergodicity breaking, has recently been questioned by numerical simulations and attempts to solve the dynamical mean-field equations (DMFE). In this work, we introduce a new integration scheme for solving DMFE that allows us to reach very large integration times, $t=O(10^6)$, in the solution of the spherical (3+4)-spin model, quenched from close to the mode coupling temperature down to zero temperature. Thanks to this new solution, we can provide solid evidence for strong ergodicity breaking in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics on mixed p-spin glass models. Our solution to the DMFE shows that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics undergo aging, but in a restricted space: the initial condition is never forgotten, and the dynamics takes place closer and closer to configurations reached at later times. During this new restricted aging dynamics, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is richer than expected.

Title: Rheology of dilute granular gases with hard-core and inverse power-law potentials
Authors: Yuria Kobayashi, Shunsuke Iizuka, Satoshi Takada
Abstract: The kinetic theory of dilute granular gases with hard-core and inverse power-law potentials is developed. The scattering process is studied theoretically, which yields the relative speed and the impact parameter dependence of the scattering angle. The viscosity is derived from the Boltzmann equation and its temperature dependence is plotted. We also perform the direct simulation Monte Carlo to check the validity of the theory.

Title: Hopf Exceptional Points
Authors: Tsuneya Yoshida, Emil J. Bergholtz, Tomáš Bzdušek
Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.

Title: Planar Nernst effect from hidden band geometry in layered two-dimensional materials
Authors: Rahul Biswas, Harsh Varshney, Amit Agarwal
Abstract: The Nernst effect is a versatile phenomenon relevant for energy harvesting, magnetic sensing, probing band topology and charge-neutral excitations. The planar Nernst effect (PNE) generates an in-plane voltage transverse to an applied temperature gradient under an in-plane magnetic field. Conventional Berry curvature-induced PNE is absent in two-dimensional (2D) systems, as the out-of-plane Berry curvature does not couple to the in-plane electron velocity. We challenge this notion by demonstrating a distinct planar Nernst effect in quasi-2D materials (2DPNE). We show that the 2DPNE originates from previously overlooked planar components of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment, arising from inter-layer tunneling in multilayered 2D systems. We comprehensively analyze the band-geometric origin and crystalline symmetry constraints on 2DPNE responses. We illustrate its experimental feasibility in strained bilayer graphene. Our findings significantly expand the theoretical understanding of planar Nernst effects, providing a clear pathway for next-generation magnetic sensing and energy-harvesting applications.

Title: Geometrical Structure of Bifurcations during Spatial Decision-Making
Authors: Dan Gorbonos, Nir S. Gov, Iain D. Couzin
Abstract: Animals must constantly make decisions on the move, such as when choosing among multiple options, or "targets", in space. Recent evidence suggests that this results from a recursive feedback between the (vectorial) neural representation of the targets and the resulting motion defined by this consensus, which then changes the egocentric neural representation of the the options, and so on. Here we employ a simple model of this process to both explore how its dynamics account for the experimentally-observed abruptly-branching trajectories exhibited by animals during spatial decision-making, and to provide new insights into spatiotemporal computation. Essential neural dynamics, notably local excitation and long-range inhibition, are captured in our model via spin-system dynamics, with groups of Ising-spins representing neural "activity bumps" corresponding to target directions. Analysis, employing a novel "mean-field trajectory" approach, reveals the nature of the spontaneous symmetry breaking - bifurcations in the model that result in literal bifurcations in trajectory space and how it results in new geometric principles for spatiotemporal decision-making. We find that all bifurcation points, beyond the very first, fall on a small number of "bifurcation curves". It is the spatial organization of these curves that is shown to be key to determining the shape of the trajectories, such as self-similar or space filling, exhibited during decision-making, irrespective of the trajectory's starting point. Furthermore, we find that a non-Euclidean representation of space considerably reduces the number of bifurcation points in many geometrical configurations, preventing endless indecision and promoting effective spatial decision-making. This suggests that a non-Euclidean neural representation of space may be expected to have evolved across species in order to facilitate spatial decision-making.

Title: Perturbative criteria for the ergodicity of interacting dissipative quantum lattice systems
Authors: Lorenzo Bertini, Alberto De Sole, Gustavo Posta, Carlo Presilla
Abstract: We introduce a class of quantum Markov semigroups describing the evolution of interacting quantum lattice systems, specified either as generic qudits or as fermions. The corresponding generators, which include both conservative and dissipative evolutions, are given by the superposition of local generators in the Lindblad form. Under general conditions, we show that the associated infinite volume dynamics is well defined and can be obtained as the strong limit of the finite volume dynamics. By regarding the interacting evolution as a perturbation of a non-interacting dissipative dynamics, we further obtain a quantitative criterion that yields the ergodicity of the quantum Markov semigroup together with the exponential convergence of local observables. The analysis is based on suitable a priori bounds on the resolvent equation which yield quantitive estimates on the evolution of local observables.

Title: Adaptive Time Stepping for the Two-Time Integro-Differential Kadanoff-Baym Equations
Authors: Thomas Blommel, David J. Gardner, Carol S. Woodward, Emanuel Gull
Abstract: The non-equilibrium Green's function gives access to one-body observables for quantum systems. Of particular interest are quantities such as density, currents, and absorption spectra which are important for interpreting experimental results in quantum transport and spectroscopy. We present an integration scheme for the Green's function's equations of motion, the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBE), which is both adaptive in the time integrator step size and method order as well as the history integration order. We analyze the importance of solving the KBE self-consistently and show that adapting the order of history integral evaluation is important for obtaining accurate results. To examine the efficiency of our method, we compare runtimes to a state of the art fixed time step integrator for several test systems and show an order of magnitude speedup at similar levels of accuracy.

Title: Dynamics of decoherence in a noisy driven environment
Authors: R. Jafari, A. Asadian, M. Abdi, Alireza Akbari
Abstract: We analyze the decoherence dynamics of a central spin coupled to a spin chain with a time-dependent noisy magnetic field, focusing on how noise influences the system's decoherence. Our results show that decoherence due to the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the environment is amplified in the presence of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise. We demonstrate that decoherence factor consistently signals the critical points, and exhibits exponential scaling with the system size, the square of noise intensity, and the noise correlation time at the critical points. We find that strong coupling between the qubit and the environment leads to partial revivals of decoherence, which diminish with increasing noise intensity or decreasing noise correlation time. In contrast, weak coupling leads to monotonic enhanced decoherence. The numerical results illustrate that, the revivals decay and scale exponentially with noise intensity. Moreover, the revivals increase and indicate linear or power law scaling with noise correlation time depends on how the correlated noise is fast or slow. Additionally, we explore the non-Markovianity of the dynamics, finding that it decays in the presence of noise but increases as the noise correlation time grows.

Title: Distinguishing Ion Dynamics from Muon Diffusion in Muon Spin Relaxation II -- Extension to Paramagnetic Muons
Authors: Ryosuke Kadono, Takashi U. Ito
Abstract: We extend the previously published model that distinguishes between the diffusive motion of diamagnetic muons and the dynamics of ions around the muon in matter, and propose a generalized model for {\sl paramagnetic muons} (Mu$^0$s, bound states of a muon and an unpaired electron) observed in non-metallic host materials. The new model distinguishes among the independent motion of unpaired electron associated with Mu$^0$, the self-diffusive motion of Mu$^0$ as single atomic entity, and that of the ions surrounding Mu$^0$, where the muon spin relaxation is induced by dynamical fluctuations of the hyperfine (HF) field exerted from the unpaired electron (e.g., due to spin/charge exchange reaction) and/or that of the nuclear hyperfine (NHF) interactions between the unpaired electron and the surrounding ions. We have applied this model to the muonated radicals (Mu$^0$s in a polaron state) in conducting polymers, and examined the validity of the interpretations claimed in the earlier literature that the spin relaxation is induced by quasi-one dimensional motion of the unpaired electron. The result suggests that experimental support for such a claim is still inadequate and needs to be reexamined, including the possibility of other origins for the fluctuations. It is expected that our model will prove a useful guide for $\mu$SR studies of various local dynamics involving paramagnetic muon states.

Title: Constraining the origin of magnetic white dwarfs
Authors: Ananya Mohapatra, Eric G. Blackman
Abstract: The origin of magnetic white dwarfs (MWDs) has been a long-standing puzzle. Proposed origin mechanisms have included: fossil fields frozen in from the progenitor convective core; a dynamo in the progenitor envelope; crystallization dynamos in sufficiently cool white dwarfs; and accretion disk dynamos from white dwarf-white dwarf mergers or tidally shredded low-mass stellar or planetary companions. Here we show how observational constraints on white dwarf magnetic field strengths, ages, and masses can be used to narrow down the viability of proposed origin mechanisms. Using data from both the Montreal White Dwarf Database and a 20 pc volume-limited sample from Gaia DR2, we find that the fossil field mechanism overpredicts the number of magnetic white dwarfs, which suggests, as supported by theoretical arguments, that the field is not actually frozen into the progenitor cores but diffuses before the white dwarf forms. Crystallization dynamos, occur too late to explain the bulk of magnetic white dwarfs. And with the progenitor envelope dynamos impeded by the theoretical challenge of depositing a field from envelope to white dwarf core, the two disk dynamo mechanisms emerge as the field origin mechanisms most resilient to present constraints, with mergers best able to explain the high mass, strongly magnetized young MWDs. The methods herein also reveal observational data gaps, and motivate future acquisition of more complete data.

Title: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and average symmetry protected topological order in the doubled Hilbert space
Authors: Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Target model in this study is an extended version of the cluster model in one dimension with $Z_2\otimes Z_2$ symmetry, and we investigate effects of decoherence applied to the ground state of the model, focusing on the symmetry aspect. By using a scheme that we propose, a strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) mixed state and double average SPT (ASPT) state are constructed through the pure gapless SPT order and the domain-wall duality. Among them, the double ASPT is categorized by coexisting orders, i.e., a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and ASPT defined by the remaining weak and strong symmetries. We make use of the doubled Hilbert space formalism for the construction scheme. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of the two mixed SPT states and find that a phase transition occurs between them tuned by the strength of decoherence. Finally, we discuss the coexistence of SPT and SWSSB in the double SPT state from the view point of symmetrically invertible property, and comment on the classification of ASPT proposed recently. Suitable multiple-decoherence channel applied to SPT states gives a broad possibility to induce rich ASPTs, possessing non-trivial internal entanglement properties from the view of doubled Hilbert space formalism.

Authors: Thomas J. Maldonado, Alejandro W. Rodriguez, Hakan E. Türeci
Abstract: Superconducting circuits comprising Josephson junctions have spurred significant research activity due to their promise to realize scalable quantum computers. Effective Hamiltonians for these systems have traditionally been derived assuming the junction connects superconducting islands of infinite size. We derive a quantized Hamiltonian for a Josephson junction between finite-sized islands and predict measurable corrections to the qubit frequency and charge susceptibility to test the theory.

Title: Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional
Authors: Sanjeev Raja, Martin Šípka, Michael Psenka, Tobias Kreiman, Michal Pavelka, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan
Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.

Title: A Family of Self-Dual Quasicrystals with Critical Phases
Authors: Wenzhi Wang, Wei Yi, Tianyu Li
Abstract: We propose a general framework for constructing self-dual one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with arbitrary-range hoppings and multifractal behaviors. Our framework generates a broad spectrum of quasicrystals, ranging from the off-diagonal Aubry-André-Harper models on one end, to those with long-range power-law hoppings on another. Focusing on models with off-diagonal quasiperiodic hoppings with power-law decay, we exploit the fact that, when the self-dual condition is satisfied, the system must be in the critical state with multifractal properties. This enables the engineering of models with competing extended, critical, and localized phases, with rich mobility edges in between. As an outstanding example, we show that a limiting case of our family of self-dual quasicrystals can be implemented using Rydberg-atom arrays. Our work offers a systematic route toward self-duality and critical phases, and would facilitate their experimental simulation.
