Title: Moiré $M$-valley bilayers: quasi-one-dimensional physics, unconventional spin textures and twisted van Hove singularities
Authors: Julian Ingham, Mathias S. Scheurer, Harley D. Scammell
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of quasi-two-dimensional kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$, we consider the theory of twisted bilayers in which the Fermi surface is near the $M$-point. Surprisingly, unlike twisted bilayers of graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides, the moiré potential is quasi-one-dimensional: at each $M$-valley, the potential flattens the dispersion strongly along one direction, and weakly along the perpendicular direction. The combination of spin-orbit coupling and twist-induced broken inversion symmetry results in a similarly anisotropic `$\textit{moiré-Rashba}$' potential, which spin-splits the dispersion into coexisting two-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional bands. We discuss novel aspects of the interplay between mixed dimensionality and spin textures in this platform. First, an applied electric field produces spin polarisation which can be tuned by doping, suggesting potential spintronics applications. Secondly, an in-plane magnetic field momentum- and spin-polarises the Fermi surfaces, producing unconventional spin density waves. Thirdly, in the small-twist-angle limit, the large density of states due to a twisted van Hove singularity near $M$ results in a dense energy spectrum. Our results demonstrate a new variation of moiré bandstructure engineering, instigating the study of spin-textured one-dimensional physics in moiré materials.

Title: Deep Learning Sheds Light on Integer and Fractional Topological Insulators
Authors: Xiang Li, Yixiao Chen, Bohao Li, Haoxiang Chen, Fengcheng Wu, Ji Chen, Weiluo Ren
Abstract: Electronic topological phases of matter, characterized by robust boundary states derived from topologically nontrivial bulk states, are pivotal for next-generation electronic devices. However, understanding their complex quantum phases, especially at larger scales and fractional fillings with strong electron correlations, has long posed a formidable computational challenge. Here, we employ a deep learning framework to express the many-body wavefunction of topological states in twisted ${\rm MoTe_2}$ systems, where diverse topological states are observed. Leveraging neural networks, we demonstrate the ability to identify and characterize topological phases, including the integer and fractional Chern insulators as well as the $Z_2$ topological insulators. Our deep learning approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, not only in computational efficiency but also in accuracy, enabling us to study larger systems and differentiate between competing phases such as fractional Chern insulators and charge density waves. Our predictions align closely with experimental observations, highlighting the potential of deep learning techniques to explore the rich landscape of topological and strongly correlated phenomena.

Title: Quantum Hall effect in a chiral cavity
Authors: Liu Yang, Gabriel Cardoso, Thors Hans Hansson, Qing-Dong Jiang
Abstract: We investigate the influence of quantum fluctuations in a chiral cavity on the quantum Hall (QH) state, extending previous studies of QH liquids in linearly polarized cavities. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for perturbative cavity-matter interaction, we identify the system's normal modes, which correspond to the elementary excitations of the dressed electrons and photons. In contrast to the linear case, we find that the chiral cavity modifies the Kohn mode frequency by a contribution proportional to the cyclotron frequency, which can be interpreted as a renormalization of the magnetic field by cavity fluctuations. We show that the AC conductivities display cavity-induced corrections, including an isotropic quantum reactance effect and a rotating total-current response under applied AC fields. These findings are also derived from a hydrodynamic approach, which extends their validity to fractional quantum Hall states. Finally, we examine the role of finite cavity quality factor and find that while photon losses introduce resistive contributions to the impedance, these vanish in the DC limit. Our results provide insights into the interplay between quantum Hall states and chiral cavities, with significant implications for material engineering and cavity-induced topological effects.

Title: A Jammed Parisi Ansatz
Authors: Michael Winer, Aidan Herderschee
Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems are ubiquitous in fields ranging from the physics of solids to artificial intelligence. In many cases, such systems undergo a transition when the ratio of constraints to variables reaches some value $\alpha_{\textrm{crit}}$. Above this critical value, it is exponentially unlikely that all constraints can be mutually satisfied. We calculate the probability that constraints can all be satisfied, $P(\textrm{SAT})$, for the spherical perceptron. Traditional replica methods, such as the Parisi ansatz, fall short. We find a new ansatz, the jammed Parisi ansatz, that correctly describes the behavior of the system in this regime. With the jammed Parisi ansatz, we calculate $P(\textrm{SAT})$ for the first time and match previous computations of thresholds. We anticipate that the techniques developed here will be applicable to general constraint satisfaction problems and the identification of hidden structures in data sets.

Title: Twist-angle evolution of the intervalley-coherent antiferromagnet in twisted WSe$_2$
Authors: Daniel Muñoz-Segovia, Valentin Crépel, Raquel Queiroz, Andrew J. Millis
Abstract: Recent experimental reports of correlated physics in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ have spurred interest in the interplay of electronic interactions and topology in this system. Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.

Title: Effective Conformal Field Theory generated from Pure and Dephased Chern insulator
Authors: Abhijat Sarma, Yimu Bao, Nayan Myerson-Jain, Thomas Kiely, Cenke Xu
Abstract: We demonstrate that the fidelity between two states with different Chern numbers $\mathcal Z = \mathrm{tr} \{ \rho \rho' \} $ serves as a generating theory for an effective conformal field theory (CFT) at the $(2+0)d$ temporal interface. $\rho$ can be chosen as a pure trivial insulator, and $\rho'$ can be taken as a pure or dephased Chern insulator density matrix. More specifically, we obtain the following results: (1) through evaluation of the effective central charge, stiffness, and correlation function (the ``strange correlators"), we demonstrate that the fidelity between a trivial insulator and an insulator with Chern number $C=1$ maps to a CFT with effective central charge $c_{\rm eff} = 1$; while the fidelity between two Chern insulators with Chern numbers $C = \pm 1$ maps to a CFT with $c_{\rm eff} = 2$. (2) The density matrix of the Chern insulator becomes a quantum spin Hall insulator in the doubled Hilbert space, and the dephasing acts as interaction between the two spin species. (3) In the limit of infinite dephasing the Chern insulator becomes a superconductor in the doubled Hilbert space, featuring the ``strong-weak" U(1) spontaneous symmetry breaking. The analysis based on Laughlin wave function and previous studies of projected wave function of quantum spin Hall insulator suggest this is a power-law superconductor. (4) With increasing strength of dephasing, the amplitude of single particle strange correlator is suppressed, while the Cooper pair strange correlator is enhanced, consistent with the trend of emerging superconductivity.

Title: Atomic-Scale Investigation of an Asymmetric SrTiO$_{3}$ Grain Boundary
Authors: Janina Malin Rybak, Jonas Arlt, Qian Ma, Carmen Fuchs, Baptiste Gault, Timo Jacob, Christian Jooss, Tobias Meyer, Cynthia A. Volkert
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) in oxide perovskites significantly influence their functional properties. This study examines the atomic-scale structure and composition of a faceted asymmetric grain boundary in strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$) using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), atom probe tomography (APT), and density functional theory (DFT). STEM and APT reveal an atomically sharp boundary with asymmetric and symmetric facets, marked by strong Sr depletion over a width of less than 1 nm. STEM-EELS shows Ti concentration variations of up to 20% between facets, while APT constrains this variation to less than 10%. DFT$+U$ calculations of a symmetric ${\Sigma}$5 facet confirm that Sr depletion minimizes boundary energy while maintaining Ti content. The variation in Ti suggests cation mobility that enables local energy minimization. Differences in facet surface energies likely drive Ti redistribution, offering strategies for GB structure control. This combined experimental-theoretical approach provides key insights into the structure and energy landscape of GBs in SrTiO$_3$, aiding in the prediction of their impact on ionic and electronic transport.

Title: Mechanical resonant sensing of spin texture dynamics in a two-dimensional antiferromagnet
Authors: S M Enamul Hoque Yousuf, Yunong Wang, Shreyas Ramachandran, John Koptur-Palenchar, Chiara Tarantini, Li Xiang, Stephen McGill, Dmitry Smirnov, Elton J. G. Santos, Philip X.-L. Feng, Xiao-Xiao Zhang
Abstract: The coupling between the spin degrees of freedom and macroscopic mechanical motions, including striction, shearing, and rotation, has attracted wide interest with applications in actuation, transduction, and information processing. Experiments so far have established the mechanical responses to the long-range ordered or isolated single spin states. However, it remains elusive whether mechanical motions can couple to a different type of magnetic structure, the non-collinear spin textures, which exhibit nanoscale spatial variations of spin (domain walls, skyrmions, etc.) and are promising candidates to realize high-speed computing devices. Here, we report the detection of collective spin texture dynamics with nanoelectromechanical resonators made of two-dimensional antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnPS3 with $10^{-9}$ strain sensitivity. By examining radio frequency mechanical oscillations under magnetic fields, new magnetic transitions were identified with sharp dips in resonant frequency. They are attributed to the collective AFM domain wall motions as supported by the analytical modeling of magnetostriction and large-scale spin-dynamics simulations. Additionally, an abnormally large modulation in the mechanical nonlinearity at the transition field infers a fluid-like response due to the ultrafast domain motion. Our work establishes a strong coupling between spin texture and mechanical dynamics, laying the foundation for electromechanical manipulation of spin texture and developing quantum hybrid devices.

Title: Physicochemical Characterization of a New 2D Semiconductor Carbon Allotrope, C16: An Investigation via Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning-based Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Kleuton A. L. Lima, Rodrigo A. F. Alves, Elie A. Moujaes, Alexandre C. Dias, Douglas S. Galvão, Marcelo L. Pereira Jr, Luiz A. Ribeiro Jr
Abstract: This study comprehensively characterizes, with suggested applications, a novel two-dimensional carbon allotrope, C$_{16}$, using Density Functional Theory and machine learning-based molecular dynamics. This nanomaterial is derived from naphthalene and bicyclopropylidene molecules, forming a planar configuration with sp$^2$ hybridization and featuring 3-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-membered rings. Cohesive energy of \SI{-7.1}{\electronvolt/atom}, absence of imaginary frequencies in the phonon spectrum, and the retention of the system's topology after ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm the structural stability of C$_{16}$. The nanomaterial exhibits a semiconducting behavior with a direct band gap of \SI{0.59}{\electronvolt} and anisotropic optical absorption in the $y$ direction. Assuming a complete absorption of incident light, it registers a power conversion efficiency of \SI{13}{\percent}, demonstrating relatively good potential for applications in solar energy conversion. The thermoelectric figure of merit ($zT$) reaches 0.8 at elevated temperatures, indicating a reasonable ability to convert a temperature gradient into electrical power. Additionally, C$_{16}$ demonstrates high mechanical strength, with Young's modulus values of \SI{500}{\giga\pascal} and \SI{630}{\giga\pascal} in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. Insights into the electronic, optical, thermoelectric, and mechanical properties of C$_{16}$ reveal its promising capability for energy conversion applications.

Title: Machine-Learning Interatomic Potential for Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Accurate Structural Relaxation and Emergent Polarization
Authors: Wilson Nieto Luna, Robin Smeyers, Cem Sevik, Lucian Covaci, Milorad V. Milošević
Abstract: The emerging ferroelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures are at the forefront of science and prospective technology. In moiré bilayers, twisting or heterostructuring causes local atomic reconstruction, which even at picometer scale, can lead to pronounced ferroelectric polarization. Accurately determining this reconstruction utilizing ab initio methods is unfeasible for the relevant system sizes, but modern machine-learning interatomic potentials offer a viable solution. Here, we present the Gaussian Approximation Potential for twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers validated against ab initio datasets. This approach enables the precise analysis of their structural properties, which is particularly relevant at small twist angles. We couple the structural information to a tight-binding model based on accurate interatomic positioning, and determine the twist-dependent polarization, yielding results that closely align with previous experimental findings - even at room temperature. This methodology enables further studies that are unattainable otherwise and is transferable to other 2D materials of interest.

Title: Anthraphenylenes: Porous 2D Carbon Monolayers with Biphenyl-Anthracene Frameworks and Type-II Dirac line nodes
Authors: K. A. L. Lima, José A. S. Laranjeira, Nicolas F. Martins, Sérgio A. Azevedod, Julio R. Sambrano, L.A. Ribeiro Junior
Abstract: Carbon's versatility allows it to form diverse structures with unique properties, driven by its moderate electronegativity, small ionic radius, and ability to adopt \textit{sp}, \textit{sp\textsuperscript{2}}, and \textit{sp\textsuperscript{3}} hybridizations, individually or in combination. In this work, we introduce three novel 2D carbon allotropes -- $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$-anthraphenylenes -- derived from biphenylene and Dewar-anthracene motifs, investigated through density functional theory calculations. Their thermodynamic and dynamic stability are confirmed by cohesive energy ($-7.02$ to $-7.26$ eV/atom), phonon dispersion, and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations. The electronic structure analysis shows that all three anthraphenylenes display metallic behavior. All anthraphenylenes feature type-II Dirac Line Nodes (DLNs). Mechanical analysis highlights significant anisotropy, mainly in $\gamma$-anthraphenylene, which exhibits the highest rigidity. These monolayers feature a porous architecture with tunable mechanical properties, making them promising candidates for nanoelectronics and energy storage applications. By expanding the family of 2D carbon materials, anthraphenylenes provide new avenues for functional nanomaterial design.

Title: From 2D to 1D in beta-Naphthyne: A Porous Carbon Allotrope Merging Graphyne and Naphthylene
Authors: Jose A. S. Laranjeira, Kleuton A. L. Lima, Nicolas F. Martins, Marcelo L. P. Junior, L.A. Ribeiro Junior, Julio R. Sambrano
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based materials have attracted considerable interest due to their diverse structural and electronic properties, making them ideal for next-generation flat electronics. Among these materials, metallic-like porous structures offer advantages such as tunable charge transport and high surface area, which are essential for energy storage applications. In this study, we introduce beta-naphthyne, a novel 2D carbon allotrope composed of naphthyl units interconnected by octagonal rings. First-principles calculations confirm its dynamic and thermal stability, demonstrating its theoretical feasibility. Our results confirm its energetic, dynamic, and mechanical stability and its metallic nature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Young's modulus ranges from 46.60 N/m to 164.47 N/m, indicating an anisotropic mechanical response. Optical analysis reveals absorption activity in the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) regions. The 1D structures were also analyzed, revealing a Dirac cone and a transition from metallic to semiconducting behavior. These findings establish beta-naphthyne as a promising material for energy storage and optoelectronic technologies.

Title: On the thermodynamic limit of bipartite spin networks
Authors: Simone Franchini
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the thermodynamic limit in a general bipartite spin network with pairwise interactions. This is done by integrating one of the the spin groups, to transform the bipartite problem into a single group problem with a non-linear Hamiltonian. The transformed model is also relevant due to similarity with the LCVAE architecture.

Title: Evolution of surface morphology from Stranski Krastanov growth mode to step flow growth mode in InSbBi thin films
Authors: Chandima Kasun Edirisinghe, Anuradha Wijesinghe, Anjali Rathore, Pradip Adhikari, Christopher Rouleau, Joon Sue Lee
Abstract: The incorporation of dilute concentrations of bismuth (Bi) into traditional III V alloys leads to significant reduction in bandgap energy, making InSbBi is a promising candidate for long wavelength infrared photodetection sensors due to its small bandgap (<0.17 eV). Furthermore, InSbBi could serve as a valuable platform for spin dynamics and quantum phenomena due to its strong spin-orbit coupling. Despite its potential, the material quality of InSbBi alloys lags behind that of conventional III V semiconductors, primarily due to the substantial challenges associated with incorporating Bi into InSb and producing high-quality InSbBi with varying Bi compositions. In this study, we address these issues by developing a method for growing smooth InSbBi thin films with tunable Bi incorporation up to 1.81% by the dynamic adjustment of Sb flux and careful control of the interplay between growth temperature and Bi flux using molecular beam epitaxy. This work paves the path for high-quality InSbBi thin films for applications in photodetection, spintronics, and quantum technology.

Title: Dirac node pinning from Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a Kagome spin liquid
Authors: Ajesh Kumar, Byungmin Kang, Patrick A. Lee
Abstract: Recent experiments on the Kagome spin liquid candidate YCOB suggest the presence of Dirac fermionic spinons near the magnetization plateau at 1/9. Theories suggest that the spinons are charge neutral spin-$1/2$ excitations, in a $2\pi/3$ flux which triples the unit cell. Generally a gap is expected, and there is no symmetry protection for the Dirac nodes in this system. The question arises as to what causes the nodes and stabilizes them. In this work, we propose a node-creation and node-pinning mechanism driven by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Employing Gutzwiller-projected variational Monte Carlo calculations, we demonstrate that DM interactions induce a band closing phase transition in the spinon spectrum. There is a change in the Chern number when the bands are inverted. Together with the DM-generated internal gauge flux, the coupling to the spinon orbital magnetization counteracts the band reopening. This interplay energetically pins the Dirac nodes over a range of parameters.

Title: Autonomous Small-Angle Scattering for Accelerated Soft Material Formulation Optimization
Authors: Tyler B. Martin, Duncan R. Sutherland, Austin McDannald, A. Gilad Kusne, Peter A. Beaucage
Abstract: The pace of soft material formulation (re)development and design is rapidly increasing as both consumers and new legislation demand products that do less harm to the environment while maintaining high standards of performance. To meet this need, we have developed the Autonomous Formulation Lab (AFL), a platform that can automatically prepare and measure the microstructure of liquid formulations using small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering and, soon, a variety of other techniques. Here, we describe the design, philosophy, tuning, and validation of our active learning agent that guides the course of AFL experiments. We show how our extensive in silico tuning results in an efficient agent that is robust to both the number of measurements and signal to noise variation. Finally, we experimentally validate our virtually tuned agent by addressing a model formulation problem: replacing a petroleum-derived component with a natural analog. We show that the agent efficiently maps both formulations and how post hoc analysis of the measured data reveals the opportunity for further specialization of the agent. With the tuned and proven active learning agent, our autonomously guided AFL platform will accelerate the pace of discovery of liquid formulations and help speed us towards a greener future.

Title: Quantum critical point followed by Kondo-like behavior due to Cu substitution in itinerant, antiferromagnet ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$
Authors: Atreyee Das, Siham Mohamed, Raquel A. Ribeiro, Tyler J. Slade, Juan Schmidt, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield
Abstract: $\text{La}_2 \text{Ni}_7$ is an itinerant magnet with a small saturated moment of $\sim$ 0.1 $\mu_{B}/\text{Ni}$ and a series of antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at $T_1$ = 61.0 K, $T_2$ = 56.5 K and $T_3$ = 42.2 K. Temperature and field dependent measurements suggest a complex, anisotropic $H-T$ phase diagram with multiple phase lines. Here we present the growth and characterization of single crystals of the ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$ series for 0 $\leq x \leq$ 0.181. Using a suite of anisotropic magnetic, transport, and thermodynamic measurements we study the evolution of the three AFM transitions upon Cu substitution. For ${0 \leq x \leq 0.097}$, the system remains magnetically ordered at base temperature with $x \leq$ 0.012, showing signs of three primarily AFM phases. For the higher substitution levels, ${0.125 \leq x \leq 0.181}$, there are no signatures of magnetic ordering, but an anomalous feature in resistance and heat capacity data are observed which are consistent with the Kondo effect in this system. The intermediate $x$ = 0.105 sample lies in between the magnetic ordered and the Kondo regime and is in the vicinity of the AFM-quantum critical point (QCP). Thus, ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$ is an example of a small moment system that can be tuned through a QCP. Given these data combined with the fact that the $\text{La}_2 \text{Ni}_7$ structure has kagome-like, Ni-sublattice running perpendicular to the crystallographic $c-$ axis, and a $3d$-electron flat band that contributes to the density of states near the Fermi energy, it becomes a promising candidate to host and study exotic physics.

Title: Superconducting dome and structural changes in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ under pressure
Authors: Zhuoqi Li, Shuyuan Huyan, Elizabeth C. Thompson, Tyler J. Slade, Dongzhou Zhang, Young J. Ryu, Wenli Bi, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield
Abstract: LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is of current research interest as a kagome metal with a superconducting transition temperature, $T_c\sim$7 K and higher temperature charge density wave (CDW) orders. Here we report electrical transport and X-ray diffraction measurements on LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ under pressure up to 65 GPa and 35 GPa respectively. The superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ first gets slightly enhanced and reaches a maximum $\sim$8.7 K at $\sim$8.5 GPa. With further applied pressure, $T_c$ is initially gradually suppressed, then more rapidly suppressed, followed by gradual suppression, revealing a superconducting dome. Two possible pressure-induced structural phase transitions are also observed at room temperature, from original hexagonal phase to another hexagonal structure above $\sim$11.5 GPa, and further to a structure with lower symmetry above $\sim$23.5 GPa. These transition pressures roughly correlate with features found in our pressure dependent transport data.

Title: Dynamical field theories for biaxial liquid crystals
Authors: Anouar El Moumane, René Wittmann, Hartmut Löwen, Michael te Vrugt
Abstract: Phase field crystal (PFC) models constitute central tools for a microscopic understanding of the dynamics of complex systems in soft matter physics. They have found widespread application in the modeling of the uniaxial orientational ordering of liquid crystals. However, only very limited progress has been made in applying them to the more complex cases of biaxial phases and biaxial particles. Here, we discuss the microscopic derivation of PFC models for biaxial liquid crystals. We illustrate it by presenting two models, one involving four scalar orientational order parameters relevant for the dynamics of biaxial particles, and one involving two scalar order parameters and a director field to describe biaxial phases in a three-dimensional uniaxial nematic liquid crystal. These models allow for an efficient simulation of spatially inhomogeneous biaxial orientational ordering dynamics. We also combine a microscopic and macroscopic approach to extract model coefficients for a full biaxial model from the microscopic derivation for a simple special case. This universal method also enables to perform derivations for other low-symmetry particles where, due to the complexity of the general case, this has not been previously attempted.

Title: Revealing electronic correlations in YNi$_2$B$_2$C using photoemission spectroscopy
Authors: Aki Pulkkinen, Geoffroy Kremer, Vladimir N. Strocov, Frank Weber, Ján Minár, Claude Monney
Abstract: We present a combined density functional theory (DFT), one-step model of photoemission, and soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) study of the electronic structure of the quaternary borocarbide superconductor YNi$_2$B$_2$C. Our analysis reveals the presence of moderate electronic correlations beyond the semilocal DFT within the generalized gradient approximation. We show that DFT and the full potential Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) with average Coulomb interaction U = 3.0 eV and the exchange energy J = 0.9 eV applied to the Ni d-states are necessary for reproducing the experimentally observed SX-ARPES spectra.

Title: Spectroscopic signatures of biexcitons: A case study in Ruddlesden-Popper lead-halides
Authors: Katherine A. Koch, Esteban Rojas-Gatjens, Martin Gomez-Dominguez, Juan-Pablo Correa-Baena, Carlos Silva-Acuna, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada
Abstract: Exciton-exciton interactions are fundamental to the light-emitting properties of semiconductors, influencing applications from lasers to quantum light sources. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic signatures and binding energy of biexcitons in a metal halide two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper structure, which is known for hosting distinct excitonic resonances with unique lattice coupling. Using three spectroscopic techniques - photoluminescence (PL) and two variations of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) - we map coherent one-quantum and two-quantum correlations to gain deeper insight into the biexciton characteristics. While PL spectroscopy is hindered by spectral broadening and reabsorption, 2DES provides a more accurate characterization, revealing multiple biexciton states and uncovering a mixed biexciton species arising from exciton cross-coupling. These findings highlight the importance of advanced spectroscopic approaches in accurately determining biexciton binding energies and offer new perspectives on many-body interactions in exciton-polarons within layered perovskites.

Title: Exceptions to the Ratchet Principle in active and passive stochastic dynamics
Authors: Jessica Metzger, Sunghan Ro, Julien Tailleur
Abstract: The "ratchet principle" asserts that non-equilibrium systems which violate parity symmetry generically exhibit steady-state currents. As recently shown, there are exceptions to this principle, due to the existence of hidden time-reversal symmetry or bulk momentum conservation. For underdamped and overdamped Brownian dynamics, we show how thermal fluctuations cannot power the momentum sources required to sustain steady ratchet currents, even when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to an inhomogeneous temperature field. While Active Brownian and Run-and-Tumble particles display interaction-induced ratchet currents in asymmetric activity landscapes, we show that this is not the case for Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles: not all inhomogeneous active fluctuations lead to net momentum sources. For each of the systems considered in this article, we numerically test for the emergence of interaction-induced ratchet currents. We then characterize time-reversal (as)symmetry in position space using a combination of path-integral and operator methods. When the existence of effective momentum conservation is ruled out, we develop perturbation theories to characterize the onset of interaction-induced currents.

Title: Periodic phase slips and frequency comb generation at tunable microwave frequencies in superconducting diabolo structures
Authors: Axel J. M. Deenen, Dirk Grundler
Abstract: Superconductors are characterized by macroscopic phase coherence and have enabled cryogenic electronics and quantum technologies. Recent advances in 3D nanofabrication now offer possibilities for tuning functional properties relevant for on-chip 3D integration of superconductors. However, non-equilibrium phenomena in 3D nanostructures exposed to transport currents remain largeley unexplored. Here, we employ numerical simulations to investigate phase slips -- discrete $2\pi$ jumps in the phase of the superconducting order parameter -- in a tubular Nb superconductor with a central constriction, which is subjected to both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) transport currents. We find that under DC drive, the system stabilizes periodic phase slips, resulting in GHz voltage oscillations. Introducing an additional AC frequency modulation generates microwave frequency combs which depend characteristically on the interaction between moving vortices and phase slips. Our findings open avenues for developing on-chip frequency comb generators in 3D cryoelectronics.

Title: Tunable resonant s-p mixing of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Jiayu David Cao, Konstantin S. Denisov, Igor Zutic
Abstract: Excitonic states of tightly-bound electron-hole pairs dominate the optical response in a growing class of two-dimensional (2D) materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) a useful guidance for the excitonic spectrum is the analogy with the states in the 2D hydrogen atom. From our symmetry analysis and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equations we find a much richer picture for excitons and predict their tunable resonant s-p mixing. The resonance is attained when the subband splitting matches the energy difference between the 1s and 2p+ (or 2p-) excitons, resulting in the anticrossing of the spectral lines in the absorption as a function of the subband splitting. By focusing on TMDs modified by magnetic proximity, and gated 3R-stacked bilayer TMD, we corroborate the feasibility of such tunable spin splitting. The resulting tunable and bright s-p excitons provide unexplored opportunities for their manipulation and enable optical detection of Rashba or interlayer coupling in vdW heterostructures.

Title: Trilinear coupling and toroidicity in multiferroics
Authors: Andrea Urru, Alessio Filippetti, Jorge Íñiguez-Gonzàlez, Vincenzo Fiorentini
Abstract: Magnetoelectric responses are related in general to magnetic multipoles, and in particular the off-diagonal linear response is proportional to the toroidization order parameter. In multiferroics with three order parameters (polarization, magnetization, and toroidization), such response turns out to be also proportional to the trilinear coupling between the order parameters. Here we explore this scenario, discussing the effects of such trilinear coupling within a Landau theory framework, and using ab initio calculations to discuss a specific model system for this effect, namely the recently predicted three-order-parameter multiferroic metal Bi$_5$Mn$_5$O$_{17}$.

Title: Vacancy-induced Modification of Electronic Band Structure of LiBO$_{2}$ Material as Cathode Surface Coating of Lithium-ion Batteries
Authors: Ha M. Nguyen, Carson D. Ziemke, Narendirakumar Narayanan, Sebastian Amaya-Roncanci, John Gahl, Yangchuan Xing, Thomas W. Heitmann, Carlos Wexler
Abstract: LiBO$_{2}$ is an electronic insulator and a promising surface coating for stabilizing high-voltage cathodes in lithium-ion batteries. Despite its potential, the functional mechanisms of this coating remain unclear, particularly the transport of lithium ions and electrons through LiBO$_{2}$ in the presence of lattice vacancies. This understanding is critical for the design and development of LiBO$_{2}$-based materials. In our previous work [Ziemke $\textit{et al.}$, J. Mater. Chem. A, 2025, $\textbf{13}$, 3146-3162], we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the impact of lattice vacancies on Li-ion transport in both tetragonal (t-LBO) and monoclinic (m-LBO) polymorphs of LiBO$_{2}$, revealing that B vacancies in either polymorph enhanced lithium-ion transport. In this study, we expand on these findings by using DFT calculations to examine the effects of lattice vacancies on the electronic properties of both t-LBO and m-LBO polymorphs,focusing on the electronic band structure. Our analysis shows that B vacancies can enhance the electronic insulation of t-LBO while improving the ionic conduction of m-LBO. The combined results of our previous and current works indicate that B vacancy generation in LiBO$_{2}$ may enable t-LBO to function as a promising solid electrolyte and enhance the performance of m-LBO as a conformal cathode coating in lithium-ion batteries. Overall, generating B vacancies, such as through neutron irradiation, would offer a viable strategy to improve the functionality of LiBO$_{2}$ as a promising material for energy storage applications.

Title: Oxygen vacancy engineering in pulsed laser deposited BaSnO$_3$ thin films on SrTiO$_3$
Authors: Wilson Román Acevedo, Myriam H. Aguirre, Beatriz Noheda, Diego Rubi
Abstract: We demonstrate the tunability of oxygen content in pulsed laser deposition (PLD)-grown barium stannate (BaSn$O_3$, BSO) thin films by precisely controlling the background oxygen pressure over a broad range from 0.0004 mbar to 0.13 mbar. The introduction of oxygen vacancies significantly alters the structural properties of BSO films, inducing a monotonic expansion of the out-of-plane lattice parameter and cell volume as the vacancy concentration increases. The progressive formation of oxygen vacancies was spectroscopically tracked using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), providing direct insight into the vacancy evolution. Furthermore, we show that the oxygen stoichiometry in BSO plays a critical role in modulating the sheet resistance of BSO/LaScO$_3$ heterostructures, enabling interface metallic electron conduction. This oxygen content control offers a robust strategy to tailor the electronic properties at the interface, highlighting its potential for oxide electronics and functional interface engineering.

Title: Soft mode induced structural phase transition in Ba$_2$ZnTeO$_6$ at high pressure
Authors: Bidisha Mukherjee, Surajit Adhikari, Mrinmay Sahu, Asish Kumar Mishra, Bhagyashri Giri, Priya Johari, Konstantin Glazyrin, Goutam Dev Mukherjee
Abstract: In this paper, we present a thorough investigation of vibrational, structural, and electronic properties of perovskite-type rhombohedral Ba$_2$ZnTeO$_6$ (BZTO) under systematic application of pressure. To carry out the analysis, we have performed pressure-dependent Raman spectroscopic measurements, synchrotron XRD, and density functional theory-based calculations. At ambient conditions, BZTO stabilizes in $R\bar{3}m$ space group, which under pressure undergoes a structural transition to a monoclinic phase with space group $C2/m$ at around 18~GPa. In-depth Raman analysis reveals softening of a phonon mode E$_g$ ($\sim $ 28cm$^{-1}$) leads to the structural phase transition. First principle DFT calculations also indicate that the doubly degenerate soft mode associated with the in-phase TeO$_6$ octahedral rotation drives the structure to a lower symmetry phase $C2/m$.

Title: Optical excitation and detection of high-frequency Sezawa modes in Si/SiO2 system decorated with Ni80Fe20 nanodot arrays
Authors: Piotr Graczyk, Bivas Rana, Aleksandra Trzaskowska, Bipul Kumar Mahato, Jarosław W. Kłos, Maciej Krawczyk, Anjan Barman
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves have emerged as one of the potential candidates for the development of next-generation wave-based information and computing technologies. For practical devices, it is essential to develop the excitation techniques for different types of surface acoustic waves, especially at higher microwave frequencies, and to tailor their frequency versus wave vector characteristics. We show that this can be done by using ultrashort laser pulses incident on the surface of a multilayer decorated with a periodic array of metallic nanodots. Specifically, we study surface acoustic waves in the dielectric substrate Si/SiO2 decorated with a square lattice of thin Ni80Fe20 (Py) dots. Using a femtosecond laser-based optical pump-probe measurement, we detect a number of high-frequency phononic modes. By performing finite element simulations, we identify them as Sezawa modes from the second and third Brillouin zone in addition to the modes confined within the Py dots. The frequency of the Sezawa modes strongly depends on the period of the Py dots and varies in the range between 5 to 15 GHz. Both types of waves cover the same frequency range for Py dots with period less than 400 nm, providing a promising system for magnetoelastic studies.

Title: Chiral Pseudogap Metal Emerging from a Disordered van der Waals Mott Insulator 1T-TaS2-xSex
Authors: Hyunjin Jung, Jiwon Jung, ChoongJae Won, Hae-Ryong Park, Sang-Wook Cheong, Jaeyoung Kim, Gil Young Cho, Han Woong Yeom
Abstract: The emergence of a pseudogap is a hallmark of anomalous electronic states formed through substantial manybody interaction but the mechanism of the pseudogap formation and its role in related emerging quantum states such as unconventional superconductivity remain largely elusive. Here, we report the emergence of an unusual pseudogap in a representative van der Waals chiral charge density wave (CDW) materials with strong electron correlation, 1T-TaS2, through isoelectronic substitute of S. We investigate systematically the evolution of electronic band dispersions of 1T-TaS2-xSex (0=<x=<2) using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our results show that the Se substitution induces a quantum transition from an insulating to a pseudogap metallic phase with the CDW order preserved. Moreover, the asymmetry of the pseudogap spectral function is found, which reflects the chiral nature of CDW structure. The present observation is contrasted with the previous suggestions of a Mott transition driven by band width control or charge transfer. Instead, we attribute the pseudogap phase to a disordered Mott insulator in line with the recent observation of substantial lateral electronic disorder. These findings provide a unique electronic system with chiral pseudogap, where the complex interplay between CDW, chirality, disorder, and electronic correlation may lead to unconventional emergent physics.

Title: Texture- and Stress-Dependent Electromechanical Response in Ferroelectric PZT: Insights from a Micromechanical Model
Authors: Saujatya Mandal, Debashish Das
Abstract: The performance of PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT)-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and other piezoelectric devices can be significantly enhanced by optimizing crystallographic texture, which directly influences polarization switching and electromechanical response. However, the combined effect of texture and residual stress on the nonlinear behavior of PZT remains poorly understood, particularly in morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions, where both tetragonal and rhombohedral domain switching mechanisms coexist. While several computational models have been developed to predict the response of ferroelectric materials, most studies either focus exclusively on tetragonal ceramics, require computationally expensive self-consistent schemes, or fail to explicitly capture key experimental observables, such as butterfly loops and D3-E3 hysteresis loops. Furthermore, the lack of accessible numerical implementations limits the ability of experimentalists to engage with and refine these models. To address these challenges, this work presents an efficient micro-electromechanical model based on Hwang et al. (1998), implemented in an open-source MATLAB framework to predict the effects of preferred crystallographic orientation and residual stress on polarization switching in MPB PZT. Despite its simplicity, the model successfully captures key experimentally observed trends, making it an invaluable tool for understanding domain-switching processes in ferroelectrics. By making the code freely available, this study provides a practical and scalable computational approach that allows researchers, especially experimentalists, to simulate, analyze, and refine polarization switching behavior, bridging the gap between theoretical modeling and real-world ferroelectric device optimization.

Title: Exchange-Coupled Spins for Robust High-Temperature Qubits
Authors: Aniruddha Chakraborty, Md. Fahim F. Chowdhury, Mohamad Niknam, Louis S. Bouchard, Jayasimha Atulasimha
Abstract: We show that Heisenberg exchange interactions between the neighboring spins comprising an ensemble spin qubit (E-qubit) can act as an intrinsic error mitigator, increasing gate fidelity even at high temperatures. As an example, the fidelity of a {\pi} gate applied to E-qubits above 1 K was studied by tuning the ferromagnetic exchange strength to show an exchange coupled E-qubit exhibits higher fidelity than a single-spin based qubit. We also investigate the coherence properties of E-qubits and find that the coherence time of an E-qubit extends linearly with the number of spins in the ensemble. This suggests that exchange interactions effectively suppress decoherence induced by thermal noise, achieving a coherence time greater than 1 ms at 1 K with an ensemble of only seven spins. Additionally, the ferromagnetic isotropic exchange prevents fidelity loss induced by spatial field gradients/inhomogeneity in Zeeman and/or control fields. Therefore, exchange-coupled spin qubits could enable fault-tolerant quantum operations and long-coherence times at elevated temperatures (>1 K).

Title: Comprehensive landscape and simple rules for transition-metal Heusler semiconductors
Authors: Yubo Zhang, Zirui Dong, Jun Luo
Abstract: Heusler alloys, renowned for their multifunctionality and capacity for vast elemental customization, are primarily classified into half-Heusler (XYZ) and full-Heusler (X2YZ) structural types. Typically, the 18-electron half-Heusler and the 24-electron full-Heusler alloys are recognized as semiconductors, following the Slater-Pauling rule. Semiconductors are desired for many applications, but they represent a minor portion compared to the predominantly metallic and half-metallic members of the Heusler family. To broaden the scope of Heusler semiconductors, advancements have been made in developing variants such as double-half Heuslers XX'Y2Z2 and quaternary full Heuslers XX'YZ, which incorporate four constituent elements. Recently, vacancy-filling off-stoichiometric Heuslers of ternary X1+bYZ (0 <= b <= 1) and quaternary XaX'bYZ (1 <= a + b <= 2) have emerged as a more versatile strategy. However, the flexibility associated with off-stoichiometry inevitably leads to complications, including issues with fractional filling ratios and complex site occupations. This work presents a comprehensive landscape of transition-metal-containing Heusler semiconductors, focusing on the off-stoichiometric Heuslers but seamlessly encompassing the integer-stoichiometric systems. The structural and electronic properties can be theoretically understood through a few simple rules. Many systems have been experimentally validated, showcasing their potential for applications such as thermoelectric converters.

Title: Eigenmode following for direct entropy calculation and characterization of magnetic systems
Authors: Stephan von Malottki, Moritz A. Goerzen, Hendrik Schrautzer, Pavel F. Bessarab, Stefan Heinze
Abstract: We present an eigenmode following method (EMF) that has been developed for the numerical scanning of the potential energy surface and the direct calculation of entropy and pre-exponential factors of Arrhenius-like transition rates in the framework of transition state theory. In contrast to other methods, we do not use EMF to move "uphill" or "downhill" in energy to find stationary points, but to obtain energy curves. By numerical integration of the Boltzmann factor along these curves, the partition functions of the followed eigenmodes can be calculated without making assumptions of the form of the energy curves. The EMF method is computationally more elaborate than traditional approaches as it requires iterative updates of the respective eigenpair spectrum. In order to mitigate this increase in computational cost, the EMF method can be combined with other approaches like the harmonic approximation for all eigenmodes but the softest which typically require the most accurate mod elling. In this work we first introduce the general theoretical background and algorithm of the EMF method before providing test calculations and relevant use-cases in the framework of atomistic spin simulations with a focus on magnetic skyrmions collapse.

Title: Effective enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling driven by nonperturbative electronic density fluctuations
Authors: Emin Moghadas, Matthias Reitner, Tim Wehling, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Sergio Ciuchi, Alessandro Toschi
Abstract: We present a dynamical mean-field study of the nonperturbative electronic mechanisms, which may lead to significant enhancements of the electron-phonon coupling in correlated electron systems. Analyzing the effects of electronic correlations on the lowest-order electron-phonon processes, we show that in the proximity of the Mott metal-to-insulator transition of the doped square lattice Hubbard model, where the isothermal charge response becomes particularly large at small momenta, the coupling of electrons to the lattice is strongly increased. This, in turn, induces significant corrections to both the electronic self-energy and phonon-mediated pairing interaction, indicating the possible onset of a strong interplay between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom even for small values of the bare electron-phonon coupling.

Title: Photostriction Facilitates Relaxation of Lattice Distortion in Two-Dimensional Perovskites
Authors: Jin Zhang, Kun Yang, Jianxin Yu, Jia Zhang, Sheng Meng, Xinghua Shi, Wei-Hai Fang
Abstract: The photostriction effect, a light-induced mechanical deformation in materials, originates from the intricate interplay between lattice structure and electronic excitation. In photovoltaic semiconductors, this effect plays a crucial role in shaping non-equilibrium structural responses, yet its fundamental mechanism remains elusive. Here, we uncover lattice expansion and structural reconfiguration in two-dimensional (2D) perovskites driven by photoinduced excitation using first-principles calculations. Our findings reveal that the photoinduced carriers lead to a substantial lattice expansion by about 2%. The expanded lattice facilitates strain relaxation with the amplitude of 20% by increasing interatomic distances and reducing internal stresses, thereby enhancing structural stability. The lattice dynamics can be systematically engineered through photodoping density, unveiling a new pathway to modulate light-matter interactions in 2D perovskites. These insights not only advance the understanding of optically driven structural dynamics but also offer a guiding principle for optimizing next-generation high-efficiency photovoltaic devices and optoelectronics.

Title: Time-resolved radiative recombination in black silicon
Authors: Seref Kalem
Abstract: Black silicon (b-Si) has been receiving a great deal of interest for its potential to be used in applications ranging from sensors to solar cells and electrodes in batteries due to its promising optical, electronic and structural properties. Several approaches have been used to demonstrate the possibility of producing application quality b-Si, which also exhibits light emission properties. The photoluminescence is a useful technique to identify recombination pathways and thus enable us to optimize device quality. In this work, we report the results of the radiative recombination dynamics in b-Si produced by a technique involving thermal oxidation, photoresist coating and chlorine plasma etching. An ultrafast blue luminescence component competing with non-radiative recombination at surface defects was identified as no-phonon radiative recombination. This component involves two decay processes with a peak energy at around 480 nm, which have the fast component of about 15 ps followed by a component of around 50 ps lifetime. The emission exhibits a slow process in red spectral region with time constant of 1500 ps. When the surface is smoothed, the lifetime of carriers increased up to 4500 ps and the emission peak blue shifted indicating downsizing in dimensions. The results are correlated with transmission electron microscopy, localized vibrational modes and spectroscopic ellipsometry and interpreted through the presence of quantum

Title: Investigation of physical and electrical properties of a suboxide layer at Si/Si-hexafluoride interface
Authors: Seref Kalem
Abstract: The silicon suboxide SiOx (x<2.0) offers promising industrial application possibilities ranging from electrodes in lithium-ion batteries, which are used widely in electrical vehicles and portable devices to sensing applications. Therefore, a low cost, environmental friendly and high performance silicon oxide materials are required for an appropriate operation of any electronic gadget. In this work, we report on the physical and electrical properties of a suboxide layer of up to 1 {\mu}m, which was grown on silicon during the formation of a dielectric layer, namely the ammonium silicon hexafluoride. It is a stable oxide exhibiting light emission from 400 nm to 1700 nm offering scalable and cost-effective large area processing capability. The measurement results reveal interesting properties, which are required to be understood clearly before proceeding with any suitable application. The results have been analyzed using state-of-the-art physical and electrical characterization techniques such as ellipsometry, AFM, SEM, FTIR, photoluminescence lifetime and resistive switching measurements to determine structural, optical and electrical properties. At 300 K the carrier lifetime measurements reveal the lifetime values ranging from about few tens of picosecond up to 4500 picoseconds. Scanning probe analysis indicate a surface roughness of about 30 Angström. Resistive memory forming was observed also in these layers at relatively low power thresholds. We provide a comprehensive description of the physical and electrical properties in order to clarify the origin of the observed features. The wavelength dependent real {\epsilon}_1 ({\omega}) and the imaginary {\epsilon}_2 ({\omega}) dielectric functions provided useful insights on optical properties. A lookout is given for the possible applications of this special SiOx dielectric oxide layer.

Title: Ferroelectricity originating from polar moiety flipping
Authors: Zengqian Wang, Yuanfang Yue, Z. Y. Xie, Fengjie Ma, Xun-Wang Yan
Abstract: A wide variety of applications has inspired great interest in designing new materials and investigating fundamental physics in the ferroelectric field. In the concept of ferroelectricity, the spontaneous polarization is traditionally considered a core property, but we find that the `spontaneous' seems unnecessary. Based on this understanding, we suggest a new type of ferroelectric materials, in which the polar atomic moiety is incorporated to realize the electric polarization and the polar atomic moiety flipping corresponds to the reversal of electric polarization. Lead hydroxyapatite Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$(OH)$_2$ containing polar OH moieties is taken as an example to illustrate our idea, in which the OH moiety flipping result in the reversal of electric polarization. The mechanism of ferroelectricity reported herein distinctly differs from those of the displacive type, disorder-order type, and interlayer sliding type ferroelectric materials in the previous studies.

Title: Degenerate Fluid Polyamorphism Induced by Symmetrical Molecular Interconversion
Authors: Mikhail A. Anisimov, Sergey V. Buldyrev, Frédéric Caupin, Thomas J. Longo
Abstract: Fluid polyamorphism is the existence of multiple fluid-fluid phase transitions in a single-component substance. It can occur due to interconversion between two alternative molecular or supramolecular states. In this work, we investigate a special (``degenerate'') case of fluid polyamorphism, in which all three characteristic parameters of the interconversion equilibrium constant, i.e. the changes of energy, entropy, and volume, are zero. This feature of interconversion is typical for the Ising spin model of ferromagnets but is also observed in a polyamorphic chiral fluid mixture of interconverting enantiomers. To investigate the consequences of interconversion's degeneration for fluid polyamorphism, we have performed a meanfield analysis and 3D Monte Carlo simulations of a compressible binary lattice with interconverting species (referred to as the ``blinking-checkers model''), which generally demonstrates the existence of both liquid-gas and liquid-liquid transitions. By tuning the interaction parameters, we have demonstrated that, in the degenerate interconverting case, a coupling between the fraction of interconversion (a vector-like nonconserved order parameter) and the total density (a scalar conserved order parameter) may produce a symmetrical tricritical point. At this point, the line of second-order transitions between two fluids, ``disordered'' (with 50:50 interconversion) and ``ordered'' (with temperature and pressure dependent interconversion fraction), is terminated by first-order transitions between the fluid states. This point exhibits the typical features of symmetrical tricritical points as observed in a superfluid mixture of helium isotopes and in some magnetic materials. We also show that the transition between the ordered and disordered fluid could occur in either the liquid or the gaseous phase.

Title: Large deviations of the largest eigenvalue for deformed GOE/GUE random matrices via replica
Authors: Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: We study the probability distribution function $P(\lambda)$ of the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\rm max}$ of $N \times N$ random matrices of the form $H + V$, where $H$ belongs to the GOE/GUE ensemble and $V$ is a full rank deterministic diagonal perturbation. This model is related to spherical spin glasses and semi-discrete directed polymers. In the large $N$ limit, using the replica method introduced in Ref. \cite{TrivializationUs2014}, we obtain the rate function ${\cal L}(\lambda)$ which describes the upper large deviation tail $P(\lambda) \sim e^{- \beta N {\cal L}(\lambda) }$. We also obtain the moment generating function $\langle e^{N s {\lambda}_{\max} } \rangle \sim e^{N \phi(s)}$ and the overlap of the optimal eigenvector with the perturbation $V$. For suitable $V$, a transition generically occurs in the rate functions. For the GUE it has a direct interpretation as a localisation transition for tilted directed polymers with competing columnar and point disorder. Although in a different form, our results are consistent with those obtained recently by Mc Kenna in \cite{McKenna2021}. Finally, we consider briefly the quadratic optimisation problem in presence of an additional random field and obtain its large deviation rate function, although only within the replica symmetric phase.

Title: Single-step high-fidelity three-qubit gates by anisotropic chiral interactions
Authors: Minh T. P. Nguyen, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ, Lieven M. K. Vandersypen, Stefano Bosco
Abstract: Direct multi-qubit gates are becoming critical to facilitate quantum computations in near-term devices by reducing the gate counts and circuit depth. Here, we demonstrate that fast and high fidelity three-qubit gates can be realized in a single step by leveraging small anisotropic and chiral three-qubit interactions. These ingredients naturally arise in state-of-the-art spin-based quantum hardware through a combination of spin-orbit interactions and orbital magnetic fields. These interactions resolve the key synchronization issues inherent in protocols relying solely on two-qubit couplings, which significantly limit gate fidelity. We confirm with numerical simulations that our single-step three-qubit gate can outperform existing protocols, potentially achieving infidelity $\leq 10^{-4}$ in 80-100 ns under current experimental conditions. To further benchmark its performance, we also propose an alternative composite three-qubit gate sequence based on anisotropic two-qubit interactions with built-in echo sequence and show that the single-step protocol can outperform it, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum processors.

Title: Singly occupied 4$f$ antiferromagnetic insulators: CePO$_4$ and CeVO$_4$
Authors: Hari Paudyal, Yogendra Limbu, Michael E. Flatté, Durga Paudyal
Abstract: Rare-earth containing wide band gap oxides, which provide spin-photon interface and narrow linewidth optical emission, are getting significant attention as the most promising candidate materials in advancing quantum transduction and memories. Here, from $ab~initio$ calculations, we identify antiferromagnetic ground states in structurally preferred monoclinic CePO$_4$ and tetragonal CeVO$_4$ exhibiting localized occupied and unoccupied Ce $4f$ states with $4f-4f$ transition characteristics. Interestingly, in CePO$_4$, O $2p$ and P $3p$ states hybridize negligibly with Ce $4f$ states, while in CeVO$_4$, V $3d$ and O $2p$ states hybridize and appear as extended states in between the occupied and unoccupied Ce $4f$ states. Here, phonon calculations and analysis identify and differentiate Raman active phonon modes along with the spin phonon coupling of Ce in both CePO$_4$ and CeVO$_4$ that ultimately lead to different $4f$ ground state crystal field multiplets, which are critical to accurately describe electronic transitions for foundational quantum transduction and memories. Further, the identified $C_1$ site symmetry of Ce, lacking inversion symmetry in CePO$_4$, is relevant for quantum memories and $D_{2d}$ site symmetry of Ce exhibiting inversion symmetry in CeVO$_4$ is relevant for quantum transduction.

Title: Stability, electronic quantum states, and magnetic interactions of Er$^{3+}$ ions in Ga$_2$O$_3$
Authors: Yogendra Limbu, Hari Paudyal, Michael E. Flatté, Durga Paudyal
Abstract: The chemical, structural, mechanical, and dynamical stabilities of the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ are confirmed from respective negative formation energies, negative cohesive energies, favorable elastic constants, and positive phonon frequencies. The phonon dispersions indicate that the Ga-O bonds are uniform in the $\alpha$-phase, while they vary in the $\beta$-phase due to the anisotropic polyhedral movement. The defect formation energy analysis confirms that both Er-doped phases prefer Er$^{3+}$ state. The underestimated band gaps of the pristine phases from $ab~initio$ calculations are corrected by employing the hybrid functional calculations. The site preference energy analysis indicates partial occupation of Er in the octahedral site of Ga. Anisotropic nature of hyperfine tensor coefficients of Er are similar in both phases. Calculated magnetic exchange interaction between two Er dopants is negative for $\alpha$ and positive for $\beta$, indicating antiferromagnetic ground state in the former and the ferromagnetic ground state in the latter. A large values of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs) are obtained along the $x$ direction in the $\alpha$ and along the $y$ direction in the $\beta$. The analysis of dielectric constants and refractive indices of both pristine and Er doped phases shows a good agreement with available experimental values. The calculated optical anisotropy is slightly higher in $\beta$ than those in $\alpha$, which is due to the involvement of lower symmetry in $\beta$. The crystal field coefficients (CFCs) calculated from DFT are used to analyze 4$f$ multiplets and 4$f$ - 4$f$ transitions. Thus calculated lowest energy level of the first excited state to the lowest energy level of the ground state is about 1.53~$\mu$m, which is in a good agreement with available experiment and it falls within the quantum telecommunication wavelength range.

Title: Intrinsic higher-order topological states in 2D honeycomb Z_2 quantum spin Hall insulators
Authors: Sibin Lü, Jun Hu
Abstract: The exploration of topological phases remains a cutting-edge research frontier, driven by their promising potential for next-generation electronic and quantum technologies. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling to systematically investigate the topological properties of freestanding two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb Bi, HgTe, and Al2O3(0001)-supported HgTe. Remarkably, all three systems exhibit coexistence of first-order and higher-order topological insulator states, manifested by gapless edge states in one-dimensional (1D) nanoribbons and symmetry-related corner states in zero-dimensional (0D) nanoflakes. Furthermore, fractional electron charges may accumulate at the corners of armchair-edged nanoflakes. Among these materials, HgTe/Al2O3(0001) is particularly promising due to its experimentally feasible atomic configuration and low-energy corner states. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring higher-order topological phases in Z_2 quantum spin Hall insulators and pave the way for new possibilities in device applications.

Title: Spin orientation by electric current in altermagnets
Authors: L. E. Golub, L. Šmejkal
Abstract: It is shown that the flow of electric current in an altermagnet results in the formation of a homogeneous electron spin orientation in the sample. The spin of the conduction electrons generated in altermagnets with $d$-wave spin-momentum couplings, is quadratic in the current magnitude, varies as the second angular harmonic under variation of the current direction and does not require broken inversion symmetry. The effect is thus distinct from conventional current induced spin polarization phenomena which are linear in the current, vary as a first angular harmonic under variation of current direction and require broken inversion symmetry. The current-induced spin orientation in altermagnets is obtained using the kinetic theory for distribution functions in the spin-splitted subbands. It is shown that an application of external magnetic field significantly enhances the electron spin.

Title: Non-van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Anastasiia Nihei, Tom Barnowsky, Rico Friedrich
Abstract: Beyond the study of individual materials, their interfaces and arising functionality are crucial enablers of fundamental science and technological applications. Recently, the arena of two-dimensional (2D) materials was extended to so-called non-van der Waals (non-vdW) compounds derived from strongly bonded non-layered bulk crystals. These nanosystems with their active surfaces complement now - through their chemically bonded heterostructure (HS) interfaces - the established space of weakly interacting vdW HSs. Here, we study a wide range of 55 candidate non-vdW HSs with autonomous density functional calculations and find that the resulting interfacial chemical hybridization and bonding is the key factor determining their electronic and magnetic properties. It gives rise to the formation of hybrid interface bands, strong magnetic coupling, and substantial electronic as well as magnetic moire surface property modulations upon twisting. Our work thus provides a significant step towards charting the new interface class of non-vdW HSs.

Title: Negative temperature coefficient of resistivity due to the itinerant spin fluctuations in metallic V$_{0.3}$Ti$_{0.7}$ alloy
Authors: SK Ramjan, Asi Khandelwal, L. S. Sharath Chandra, M. K. Chattopadhyay
Abstract: Few concentrated disordered binary metallic alloys show a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), which is quite unusual. V$_{0.3}$Ti$_{0.7}$ is one such alloy that shows resistivity exceeding 100 $\mu\Omega$ cm and exhibits negative TCR. The addition of ferromagnetic rare-earth Gd, which is insoluble in the body-centered cubic V-Ti matrix, changes the negative TCR to positive (when Gd conc. $\geq$ 2 at.$\%$). Evidence of spin polarization of conduction electrons of the V-Ti matrix by Gd clusters is obtained from the magnetization experiments as well as from the anomalous component of the Hall effect. Our analysis suggests that the additional scattering due to the distribution in the electron-spin fluctuation interaction arising from the substitution of titanium in vanadium is the origin of the negative TCR. The Gd clusters polarize the conduction electrons, leading to the suppression of spin fluctuations, resulting in the positive TCR.

Title: Constructing the low-temperature phase diagram for the $2+p$-quantum spin glass using the nonperturbative renormalization group
Authors: Ixandra Achitouv, Vincent Lahoche, Dine Ousmane Samary, Parham Radpay
Abstract: In this paper, we use a nonperturbative renormalization group approach to construct the dynamical phase space of a quantum spin glass in the large $N$ limit. The disordered Hamiltonian is of ``$2 + p$" type, and we perform a coarse-graining procedure over the Wigner spectrum for the matrix-like disorder. The phase space reconstruction relies on phase transitions derived from the Luttinger-Ward functional, which accounts for interactions that are forbidden by perturbation theory. Various phases are identified, characterized by large correlations between replicas and/or the breaking of time translation symmetry.

Title: Impact of structural distortions on the correlated electronic structure of orbital-selective Mott insulating Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ under strains
Authors: Nam Nguyen, Alex Taekyung Lee, Anh T. Ngo, Hyowon Park
Abstract: Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.

Title: Identification of Two Distinct Antiferromagnetic Phases in the Au-Al-Gd Quasicrystal Approximant
Authors: Farid Labib, Takanori Sugimoto, Hiroyuki Takakura, Asuka Ishikawa, Ryuji Tamura
Abstract: The structural and physical properties of two single-grain Au-Al-Gd 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) with analyzed compositions Au73.67Al12.24Gd14.09 and Au74.67Al11.35Gd13.98 were thoroughly investigated. The two variants are iso-structural (cubic, space group: Im-3 undergoing sharp antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at TN = 9.6 K and TN = 8.3 K, respectively. Specific heat measurements in both samples evidenced sharp jump at TN, associated with the AFM transition, accompanied by broad Schottky-type anomalies at lower temperatures. Strikingly, the two 1/1 ACs exhibited markedly different responses to applied magnetic fields: one displayed a pronounced metamagnetic anomaly while the other did not. In this regard, variational calculations with adiabatic transformation of the magnetic field in realistic structural models identified the existence of two possible AFM phases: the cuboc phase with a metamagnetic anomaly and the cluster Néel phase without it, thereby clearly revealing the possible magnetic structures of the present AFM variants. These findings have led to the establishment of a comprehensive magnetic phase diagram for Heisenberg-type 1/1 ACs. This work not only advances our understanding of magnetic phase transitions in these complex systems but also suggests the existence of a broader spectrum of unexplored magnetic states in Tsai-type materials.

Title: Strongly-anharmonic gateless gatemon qubits based on InAs/Al 2D heterostructure
Authors: Shukai Liu, Arunav Bordoloi, Jacob Issokson, Ido Levy, Maxim G. Vavilov, Javad Shabani, Vladimir Manucharyan
Abstract: The gatemon qubits, made of transparent super-semi Josephson junctions, typically have even weaker anharmonicity than the opaque AlOx-junction transmons. However, flux-frustrated gatemons can acquire a much stronger anharmonicity, originating from the interference of the higher-order harmonics of the supercurrent. Here we investigate this effect of enhanced anharmonicity in split-junction gatemon devices based on InAs/Al 2D heterostructure. We find that anharmonicity in excess of 100% can be routinely achieved at the half-integer flux sweet-spot without any need for electrical gating or excessive sensitivity to the offset charge noise. We verified that such "gateless gatemon" qubits can be driven with Rabi frequencies more than 100 MHz, enabling gate operations much faster than what is possible with traditional gatemons and transmons. Furthermore, by analyzing a relatively high-resolution spectroscopy of the device transitions as a function of flux, we were able to extract fine details of the current-phase relation, to which transport measurements would hardly be sensitive. The strong anharmonicity of our gateless gatemons, along with their bare-bones design, can prove to be a precious resource that transparent super-semi junctions bring to quantum information processing.

Title: Probing the hollowing transition of a shell-shaped BEC with collective excitation
Authors: Zerong Huang, Kai Yuen Lee, Chun Kit Wong, Liyuan Qiu, Bo Yang, Yangqian Yan, Dajun Wang
Abstract: We investigate the hollowing transition of a shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate using collective excitations. The shell is created using an immiscible dual-species BEC mixture, with its hollowness controlled by tuning the repulsive interspecies interaction via a Feshbach resonance. Our results reveal two distinct monopole modes in which the two condensates oscillate either in-phase or out-of-phase. The spectrum of the out-of-phase mode exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction, providing a clear signature of the topology change from a filled to a hollow condensate. Furthermore, we find that the critical point of the hollowing transition depends strongly on the number ratio of the two species. Our findings provide a detailed understanding of the topology change in shell-shaped quantum gases and pave the way for future study of quantum many-body phenomena in curved spaces.

Title: Numerical methods for unraveling inter-particle potentials in colloidal suspensions: A comparative study for two-dimensional suspensions
Authors: Clare R. Rees-Zimmerman, José Martín-Roca, David Evans, Mark A. Miller, Dirk G. A. L. Aarts, Chantal Valeriani
Abstract: We compare three model-free numerical methods for inverting structural data to obtain interaction potentials, namely iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI), test-particle insertion (TPI), and a machine-learning (ML) approach called ActiveNet. Three archetypal models of two-dimensional colloidal systems are used as test cases: Weeks--Chandler--Anderson short-ranged repulsion, the Lennard-Jones potential, and a repulsive shoulder interaction with two length scales. Additionally, data on an experimental suspension of colloidal spheres are acquired by optical microscopy and used to test the inversion methods. The methods have different merits. IBI is the only choice when the radial distribution function is known but particle coordinates are unavailable. TPI requires snapshots with particle positions and can extract both pair- and higher-body potentials without the need for simulation. The ML approach can only be used when particles can be tracked in time and it returns the force rather than the potential. However, it can unravel pair interactions from any one-body forces (such as drag or propulsion) and does not rely on equilibrium distributions for its derivation. Our results may serve as a guide when a numerical method is needed for application to experimental data, and as a reference for further development of the methodology itself.

Title: Low-energy insulating reconstructions of Si(111)-7x7 surface with and without stacking fault discovered by graph theory
Authors: Chaoyu He, Yuke Song, ShiFang Li, PeiZe Lin, Jin Li, Tao Ouyang, Chao Tang
Abstract: The 7x7 reconstruction of Si(111) surface is one of the most fascinating configuration in nature, whose STM image has been well-understood by the famous dimer-adatom-stacking-fault model (DAS). However, the electronic property of the DAS model is always confirmed to be metallic by first-principles calculations, while some experiments detected insulating features. It is still challenge to predict DAS-like reconstructions through traditional method to solve such a puzzle. Here, we show that 7x7 reconstructions can be quickly discovered by graph theory as implemented in the graph-space based RG2 code for crystal structure prediction. Two groups of reconstructions with (DAS-d8-T12, DAS-d8-T9H3-A, DAS-d8-T9H3-B and DAS-d8-T6H6) and without (AB-d10-T12, AB-d10-T9H3, AA-d10-T12 and AA-d10-T9H3) stacking-fault are discovered. They possess energetic stabilities comparable to the well-known DAS (DAS-d8-T12) and show similar STM patterns, providing a plausible explanation for the experimentally observed 7x7 reconstruction on the Si(111) surface. The first-principles calculations show that DAS-d8-T12, DAS-d8-T6H6, AB-d10-T12, and AA-d10-T12 are metallic, while DAS-d8-T9H3-A, DAS-d8-T9H3-B, AB-d10-T9H3 and AA-d10-T9H3 are insulating phases with gaps of 0.043 eV, 0.182 eV, 0.043 eV and 0.059 eV, respectively. Our work demonstrates the predictability of the Si(111)-7x7 reconstruction and provides the structural candidates for understanding the experimentally observed metal-to-insulator transition.

Title: Reduction of current for magnetization switching in a nanomagnet with perpendicular anisotropy by spin-splitter torque
Authors: Tomoki Watanabe, Keisuke Yamada, Yoshinobu Nakatani
Abstract: Recently, spin-transfer torque (STT) based magnetization switching has been widely utilized in magnetic resistance-based memories, which have broad applications in microcontroller units and other devices. This study utilizes a macrospin model to simulate magnetization switching in nanoscale magnets with perpendicular anisotropy through spin-splitter torque (SST). The study primarily addresses minimizing the current for magnetization switching and identifying the conditions necessary for achieving high switching probabilities. Notably, the threshold current density for SST-induced magnetization switching is reduced by approximately 75-80% compared to conventional STT and spin-orbit torque mechanisms, provided the spin torque polar angle is optimized. For practical implementation in magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), a polar angle exceeding roughly 128 degrees must be maintained to ensure sufficient switching probability. Additionally, optimizing the shape of the applied current pulse significantly lowers the switching per rate by approximately 18 times. These findings underscore the effectiveness of SST in reducing magnetization switching currents and offer valuable insights into its potential application in SST-MRAM technology.

Title: Non-reciprocity and multibody interactions in acoustically levitated particle systems: A three body problem
Authors: Brady Wu, Qinghao Mao, Bryan VanSaders, Heinrich M. Jaeger
Abstract: In active fluids and active solids the constituents individually generate movement by each extracting energy from their environment or from their own source. Non-reciprocal interactions among these active constituents then enable novel collective behavior that often can be strikingly counterintuitive. However, non-reciprocity in these cases typically requires that the interacting bodies have different physical properties or it needs to be programmed explicitly into all pairwise interactions. Here we show that collective activity in a driven system can emerge spontaneously through multibody nonreciprocal forces, even if all bodies are individually non-active and have identical properties. We demonstrate this with as few as three identical spheres, acoustically levitated in air, which exhibit collective activity as they interact through non-pairwise forces: similar to the classic gravitational three-body problem, the interaction between two spheres depends sensitively on the relative position of the third sphere. Non-reciprocity arises naturally from both near-field sound scattering and microstreaming forces among the spheres. The underdamped dynamics in air furthermore make it possible to go beyond collective center-of-mass propulsion or rotation and observe internal, engine-like reconfigurations that follow limit cycles. These findings open up new possibilities for self-assembly, where now multibody interactions not only determine the resulting structure but also drive the spontaneously emerging dynamics.

Title: Spin glass behavior in amorphous CrSiTe3 alloy
Authors: Xiaozhe Wang, Jiayue Wang, Yihui Jiang, Suyang Sun, Jiangjing Wang, Riccardo Mazzarello, Wei Zhang
Abstract: Owing to the intrinsically high crystallization temperatures, layered phase-change materials, such as CrGeTe3 and InGeTe3, are attracting attention for embedded memory applications, In addition to the electrical contrast, a major change in magnetic properties is observed in CrGeTe3 upon switching from the crystalline to the amorphous state. In this work, we report a combined ab initio modeling and magnetic characterization study on the isostructural silicon parent compound of CrGeTe3, namely, CrSiTe3. Amorphous CrSiTe3 has similar structural properties to amorphous CrGeTe3; however, it shows a smaller energy difference between the ferromagnetic configuration and the random magnetic configuration, indicating a high probability of spin glass formation. Indeed, direct-current and alternating-current magnetic measurements show that the coercive force of amorphous CrSiTe3 is higher than that of amorphous CrGeTe3. Therefore, the pinning effect of spins is enhanced in amorphous CrSiTe3, leading to a more robust spin glass state with a higher freezing temperature. The large magnetic contrast between the amorphous and crystalline phase could make CrSiTe3 a potential candidate for phase-change magnetic switching applications.

Title: Stability of quasi-particle creation and multiband geometry in fractional Chern insulators under magnetic fields
Authors: Nozomi Higashino, Yasuhiro Tada
Abstract: We study creation of quasi-particles in fractional Chern insulators (FCI) under magnetic fields. We consider two representative models, the Kapit-Mueller model and the checkerboard model, which have distinct band properties in terms of the quantum geometry. The former satisfies the so-called ideal condition and well mimics the lowest Landau level, while the latter is not ideal for realization of FCI states. It is found within exact diagonalization that both quasi-holes and quasi-electrons are stably created by the magnetic fields in the Kapit-Mueller model. On the other hand, stability of the quasi-particle creation depends on directions of the magnetic field in the checkerboard model. Although the quasi-electron creation is stable under a magnetic field, the quasi-hole creation and the underlying FCI state are unstable for the opposite field direction, leading to a field-induced non-FCI state. We point out that this difference can be understood based on the multiband quantum geometry in the presence of the magnetic fields.

Title: Diverse Magnetic Phase Diagram and Anomalous Hall Effect in Antiferromagetic LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$
Authors: Shirin Mozaffari, Seung-Hwan Do, Richa P. Madhogaria, Aikaterini Flessa Savvidou, Brian W. Casas, William R. Meier, Rui Xue, Eun Sang Choi, Luis Balicas, David G. Mandrus
Abstract: The interactions between conduction electrons and magnetism can significantly enhance the Hall signal, a phenomenon known as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). While the AHE is generally not expected in antiferromagnets with vanishing magnetization, a large AHE is observed in certain antiferromagnets with noncollinear spin textures and nonvanishing Berry curvature. In this work, we present a rich temperature and magnetic phase diagram with eight distinct magnetic phases for the antiferromagnetic kagome compound LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$. In the coplanar canted antiferromagnetic phase, we observe an AHE, which likely originates from the intrinsic effects. Upon entering the ferromagnetic phase, the AHE significantly increases and exceeds the conventional limits of AHE of intrinsic origin. Additionally, we observe a topological Hall effect (THE) that emerges in the conical magnetic phase. Notably, the THE in LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$ persists over an extended magnetic field range of up to 25~T. Our detailed transport measurements highlight the need for theoretical modeling to explain the observations of AHE and THE in $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R$= Rare earth) family of compounds.

Title: A Bond weighted tensor renormalization group study of the q-state ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice
Authors: Yuan-Heng Tseng, Shang-Wei Li, Fu-Jiun Jiang
Abstract: It is known rigorously that the phase transition of the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on the square lattice is second order for $q=4$. Despite this fact, some observables of the $q=4$ model show features of a first-order phase transition. For example, negative peak appears for the quantity of Binder ratio $Q_2$ of this model. Such a non-monotonic behavior of $Q_2$ is typically a consequence of phase coexistence, hence is served as a signal of a first-order phase transition. In particular, the negative peak should diverge with linear system size $L$ squared. Since the mentioned divergence phenomenon is not observed for the 4-state Potts model, the scenario of a first-order phase transition for this model is ruled out. Interestingly, a recent large scale Monte Carlo investigation of the 4-state Potts model observes that the two-peak structure of the energy density distribution becomes more noticeable when $L$ increases. This finding indicates the signal of coexistence of phases is getting stronger with $L$. Due to these unusual critical behaviors, here we study the energy density $E$ and the specific heat $C_v$ of the 4-state Potts model on the square lattice using the technique of bond weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG). For a comparison purpose, $q=2$ and $q=5$ ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice are investigated using the same method as well. Remarkably, our results do imply there may be a small energy gap for $q=4$ model. While the appearance of the mentioned small energy gap can be explained plausibly and it will disappear with a more sophisticated investigation, our finding suggests that whether a message of a first-order phase transition is genuine or is an artificial effect requires further and detailed investigations.

Title: Spiral spin liquid in a frustrated honeycomb antiferromagnet: A single-crystal study of GdZnPO
Authors: Zongtang Wan, Yuqian Zhao, Xun Chen, Zhaohua Ma, Zikang Li, Zhongwen Ouyang, Yuesheng Li
Abstract: The frustrated honeycomb spin model can stabilize a subextensively degenerate spiral spin liquid with nontrivial topological excitations and defects, but its material realization remains rare. Here, we report the experimental realization of this model in the structurally disorder-free compound GdZnPO. Using a single-crystal sample, we find that spin-7/2 rare-earth Gd$^{3+}$ ions form a honeycomb lattice with dominant second-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic and first-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic couplings, along with easy-plane single-site anisotropy. This frustrated model stabilizes a unique spiral spin liquid with a degenerate contour around the $\mathrm{K}$$\{$1/3,1/3$\}$ point in reciprocal space, consistent with our experiments down to 30 mK, including the observation of a giant residual specific heat. Our results establish GdZnPO as an ideal platform for exploring the stability of spiral spin liquids and their novel properties, such as the emergence of low-energy topological defects on the sublattices.

Title: Low-energy perspective of interacting electrons in the normal state of superconducting bilayer nickelate
Authors: Frank Lechermann, Steffen Bötzel, Ilya M. Eremin
Abstract: Developing a low-energy model is essential for understanding unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Here, we analyze distinct low-energy scenarios of the normal state by downfolding the ab-initio determined band structure and applying the mean-field regime of rotational-invariant slave-boson theory. We compare models based on the single-site two-orbital, the two-site four-orbital and a proposed minimal cluster (MC) picture. The latter builds up on three adapted orbitals located on the sites of the basic Ni-O-Ni cluster across the bilayer. Intriguing interplay between the Hund coupling $J_{\rm H}$ and the interlayer exchange $J_{\perp}$ is encountered in the multiorbital multi-site problem. While the tendency for interlayer Ni-$d_{z^2}$ singlet formation is pronounced, a complete localization remains hindered by the coupling to the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. The correlation physics in the MC picture is peculiar with respect to the effective interorbital/site exchange.

Title: Antiferromagnetic two-dimensional transition-metal nitride Co$_2$N$_2$ layer with high N$\rm \acute{\textbf e}$el temperature and Dirac fermions
Authors: Lujia Tian, Lihui Han, Yuanfang Yue, Huazhen Li, Z. Y. Xie, Xun-Wang Yan
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal nitrides have a wide prospect of applications in the fields of physics, chemistry, materials, etc. However, 2D transition metal nitrides with strong magnetism, especially high N$\rm \acute{e}$el temperature, are very scarce. Based on the first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory, we design two 2D transition-metal nitrides \textit{M}$_2$N$_2$ (\textit{M} = Ti, Co), in which the transition metal atoms and the N atoms form a 2D layer with a wrinkled structure. The structural stability is demonstrated by the cohesive energy, formation energy, elastic constants, phonon spectra and molecular dynamics simulations. Elastic moduli calculations reveal that the mechanical properties of the two structures are anisotropic. Spin-polarized calculations show that Ti$_2$N$_2$ is a 2D ferromagnetic material while Co$_2$N$_2$ is a 2D antiferromagnetic semimetal with a Dirac point at Fermi level. Furthermore, by solveing the Heisenberg model by Monte Carlo method, we discover that the 2D Co$_2$N$_2$ layer is a high-temperature antiferromagnetic material and the N$\rm \acute{e}$el temperature is up to 474 K. Therefore, our findings provide a rare antiferromagnetic 2D material with both high critical temperature and Dirac Fermions.

Title: Traveling antiferromagnetic domain walls in a magnetic field
Authors: George Theodorou, Stavros Komineas
Abstract: We consider an antiferromagnet in one space dimension with easy-axis anisotropy in a perpendicular magnetic field. We study propagating domain wall solutions that can have a velocity up to a maximum $v_c$. The width of the domain wall is a non-monotonic function of the velocity and it diverges to infinity at $v_c$. Both features are in contrast to the case of the Lorentz invariant model in the absence of the field. We further study the modification of the wall profile when a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is added. Finally, we present a propagating spiral expected to form when the system is forced at a velocity higher than the maximum velocity for domain walls and we give numerical results for the effect of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

Title: A Universal Raman Spectroscopic Framework for Defect Quantification in Mono-to-Multilayer Graphenic Materials: The Graphene Atlas
Authors: Kazunori Fujisawa, Bruno R. Carvalho, Pedro Venezuela, Cheon-Soo Kang, Yoong Ahm Kim, Takuya Hayashi, Mauricio Terrones
Abstract: Point defects, though atomically small, significantly influence the properties of 2D materials. A general method for characterizing point defect density ($n_{ D }$) in graphenic materials with arbitrary layer number ($n_{ L }$) is currently lacking. Here, we introduce the Graphene Atlas, a non-destructive Raman spectroscopy-based framework for defect quantification in diverse graphenic systems. We demonstrate that the relative fractions of the double-resonance D and 2D Raman bands, which arise from competing scattering processes, exhibit a universal relationship with $n_{ D }$, independent of $n_{ L }$. Plotting Raman data on a plane defined by defect-related and layer number-related parameters enables a direct and quantitative determination of $n_{ D }$ and $n_{ L }$. This Graphene Atlas provides a transformative tool for real-time defect quantification in scalable manufacturing of graphenic materials, bridging fundamental research and industrial applications. This framework establishes a new standard for defect characterization of graphenic systems, facilitating their optimization for advanced technological applications.

Title: Entanglement in the pseudogap regime of cuprate superconductors
Authors: Frederic Bippus, Juraj Krsnik, Motoharu Kitatani, Luka Akšamović, Anna Kauch, Neven Barišić, Karsten Held
Abstract: We find a strongly enhanced entanglement within the pseudogap regime of the Hubbard model. This entanglement is estimated from the quantum Fisher information and, avoiding the ill-conditioned analytical continuation, the quantum variance. Both are lower bounds for the actual entanglement that can be calculated from the (antiferromagnetic) susceptibility, obtained here with the dynamical vertex approximation. Our results qualitatively agree with experimental neutron scattering experiments for various cuprates. Theory predicts a $\ln(1/T)$ divergence of the entanglement for low temperatures $T$, which is however cut-off by the onset of superconductivity.

Title: Nonpertubative Many-Body Theory for the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model at Low Temperature: From Weak to Strong Coupling Regimes
Authors: Yingze Su, Ruitao Xiao, Junnian Xiong, Hui Li, Huaqing Huang, Dingping Li
Abstract: In the theoretical study of two-dimensional systems, difficulties emerge as that quantum phase transitions at zero temperature cause low- and high-temperature scenarios to belong to different branches, while the Mermin-Wagner theorem prohibits continuous symmetry breaking at finite temperatures, excluding a Landau phase transition marked by a critical temperature $T_c$. In many-body theory, fundamental symmetries like Ward-Takahashi identity (WTI), Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem (FDT), and Pauli-repulsive principle must be satisfied, yet widely-used approximate theories struggle to meet them simultaneously. We introduce a symmetrization theory that, by using spurious broken phases from approximate theories, can naturally generate different low- and high-temperature branches. Employing the GW method beyond mean-field and the covariance scheme, which strictly satisfy WTI and FDT, we numerically show that the violation of Pauli-repulsive principle is significantly less than that in mean-field, and further restore Pauli-repulsive principle without breaking WTI and FDT. By calculating symmetrized one-body Green's function and two-body correlation function and comparing them with accurate results from Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we demonstrate its numerical accuracy at low temperatures and strong coupling. This symmetrization theory can be easily applied to other two-dimensional systems at low temperatures.

Title: Effect of surface orientation on blistering of copper under high fluence keV hydrogen ion irradiation
Authors: A. Lopez-Cazalilla, C. Serafim, J. Kimari, M. Ghaemi, A. T. Perez-Fontenla, S. Calatroni, A. Grudiev, W. Wuensch, F. Djurabekova
Abstract: Copper and hydrogen are among the most common elements that are widely used in industrial and fundamental research applications. Copper surfaces are often exposed to hydrogen in the form of charged ions. The hydrogen ions can accelerate towards the surface, resulting in an accumulation of hydrogen below the surface. Harmless in low concentrations, prolonged hydrogen exposure can lead to dramatic changes on copper surfaces. This effect is visible to the naked eye in the form of blisters densely covering the exposed surface. Blisters are structural modifications that can affect the physical properties of the surface including, for example, vacuum dielectric strength. Using scanning electron microscopy we found that the blistering of the irradiated polycrystalline copper surface does not grow uniformly with ion fluence. Initially, only some grains exhibit blisters, while others remain intact. Our experiments indicate that grains with the 100 orientation are the most prone to blistering, while the grains oriented in the 110 are the most resistant to it. Moreover, we noticed that blisters assume different shapes correlating with specific grain orientation. Good agreement of experiments with the atomistic simulations explains the difference in the shapes of the blisters by specific behavior of dislocations within the FCC crystal structure. Moreover, our simulations reveal the correlation of the delay in blister formation on surfaces with certain orientations compared to the others with the dependence of the hydrogen penetration depth and the depth and amount of vacancies in copper on the orientation of the irradiated surface.

Title: Universal scaling relation for growth phenomena
Authors: Evandro A. Rodrigues, Edwin E. Mozo Luis, Thiago A. de Assis, Fernando A. Oliveira
Abstract: The Family-Vicsek relation is a seminal universal relation obtained for the global roughness at the interface of two media in the growth process. In this work, we revisit the scaling analysis and, through both analytical and computational means, show that the Family-Vicsek relation can be generalized to a new scaling independent of the size, substrate dimension $d$, and scaling exponents. We use properties of lattice growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and Villain-Lai-Das Sarma universality classes for $1 \leq d \leq 3$ to support our claims.

Title: TBHubbard: tight-binding and extended Hubbard model database for metal-organic frameworks
Authors: Pamela C. Carvalho, Federico Zipoli, Alan C. Duriez, Marco Antonio Barroca, Rodrigo Neumann Barros Ferreira, Barbara Jones, Benjamin Wunsch, Mathias Steiner
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers. Their diverse compositions and structures offer a wide range of applications, such as electrical conductivity and diffusion, which can be optimized by tuning the combination of different building blocks. The ease of modifying metal centers or organic linkers makes MOFs ideal for property prediction and inverse material design through computational modeling. Data science driven techniques can aid in the exploration of novel structures with optimize properties by employing machine learning models and using available simulation data in the literature. Here, we provide an extensive data collection with the simulation of MOFs, derived from the QMOF database, based on density-functional-theory, along with their corresponding tight-binding lattice Hamiltonian, offering insights into the electronic structure of each material. The topology information is augmented by the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors which are used as fingerprints of the local environment. Besides, the Extended Hubbard model is also used to describe a sub-set of MOFs with transition metals, where the Hubbard parameters intra-site U and inter-site V are computed. Due to the highly computational cost associated with the Hubbard calculations and the comprehensive amount of data for the tight-binding Hamiltonian, the database provided here stands as a significant contribution not only for the training of ML models to predict new properties but also to perform inverse design of new MOFs with enhanced target properties.

Title: Density-Functional Theory and Triply-Periodic Minimal Surfaces
Authors: Mengdi Yin, Jing Zhang, Dimitri D Vvedensky
Abstract: Several authors have suggested that the surfaces of vanishing potential generated by the electrostatic fields from a distribution of point charges resemble triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) corresponding to the positions of the point charges. We provide a theoretical basis for this phenomenological comparison by starting with the Boltzmann equation to show that the surface corresponding to zero charge density is a minimal surface. We then use density-functional calculations for elemental materials that differ electronically and structurally, Na, Cu, and Al, to show that surfaces of vanishing charge density converge to the corresponding TPMS.

Title: Efficient optimization and conceptual barriers in variational finite Projected Entangled-Pair States
Authors: Daniel Alcalde Puente, Erik Lennart Weerda, Konrad Schröder, Matteo Rizzi
Abstract: Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on finite two-dimensional lattices are a natural ansatz for representing ground states of local many-body Hamiltonians, as they inherently satisfy the boundary law of entanglement entropy. In this paper, we propose the optimization of PEPS via an improved formulation of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), namely the minimum-step stochastic-reconfguration scheme recently introduced for neural quantum states. We further discuss possible numerical issues that might arise in such a sampling-based approach. In this context, investigate the entanglement properties of random PEPS and find an entanglement phase transition. We note that on one side of this transition, we can identify positive random tensors as product states. To demonstrate the power of the framework described in this paper, we apply the PEPS to study the notoriously challenging chiral spin liquids. Moreover, we exhibit our approach's capability to naturally handle long-range interactions by exploring the phase diagram of Rydberg atom arrays with long-range interactions. We further provide parallelized easy-to-use code, allowing the straightforward application of our method to general Hamiltonians composed of local interaction terms.

Title: Power Spectra of Velocity Fluctuations in Granular Heap Flow
Authors: ShuChang Yu, Jin Shang, YangRui Chen, Ran Li, Quan Chen, Hui Yang, Hu Zheng, Jie Zhang
Abstract: This study used Speckle Visibility Spectroscopy to examine velocity fluctuations in a three-dimensional granular heap flow, where the mean velocity profile consists of a fast-flow surface layer and a creep layer beneath. The velocity spectra follow power-law scalings, $E(f) \propto f^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha \approx -0.85$ in the surface flow layer -- matching the Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) model with open boundaries ($\alpha \approx -0.95$). In the creep layer, $\alpha$ decreases with depth, reaching $\alpha \approx -1.5$ at approximately 55 mean particle diameters, consistent with the SOC model with closed boundaries ($\alpha \approx -1.58$). Analysis of the fluctuation velocity distributions offers additional insights into the microscopic origins of the spectrum's characteristics. These findings help resolve the long-standing puzzle of flow localization in gravity-driven granular flows despite a constant shear stress-to-pressure ratio throughout the material.

Title: Emergent quasi-particles of spin-1 trimer chain
Authors: Manodip Routh, Anutosh Biswas, Manoranjan Kumar
Abstract: The recent experimental realization of emergent quasi-particles, such as spinons, doublons, and quartons, in a spin-$1/2$ trimer chain has spurred new interest in low dimensional magnetic systems. In this study, we investigate the dynamical properties of the isotropic spin-$1$ trimer chain with intra and inter-trimer antiferromagnetic exchange couplings, ($J >0$ and $J' >0$), respectively, unveiling various quasi-particles: magnons, singletons, triplons, pentons, and heptons. For weak inter-trimer exchange coupling $J'/J \ll 1$, it behaves as an effective spin-$1$ chain with valence bond solid (VBS) ground state. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we compute the dynamic structure factor (DSF) which reveals a gapped magnon band alongside weakly dispersive singleton, excited triplon, and penton excitations. The evolution of these excitations with inter-trimer coupling $J'$ is also examined, providing insight into the underlying excitation mechanisms. For spin-$1$ chain, these exotic quasi-particles eventually reduce to conventional magnon excitations as $J'/J \rightarrow 1$. Our results shed light on the rich and complex excitation spectrum of spin-$1$ trimer chains and offer new perspectives on the dynamics in quantum spin systems.

Title: Impact and spreading dynamics of a drop of fiber suspension on a solid substrate
Authors: Sreeram Rajesh, Alban Sauret
Abstract: The presence of non-Brownian spherical particles dispersed in a liquid modifies the impact and spreading dynamics of a drop on a hydrophilic substrate. This difference in spreading dynamics is attributed to the increase in the suspension's viscosity caused by the particles. Similarly, anisotropic non-Brownian particles, such as fibers, also increase the bulk viscosity. In addition to the fiber diameter, D, the length, L, which determines the aspect ratio A = L/D, is crucial in controlling the fiber suspension viscosity. Therefore, we hypothesize that the drop impact of fiber suspensions with different volume fractions will result in a similar modification of the spreading dynamics. To investigate the impact and spreading dynamics, we prepared suspensions of fibers with an aspect ratio A = 12 at different volume fractions, spanning the dilute, semi-dilute, and dense concentration regimes. Additionally, we conducted a subset of experiments with aspect ratios A = 4 and A = 20. Furthermore, we characterized the thickness of the resulting droplet film (the coating) and the orientation of fibers after the spreading dynamics reached a steady state. The presence of fibers results in a decrease in the final droplet size, as an increase in volume fraction leads to an increase in the suspension viscosity. To rationalize these results, we used a modified equation, originally developed for spherical particles, which incorporates the suspension viscosity. Furthermore, we observed that volume fraction plays only a weak role in controlling splashing. However, it is crucial in determining the final thickness and resulting fiber coating. We also used a novel approach to quantify the final fiber orientation and showed that the resulting distribution is anisotropic within the quantified range.

Title: Revealing Nanostructures in High-Entropy Alloys via Machine-Learning Accelerated Scalable Monte Carlo Simulation
Authors: Xianglin Liu, Kai Yang, Yongxiang Liu, Fanli Zhou, Dengdong Fan, Zongrui Pei, Pengxiang Xu, Yonghong Tian
Abstract: Large-scale simulations are a powerful tool for understanding material behavior and designing new materials. However, the computational limitations of atomistic-scale simulations stemming from constraints in computational power, algorithmic efficiency, and accuracy, prevent us from modeling large systems, even at ground state,(DFT)-level precision. Here, we introduce an efficient and Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC) method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks inherent in conventional MC simulation algorithms, reducing the computational complexity of an MC sweep from cubic to linear. Leveraging the large degree of parallelization inherent in our method, we present a GPU accelerated implementation, SMC_GPU, which enables the simulation of atomistic systems exceeding one billion atoms while maintaining the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT). Using this unprecedented capability, we perform large-scale thermodynamic simulations to investigate the microstructure evolution in the FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW high entropy alloys (HEAs). Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanoscale phenomena, including short-range and long-range order, nanoparticles, and nanophases. The size, composition, and morphology of these nanostructures, which can comprise millions of atoms and thus present significant challenges for traditional methods, are analyzed with high-accuracy atomistic simulations for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Our simulations produce thermodynamic properties and nanostructures that align well with available theoretical and experimental data. More intriguingly, our results reveal that the intricate nanoscale interplay of order and disorder in HEA stems from the combined effects of chemical complexity and temperature. This work underscores the promising potential of large-scale MC simulation for this http URL alone at finite temperatures, with density functional theory

Abstract: Using the velocity gauge formalism, we develop a theoretical framework for computing the nonlinear optical responses of time-periodic quantum systems. This approach complements the length gauge formulation and offers distinct advantages in both numerical and analytical treatments, particularly for atomic and solid-state systems with well-defined momentum-space structures. By applying our framework to the Rabi model, we derive numerical solutions in the velocity gauge and compare them with the length gauge, demonstrating full agreement between the two formulations. Our findings reveal rich optical phenomena, including photon-assisted transitions, frequency mixing effects, and emergent Floquet-induced photocurrents that are absent in static systems. We demonstrate that nonlinear responses in Floquet-driven systems exhibit resonances at integer multiples of the driving frequency, providing insights into ultrafast spectroscopy and Floquet engineering of quantum materials. The present formulation establishes a bridge between theoretical models and experimental observations in driven quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum optics, photonics, and next-generation optoelectronic devices.

Title: Long-range correlations in a locally constrained exclusion process
Authors: Stefan Großkinsky, Gunter Schütz, Ali Zahra
Abstract: We introduce a novel exclusion process with a simple local kinetic constraint that leads to a remarkable transition between a homogeneous phase with short-range correlations and a clustered phase with long-range correlations and spontaneous breaking of translation invariance. The metastable dynamics of particle clusters lead to a coarsening cascade and glassy dynamics, as well as an intriguing faster-is-slower effect where an increasing asymmetry in the flow direction leads to a decrease of the stationary current.

Title: Probing superconductivity with tunneling spectroscopy in rhombohedral graphene
Authors: Denis Sedov, Mathias S. Scheurer
Abstract: Motivated by experiments on rhombohedral tetralayer graphene showing signs of superconductivity emerging from a valley-polarized normal state, we here analyze theoretically how scanning tunneling spectroscopy can be used to probe the superconducting order parameter of the system. To describe different pairing scenarios on equal footing, we develop a microscopic tunneling approach that can capture arbitrary, including finite-momentum, superconducting order parameters and low-symmetry normal-state Hamiltonians. Our analysis shows that the broken time-reversal symmetry in a single valley leads to unique features in the weak-tunneling regime that are different for commensurate and incommensurate Cooper pair momenta. We further uncover an unconventional spatial dependence of the Andreev conductance, allowing to distinguish between three topologically distinct classes of single-$\mathbf{q}$ pairing states in the system, and compute the signatures of a competing translational-symmetry breaking three-$\mathbf{q}$ ''moiré superconductor''.

Title: Stability of Majorana modes in Coulomb-disordered topological insulator nanowires
Authors: Leonard Kaufhold, Achim Rosch
Abstract: We evaluate theoretically the possibility to realize Majorana zero modes in hybrid devices made from topological-insulator (TI) nanowires proximity-coupled to a superconductor. Such systems have been suggested as building blocks of future topological quantum computers, as they have been predicted to realize Majorana zero modes protected by large gaps. A main obstacle is, however, the presence of a relatively large density of charged impurities, $n_\text{imp}\sim 10^{19}$cm$^{-3}$. Based on extensive numerical simulations, we show that the proximity to the superconductor leads to an efficient screening of the disorder potential. By analyzing the Majorana splitting energy, the size of the Andreev gap and the localization of edge modes, we show that robust Majorana modes can be realized for realistic levels of impurity concentrations and wire radii.

Title: Shear jamming transition in alternating shear rotation for frictional and frictionless suspensions
Authors: Pappu Acharya, Martin Trulsson
Abstract: Alternating shear rotations in dense suspensions have recently shown the ability to reduce both viscosity and dissipation per strain (at a fixed global shear rate). Here, we study alternating shear rotation, with extensive numerical simulations, at various angles and up to their corresponding jamming points. For increasing shear rotation angles, we find that the jamming point is continuously shifted to higher packing fractions for frictional particles, while it remains constant for frictionless particles. As a consequence, the alternating shear rotation is unable to reduce the dissipation per strain for suspensions composed of frictionless particles. We detail the individual contributions, hydrodynamic or contact, to the shear stress, being uncharted for this protocol. As the angle of rotation increases, the average contact stress decreases. However, we find that the hydrodynamics shows the opposite trend, instead increasing with increasing angle. Hence, hydrodynamic stress will dominate up to much higher packing fractions as the angle of rotation increases. In addition, we report how the microstructure varies and establish a one-to-one mapping between the contact number and its contribution to the total stress for both frictionless and frictional particles.

Title: Cryogenic Nano-Imaging of Excitons in a Monolayer Semiconductor
Authors: Anna Roche, Michael R. Koehler, David G. Mandrus, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, John R. Schaibley, Brian J. LeRoy
Abstract: Excitons, Coulomb bound electron-hole pairs, dominate the optical response of two-dimensional semiconductors across near-infrared and visible frequencies due to their large binding energy and prominent oscillator strength. Previous measurements of excitons in 2D semiconductors have primarily relied on far-field optical spectroscopy techniques which are diffraction limited to several hundred nanometers. To precisely image nanoscale spatial disorder requires an order of magnitude increase in resolution capabilities. Here, we present a study of the exciton spectra of monolayer MoSe2 in the visible range using a cryogenic scattering-type scanning near field optical microscope (s-SNOM) operating down to 11 K. By mapping the spatial variation in the exciton resonance across an hBN encapsulated MoSe2 monolayer, we achieve sub-50 nm spatial resolution and energy resolution below 1 meV. We further investigate the material's near-field spectra and dielectric function, demonstrating the ability of cryogenic visible s-SNOM to reveal nanoscale disorder. Comparison to room temperature measurements illustrate the enhanced capabilities of cryogenic s-SNOM to reveal fine-scale material heterogeneity.

Title: Random motility regulation drives the fragmentation of microbial ecosystems
Authors: Alberto Dinelli, Ada Altieri, Julien Tailleur
Abstract: The self-organization of microbial ecosystems involves a large variety of mechanisms, ranging from biochemical signaling to population dynamics. Among these, the role of motility regulation has been little studied, despite the importance of active migration processes. Here we show how weak, random motility regulation generically induces the fragmentation of bacterial ecosystems comprising a large number of coexisting strains. To do so, we simulate microscopic models of run-and-tumble bacteria whose self-propulsion speeds are regulated by the local density of each strain. Our simulations reveal that, as the heterogeneity of the interaction network increases, the ecosystem undergoes a phase transition leading to the emergence of distinct communities. To account for these results and assess their robustness, we use random-matrix theory to analyze the hydrodynamic description of the bacterial ecosystem, obtaining a quantitative agreement with our microscopic simulations. Our results are shown to hold for a variety of motility-regulation mechanisms and should be relevant to the study of community formation by motile organisms.

Title: Coupling between small polarons and ferroelectricity in BaTiO3
Authors: Darin Joseph, Cesare Franchini
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the formation of electron and hole small polarons in the prototypical ferroelectric material BaTiO3, with a focus on their interaction with ferroelectric distortive fields. To accurately describe the ferroelectric phase in electronically correlated BaTiO3, we employ the HSE06 hybrid functional, which addresses the limitations of conventional DFT and DFT+U models, providing a more precise depiction of both ferroelectric and polaronic behaviors. Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3: cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic. We uncover a unique phase-dependent trend in electron polaron stability, which progressively increases across the structural phases, peaking in the rhombohedral phase due to the constructive coupling between the polaron and ferroelectric phonon fields. In contrast, hole polarons exhibit a stability pattern largely unaffected by the phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe that polaron self-trapping significantly alters the local ferroelectric distortive pattern, which propagates to neighboring sites but has a minimal effect on the long-range macroscopic spontaneous polarization. Charge trapping is also associated with localized spin formation, opening new possibilities for enhanced functionalities in multiferroic materials.

Title: Gapless Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries
Authors: Lakshya Bhardwaj, Yuhan Gai, Sheng-Jie Huang, Kansei Inamura, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Apoorv Tiwari, Alison Warman
Abstract: The study of gapless phases with categorical (or so-called non-invertible) symmetries is a formidable task, in particular in higher than two space-time dimensions. In this paper we build on previous works arXiv:2408.05266 and arXiv:2502.20440 on gapped phases in (2+1)d and provide a systematic framework to study phase transitions with categorical symmetries. The Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) is, as often in these matters, the central tool. Applied to gapless theories, we need to consider the extension of the SymTFT to interfaces between topological orders, so-called ``club sandwiches", which realize generalizations of so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. This requires an input phase transition for a smaller symmetry, such as the Ising transition for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the SymTFT constructs a transformation to a gapless phase with a larger categorical symmetry. We carry this out for categorical symmetries whose SymTFT is a (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theory for a finite group $G$ with twist -- so-called all bosonic fusion 2-categories. We classify such interfaces using a physically motivated picture of generalized gauging, as well as with a complementary analysis using (bi-)module this http URL is exemplified in numerous abelian and non-abelian DW theories, giving rise to interesting gapless phases such as intrinsically gapless symmetry protected phases (igSPTs) and spontaneous symmetry breaking phases (igSSBs) from abelian, $S_3$, and $D_8$ DW theories.

Title: A Jellium Model for the Anomalous Hall Crystal
Authors: Tomohiro Soejima, Junkai Dong, Daniel E. Parker, Ashvin Vishwanath
Abstract: The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.

Title: Indium selenides for next-generation low-power computing devices
Authors: Seunguk Song, Michael Altvater, Wonchan Lee, Hyeon Suk Shin, Nicholas Glavin, Deep Jariwala
Abstract: As silicon-based computing approaches fundamental physical limits in energy efficiency, speed, and density, the search for complementary materials to extend or replace CMOS technology has become increasingly urgent. While two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides have been extensively investigated, van der Waals indium selenides--particularly InSe and In2Se3--offer a compelling alternative with distinct advantages for next-generation electronics. Unlike conventional 2D semiconductors, indium selenides combine exceptional electron mobility (exceeding 1,000 cm^2V^-1s^-1), high thermal velocity (>2x10^7 cm/s), thickness-tunable bandgaps (0.97-2.5 eV), and unique phase-dependent ferroelectric properties, enabling both high-performance logic and non-volatile memory functions within a single material system. This perspective critically evaluates the materials properties, fabrication challenges, and device applications of indium selenides, examining their potential to surpass silicon in ultra-scaled transistors through ballistic transport while simultaneously offering ferroelectric memory capabilities impossible in conventional semiconductors. We analyze recent breakthroughs in ballistic InSe transistors, tunnel field-effect transistors, and In2Se3-based ferroelectric devices for information storage, and identify key research priorities for addressing persistent challenges in scalable synthesis, phase control, and oxidation prevention. By bridging fundamental materials science with practical device engineering, we provide a roadmap for translating the exceptional properties of indium selenides into commercially viable, low-power computing technologies that can overcome the limitations of silicon while enabling novel computing architectures.

Title: Energy Dispersion, Superconductivity and Magnetic Fluctuations in Stacked Altermagnetism Materials
Authors: Jun Chang, Hantao Lu, Jize Zhao, Hong-Gang Luo, Yang Ding
Abstract: Recently, altermagnetism (AM) has emerged as a new category of magnetism, alongside conventional antiferromagnetism (AFM) and ferromagnetism (FM). In an AM, superconductivity (SC) is faced with a dilemma that the spin-polarized bands, induced by the broken time reversal (T ) symmetry, dominantly supports spin-triplet pairing. In contrast, AM spin fluctuations routinely facilitate spin-singlet pairing as in AFM. Consequently, unconventional SC is either absent or weak in AM materials. Here, we propose that stacking 2D AM materials could resolve this dilemma. Stacked 2D materials have yielded a variety of new electronic properties by altering the symmetries inherent in the monolayer. In a 2D anisotropic Hubbard model, we investigate the general energy dispersions of both single-layer and stacked AM materials. We demonstrate that AM sheet stacking can alter the original symmetries, consequently affecting the energy dispersion. The interlayer magnetic coupling enhances the low q magnetic fluctuations. T symmetry is restored in the AA stacking with an antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, and then both the energy dispersion and pairing interaction are in favor of spin-singlet SC. The ferromagnetic interlayer coupling in the AB stacking not only recovers T symmetry but also supports spin-triplet pairing. It is further anticipated that twisted bilayer AM sheets could exhibit additional novel electronic properties, including topology, flat bands, and collective excitations. Our work illustrates that stacking sheets of AM materials could open up a unique research domain in exploring novel quantum phenomena and offer a fertile ground for potential electronic applications.

Title: Thermal-induced ion magnetic moment in H$_4$O superionic state
Authors: Xiao Liang, Junhao Peng, Fugen Wu, Renhai Wang, Yujue Yang, Xingyun Li, Huafeng Dong
Abstract: The hydrogen ions in the superionic ice can move freely, playing the role of electrons in metals. Its electromagnetic behavior is the key to explaining the anomalous magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune. Based on the ab initio evolutionary algorithm, we searched for the stable H4O crystal structure under pressures of 500-5000 GPa and discovered a new layered chain $Pmn2_1$-H$_4$O structure with H$_3$ ion clusters. Interestingly, H3 ion clusters rotate above 900 K (with an instantaneous speed of 3000 m/s at 900 K), generating an instantaneous magnetic moment ($10^{-26}$ Am$^2 \approx 0.001 \mu_B$). Moreover, H ions diffuse in a direction perpendicular to the H-O atomic layer at 960-1000 K. This is because the hydrogen oxygen covalent bonds within the hydrogen oxygen plane hinder the diffusion behavior of H$_3$ ion clusters within the plane, resulting in the diffusion of H$_3$ ion clusters between the hydrogen oxygen planes and the formation of a one-dimensional conductive superionic state. One-dimensional diffusion of ions may generate magnetic fields. We refer to these two types of magnetic moments as "thermal-induced ion magnetic moments". When the temperature exceeds 1000 K, H ions diffuse in three directions. When the temperature exceeds 6900 K, oxygen atoms diffuse and the system becomes fluid. These findings provide important references for people to re-recognize the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen and oxygen under high pressure, as well as the sources of abnormal magnetic fields in Uranus and Neptune.

Title: Are There High-Density Deep States in AtomicLayer-Deposited IGZO Thin Film?
Authors: Liankai Zheng, Lijuan Xing, Zhiyu Lin, Wanpeng Zhao, Yuyan Fan, Yulong Dong, Ziheng Wang, Siying Li, Xiuyan Li, Ying Wu, Jeffrey Xu, Mengwei Si
Abstract: It has been well recognized that there exist high-density deep states in IGZO thin films. Many of the device characteristics of IGZO transistors, such as negative bias illumination stability (NBIS),were understood to be related to these deep states. However, in this work, it is found that deep state density (NtD) of atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) IGZO transistors can be an ultra-low value (2.3*10^12 /cm^3) by the proposed NBIS-free light assisted I-V measurements so that the deep states do not affect the I-V characteristics even in subthreshold region. This work also reveals that NBIS is not related to the photoexcitation of electrons in deep states. Our results suggest that the existence of deep states and the impact of deep states on ALD IGZO transistors may need to be revisited.

Title: Ground state and magnetic transitions of the orthorhombic antiferromagnet CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$
Authors: Xing Huang, Peiyue Ma, Mengwu Huo, Chaoxin Huang, Hualei Sun, Xiang Chen, Sihao Deng, Lunhua He, Tao Xie, Zhangzhen He, Meng Wang
Abstract: We report the systematic synthesis, crystal structure, magnetization, and powder neutron diffraction of single crystalline and polycrystalline CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ samples. CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with $Pnma$ space group, featuring chains of edge-shared CoO$_6$ octahedra arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Two antiferromagnetic transitions are observed at $T$$_{N1}$ = 14.4 K and $T$$_{N2}$ = 16.2 K, corresponding to two long-range magnetic orders with propagation vectors of $\bf{k}$$_1$ = (0, 0, 0) and $\bf{k}$$_2$ = (0.125, 0, 0.25), respectively. The ground state is determined as a canted up-up-down-down zigzag spin configuration along the $c$ axis, wherein the magnetic moments of Co1 and Co2 ions are 3.4(1) and 2.1(1)$\mu$$_B$, respectively. Successive spin-flop transitions appear with the increasing magnetic field applied along the easy axis ($c$ axis), accompanied by depression of the antiferromagnetic orders and enhancement of residual magnetic entropy. The field-induced spin-disordered state suggests that CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ may be an ideal candidate for studying frustrated magnetism.

Title: Engineering robust strain transmission in van der Waals heterostructure devices
Authors: John Cenker, Jordan Fonseca, Mai Nguyen, Chaowei Hu, Daniel G. Chica, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Xiaoyang Zhu, Xavier Roy, Jiun-Haw Chu, Xiaodong Xu
Abstract: Atomically thin van der Waals materials provide a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent quantum phenomena in solid state systems. Due to their remarkable mechanical strength, one enticing tuning knob is strain. However, the weak strain transfer of graphite and hBN, which are standard components of high-qualityvdW devices, poses fundamental challenges for high-strain experiments. Here, we investigate strain transmission in less-explored orthorhombic crystals and find robust transmission up to several percent at cryogenic temperatures. We further show that strain can be efficiently transferred through these crystals to other 2D materials in traditional heterostructure devices. Using this capability, we demonstrate in-situ strain and gate control of the optical properties of monolayer WS2 utilizing the high-\k{appa} dielectric insulator Bi2SeO5 as a substrate. These results enable the exploration of combined cryo-strain and gate tuning in a variety of layered systems such as moiré heterostructures, air-sensitive 2D magnets and superconductors, and any gated 2D device.

Title: Abundance of spin liquids in the $S=1$ bilinear-biquadratic model on the pyrochlore lattice, and its application to $\mathrm{NaCaNi}_2\mathrm{F}_7$
Authors: Rico Pohle, Nic Shannon
Abstract: Long considered the ''poor cousins'' of spin-1/2 systems, magnets built of spin-1 moments have recently come to fore as a rich source of novel phases of matter. Here we explore the phases which arise in a spin-1 magnet on the pyrochlore lattice, once biquadratic interactions are taken into account. Using a combination of variational and Monte Carlo techniques, built around the exact treatment of spin-1 at the level of a single site, we uncover seven distinct spin liquid phases. Dynamical calculations for one of these spin liquids are shown to be in good agreement with inelastic neutron scattering on the spin-1 pyrochlore $\mathrm{NaCaNi}_2\mathrm{F}_7$. These results suggest that the range of spin liquid phases found in spin-1 pyrochlores may be even richer than in materials with (pseudo-)spin-1/2 moments.

Title: Doping dependence of the magnetic ground state in the frustrated magnets Ba$_2$$M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$ ($M$ = Mn, Co)
Authors: Chaoxin Huang, Lisi Li, Peiyue Ma, Xing Huang, Tao Xie, Meng Wang
Abstract: Theoretically, the relative change of the Heisenberg-type nearest-neighbor coupling $J_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor coupling $J_2$ in the face-centered-cubic lattice can give rise to three main antiferromagnetic orderings of type-I, type-II, and type-III. However, it is difficult to tune the $J_2/J_1$ ratio in real materials. Here, we report studies on the influence of Te$^{6+}$ and W$^{6+}$ ions replacement to the magnetic interactions and the magnetic ground states in the double-perovskite compounds Ba$_2$$M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$ ($M$ = Mn, Co). For Ba$_2$MnTe$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$, the W$^{6+}$ doping on Te$^{6+}$ site is successful in $0.02 \leq x \leq 0.9$ with short-range orders of the type-I ($0.02 \leq x \leq 0.08$) and type-II ($0.1 \leq x \leq 0.9$). In Ba$_2$CoTe$_{1-x}$W${_x}$O$_6$, x-ray diffraction measurements reveal two crystal structures, including the trigonal phase ($0 \leq x \leq 0.1$) and the cubic phase ($0.5 \leq x \leq 1$), between which is a miscibility gap. Two magnetic transitions are identified in the trigonal phase due to two magnetic subsystems, and the type-II magnetic order is observed in the cubic phase. Magnetic phase diagrams of Ba$_2M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$ ($M$ = Mn, Co) are established. Our work shows that the magnetic interactions and ground states of Ba$_2$$M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$ can be tuned effectively by the replacement of Te$^{6+}$ by W$^{6+}$ ions.

Title: RKKY interaction in the presence of a charge-density-wave order
Authors: Kazushi Aoyama
Abstract: Effects of a charge-density-wave (CDW) order on the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction has been theoretically investigated. Assuming that the CDW with an incommensurate ordering vector ${\bf Q}_c$ is induced by a Fermi surface nesting, we show that the CDW order suppresses the conventional RKKY interaction and that it can induce a mode coupling between magnetic ordering vectors ${\bf q}_m$ and ${\bf q}_m\pm {\bf Q}_c$. This suggests that below the CDW transition temperature, the correlation between localized spins may develop at both ${\bf q}_m$ and ${\bf q}_m\pm {\bf Q}_c$. Experimental implications of our result to van der Waals materials $R$Te$_3$ are also discussed.

Title: Observation of multiple surface states in naturally cleavable chiral crystal PdSbSe
Authors: Zhicheng Jiang, Zhengtai Liu, Chenqiang Hua, Xiangqi Liu, Yichen Yang, Jianyang Ding, Jiayu Liu, Jishan Liu, Mao Ye, Ji Dai, Massimo Tallarida, Yanfeng Guo, Yunhao Lu, Dawei Shen
Abstract: Chiral multifold fermions in solids exhibit unique band structures and topological properties, making them ideal for exploring fundamental physical phenomena related to nontrivial topology, chirality, and symmetry breaking. However, the challenge of obtaining clean, flat surfaces through cleavage has hindered the investigation of their unique electronic states. In this study, we utilize high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to investigate the low-energy electronic structure of the cleavable single-crystal PdSbSe. Our combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals the presence of multifold degenerate fermions within this chiral crystal. We also observe multiple chiral Fermi arc surface states and spin-splitting behavior in the associated bulk bands. These findings provide unique insights into chiral, multifold fermionic states in easily cleavable crystals and offer a robust platform for further research into their unique electronic properties and potential applications in novel electronic devices.

Title: Thermodynamic optimization of finite-time feedback protocols for Markov jump systems
Authors: Rihito Nagase, Takahiro Sagawa
Abstract: In recent advances in finite-time thermodynamics, optimization of entropy production required for finite-time information processing is an important issue. In this work, we consider finite-time feedback processes in classical discrete systems described by Markov jump processes, and derive achievable bounds on entropy production for feedback processes controlled by Maxwell's demons. The key ingredients of our approach is optimal transport theory and an achievable Fano's inequality, by which we optimize the Wasserstein distance over final distributions under fixed consumed information. Our study reveals the minimum entropy production for consuming a certain amount of information, and moreover, the optimal feedback protocol to achieve it. These results are expected to lead to design principles for information processing in various stochastic systems with discrete states.

Title: Edge dependence of the Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime
Authors: Seong Jang, Geon-Hyoung Park, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Gil-Ho Lee
Abstract: The observation of Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime has attracted considerable attention, revealing the coexistence of two seemingly incompatible phases: the quantum Hall and superconducting states. However, the mechanism underlying the Josephson current remains unclear because of the observed h/2e magnetic interference period and the lack of precisely quantized Hall plateaus. To address this issue, we investigate the edge dependence of the Josephson current in graphene Josephson junctions operating in the quantum Hall regime. By systematically comparing devices with native, etched, edge-free, and gate-defined edges, we demonstrate that the Josephson current is confined to the physical edges and is highly sensitive to specific edge configurations. Our findings provide direct evidence that counter-propagating quantum Hall edge states mediate Andreev bound states, enabling Josephson coupling. These results clarify the underlying mechanism of Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime and offer new strategies for engineering superconducting hybrid devices.

Title: Extended Fractional Chern Insulators Near Half Flux in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Above the Magic Angle
Authors: Joe Finney, Aaron L. Sharpe, Linsey K. Rodenbach, Jian Kang, Xiaoyu Wang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Marc A. Kastner, Oskar Vafek, David Goldhaber-Gordon
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) -- the lattice analog of the fractional quantum Hall states -- form as fractionalized quasiparticles emerge in a partially-filled Chern band. This fractionalization is driven by an interplay of electronic interaction and quantum geometry of the underlying wavefunctions. Bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist near the magic angle of 1.1° hosts diverse correlated electronic states at zero magnetic field. When the twist angle exceeds 1.3°, the electronic bandwidth is sufficient to suppress the zero-field correlated states. Yet applying a magnetic field can restore the importance of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report strongly-correlated phases when a 1.37° twisted bilayer graphene sample is tuned to near half a magnetic flux quantum per moiré cell, deep into the Hofstadter regime. Most notably, well-quantized odd-denominator FCI states appear in multiple Hofstadter subbands, over unusually large ranges of density. This suggests a mechanism beyond disorder is stabilizing the fractional states. We also observe a bending and resetting of the Landau minifan reminiscent of the cascade of Dirac resets observed in magic-angle samples near integer filling at zero field.

Title: Combinatorial Design of Floppy Modes and Frustrated Loops in Metamaterials
Authors: Wenfeng Liu, Tomer A. Sigalov, Corentin Coulais, Yair Shokef
Abstract: Metamaterials are a promising platform for a range of applications, from shock absorption to mechanical computing. These functionalities typically rely on floppy modes or mechanically frustrated loops, both of which are difficult to design. Here, we introduce a combinatorial approach that allows to create an arbitrarily large number of floppy modes and frustrated loops. The design freedom of the mode shapes enables us to easily introduce kinematic incompatibility to turn them into frustrated loops. We demonstrate that floppy modes can be sequentially buckled by using a specific instance of elastoplastic buckling, and we utilize the designability of floppy chains and frustrated loops to demonstrate matrix-vector multiplication in materia.

Title: Frustration-free free fermions and beyond
Authors: Rintaro Masaoka, Seishiro Ono, Hoi Chun Po, Haruki Watanabe
Abstract: Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.

Title: Weyl Fermion Manipulation through Magnetic Transitions in the Ferromagnetic Non-Centrosymmetric Weyl semimetal PrAlSi
Authors: K. P. Wang, W. J. Shi, W. Z. Cao, X. T. Yang, Z. Y. Lv, C. Peng, C. Chen, D. F. Liu, H. F. Yang, L. X. Yang, M. Lyu, P. J. Sun, E. K. Liu, M. Ye, Y. L. Chen, Y. Sun, Y. P. Qi, Z. K. Liu
Abstract: PrAlSi, a non-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal candidate with a Curie temperature of 17.8K, offers a unique platform for exploring the interplay of symmetry breaking and topological electronic structures. Up to now, the Weyl fermion distribution as well as their evolution across the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition in PrAlSi has not been explored. Here, we uncover the presence of Weyl fermions in PrAlSi and demonstrate they could be manipulated through the magnetic phase transition. Our ab-initio calculations indicate a shift in the momentum and energy positions of Weyl fermions, alongside an increase in Weyl point numbers due to band splitting. The predicted band splitting and shifting of Weyl fermions are corroborated by our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. Such manipulation of Weyl fermions leads to the appearance of a net chirality charge and a significant modulation in optical conductivity, as proposed by our calculations. Our research presents a novel method for adjusting the properties of Weyl semimetals by controlling Weyl fermions through magnetic phase transitions, positioning PrAlSi as a model system.

Title: $3d$ flat bands and coupled $4f$ moments in the kagome-honeycomb permanent magnet Sm$_{2}$Co$_{17}$
Authors: Hao Zheng, Zhiguang Xiao, Ze Pan, Guowei Yang, Yi Wu, Teng Hua, Jiawen Zhang, Jiayi Lu, Jiong Li, Tulai Sun, Yu Song, Guanghan Cao, Huiqiu Yuan, Yuanfeng Xu, Ming Shi, Chao Cao, Yang Liu
Abstract: Rare earth permanent magnets (REPMs) with both localized moments and itinerant conduction bands are not only important for fundamental research but also have significant technological applications. In particular, Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ is a prototypical high-temperture REPM, where the Co atoms form a kagome-honeycomb stacked lattice. Here we report synthesis of epitaxial Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ films using molecular beam epitaxy and measurements of their momentum-resolved electronic structure from \textit{in-situ} angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our results unveil two flat bands from Co $3d$ orbitals near the Fermi level ($E_F$), one at $\sim$-300meV and another right at $E_F$, which arise from orbital-selective destructive interference and strong electron correlations, respectively. In addition, our results reveal that Sm $4f$ states are far away from $E_F$ (hence mostly localized) and exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence, caused by the $3d$-$4f$ magnetic coupling. Our findings provide direct spectroscopic insights to understand the strong uniaxial ferromagnetism in Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ (and REPMs alike). Our work also opens avenues to explore flat-band physics near $E_F$ and emergent phenomena in correlated kagome-honeycomb lattices.

Title: Interplanar magnetic exchange in CoPS$_3$
Authors: A. R. Wildes, B. Fåk, U. B. Hansen, A. Ivanov, M. Enderle, L. Puertas Peláez
Abstract: Neutron three-axis spectrometry has been used to determine the interplanar magnetic exchange parameter in the magnetic van der Waals compound CoPS$_3$. The exchange is found to be small and antiferromagnetic, estimated to be 0.020 $\pm$ 0.001 meV, which is surprising considering that the magnetic structure is correlated ferromagnetically between the ab planes. A possible explanation, involving a small anisotropy in the exchanges, is proposed. The results are discussed with reference to the other members of the transition metal-PS3 compounds.

Title: Antiferromagnetic Spin Fluctuations and Structural Transition in Cluster Mott Insulator Candidate Nb3Cl8 Revealed by 93Nb- and 35Cl-NMR
Authors: Y. Z. Zhou, X. Han, J. Luo, D. T. Wu, A. F. Fang, B. Shen, B. J. Feng, Y. G. Shi, J. Yang, R. Zhou
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies of the cluster Mott insulator candidate compound Nb3Cl8, this study performs 93Nb and 35Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements to investigate the electron correlations. Below the structural transition temperature Ts ~ 97 K, all satellites of the 93Nb NMR spectra split into three distinct peaks, which suggests symmetry lowering due to the structural transition and could be attributed to the change in the Nb-Nb bond-lengths of the Nb3 clusters. The spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 divided by the temperature T, 1/T1T, increases upon cooling to Ts for all Cl sites, whereas only the Knight shift K of Cl located at the center of the Nb3 clusters exhibits a temperature dependence similar to that observed in magnetic susceptibility. These findings collectively demonstrate the existence of strong spin correlations between the Nb atoms in Nb3Cl8, which are closely associated with Mottness.

Title: Chiral magnon splitting in altermagnetic CrSb from first principles
Authors: Yi-Fan Zhang, Xiao-Sheng Ni, Ke Chen, Kun Cao
Abstract: Altermagnetism has been proposed as a new type of magnetism, simultaneously exhibiting compensated spin moments in real space and spin-split electronic bands in reciprocal space. Alternating chiral magnon splitting is considered a unique feature of altermagnets. In this work, utilizing linear spin wave theory (LSWT), which is based on a localized spin picture and itinerant time-dependent density functional perturbation theory (TD-DFPT), we investigate the spin fluctuation spectra of altermagnetic CrSb. Along the L-$\Gamma$-L$^{\prime}$ path, the LSWT provides a chiral magnon splitting of up to 9 meV, located at high excitation energies around 140 meV, which is identified to be primarily driven by the splitting of two long-range exchange interactions, with exchange paths along the body diagonal lines of the unit cell. On the other hand, the more realistic TD-DFPT obtains more significant splitting of $\sim$ 30 meV at maximum. However, the splitting is severely smeared out due to strong Landau damping from the Stoner continuum, which may make it difficult to observe experimentally, e.g. through inelastic neutron scattering. We further provide a brief discussion on the connection between the Stoner excitations and the chiral magnon splitting.

Title: Incommensurate and commensurate antiferromagnetic orders in the kagome compound UV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$

Abstract: We report on the synthesis of single crystals of a new kagome compound, UV$_6$Sn$_6$, and present the results of magnetization, electrical resistivity, heat capacity, X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments to characterize the structure and magnetic properties. UV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystallizes in a large supercell of the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$ parent structure with an hexagonal symmetry in which some of the U atoms are shifted by $c/2$ in an ordered fashion. Below $T_{N1}=30$ K, an incommensurate magnetic structure with a temperature-dependent wavevector $(0,0,k_z)$ is observed. Below $T_{N2}=23.5$ K, the wavevector locks in to $(0,0,0.5)$ forming an antiferromagnetic ground state. The U moments align along the \(c\) axis retaining a large magnetic anisotropy.

Title: Unified mechanism of charge-density-wave and high-$T_c$ superconductivity protected from oxygen vacancies in bilayer nickelates
Authors: Daisuke Inoue, Youichi Yamakawa, Seiichiro Onari, Hiroshi Kontani
Abstract: Unconventional charge and spin density-wave states are commonly observed in bilayer nickelates, drawing considerable attention due to their proximity to high-$T_c$ superconductivity in various phase diagrams. However, the nature and mechanisms of charge and spin density-waves (DWs) in nickelates remain poorly understood. Numerous experiments have reported that the charge-density-wave (CDW) transition temperature $T_{ cdw}$ and the spin-density-wave (SDW) transition temperature $T_{sdw}$ are closely related but distinct. However, in contrast to these experiments, previous mean-field-type analyses have yielded only a simple SDW phase. To resolve this key problem, this paper demonstrates that sizable CDW instabilities emerge in proportion to the SDW instability in La$3$Ni$2$O$7$.This behavior is driven by the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism, which captures important electron correlations beyond mean-field theory. Therefore, (i) experimental CDW + SDW coexisting state is naturally explained. In addition, (ii) the CDW + SDW fluctuations cooperatively drive high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Notably, the predicted $s$-wave SC state is robust against the inner apical O vacancies. Furthermore, (iii) the CDW instability is highly sensitive to the size of the $d_{z^2}$-orbital hole pocket, allowing for the realization of CDW quantum criticality through carrier-doping and pressure application. We find that the coexistence of charge and spin fluctuations is essential in bilayer nickelates, with both playing a cooperative role in mediating high-$T_c$ superconductivity.

Title: Tunable topological protection in Rydberg lattices via a novel quantum Monte Carlo approach
Authors: Pranay Patil, Owen Benton
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have recently been conjectured to host $Z_2$ quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in certain parameter regimes. Due to the strong interactions between these atoms, it is not possible to analytically study these systems, and one must resort to Monte Carlo sampling of the path integral to reach definite conclusions. We use a tailored update, specifically designed to target the low energy excitations of the QSL. This allows us to reliably simulate Rydberg atoms on a triangular lattice in the proposed QSL regime. We identify a correlated paramagnetic phase at low temperatures which hosts topological protection similar to a $Z_2$ spin liquid up to a length scale tuned by Hamiltonian parameters. However, this correlated paramagnet seems to be continuously connected to the trivial paramagnetic regime and thus does not seem to be a true QSL. This result indicates the feasibility of Rydberg atom arrays to act as topological qubits.

Title: Echo state property and memory capacity of artificial spin ice
Authors: Tomohiro Taniguchi
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing by using artificial spin ice (ASI) has been proposed on the basis of both numerical and experimental analyses. ASI is a many-body system consisting of ferromagnets with various interactions. Recently, fabricating magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) as ferromagnets in an ASI was achieved in the experiment, which enables an electrical detection of magnetic state of each MTJ independently. However, performing a recognition task of time-dependent signal by such an MTJ-based ASI has not been reported yet. In this work, we examine numerical simulation of a recognition task of time-dependent input and evaluate short-term memory and parity-check capacities. These capacities change significantly when the magnitude of the input magnetic field is comparable to a value around which the magnetization alignment is greatly affected by the dipole interaction. It implies that the presence of the dipole interaction results in a loss of echo state property. This point was clarified by evaluating Lyapunov exponent and confirming that the drastic change of the memory capacities appears near the boundary between negative and zero exponents, which corresponds to the edge of echo state property.

Title: Entropic bottlenecks to nematic ordering in an $RP^{2}$ apolar spin model
Authors: B. Kamala Latha, V. S. S. Sastry, S. R. Shenoy
Abstract: The Lebwohl-Lasher model of liquid crystals with (d = 2, n = 3) describes interacting apolar spins, with an $RP^{2}$ order-parameter topology. Simulations with a modified Wang-Landau Monte Carlo protocol, that includes a density of states (DoS) factor, had previously found a zero latent-heat transition at $T=T_{n}$ to a novel nematic order, coexisting with unbound defects whose binding is completed only on cooling. We find through this entropically augmented MC protocol, that there is a deep dip in the DoS at an energy preceding global ordering, reflecting 'sparse' intermediate configurations, or entropy barriers. The narrow entropic bottleneck induces a cusp in the initially rising nematic correlation length, at a micro-canonical 'precursor' temperature $T=T_{p}$. A finite-scale cooperativity of defects and nematic clusters penetrates the bottleneck at $T_{p}$ to enable a third-order phase transition at a lower $T_{n}$: a rare pathway, overlooked by energy-only acceptance protocols.

Title: Ferromagnetism in LaFeO3/LaNiO3 Superlattices with High Curie Temperature
Authors: Tianlin Zhou, Fei Gao, Qinghua Zhang, Yuansha Chen, Xinzhe Hu, Yuzhou He, Yuchen Zhao, Jianjie Li, Minghang Li, Shaojin Qi, Fengxia Hu, Jirong Sun, Yunzhong Chen, Baogen Shen
Abstract: Interfacing complex oxides in atomically engineered layered structures can give rise to a wealth of exceptional electronic and magnetic properties that surpass those of the individual building blocks. Herein, we demonstrate a ferromagnetic spin order with a high Curie temperature of 608 K in superlattices consisting of otherwise paramagnetic perovskite LaNiO3 (LNO) and antiferromagnetic LaFeO3 (LFO). The extraordinary ferromagnetism likely results from the covalent exchange due to interfacial charge transfer from Fe to Ni cations. By deliberately controlling the thickness of the LNO sublayers thus the amount of charge transfer, a robust ferromagnetism of 4 uB is realized for a stacking periodicity consisting of one single unit cell of both LNO and LFO, an emergent double perovskite phase of La2FeNiO6 with B-site layered ordering configurations. The ferromagnetic LFO/LNO superlattices offer great potential for the search of emergent magnetodielectric and/or multiferroic properties as well as applications in spintronics and electrocatalysts.

Title: Revisiting the Extraction of Coupling Strength for Polaron Hopping from $ab~initio$ Approach
Authors: Hala Houmsi, Benoit Sklénard, Marc Guillaumont, François Triozon, Jing Li
Abstract: Accurately determining the coupling strength between polaron states is essential to describe charge-hopping transport in materials. In this work, we revisit methodologies to extract coupling strengths using ab initio approaches. Our findings underscore the critical role of incorporating anharmonic effects in the model Hamiltonian when analyzing total energy variations along reaction coordinates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling strength extraction based on total energy calculated from ab initio approaches is fundamentally limited due to the stabilization of diabatic states, which do not involve coupling strength. We demonstrate that such limitation exists in both DFT+U and HSE hybrid functionals, which are widely used in the study of polaron transport. Instead, we suggest extracting coupling strength directly from the electronic structure of a system in neutral conditions. The neutral condition avoids overestimating coupling strength due to additional energy splitting between bonding and anti-bonding states from the charging energy. This study highlights the limitations of existing methods and introduces a robust framework for accurately extracting coupling parameters, paving the way for improved modeling of charge transport in complex materials.

Title: Microscopic mechanisms of flexoelectricity in oxide membranes
Authors: Harikrishnan KP, Varun Harbola, Jaehong Choi, Kevin J. Crust, Yu-Tsun Shao, Chia-Hao Lee, Dasol Yoon, Yonghun Lee, Gregory D. Fuchs, Cyrus E. Dreyer, Harold Y. Hwang, David A. Muller
Abstract: Modern electromechanical actuators and sensors rely on the piezoelectric effect that linearly couples strain and electric polarization. However, this effect is restricted to materials that lack inversion symmetry. In contrast, the flexoelectric effect couples strain gradients to electric polarization, and is a universal property in insulating materials of arbitrary symmetry. Flexoelectricity becomes prominent at the nanoscale from the inverse scaling of strain gradients with material dimensions. Here, we measure the strain-gradient-induced structural distortions in strontium titanate using multislice electron ptychography. This technique enables reliable picometer-scale measurements of the dominant oxygen-titanium distortions, correcting for artifacts that limited conventional imaging methods. This enables us to directly measure the sign of the net ionic contribution to the flexoelectric polarization. Guided by the experimental measurements, first-principles calculations show how the sign and magnitude of the bulk contribution to the flexoelectric coefficient in strontium titanate can be switched by tuning the strain state. Hybridization between the optical soft phonon and acoustic phonon modes drives this transition, yielding a large response and a polarity switch across the resonance. This strain-dependence might explain the sign discrepancy and orders of magnitude variation in the values of previously reported flexoelectric coefficients for strontium titanate. As the strain state of curved membranes can be tuned, our approach also suggests an approach to engineer nanoscale flexoelectric polarization using strain as a control parameter.

Title: Switching on and off the spin polarization of the conduction band in antiferromagnetic bilayer transistors
Authors: Fengrui Yao, Menghan Liao, Marco Gibertini, Cheol-Yeon Cheon, Xiaohanwen Lin, Fan Wu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ignacio Gutiérrez-Lezama, Alberto F. Morpurgo
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic conductors with suitably broken spatial symmetries host spin-polarized bands, which lead to transport phenomena commonly observed in metallic ferromagnets. In bulk materials, it is the given crystalline structure that determines whether symmetries are broken and spin-polarized bands are present. Here we demonstrate experimentally that double-gate transistors realized on bilayers of van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS4 allow the relevant symmetry to be controlled by a perpendicular electric displacement field. Such a level of control enables the spin-polarization of the conduction band to be switched on and off. Because conduction band states with opposite spin-polarizations are hosted in the different layers and are spatially separated, these devices also give control over the magnetization of the electrons that are accumulated electrostatically. Our experiments show that double-gated CrPS4 transistors provide a viable platform to create gate-induced conductors with near unity spin polarization at the Fermi level, as well as devices with a full electrostatic control of the total magnetization of the system.

Title: High-performance and reliable probabilistic Ising machine based on simulated quantum annealing

Abstract: Probabilistic computing with pbits is emerging as a computational paradigm for machine learning and for facing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with the so-called probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs). From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled pbits, and the energy minimization algorithm. Regarding the latter, in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems, planted Ising problem, and travelling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the architecture of a fully connected CMOS based PIM able to run the SQA algorithm having a spin-update time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are hardware agnostic and can be applied in the co-design of any hybrid analog digital Ising machine implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation of reliable and scalable PIMs.

Title: Role of Dimensionality on Excitonic Properties of BiSeI using Many-body Perturbative Approaches
Authors: Sanchi Monga, Saswata Bhattacharya
Abstract: The mechanical exfoliation of two-dimensional materials has sparked significant interest in the study of low-dimensional structures. In this work, we investigate the bulk and low-dimensional derivatives of BiSeI, a quasi-one-dimensional anisotropic crystal known for its remarkable stability and novel electronic properties. Using the density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, we examine the influence of dimensionality on their electronic, optical, and excitonic properties. Quasi-particle $\mathit{G_0W_0}$ calculations reveal a significant increase in the band gap with a decrease in dimensionality, driven by quantum confinement effects and reduced dielectric screening. By solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we identify a transition from weakly bound Wannier-Mott excitons in bulk BiSeI to strongly bound excitons its low-dimensional forms. These structures feature band gaps spanning the infrared to the visible spectrum and exhibit large exciton binding energies, making them promising for next-generation optoelectronics and excitonic applications. Our findings provide a theoretical foundation for future experimental studies on BiSeI and its low-dimensional counterparts.

Title: Giant energy density nitride dielectrics enabled by a paraelectric-metaparaelectric phase transition
Authors: Zhijie Liu, Xingyue Ma, Lan Chen, Xiaohong Yan, Jun-Ming Liu, Chun-Gang Duan, Jorge Íñiguez-González, Di Wu, Yurong Yang
Abstract: Electrostatic dielectric capacitors are foundational to advance the electronics and electric power devices due to their ultrafast charging/discharging capability and high-power density. However, the low energy density limits the potential for next generation devices in terms of miniaturization and integration. We propose a strategy that relies on inducing a field-driven phase transition that we denote paraelectric-metaparaelectric, which yields an ultrahigh energy density in III-nitrides. III-nitride compounds (Al, Sc, B)N with certain cation concentrations possess a nonpolar hexagonal ground phase which could transform into a polar wurtzite phase under a very large electric field, which is denoted as metaparaelectric with nearly null hysteresis P-E loop. This paraelectric-metaparaelectric transition leads to a polarization saturation at large electric field. The corresponding P-E loop displays a giant energy density of 308 J/cm$^3$ with high efficiency nearly 100%. The proposed paraelectric-metaparaelectric phase transition strategy in nitrides opens an avenue to design of next generation high performance dielectrics.

Title: From time crystals to time quasicrystals: Exploring novel phases in transverse field Ising chains
Authors: Davood Marripour, Jahanfar Abouie
Abstract: Time crystals (TCs) and time quasicrystals (TQCs) represent novel phases of matter that arise from the breaking of time translational symmetry in periodically and quasiperiodically driven quantum systems. In this study, we explore the formation of a TQC phase within the disordered quantum Ising chain model under a transverse field (ITF). Notably, TQCs demonstrate robust subharmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies, unlike traditional TCs which respond at a single frequency. Our analysis reveals that the TQC phase exhibits stable magnetization responses even in the presence of interaction perturbations and imperfections in the quasiperiodic driving fields. Employing exact diagonalization techniques, we find that increasing the chain length further stabilizes both TC and TQC phases. These results suggest promising pathways for experimental realization of TQCs in cold atomic systems and quantum simulators, opening avenues for deeper investigation into these intriguing dynamical phenomena.

Title: Engineering tunable fractional Shapiro steps in colloidal transport
Authors: Andris P. Stikuts, Seemant Mishra, Artem Ryabov, Philipp Maass, Pietro Tierno
Abstract: Shapiro steps are quantized plateaus in the velocity-force or velocity-torque curve of a driven system, when its speed remains constant despite an increase in the driving force. For microscopic particles driven across a sinusoidal potential, integer Shapiro steps have been observed. By driving a single colloidal particle across a time-modulated, non-sinusoidal periodic optical landscape, we here demonstrate that fractional Shapiro steps emerge in addition to integer ones. Measuring the particle position via individual particle tracking, we reveal the underlying microscopic mechanisms that produce integer and fractional steps and demonstrate how these steps can be controlled by tuning the shape and driving protocol of the optical potential. The flexibility offered by optical engineering allows us to generate wide ranges of potential shapes and to study, at the single-particle level, synchronization behavior in driven soft condensed matter systems.

Title: Deep Neural Network-Based Voltage Prediction for Alkali-Metal-Ion Battery Materials
Authors: Sk Mujaffar Hossain, Namitha Anna Koshi, Seung-Cheol Lee, G.P Das, Satadeep Bhattacharjee
Abstract: Accurately predicting the voltage of battery materials is essential for advancing energy storage technologies and designing more efficient, high-performance batteries. In this study, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict the average voltage of materials used in Li-ion, Na-ion, and other alkali-metal-ion batteries. A comprehensive dataset was compiled from the Materials Project, incorporating a diverse set of features, including structural, physical, chemical, electronic, and thermodynamic properties, along with battery-specific descriptors. These features were utilized to construct a robust DNN model aimed at facilitating the discovery of novel battery materials. The model performance evaluated through 10-fold cross validation achieving an R$^2$ value of 0.99 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.069 V on the validation dataset. This high level of accuracy underscores the model's capability to capture the complex relationship between material properties and electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that machine learning approaches, particularly DNN models, can provide rapid and reliable voltage predictions without relying on computationally expensive first-principles calculations. This research shows how systematic data analysis can accelerate the identification and improvement of next-generation battery materials. By focusing on key material properties and using computational methods, our study lays the groundwork for faster development of new energy storage solutions.

Title: Pathways to crystal chirality An algorithm to identify new displacive chiral phase transitions
Authors: Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Aldo H. Romero, Eric Bousquet
Abstract: We present an algorithm that integrates pseudosymmetry search with first-principles calculations to systematically identify achiral parent structures and establish potential chiral displacive transitions linking them to their corresponding chiral phases within the 22 enantiomorphic space groups. This approach enables a robust exploration of structural relationships, offering new insights into symmetry-driven properties. Our workflow streamlines the discovery of displacive chiral phase transitions driven by soft phonon modes, providing insights into the mechanisms of structural chirality in inorganic materials. We apply this methodology on the chiral phases of TeO$_2$, Na$_2$SeO$_9$, Sr$_2$As$_2$O$_7$, As$_2$O$_5$, Rb$_2$Be$_2$O$_3$, and CaTe$_2$O$_3$. Demonstrating that some do not have a minimal supergroup that allows for an achiral phase; some can have a minimal supergroup, still, no unstable phonon mode exists in the achiral phase; and somewhere the minimal supergroup exists with a soft phonon mode connecting the identified achiral phase and the chiral phase through small continuous displacements.

Title: Drivers of chemical diffusion of hydrogen in the thin transition metallic glass V80Zr20
Authors: Lennart Spode, Ola Hartmann, Gunnar Karl Pálsson
Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of using optical transmission to determine concentration-dependent hydrogen diffusion coefficients and activation energies of thin metallic glass films over a wide range of temperatures and concentrations. The hydrogen concentration's temporal and spatial profiles are simultaneously extracted without requiring a metal-insulator transition or hydride formation. The concentration-dependent activation energy is extracted and is found to exhibit similar concentration dependence as hydrogen in the disordered bulk alpha-phase of vanadium. The activation energy is in stark contrast, however, to the activation energy found in epitaxial vanadium films of similar thickness. The chemical diffusion increases with hydrogen concentration in the glass, whereas it decreases in the crystalline case owing to the differences in the thermodynamic factors. This technique provides detailed insight into the concentration dependence of hydrogen diffusion and constrains theories treating correlated motion of hydrogen and short-range hydrogen-hydrogen interaction. The method can be applied to other materials that show an optical response to hydrogen uptake.

Title: Room-temperature Cooper pairing via ionic bonds in cuprate and nickelate superconductors with thirty-one experimental evidences
Authors: Jun-jie Shi, Yao-hui Zhu
Abstract: Targeting the key issue of the microscopic mechanism for high-T$_c$ superconductivity in cuprates and nickelates and following the principle of "exploring the pairing mechanism of electrons by tracing their migration and gathering", we propose a new idea of electron e$^-$ (hole h$^+$) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, i.e., the local e$^-$-O-e$^-$ (h$^+$-M-h$^+$) picture, based on the strong ionic bonding and the strong attraction of the oxygen nuclei to electrons, which clarifies numerous experimental puzzles. The Cooper-pair wavefunction and its typical characteristics are given. It is this universal picture, confirmed through diverse experimental evidence, most notably the STM tunneling constant-current image on the CuO$_2$ plane combining with the ultra-small Cooper-pair size as an ironclad proof, that determines the unconventional high-T$_c$ superconductivity of oxide superconductors. According to our e$^-$-O-e$^-$ (h$^+$-M-h$^+$) picture, the room-temperature electron (hole) pairing can be realized in ionic oxides, laying a key foundation for achieving the room-temperature superconductivity, and bringing the dream of room-temperature superconductors one step closer.

Title: Three-body Physics in the Impurity Limit of 39K Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: A. M. Morgen, S. S. Balling, M. T. Strøe, T. G. Skov, M. R. Skou, A. G. Volosniev, J. J. Arlt
Abstract: Loss spectroscopy is a key tool for investigating systems where important system parameters are linked to intrinsic resonant loss processes. We investigate three-body loss processes of impurity atoms embedded in a medium of a Bose-Einstein Condensate close to a Feshbach resonance. In this case, the loss processes occur faster than the measurement duration, impeding a direct time-resolved measurement. Here, we discuss how an even faster two-body loss process can be used to probe the system. The time-dependent number of atoms in the medium is reconstructed from such measurements, allowing for a measurement of the three-body loss rate coefficient $L_3$ and its scaling with scattering length. Moreover, the medium atom number is reconstructed from spectroscopic loss measurements. This allows for a comparison of the medium densities based on both the extracted loss rates and the spectroscopically reconstructed atom number. Finally, the number of lost medium atoms per loss event is evaluated and found to exceed 2 at strong interactions, which is attributed to secondary collisions in the medium. These investigations establish the use of a fast loss mechanism as a new tool in the field and provide quantitative measurements of three-body losses at large interaction strengths.

Title: Giant spin shift current in two-dimensional altermagnetic multiferroics VOX$\mathrm{_2}$
Authors: Yao Yang, Jinxiong Jia, Longjun Xiang, Fuming Xu, Hao Jin
Abstract: Altermagnets represent a novel class of magnetic materials that integrate the advantages of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, providing a rich platform for exploring the physical properties of multiferroic materials. Here, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers ($\mathrm{X = Cl, Br, I}$) are two-dimensional ferroelectric altermagnets, as confirmed by symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations. $\mathrm{VOI_2}$ monolayer exhibits a strong magnetoelectric coupling coefficient ($\alpha_S \approx 1.208 \times 10^{-6}~\mathrm{s/m}$), with spin splitting in the electronic band structure tunable by both electric and magnetic fields. Additionally, the absence of inversion symmetry in noncentrosymmetric crystals enables significant nonlinear optical effects, such as shift current (SC). The x-direction component of SC component is observed to have an ferroicity-driven switch. Moreover, the $\sigma^{yyy}$ component exhibits an exceptionally large spin SC of $330.072~\mathrm{\mu A/V^2}$. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between magnetism and ferroelectricity, offering versatile tunability of electronic and optical properties. $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers provide a promising platform for advancing two-dimensional multiferroics, paving the way for energy-efficient memory devices, nonlinear optical applications and opto-spintronics.

Title: Gate electrode-induced nonreciprocal resistance in topological insulators
Authors: Sofie Kölling, Florian R. Westerhof, Alexander Brinkman
Abstract: A common method of controlling the chemical potential in topological insulators is applying a gate electrode. Simultaneously applying high source-drain bias currents can lead to parasitic effects in such devices. We derive that these parasitic effects lead to a gradient in the Hall effect along the current lead of a Hall bar. Consequently, nonreciprocal effects in both longitudinal and Hall voltages appear upon reversing the bias. These effects scale similarly to the magnetochiral anisotropy, requiring detailed analysis to make a distinction. Experimentally we show that nonreciprocal effects can appear in materials where magnetochiral anisotropy is not expected while a top gate is present. Without gate electrode, this nonreciprocal effect is found to be absent. These results show the importance of considering and, if possible, excluding gate electrode-induced effects when searching for nonreciprocal resistance intrinsic to a material.

Title: Effects of Disorder on the Energy Landscape and Motional Mechanisms Involved in Lithium Ion Dynamics and Transport in Solid Electrolytes: Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 Argyrodite as a Case Study
Authors: Mohammad Ali Badragheh, Vanessa Miß, Bernhard Roling, Michael Vogel
Abstract: 7Li NMR diffusometry and relaxometry are combined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to compare the mechanisms for the dynamics and transport of lithium ions in disordered and crystalline electrolytes with argyrodite composition Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5. The dc conductivity of a disordered sample prepared by ball milling amounts to 0.76 mScm-1 at room temperature, which is substantially lower than that of two previously studied crystalline argyrodites differing in the order of the anion sublattice due to various heat treatments. However, the activation energy of the dc conductivity is smaller for ball-milled disordered Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 (E_dc= 0.35 eV) than for both crystalline compounds (E_dc= 0.38 eV). 7Li NMR field-gradient measurements of the self-diffusion coefficient D and its activation energy E_D confirm these findings and, furthermore, reveal different Haven ratios. 7Li NMR field-cycling relaxometry shows that the lithium ion jumps in ball-milled Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 are described by very broad dynamical susceptibilities arising from a temperature-independent Gaussian-like distribution of activation energies g(E_a) with a mean value of E_m= 0.43 eV, while the susceptibilities indicated a high-energy cutoff for the crystalline electrolytes. Based on different relations between the activation energies for the conductivity, diffusivity and jumps, we discuss that the shape and exploration of the energy landscapes of ball-milled and crystalline Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 samples strongly differ. Moreover, significant differences in the preexponential factor of the dc conductivity, the Haven ratio and the single-particle correlation factor point to distinct types of anion lattice disorder of the ball-milled disordered and heat-treated crystalline samples.

Title: Magnetization-induced symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe$_2$
Authors: Zhongzheng Yang, Fanbang Zheng, Dingsong Wu, Bin-Bin Zhang, Ning Li, Wenhui Li, Chaofan Zhang, Guang-Ming Zhang, Xi Chen, Yulin Chen, Shichao Yan
Abstract: The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe$_2$, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortex. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe$_2$ have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe$_2$ with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction of UTe$_2$ (crystallographic a axis). Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the depth of the superconducting gap and the coherence peak on the one side of the vortex core are stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Considering the distribution of the magnetic field in the vortex, this symmetry breaking is due to the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe$_2$ and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic fields.

Title: Negative Currents in Fabry-Pérot Cavities are Caused by Interfering Paths
Authors: Mrinmoyee Saha, Luca Horray, Pedro Portugal, Christian Flindt
Abstract: The time-dependent electric current in a Fabry-Pérot cavity can turn negative even if the time-dependent voltage is always positive. Here we present an analytic theory of this surprising phenomenon, showing that it is a purely quantum mechanical effect. It only occurs at low temperatures, and it is caused by interferences between paths through the cavity with different numbers of round trips. We provide realistic parameters for observing the negative currents in an experiment and show that a similar phenomenon is expected for the heat current, which may also turn negative.

Title: Exact Results in Stochastic Processes with Division, Death, and Diffusion: Spatial Correlations, Marginal Entropy Production, and Macroscopic Currents
Authors: Samuel Cameron, Elsen Tjhung
Abstract: We consider a generic class of stochastic particle-based models whose state at an instant in time is described by a set of continuous degrees of freedom (e.g. positions), and the length of this set changes stochastically in time due to birth-death processes. Using a master equation formalism, we write down the dynamics of the corresponding (infinite) set of probability distributions: this takes the form of coupled Fokker-Planck equations with model-dependent source and sink terms. We derive the general expression of entropy production rate for this class of models in terms of path irreversibility. To demonstrate the practical use of this framework, we analyze a biologically motivated model incorporating division, death, and diffusion, where spatial correlations arise through the division process. By systematically integrating out excess degrees of freedom, we obtain the marginal probability distribution, enabling exact calculations of key statistical properties such as average density and correlation functions. We validate our analytical results through numerical Brownian dynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement between theory and simulation. Our method thus provides a powerful tool for tackling previously unsolved problems in stochastic birth-death dynamics.

Title: Low-Temperature Remote Plasma Synthesis of Highly Porous TiO$_2$ as Electron Transport Layers in Perovskite Solar Cells
Authors: Jose M. Obrero-Perez, Fernando Nunez-Galvez, Lidia Contreras-Bernal, Javier Castillo-Seoane, Gloria P. Moreno, Triana Czermak, Francisco J. Aparicio, Teresa C. Rojas, Francisco J. Ferrer, Ana Borras, Angel Barranco, Juan R Sanchez-Valencia
Abstract: Halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer high efficiency and low costs, making them key for future photovoltaics. Optimizing charge transport layers is crucial, with porous TiO$_2$ widely used as electron transport layers (ETL) due to its energy alignment, transparency, and abundance. However, its efficiency relies on crystallinity requiring high-temperature processing (>450$^\circ$C), increasing costs and limiting flexible substrates. Low-temperature wet-chemical methods face scalability issues due to material waste and hazardous solvents. In this context, plasma-based technologies are emerging as a more efficient and sustainable alternative to oxide-based ETLs. This study presents the synthesis of TiO$_2$ layers using an advanced plasma method combining remote plasma-assisted vacuum deposition (RPAVD) and soft plasma etching (SPE) at mild temperatures (<200$^\circ$C), allowing control of microstructure and porosity. The resulting nanocolumnar film, decorated with a highly porous aerogel-like layer, enhances optical and electronic properties. These plasma-synthesized TiO$_2$ layers are antireflective and improve the efficiency in porous n-i-p PSCs, matching the performance of high-temperature reference cells. These PSCs achieve a champion PCE of 14.6%, a high value compared to reference devices synthesized at 450°C. Impedance spectroscopy confirms high recombination resistance and stable capacitance, linked to improved perovskite crystallinity. Our results highlight the potential of the RPAVD+SPE approach for producing low-temperature efficient ETLs, providing a feasible, industrially scalable, and eco-friendly alternative for manufacturing flexible, high-performance photovoltaic devices.

Title: Unprecedented superionicity of ultra-low barrier in A0.5CoO2 (A=Li, Zn)
Authors: Xuechen Wang, Yaxin Gao, Menghao Wu
Abstract: The ion conductivity of a solid-state ion conductor generally increases exponentially upon reduction in ion migration barrier. For prevalent cathode material LiCoO2, the room-temperature ion conductivity and migration barrier are respectively around 10-4 S/cm and 0.3 eV. In this paper, through first-principles calculations we predict the existence of 1D superionicity as the Li ions in O2 LiCoO2 are transformed to Zn0.5CoO2 or Li0.5CoO2 via cation-exchange reaction or deintercalation. The ion migration barriers (0.01-0.02 eV) even lower than room-temperature ~kBT are reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared with LiCoO2, which are facilitated by facile transition of mobile ions between two coordination configurations. The room-temperature ion conductivity is estimated to be over 50 S/cm, enhanced by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared with current highest reported value. Such unprecedented superionicity may also exist in other similar layered ion conductors, which may render technical advances and exotic effects such as ultrafast ion batteries and quantized ferroelectricity.

Title: Current Advances in Magnetoelectric Composites with Various Interphase Connectivity Types
Authors: Youness Hadouch, Daoud Mezzane, M barek Amjoud, Hana Ursic, Abdelilah Lahmar, Brigita Rozic, Igor Lukyanchuk, Zdravko Kutnjak, Mimoun El Marssi
Abstract: Magnetoelectric composites integrate the coupling between magnetic and piezoelectric materials to create new functionalities for potential technological applications. This coupling is typically achieved through the exchange of magnetic, electric, or elastic energy across the interfaces between the different constituent materials. Tailoring the strength of the magnetoelectric effect is primarily accomplished by selecting suitable materials for each constituent and by optimizing geometrical and microstructural designs. Various composite architectures, such as (0-3), (2-2), (1-3) and core-shell connectivities, have been studied to enhance magnetoelectric coupling and other required physical properties in composites. This review examines the latest advancements in magnetoelectric materials, focusing on the impact of different interphase connectivity types on their properties and performance. Before exploring magnetic-electric coupling, a brief overview of the historical background of multiferroic magnetoelectric composites is provided. Fundamental concepts underlying the magnetoelectric effect, piezoelectricity, and the magnetostrictive effect are explained, including their origins and examples of these materials' properties. So far, three types of magnetoelectric composite connectivities have been investigated experimentally: particulate composites (0-3), laminated and thin films (2-2), sticks embedded in matrix, core-shell particles, and coaxial fibers. An outlook on the prospects and scientific challenges in the field of multiferroic magnetoelectric composites is given at the end of this review.

Title: Theoretical Investigation of High-Tc Superconductivity in Sr-Doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure
Authors: Lei Shi, Ying Luo, Wei Wu, Yunwei Zhang
Abstract: The recent discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has established a novel platform for studying unconventional superconductors. However, achieving superconductivity in this system currently requires relatively high pressures. In this study, we propose a chemical pressure strategy via Sr substitution to stabilize high-Tc superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient this http URL density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (x = 0.25, 0.5, 1) at ambient pressure and identify two dynamically stable phases:La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$.Our calculations reveal that both phases exhibit metallization of the $\sigma$-bonding bands dominated by Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals-a key feature associated with high-Tc superconductivity, as reported in the high-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Further analysis using tight-binding models shows that the key hopping parameters in La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$ closely resemble those of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, indicating that strong super-exchange interactions between interlayer Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals are preserved. These findings suggest that Sr-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a promising candidate for realizing high-Tcsuperconductivity at ambient pressure.

Title: Emergent charge-transfer ferromagnetism and Fractional Chern states in moiré MoTe$_2$

Abstract: Two-dimensional moire materials present unprecedented opportunities to explore quantum phases of matter arising from the interplay of band topology and strong this http URL of the most striking examples is the recent observation of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe2) with relatively large twist angles(~3.7deg-3.9deg). The electronic ground states are usually expected to be sensitive to the twist angle, as the twist angle determines the electron bandwidth and correlation strength in the moire system. Here, we report the observation of unexpected competing magnetic ground states in tMoTe2 moire superlattice, on which balance can be tipped by both twist angle and electric field (E). Specifically, we observed anomalous antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground states with zero Hall resistance at both v_h=1 and 2/3, at intermediate twist angles ~3deg. The AFM orders are suppressed by applying vertical E, and emergent charge-transfer ferromagnetism accompanied by integer Chern insulator (ICI) or fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states are observed near the critical E (E_c) of moire superlattice symmetry transition. Our results demonstrate tMoTe2 as a fascinating platform for exploring unexpected correlated phases with nontrivial topology and fractional excitations and point to electric-field-controlled ultralow-power spin-valleytronic devices.

Title: Ferroelectric control of antiferromagnetism via coordination swapping in A2Mo3O8 (A= Mn, Fe, Co)
Authors: Yaxin Gao, Sha Li, Menghao Wu
Abstract: Transition metal molybdenum oxides A2Mo3O8 (A= Mn, Fe, Co) are known to be polar magnets where A ions are located in either octahedrally or tetrahedrally coordinated sites. In this paper we predict that their polarizations can be reversed via swapping of two coordinations for A ions, giving rise to robust vertical ferroelectricity. Such unique ferroelectricity via coordination swapping can be used to control the Neel vector in altermagnetic Fe2Mo3O8, while the large non-relativistic spin-splittings can be also altered by ferroelectric switching in Luttinger compensated magnetic Mn2Mo3O8, both in the absence of net magnetization. However, their ultra-thin layers may possess net magnetizations that can be reversed upon ferroelectric switching. Our findings provide a new type of multiferroicity as well as a new avenue in control of antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Emergent B2 chemical orderings in the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys studied via first-principles theory and atomistic modelling
Authors: Christopher D. Woodgate, Hubert J. Naguszewski, David Redka, Ján Minár, David Quigley, Julie B. Staunton
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys using a combination of \textit{ab initio} electronic structure theory -- namely a concentration wave analysis -- and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. Our multiscale approach is suitable both for examining atomic short-range order in the solid solution, as well as for studying the emergence of long-range crystallographic order with decreasing temperature. In both alloys considered in this work, in alignment with experimental observations, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging at high temperatures, which is driven primarily by Al and Ti, with other elements expressing weaker site preferences. The predicted B2 ordering temperature for AlTiVNb is higher than that for AlTiCrMo. These chemical orderings are discussed in terms of the alloys' electronic structure, with hybridisation between the $sp$ states of Al and the $d$ states of the transition metals understood to play an important role. Within our modelling, the chemically ordered B2 phases for both alloys have an increased predicted residual resistivity compared to the A2 (disordered bcc) phases. These increased resistivity values are understood to originate in a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, in conjunction with qualitative changes to the alloys' smeared-out Fermi surfaces. These results highlight the close connections between composition, structure, and physical properties in this technologically relevant class of materials.

Title: General rules for obtaining Hopf term by coupling Dirac cones to spin fields
Authors: Yan-Guang Yue, Shuai Yang, Zheng-Xin Liu, Yan Chen
Abstract: It is known that the topological Hopf term in two-dimensional (2D) spin systems can be derived by coupling to massless Dirac fermions. In an earlier work, we realized the Hopf term in a four-band lattice model. The key difficulty is avoiding canclation of the topological term contributed from different cones. In the present work, we provide general rules for obtaining nonzero Hopf term in spin systems when coupling to Dirac fermions. This method allows to direct dectation of the coefficient of the Hopf term without detailed calculations from path integral. We apply this framework to several models and verify that our results are self-consistent. Especially, we design a simple two-cone model on the checkerboard lattice and demonstrate how it realizes the Hopf term according to the above rules.

Title: UV$_6$Sn$_6$: a new kagome material with unusual $5f$ magnetism

Abstract: Materials in the family $R$V$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ ($R=$ rare earth) provide a unique platform to investigate the interplay between local moments from $R$ layers and nonmagnetic vanadium kagome layers. Yet, the investigation of actinide members remains scarce. Here we report the synthesis of UV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ single crystals through the self-flux technique. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, electrical resistivity, and thermal expansion measurements reveal two uranium-driven antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{N1}=29$~K and $T_{N2}=24$~K, a complex field-temperature phase diagram, and unusual negative domain wall magnetoresistance. Specific heat measurements unveil a modest Sommerfeld coefficient of $\gamma = 40$~mJ/mol.K$^{2}$, consistent with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements that show a moderate $f$-electron enhancement at the Fermi level ($E_{F}$). Our experiments support a modest contribution from \textit{5f} flat bands to the density of states at $E_{F}$, whereas our band structure calculations place the vanadium flat bands 0.25~eV above $E_{F}$. Our findings point to a materials opportunity to expand the uranium 166 family with the goal of enhancing correlations by tuning $5f$ and $3d$ flat bands to $E_{F}$.

Title: Boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models
Authors: Huan Jiang, Shao-Kai Jian
Abstract: We study the boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) models. Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use mean-field theory to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.

Title: Coherent microwave comb generation via the Josephson effect
Authors: Angelo Greco, Xavier Ballu, Francesco Giazotto, Alessandro Crippa
Abstract: Frequency combs represent exceptionally precise measurement tools due to the coherence of their spectral lines. While optical frequency comb sources constitute a well-established technology, superconducting circuits provide a relatively unexplored on-chip platform for low-dissipation comb emitters able to span from gigahertz to terahertz frequencies. We demonstrate coherent microwave frequency comb generation by leveraging the ac Josephson effect in a superconducting quantum interference device. A time-dependent magnetic drive periodically generates voltage pulses, which in the frequency domain correspond to a comb with dozens of spectral modes. The micrometer-scale footprint and minimal dissipation inherent to superconducting systems foster the integration of our comb generator with advanced cryogenic electronics. Transferring optical techniques to the solid-state domain may enable new applications in quantum technologies.

Title: Wettability and sp2/sp3 ratio effects on supercapacitor performance of N-doped hydrogenated amorphous Carbon Nanofoam
Authors: Subrata Ghosh, Giacomo Pagani, Andrea Macrelli, Alberto Calloni, Gianlorenzo Bussetti, Andrea Lucotti, Matteo Tommasini, Raffaella Suriano, Valeria Russo, Agnieszka M. Jastrzkebska, Cinzia Casiraghi, Andrea Li Bassi, Carlo S. Casari
Abstract: Pulsed laser-deposited amorphous carbon nanofoams could be a potential candidate for electrochemical energy storage applications due to their properties such as ultralightweight, huge volumetric void fractions, and co-existence of sp, sp2 and sp3 carbon hybridization. It is known that the charge-storage of carbon nanostructures containing disordered sp2-domains is determined by the wettability, surface area, and porosity of carbon nanostructures. However, their charge-storage performance is limited to the areal capacitance of the order of a few mF/cm2. We enhanced the supercapacitor performance of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon nanofoam by engineering its wettability and sp2-C/sp3-C ratio by vacuum annealing. The specific capacitance was enhanced around fifty times and the widened voltage of the device increased from 0.8 to 1.1 V compared to as-grown nanofoam. In addition, we examined for the first time the initial increase in specific capacitance of the aqueous symmetric supercapacitor with respect to the scan rate, employing in-situ measurements coupling Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. We attribute this effect, although observed in previous literatures but unexplained, to the electrochemical activation induced by structural changes during the charge storage performance. This optimization of pulsed laser-deposited carbon nanofoam may open an avenue for fabricating lightweight and porous nanostructures for advanced macro-to-micro-supercapacitor devices.

Title: Fragility and thermal expansion control crystal melting and the glass transition
Authors: Alessio Zaccone, Konrad Samwer
Abstract: Analytical relations for the glass transition temperature, $T_g$, and the crystal melting temperature, $T_m$, are developed on the basis of nonaffine lattice dynamics. The proposed relations explain: (i) the seemingly universal factor of $\approx 2/3$ difference between glass transition temperature and melting temperature of the corresponding crystal, and (ii) the recent empirical discovery that both $T_g$ and $T_m$ are proportional to the liquid fragility $m$ divided by the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$ of the solid.

Title: Slow Oscillations of the Transverse Magnetoresistance in HoTe3
Authors: C. V. Zaitsev-Zotov, P. D. Grigoriev, D. Voropaev, A. A. Morocho, I. A. Kon, E. Pachoud, A. Hadj-Azzem, P. Monceau
Abstract: Slow oscillations of the magnetoresistance periodic in the inverse magnetic field with a frequency of 3.4 T have been identified in HoTe3. The temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude is close to exponential even at low temperatures. This may be attributed to the existence of soft modes in the system and allows the estimation of the electron scattering rate on these modes. In the region of magnetic fields exceeding 1 T, the oscillations can be described as interference oscillations associated with the splitting of the band structure due to the bilayer structure of HoTe3. The obtained data have allowed us to calculate the ratio tb/tz of the hopping integrals between layers within each bilayer (tb) and between the adjacent bilayers (tz) to estimate these integrals as tb ~ 2 meV and tz ~ 0.26 meV.

Title: From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings
Authors: Catalin-Mihai Halati, Ameneh Sheikhan, Giovanna Morigi, Corinna Kollath, Simon B. Jäger
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.

Title: 3D morphology formation in a mixture of three differently averse components
Authors: Emilio N.M. Cirillo, Nicklas Jävergård, Rainey Lyons, A. Muntean, S.A. Muntean
Abstract: Film formation from solvent evaporation in polymer ternary solutions is relevant for several technological applications, such as the fabrication of organic solar cells. The performance of the final device will strongly depend on the internal morphology of the obtained film, which, in turn, is affected by the processing conditions. We are interested in modeling morphology formation in 3D for ternary mixtures using both a lattice model and its continuous counterpart in the absence of evaporation. In our previous works, we found that, in 2D, both models predict the existence of two distinct regimes: (i) a low-solvent regime, characterized by two interpenetrated domains of the two polymers, and (ii) a high-solvent regime, where isolated polymer domains are dispersed in the solvent background. In the significantly more intriguing 3D case, we observe a comparable scenario both for the discrete and the continuous model. The lattice model reveals its ability to describe morphology formation even in the high solvent content 3D case, in which the three-dimensional nature of space could have prevented cluster formation.

Title: Enhanced anomalous Hall effect in the topological Kagome metal Cs(V$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Xinmin Wang, Peipei Wang, Jian Lyu, Zhuang Xu, Mingquan He, Yu Feng, Wei Luo, Liyuan Zhang, Junying Shen, Xin Tong
Abstract: As a fundamental physical phenomenon, achieving and controlling a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is crucial for advancing the understanding of topological physics and for developing applied technologies in spintronics. The recently discovered topological Kagome metal $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A =$ K, Rb, Cs)exhibits a significant AHE along with charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity, providing an ideal platform to study the interactions between nontrivial band topology, CDW, and superconductivity. In this study, we systematically investigated the evolution of CDW, superconductivity, and AHE in electron (Mn)-doped Cs(V$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$ single crystals. The experimental results show that electron doping rapidly suppresses superconductivity, while the CDW order remains relatively robust. Meanwhile, a significantly enhanced AHE, with a maximum anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of ~25331 \Ohm ^{-1}\cm^{-1} and an anomalous Hall angle of 6.66% occurs at a relatively low doping level of $x = 0.03$. Based on the Tian-Ye-Jin (TYJ) scaling model, such a significant enhancement AHC is mainly dominated by the skew scattering. We speculated enhanced skew scattering between electrons and Mn originating from the strengthened spin-orbital coupling. Our finding provides important guidance for the design and development of transverse transport properties in topological Kagome materials.

Title: Long-range Entanglement and Role of Realistic Interaction in Braiding of Non-Abelian Quasiholes in Fractional Quantum Hall Phases
Authors: Ha Quang Trung, Qianhui Xu, Bo Yang
Abstract: Parity conservation dictates that when fusing pairs of Moore-Read (MR) quasiholes, such that each pair of charge-$e/4$ anyon forms a charge-$e/2$ anyon, the parity of the numbers of $1$-anyon and $\psi$-anyon must be conserved within a given system. This idea is illustrated here using the Jack polynomial formalism, which also provides a basis to numerically study the dynamics of MR anyons. In particular, we examine the effect of two-body electron-electron interaction on the degeneracy of two anyon fusion channels, which affects their mutual statistics of the MR anyons. We find that parity conservation gives rise to a long-range ``entanglement" which affect the experimental measurement of exchange statistics under realistic electron interaction. It is therefore important to account for all quasiholes in an experimental systems in order to accurately predict the outcome of a certain measurement. We also show how understanding the quasihole dynamics can help to fine-tune two-body interactions in order to stabilize any given fusion channel in experiments.

Title: Neuromorphic Computing with Microfluidic Memristors
Authors: Nico C. X. Stuhlmüller, René van Roij, Marjolein Dijkstra
Abstract: Conical microfluidic channels filled with electrolytes exhibit volatile memristive behavior, offering a promising foundation for energy-efficient, neuromorphic computing. Here, we integrate these iontronic channels as additional nonlinear element in nonlinear Shinriki-inspired oscillators and demonstrate that they exhibit alternating chaotic and non-chaotic dynamics across a broad frequency range. Exploiting this behavior, we construct XOR and NAND gates by coupling three "Memriki" oscillators, and we further realize the full set of standard logic gates through combinations of NAND gates. Our results establish a new paradigm for iontronic computing and open avenues for scalable, low-power logical operations in microfluidic and bio-inspired systems.

Title: Assessment of spectral phases of non-Hermitian quantum systems through complex and singular values
Authors: Mahaveer Prasad, S. Harshini Tekur, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla, Manas Kulkarni
Abstract: Chaotic behavior or lack thereof in non-Hermitian systems is often diagnosed via spectral analysis of associated complex eigenvalues. Very recently, singular values of the associated non-Hermitian systems have been proposed as an effective measure to study dissipative quantum chaos. Motivated by the rich properties of non-Hermitian power-law banded random matrices and its promise as a platform to study localized and delocalized phases in non-Hermitian systems, we make an in-depth study to assess different spectral phases of these matrices through the lens of both complex eigenvalues and singular values. Remarkably, the results from complex spectra and singular value analysis are seemingly different, thereby necessitating caution while identifying different phases. We also exemplify our findings by studying a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with a complex on-site disorder. Our work indicates that systems, where disorder is present both in the Hermitian and non-Hermitian segments of a Hamiltonian, are sensitive to the specific diagnostic tool that needs to be employed to study quantum chaos.

Title: Quantum crystal spin Hall effect in two-dimensional altermagnetic systems
Authors: Pan-jun Feng, Chao-Yang Tan, Miao Gao, Xun-Wang Yan, Zheng-Xin Liu, Peng-Jie Guo, Fengjie Ma, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: In the field of condensed matter physics, time-reversal symmetry provides the foundation for a number of interesting quantum phenomena, in particular the topological materials and the quantum spin Hall physics that have been extensively studied in recent years. Here, based on the first-principles electronic-structure calculations, symmetry analysis, and model simulations, we demonstrate that time-reversal symmetry is not fundamentally necessary for the quantum spin Hall effect. In altermagnetic materials, as an alternative, it can also be protected by crystal symmetry, which can be referred to as the quantum crystal spin Hall effect.

Title: Wannier-Function-Based Approach to Coupled Exciton-Phonon-Photon Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Semiconductors
Authors: Alexander Steinhoff, Frank Jahnke, Matthias Florian
Abstract: Marrying the predictive power of ab initio calculations with many-body effects remains a challenging task in two-dimensional (2d) materials, where efficient carrier-carrier interaction challenges established approximation schemes. In particular, understanding exciton-phonon interaction from first principles is a field of growing interest. Here, we present a many-body theory for coupled free-carrier, exciton, phonon and photon dynamics based on carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon interaction matrix elements obtained via projection on Wannier orbitals. The framework is applied to study the impact of carrier-phonon correlations on optical spectra and coupled nonequilibrium carrier-phonon kinetics in monolayer MoSe$_2$. We find that non-Markovian effects and dynamical buildup of quasi-particles are only properly described if correlations at least on the two-phonon level are included. Our studies open a perspective to advance the material-realistic description of nonequilibrium physics in 2d nanostructures to new many-body realms.

Title: Engineering Moiré Kagome Superlattices in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Adrian Fedorko, Chao-Xing Liu, Zhen Bi
Abstract: We propose a scheme to achieve breathing kagome moiré superlattices using three twisted layers of transition metal dichalcogenides. In this scheme, the top and bottom layers are twisted relative to the middle layer by small angles $\theta$ and 2$\theta$ respectively, generating a kagome-like moiré potential for the middle layer with suitable parameters. The moiré band structures of these systems are calculated within the continuum model and show good resemblance to the breathing kagome band structure, including the flat band, Dirac points with tunable gap, and van Hove singularities. This system serves as a new venue to explore strongly correlated physics on kagome lattices which offers more flexibility and tunability in band structure, charge density, and interaction strength.

Abstract: Advancements in fabrication methods have shaped new computing device technologies. Among these methods, depositing electrical contacts to the channel material is fundamental to device characterization. Novel layered and two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising for next-generation computing electronic channel materials. Direct-write printing of conductive inks is introduced as a surprisingly effective, significantly faster, and cleaner method to contact different classes of layered materials, including graphene (semi-metal), MoS2 (semiconductor), Bi-2212 (superconductor), and Fe5GeTe2 (metallic ferromagnet). Based on the electrical response, the quality of the printed contacts is comparable to what is achievable with resist-based lithography techniques. These devices are tested by sweeping gate voltage, temperature, and magnetic field to show that the materials remain pristine post-processing. This work demonstrates that direct-write printing is an agile method for prototyping and characterizing the electrical properties of novel layered materials.

Title: Near-Term Fermionic Simulation with Subspace Noise Tailored Quantum Error Mitigation
Authors: Miha Papič, Manuel G. Algaba, Emiliano Godinez-Ramirez, Inés de Vega, Adrian Auer, Fedor Šimkovic IV, Alessio Calzona
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) has emerged as a powerful tool for the extraction of useful quantum information from quantum devices. Here, we introduce the Subspace Noise Tailoring (SNT) algorithm, which efficiently combines the cheap cost of Symmetry Verification (SV) and low bias of Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) QEM techniques. We study the performance of our method by simulating the Trotterized time evolution of the spin-1/2 Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) using a variety of local fermion-to-qubit encodings, which define a computational subspace through a set of stabilizers, the measurement of which can be used to post-select noisy quantum data. We study different combinations of QEM and encodings and uncover a rich phase diagram of optimal combinations, depending on the hardware performance, system size and available shot budget. We then demonstrate how SNT extends the reach of current noisy quantum computers in terms of the number of fermionic lattice sites and the number of Trotter steps, and quantify the required hardware performance beyond which a noisy device may outperform classical computational methods.

Title: Nonequilibrium Universality of a Squeezing Phase Transition
Authors: Arman Duha, S. E. Begg, Thomas Bilitewski
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of power-law interacting spin-1/2 bilayer XXZ models, which have recently been shown to allow generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezing. We find a transition between a phase characterized by Heisenberg limited squeezing and a partially collective phase. We identify universal scaling of the squeezing dynamics in terms of system parameters and a divergent time-scale, establishing these as distinct dynamical phases. Our work demonstrates a novel dynamical phase transition with potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation in cold-atomic, molecular or Rydberg platforms.

Title: Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal
Authors: Samuel D. Tomlinson, Aliki M. Tsopelakou, Tzia M. Onn, Steven R. H. Barrett, Adam M. Boies, Shaun D. Fitzgerald
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.

Title: Topological edge states of continuous Hamiltonians
Authors: Matthew Frazier, Guillaume Bal
Abstract: This paper concerns the topological classification of continuous Hamiltonians that find applications in biased cold plasmas and photonics. Besides a magnetic bias, the Hamiltonians are parametrized by a plasma frequency and a fixed vertical wavenumber. Eight distinct phases of matter are identified as these parameters vary. When insulating gaps are shared by two such phases, asymmetric edge modes propagate along interfaces separating the two phases. Here we apply the notion of a bulk difference invariant (BDI) to this Hamiltonian, and show by numerical diagonalizations of interface Hamiltonians that after an appropriate regularization our BDI correctly predicts edge transport as described by a bulk edge correspondence. We also derive theoretical tools to compute the BDI and show the limitations of the bulk edge correspondence (BEC) when the phase transition is too singular.

Title: Benchmarking semi-empirical quantum chemical methods on liquid water
Authors: Xin Wu, Hossam Elgabarty, Vahideh Alizadeh, Andres Henao, Frederik Zysk, Christian Plessl, Sebastian Ehlert, Jürg Hutter, Thomas D. Kühne
Abstract: Stimulated by the renewed interest and recent developments in semi-empirical quantum chemical (SQC) methods for noncovalent interactions, we examine the properties of liquid water at ambient conditions by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, both with the conventional NDDO-type (neglect of diatomic differential overlap) methods, e.g. AM1 and PM6, and with DFTB-type (density-functional tight-binding) methods, e.g. DFTB2 and GFN-xTB. Besides the original parameter sets, some specifically reparametrized SQC methods (denoted as AM1-W, PM6-fm, and DFTB2-iBi) targeting various smaller water systems ranging from molecular clusters to bulk are considered as well. The quality of these different SQC methods for describing liquid water properties at ambient conditions are assessed by comparison to well-established experimental data and also to BLYP-D3 density functional theory-based ab initio MD simulations. Our analyses reveal that static and dynamics properties of bulk water are poorly described by all considered SQC methods with the original parameters, regardless of the underlying theoretical models, with most of the methods suffering from too weak hydrogen bonds and hence predicting a far too fluid water with highly distorted hydrogen bond kinetics. On the other hand, the reparametrized force-matchcd PM6-fm method is shown to be able to quantitatively reproduce the static and dynamic features of liquid water, and thus can be used as a computationally efficient alternative to electronic structure-based MD simulations for liquid water that requires extended length and time scales. DFTB2-iBi predicts a slightly overstructured water with reduced fluidity, whereas AM1-W gives an amorphous ice-like structure for water at ambient conditions.

Title: Creating high-dimensional topological physics using a single ring resonator
Authors: Dali Cheng, Heming Wang, Charles Roques-Carmes, Janet Zhong, Shanhui Fan
Abstract: In spaces of three or more dimensions, there exists topological physics of significant richness that has no lower-dimensional counterparts. To experimentally explore high-dimensional physics, it is advantageous to augment the physical space with synthetic dimensions. An emerging approach is to use a single modulated photonic ring resonator to form multiple synthetic frequency dimensions. However, all the high-dimensional Hamiltonians experimentally demonstrated in this approach are topologically trivial. Here we propose a general scheme to create high-dimensional topological physics using multiple synthetic frequency dimensions in a single ring resonator. This scheme utilizes specifically designed mode-selective modulations and mode conversions to create non-trivial topology. As examples, we numerically demonstrate a three-dimensional, two-band model exhibiting Weyl points and topological insulator phases, and a five-dimensional, four-band model exhibiting Yang monopoles and Weyl surfaces. Our results will facilitate the experimental studies and future applications of topological physics in high dimensions.

Title: Nonlinearity-driven Topology via Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Alessandro Coppo, Alexandre Le Boité, Simone Felicetti, Valentina Brosco
Abstract: Topology and nonlinearity are deeply connected. However, whether topological effects can arise solely from the structure of nonlinear interaction terms, and the nature of the resulting topological phases, remain to large extent open questions. Here we consider a chain of parametrically-driven quantum resonators coupled only via weak nearest-neighbour cross-Kerr interaction, without any quadratic tunneling term. We show that, when the drive overcomes a critical threshold value, the system undergoes a transition from the atomic limit of decoupled oscillators to a symmetry-broken topological phase. The topology is dictated by the structure of the Kerr nonlinearity, yielding a non-trivial bulk-boundary correspondence. In the topological phase, we find different effective models for periodic and open boundary conditions and derive analytical approximations for the low-energy spectrum, identifying the conditions to observe topological edge modes.

Title: Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra
Authors: Iren Simko, Norah M. Hoffmann
Abstract: Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is inherently quantum or classical is essential for developing accurate models and optimizing experimental designs. We investigate this question in the context of polaritonic rotational-vibrational spectra and report a new feature, the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the usual primary resonant polariton splitting that arises from light-matter entanglement. Through ab-initio calculations of HCl molecules and a corresponding model system coupled to a cavity, we demonstrate that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule case and follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary resonant polariton splitting. This finding reveals a novel mechanism to tune a quantum feature using a classical one, offering new insights into the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.

Title: Dynamics of Superfluid-Superconducting Magnetars: Magnetic Field Evolution and Gravitational Waves
Authors: Sanjay Shukla, Rahul Pandit
Abstract: Magnetars, highly magnetized neutron stars, host superconducting and superfluid phases. We develop a minimal model that captures the interplay between neutron superfluidity, proton superconductivity, and electromagnetic fields using the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson, Ginzburg-Landau, and Maxwell equations. Our numerical simulations show that strong rotation enhances the net magnetic field inside the magnetar, suppresses superconductivity there, and amplifies the field near the surface. We explain this by a theory that makes testable predictions, including gravitational-wave signatures.

Title: Automatic Characterization of Fluxonium Superconducting Qubits Parameters with Deep Transfer Learning
Authors: Huan-Hsuan Kung, Chen-Yu Liu, Qian-Rui Lee, Chiang-Yuan Hu, Yu-Chi Chang, Ching-Yeh Chen, Daw-Wei Wang, Yen-Hsiang Lin
Abstract: Accurate determination of qubit parameters is critical for the successful implementation of quantum information and computation applications. In solid state systems, the parameters of individual qubits vary across the entire system, requiring time consuming measurements and manual fitting processes for characterization. Recent developed superconducting qubits, such as fluxonium or 0-pi qubits, offer improved fidelity operations but exhibit a more complex physical and spectral structure, complicating parameter extraction. In this work, we propose a machine learning (ML)based methodology for the automatic and accurate characterization of fluxonium qubit parameters. Our approach utilized the energy spectrum calculated by a model Hamiltonian with various magnetic fields, as training data for the ML model. The output consists of the essential fluxonium qubit energy parameters, EJ, EC, and EL in Hamiltonian. The ML model achieves remarkable accuracy (with an average accuracy 95.6%) as an initial guess, enabling the development of an automatic fitting procedure for direct application to realistic experimental data. Moreover, we demonstrate that similar accuracy can be retrieved even when the input experimental spectrum is noisy or incomplete, highlighting the model robustness. These results suggest that our automated characterization method, based on a transfer learning approach, provides a reliable framework for future extensions to other superconducting qubits or different solid-state systems. Ultimately, we believe this methodology paves the way for the construction of large-scale quantum processors.

Title: Indistinguishable Single Photons from Nanowire Quantum Dots in the Telecom O-Band
Authors: Mohammed K. Alqedra, Chiao-Tzu Huang, Wen-Hao Chang, Sofiane Haffouz, Philip J. Poole, Dan Dalacu, Ali W. Elshaari, Val Zwiller
Abstract: On-demand single-photon sources operating at telecom wavelengths are crucial for quantum communication and photonic quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate high-purity, indistinguishable single-photon generation in the telecom O-band from an InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dot. We measured a single-photon purity of $g^2(0)=0.006(3)$ under aboveband excitation. Furthermore, we characterize two-photon interference via Hong-Ou-Mandel measurements and achieve a photon indistinguishability of $94.6\,\%$ with a temporal postselection of 100 ps time window and $5.58\,\%$ without temporal postselection. We measure a first-lens source efficiency of $\sim28\,\%$. These results highlight the potential of nanowire quantum dots as a promising source of telecom single photons for photonic quantum applications, offering deterministic positioning, efficient photon extraction, and scalable production.

Title: Floquet Engineering Clock Transitions in Magnetic Molecules
Authors: Andrew Cupo, Shuanglong Liu, Silas Hoffman, X.-G. Zhang, Hai-Ping Cheng
Abstract: We theoretically study Floquet engineering of magnetic molecules via a time-periodic magnetic field that couples to the emergent total spin of the metal center. By focusing on an $S = 1$ electronic spin Hamiltonian containing the zero-field and Zeeman terms, we demonstrate significant continuous tunability of the low-lying energy levels. Remarkably, under the action of linearly polarized Floquet controls, all three energy levels retain their stability against variations in an external static magnetic field so that any pair of renormalized energy levels forms a clock transition qubit. This property is closely linked to having a net-zero total Zeeman shift, which results from both static and effective dynamical contributions. Further physical insights are obtained from an effective Hamiltonian, derived analytically from second order van Vleck degenerate perturbation theory. Based on our theoretical predictions, experimentalists will be able to dynamically tune qubit energy gaps to values that are useful in their specific laboratory settings, while retaining the spin decoherence suppressing effect of maintaining a clock transition.

Title: Unified evolutionary optimization for high-fidelity spin qubit operations

Abstract: Developing optimal strategies to calibrate quantum processors for high-fidelity operation is one of the outstanding challenges in quantum computing today. Here, we demonstrate multiple examples of high-fidelity operations achieved using a unified global optimization-driven automated calibration routine on a six dot semiconductor quantum processor. Within the same algorithmic framework we optimize readout, shuttling and single-qubit quantum gates by tailoring task-specific cost functions and tuning parameters based on the underlying physics of each operation. Our approach reaches systematically $99\%$ readout fidelity, $>99\%$ shuttling fidelity over an effective distance of 10$\mu$m, and $>99.5\%$ single-qubit gate fidelity on timescales similar or shorter compared to those of expert human operators. The flexibility of our gradient-free closed loop algorithmic procedure allows for seamless application across diverse qubit functionalities while providing a systematic framework to tune-up semiconductor quantum devices and enabling interpretability of the identified optimal operation points.

Title: Leveraging Vision Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs for Automated Data Extraction from Plots
Authors: Maciej P. Polak, Dane Morgan
Abstract: Automated data extraction from research texts has been steadily improving, with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) accelerating progress even further. Extracting data from plots in research papers, however, has been such a complex task that it has predominantly been confined to manual data extraction. We show that current multimodal large language models, with proper instructions and engineered workflows, are capable of accurately extracting data from plots. This capability is inherent to the pretrained models and can be achieved with a chain-of-thought sequence of zero-shot engineered prompts we call PlotExtract, without the need to fine-tune. We demonstrate PlotExtract here and assess its performance on synthetic and published plots. We consider only plots with two axes in this analysis. For plots identified as extractable, PlotExtract finds points with over 90% precision (and around 90% recall) and errors in x and y position of around 5% or lower. These results prove that multimodal LLMs are a viable path for high-throughput data extraction for plots and in many circumstances can replace the current manual methods of data extraction.

Title: On-demand manipulation of superbunching emission from colloidal quantum dots and its application in noise-resistance correlated biphoton imaging
Authors: Yunrui Song, Chengbing Qin, Yuanyuan Li, Xiangdong Li, Xuedong Zhang, Aoni Wei, Zhichun Yang, Xinghui Liu, Jianyong Hu, Ruiyun Chen, Guofeng Zhang, Liantuan Xiao, Suotang Jia
Abstract: Superbunching effect with second-order correlations larger than 2, $g^{(2)}(0)>2$, indicating the N-photon bundles emission and strong correlation among photons, has a broad range of fascinating applications in quantum illumination, communication, and computation. However, the on-demand manipulation of the superbunching effect in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) under pulsed excitation, which is beneficial to integrated photonics and lab-on-a-chip quantum devices, is still challenging. Here, we disclosed the evolution of $g^{(2)}(0)$ with the parameters of colloidal QDs by Mento Carlo simulations and performed second-order correlation measurements on CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs under both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed lasers. The photon statistics of a single colloidal QD have been substantially tailored from sub-Poissonian distribution $g^{(2)}(0) <1$) to superbunching emission, with the maximum $g^{(2)}(0)$ reaching 69 and 20 under CW and pulsed excitation, respectively. We have achieved correlated biphoton imaging (CPI), employing the coincidence of the biexciton and bright exciton in one laser pulse, with the stray light and background noise up to 53 times stronger than PL emission of single colloidal QDs. By modulating the PL intensity, the Fourier-domain CPI with reasonably good contrast has been determined, with the stray light noise up to 107 times stronger than PL emission and 75600 times stronger than the counts of biphotons. Our noise-resistance CPI may enable laboratory-based quantum imaging to be applied to real-world applications with the highly desired suppression of strong background noise and stray light.

Title: Distribution of ${}^{7}$Li Implants in Nb Films for a Sterile Neutrino Search

Abstract: The BeEST experiment is measuring the ${}^{7}$Li recoil spectrum from the decay of ${}^{7}$Be implanted into Ta-based sensors to provide the most stringent limits on the existence of sterile neutrinos in the sub-MeV mass range. Its sensitivity is limited by spectral broadening due to interactions between the atomic shell of the ${}^{7}$Be/${}^{7}$Li and the Ta sensor film. This study is investigating the suitability of Nb as an alternative sensor material by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) of ${}^{7}$Li-implanted Nb films. STEM does not detect any change in the microstructure of polycrystalline Nb due to ${}^{7}$Li implantation. APT reveals some segregation of ${}^{7}$Li at grain boundaries in Nb. While this may slightly alter the ${}^{7}$Li binding energies, the effect on the recoil spectrum is not expected to be strong enough to preclude using Nb-based detectors in future phases of the BeEST experiment.

Title: qReduMIS: A Quantum-Informed Reduction Algorithm for the Maximum Independent Set Problem
Authors: Martin J. A. Schuetz, Romina Yalovetzky, Ruben S. Andrist, Grant Salton, Yue Sun, Rudy Raymond, Shouvanik Chakrabarti, Atithi Acharya, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia, Helmut G. Katzgraber
Abstract: We propose and implement a quantum-informed reduction algorithm for the maximum independent set problem that integrates classical kernelization techniques with information extracted from quantum devices. Our larger framework consists of dedicated application, algorithm, and hardware layers, and easily generalizes to the maximum weight independent set problem. In this hybrid quantum-classical framework, which we call qReduMIS, the quantum computer is used as a co-processor to inform classical reduction logic about frozen vertices that are likely (or unlikely) to be in large independent sets, thereby opening up the reduction space after removal of targeted subgraphs. We systematically assess the performance of qReduMIS based on experiments with up to 231 qubits run on Rydberg quantum hardware available through Amazon Braket. Our experiments show that qReduMIS can help address fundamental performance limitations faced by a broad set of (quantum) solvers including Rydberg quantum devices. We outline implementations of qReduMIS with alternative platforms, such as superconducting qubits or trapped ions, and we discuss potential future extensions.

Title: Standardized test of many-body coherence in gate-based quantum platforms
Authors: Yi Teng, Orazio Scarlatella, Shiyu Zhou, Armin Rahmani, Claudio Chamon, Claudio Castelnovo
Abstract: Quantum coherence is a crucial resource in achieving quantum advantage over classical information processing, and more generally developing new quantum technologies. While its effects are observable in current quantum platforms, there are no standardized tools for systematically measuring and quantifying multi-qubit coherence across different gate-based quantum hardware. In this work, we propose a method to define a many-body quantum coherence length scale using anyon interference effects in a spin-chain setup, which effectively mirrors the problem of a quantum particle on a ring, with or without flux through it. We propose using the maximum length of the ring for which the presence or absence of flux can be clearly discerned, as a simple measure of the many-body quantum coherence grade (Q-grade) in a given quantum hardware. We demonstrate how this approach can be implemented on gate-based quantum platforms to estimate and compare the quantum coherence of current devices, such as those from Google, IBM, IonQ, IQM, and Quantinuum that we considered here. This work aims to contribute to the creation of a live Web interface where the latest developments and advancements can be demonstrated, and progress in quantum coherence resources tracked over time. Establishing such a standardized quantum test would enable monitoring the growth of quantum coherence in gate-based quantum platforms, in a spirit similar to Moore's law.

Title: Light-induced quantum friction of carbon nanotubes in water
Authors: Tanuja Kistwal, Krishan Kanhaiya, Adrian Buchmann, Chen Ma, Jana Nikolic, Julia Ackermann, Phillip Galonska, Sanjana S. Nalige, Martina Havenith, Marialore Sulpizi, Sebastian Kruss
Abstract: Quantum friction describes the transfer of energy and momentum from electronically excited states in a material to a surrounding solvent. Here, we show that near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit quantum friction in water. The diffusion constants of functionalized SWCNTs in aqueous solution decrease linearly by around 50 % with increasing excitation power. In contrast, SWCNTs with quantum defects that localize excitons show no power-dependent diffusion. Chemical manipulation of exciton concentration by molecules that increase or decrease SWCNT fluorescence also modulate the diffusion constant by a factor of up to 2. Additionally, excitons increase the macroscopic viscosity of SWCNT solutions. Optical pump Terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy reveals transient absorption features of water (37 /cm and above 80 /cm), indicating energy dissipation into translational modes of its hydrogen bond network. Molecular dynamics simulations further support a mechanism in which exciton-induced dipoles enhance frictional forces. These findings establish that excitons in SWCNTs induce quantum friction in water.

Title: Stable homotopy theory of invertible gapped quantum spin systems I: Kitaev's $Ω$-spectrum
Authors: Yosuke Kubota
Abstract: We provide a mathematical realization of a proposal by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--Lück assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.

Title: Higher-form anomaly and long-range entanglement of mixed states
Authors: Leonardo A. Lessa, Shengqi Sang, Tsung-Cheng Lu, Timothy H. Hsieh, Chong Wang
Abstract: In open quantum systems, we directly relate anomalies of higher-form symmetries to the long-range entanglement of any mixed state with such symmetries. First, we define equivalence classes of long-range entanglement in mixed states via stochastic local channels (SLCs), which effectively ``mod out'' any classical correlations and thus distinguish phases by differences in long-range quantum correlations only. It is then shown that strong symmetries of a mixed state and their anomalies (non-trivial braiding and self-statistics) are intrinsic features of the entire phase of matter. For that, a general procedure of symmetry pullback for strong symmetries is introduced, whereby symmetries of the output state of an SLC are dressed into symmetries of the input state, with their anomaly relation preserved. This allows us to prove that states in (2+1)-D with anomalous strong 1-form symmetries exhibit long-range bipartite entanglement, and to establish a lower bound for their topological entanglement of formation, a mixed-state generalization of topological entanglement entropy. For concreteness, we apply this formalism to the toric code under Pauli-X and Z dephasing noise, as well as under ZX decoherence, which gives rise to the recently discovered intrinsically mixed-state topological order. Finally, we conjecture a connection between higher-form anomalies and long-range multipartite entanglement for mixed states in higher dimensions.

Title: Scalable Robust Quantum Control for Semiconductor Spin Qubits with Always-on Couplings
Authors: Yong-Ju Hai, Shihang Zhang, Haoyu Guan, Peihao Huang, Yu He, Xiu-Hao Deng
Abstract: We demonstrate a robust quantum control framework that enables high-fidelity gate operations in semiconductor spin qubit systems with always-on couplings. Always-on interactions between qubits pose a fundamental challenge for quantum processors by inducing correlated errors that can trigger chaotic dynamics. Our approach suppresses both static coupling noise and time-dependent crosstalk without requiring high on/off ratio tunable couplers. Significantly, these pulses also prevent the emergence of chaotic entanglement growth in deep quantum circuits, preserving coherence in large multi-qubit systems. By relaxing hardware constraints on coupling control, our method provides a practical path toward scaling semiconductor quantum processors within existing fabrication capabilities, with particular relevance for silicon spin qubit architectures where high-contrast coupling modulation remains challenging.

Title: Reversing Hydrogen-Related Loss in $α$-Ta Thin Films for Quantum Device Fabrication

Abstract: $\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500°C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.

Title: Predicting the Stability of Geopolymer Activator Solutions for Optimised Synthesis through Thermodynamic Modelling
Authors: Ramon Skane, Philip A. Schneider, William D.A. Rickard, Franca Jones, Arie van Riessen, Evan Jamieson, Xiao Sun
Abstract: Geopolymers are an emerging class of binding materials used in sustainable cements, concretes, and composites. However, despite growing research, the lack of standardised processes and stability analyses for formulating activator solutions - a crucial component of geopolymer systems - remains a barrier to quality control and research advancement. This study presents an experimentally validated energy balance with thermodynamic phenomenon mathematically modelled for synthesising consistent geopolymer activator solutions. The model's general applicability enables dynamic assessments of user-specified systems, offering stability metrics for quality control in laboratory and industrial settings. Fundamentally, the mathematical model can be used towards batching optimisation under user-defined conditions where dissolution of geopolymer precursors can be maximised via solution preparation and batching optimisation. The model results quantify experimentally validated temperature dynamics, thermodynamic stability, and process design/batching optimisation, challenging traditional practices in the literature that rely on undefined equilibration periods. Key findings demonstrate that stable, ready-to-use activator solutions can be achieved in as little as 1 minute, compared to the typically used 24-hour batching periods. This research paves the way towards standardised activator solution preparation and supports the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for geopolymer synthesis, promoting consistency and scalability in geopolymer technology.

Title: Atom-Field-Medium Interactions II: Covariance Matrix Dynamics for $N$ Harmonic Atoms in a Dielectric-Altered Quantum Field and Effects of Dielectric on Atom-Field Entanglement
Authors: Jen-Tsung Hsiang, Bei-Lok Hu
Abstract: We continue our investigation of multi-partite open quantum systems comprising layers of structure using the atom-field-medium interactions as a familiarly important example. Same as in Paper I~\cite{HH24} we consider a system of $N$ harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of $N$ neutral atoms interacting with a scalar quantum field altered by the presence of a dielectric medium. Different from Paper I, which uses the graded influence action formalism, here, taking advantage of the Gaussian nature of our extended system's interactions, we use the quantum Langevin equation method to calculate the time evolution of the covariance matrix elements of the quantum correlation functions of the idfs of the $N$ system-atoms in a dielectric-altered quantum field. The covariance matrix is particularly useful for extracting quantum informational properties of a Gaussian system related to quantum correlations, such as quantum entanglement. As an illustration of the method we calculate the entanglement between one system atom and the ambient quantum field outside the dielectric half-space, measured by the purity function and the von Neumann entropy. We highlight one somewhat peculiar feature in our results and one important technical issue: The special feature refers to the non-monotonic behavior of the purity function when the atom is positioned very close to the dielectric surface. By deriving the Robertson-Schrödinger function and displaying a similar qualitative behavior under these conditions we attribute this novelty to a manifestation of the uncertainty relation. The technical issue refers to the order-reduction scheme to remove the third time derivative term in the Langevin equation for the idfs of the atom. We point out the inconsistencies in the traditional treatments and propose a new consistent scheme of order reduction for Gaussian open systems.

Title: High-entropy Advantage in Neural Networks' Generalizability
Authors: Entao Yang, Xiaotian Zhang, Yue Shang, Ge Zhang
Abstract: While the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics ignites a worldwide discussion on the origins of neural networks and their foundational links to physics, modern machine learning research predominantly focuses on computational and algorithmic advancements, overlooking a picture of physics. Here we introduce the concept of entropy into neural networks by reconceptualizing them as hypothetical physical systems where each parameter is a non-interacting 'particle' within a one-dimensional space. By employing a Wang-Landau algorithms, we construct the neural networks' (with up to 1 million parameters) entropy landscapes as functions of training loss and test accuracy (or loss) across four distinct machine learning tasks, including arithmetic question, real-world tabular data, image recognition, and language modeling. Our results reveal the existence of \textit{entropy advantage}, where the high-entropy states generally outperform the states reached via classical training optimizer like stochastic gradient descent. We also find this advantage is more pronounced in narrower networks, indicating a need of different training optimizers tailored to different sizes of neural networks.

Title: Crisis in time-dependent dynamical systems
Authors: Simona Olmi, Antonio Politi
Abstract: Many dynamical systems operate in a fluctuating environment. However, even in low-dimensional setups, transitions and bifurcations have not yet been fully understood. In this Letter we focus on crises, a sudden flooding of the phase space due to the crossing of the boundary of the basin of attraction. We find that crises occur also in non-autonomous systems although the underlying mechanism is more complex. We show that in the vicinity of the transition, the escape probability scales as $\exp[-\alpha (\ln \delta)^2]$, where $\delta$ is the distance from the critical point, while $\alpha$ is a model-dependent parameter. This prediction is tested and verified in a few different systems, including the Kuramoto model with inertia, where the crisis controls the loss of stability of a chimera state.

Title: Low-loss Nb on Si superconducting resonators from a dual-use spintronics deposition chamber and with acid-free post-processing

Abstract: Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used: with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (3 {\mu}m gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal.

Title: Realization of fermionic Laughlin state on a quantum processor
Authors: Lingnan Shen, Mao Lin, Cedric Yen-Yu Lin, Di Xiao, Ting Cao
Abstract: Strongly correlated topological phases of matter are central to modern condensed matter physics and quantum information technology but often challenging to probe and control in material systems. The experimental difficulty of accessing these phases has motivated the use of engineered quantum platforms for simulation and manipulation of exotic topological states. Among these, the Laughlin state stands as a cornerstone for topological matter, embodying fractionalization, anyonic excitations, and incompressibility. Although its bosonic analogs have been realized on programmable quantum simulators, a genuine fermionic Laughlin state has yet to be demonstrated on a quantum processor. Here, we realize the {\nu} = 1/3 fermionic Laughlin state on IonQ's Aria-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using an efficient and scalable Hamiltonian variational ansatz with 369 two-qubit gates on a 16-qubit circuit. Employing symmetry-verification error mitigation, we extract key observables that characterize the Laughlin state, including correlation hole and chiral edge modes, with strong agreement to exact diagonalization benchmarks. This work establishes a scalable quantum framework to simulate material-intrinsic topological orders and provides a starting point to explore its dynamics and excitations on digital quantum processors.

Title: Study of Magnetic Field Resilient High Impedance High-Kinetic Inductance Superconducting Resonators
Authors: Camille Roy, Simone Frasca, Pasquale Scarlino
Abstract: Superconducting resonators with high-kinetic inductance play a central role in hybrid quantum circuits, enabling strong coupling with quantum systems with small electric dipole moment and improved parametric amplification. However, optimizing these resonators simultaneously for high internal quality factors ($Q_i$) and resilience to strong magnetic fields remains challenging. In this study, we systematically compare superconducting resonators fabricated from niobium nitride (NbN) and granular aluminum (grAl) thin films, each having similar kinetic inductance values ($L_k \sim 100$ pH/sq). At zero magnetic field, resonators made from grAl exhibit higher $Q_i$ compared to their NbN counterparts. However, under applied magnetic fields, NbN resonators demonstrate significantly better resilience. Moreover, NbN resonators exhibit an unexpected increase in $Q_i$ at intermediate in-plane magnetic fields ($B_{\parallel} \sim 1$ T), which we attribute to an enhanced frequency detuning that reduce coupling to two-level system defects. In contrast, grAl resonators show a distinct critical field above which $Q_i$ rapidly decreases, strongly depending on resonator cross-section respect to the applied field direction. Characterization of the nonlinear properties at zero magnetic field reveals that the self-Kerr coefficient in grAl resonators is more than an order of magnitude higher than in NbN resonators, making grAl particularly attractive for applications requiring pronounced nonlinear interactions. Our findings illustrate a clear trade-off between the two materials: NbN offers superior magnetic-field resilience beneficial for hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics applications, while grAl is more advantageous in low-field regimes demanding high impedance and strong nonlinearity.

Title: Realizing a Symmetry Protected Topological Phase in a Superconducting Circuit
Authors: Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, Patrick Azaria, Ari Mizel
Abstract: We propose a superconducting quantum circuit whose low-energy degrees of freedom are described by the sine-Gordon (SG) quantum field theory. For suitably chosen parameters, the circuit hosts a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase protected by a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The ground state of the system is twofold degenerate and exhibits local spontaneous symmetry breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry close to the edges of the circuit, leading to spontaneous localized edge supercurrents. The ground states host Majorana zero modes (MZM) at the edges of the circuit. On top of each of the two ground states, the system exhibits localized bound states at both edges, which are topologically protected against small disorder in the bulk. The spectrum of these boundary excitations should be observable in a circuit-QED experiment with feasible parameter choices.

Title: Three-dimensional active turbulence in microswimmer suspensions: simulations and modelling
Authors: Antonio Gascó, Ignacio Pagonabarraga, Andrea Scagliarini
Abstract: Active turbulence is a paradigmatic and fascinating example of self-organized motion at large scales occurring in active matter. We employ massive hydrodynamic simulations of suspensions of resolved model microswimmers to tackle the phenomenon in semi-dilute conditions at a mesoscopic level. We measure the kinetic energy spectrum and we detect a $k^{-3}$ power law regime. The velocity distributions are of Lévy type, a distinct difference with inertial turbulence. Furthermore, we propose a reduced order dynamical deterministic model for active turbulence, inspired to shell models for classical turbulence, whose numerical and analytical study confirms the spectrum powerlaw observed in the simulations and reveals hints of a non-Gaussian, intermittent, physics of active turbulence. Direct numerical simulations and modelling also agree in pointing to a phenomenological picture whereby, in the absence of an energy cascade à la Richardson forbidden by the low Reynolds number regime, it is the coupling between fluid velocity gradients and bacterial orientation that gives rise to a multiscale dynamics.

Title: Classification of unitary operators by local generatability
Authors: Xu Liu, Adrian B. Culver, Fenner Harper, Rahul Roy
Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems can exhibit possibilities beyond what can be obtained in equilibrium. Both in Floquet systems and in the related problems of discrete-time quantum walks and quantum cellular automata, a basic distinction arises among unitary time evolution operators: while all physical operators are local, not all are locally generated (i.e., generated by some local Hamiltonian). In this paper, we define the notion of equivalence up to a locally generated unitary in all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes. We then classify noninteracting unitaries in all dimensions on this basis by showing that equivalence up to a locally generated unitary is identical to homotopy equivalence.

Title: Scaling in Kinetics of Supercooled Liquids
Authors: B. Zhang, D. M. Zhang, D. Y. Sun, X. G. Gong
Abstract: The present study introduces a renormalization based approach to investigate the relaxation dynamics within supercooled liquids. By applying a numerical scale transformation to potential energies along the temporal axis, we have established a novel framework that elucidates the underlying kinetics of supercooled liquids. Our findings indicate that the skewness of the potential energy distribution attains its maximum at a characteristic time scale, D, which exhibits a Curie like scaling relationship with temperature. This scaling relationship is characterized by an exponent, g, that experiences a discontinuous transition at a critical cooling rate, signifying a kinetic like phase this http URL further demonstrate that g maintains an approximate scaling relationship with the cooling rate, where the product of g and the logarithm of the cooling rate is approximately this http URL constant, however, varies depending on whether the cooling rate is above or below the critical value, effectively classifying supercooled liquids into two distinct categories: the glass transition as the destiny of supercooled liquid, GDL, and the crystallization as the destiny of supercooled liquid, CDL. Furthermore, we identify that Ts corresponds to the glass transition temperature for GDL and the crystallization temperature for CDL, respectively. We have successfully developed a theoretical model,which not only derives the Curie like power law but also provides profound insights into the physical implications of D, g and Ts. This research delineates the differences between GDL and CDL, and offers a fresh perspective for exploring the nature of glasses. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the mechanisms of glass formation.

Title: Emergent Chiral Metal near a Kondo Breakdown Quantum Phase Transition
Authors: Tom Drechsler, Matthias Vojta
Abstract: The destruction of the Kondo effect in a local-moment metal can lead to a topological non-Fermi-liquid phase, dubbed fractionalized Fermi liquid, with spinon-type excitations and an emergent gauge field. We demonstrate that, if the latter displays an internal $\pi$-flux structure, a chiral heavy-fermion metal emerges near the Kondo-breakdown transition. Utilizing a parton mean-field theory describing the transition between a conventional heavy Fermi liquid and a U(1) fractionalized Fermi liquid, we find a novel intermediate phase near the transition whose emergent flux pattern spontaneously breaks both translation and time-reversal symmetries. This phase is an orbital antiferromagnet, and we derive a Landau-type theory which shows that such a phase generically emerges from a $\pi$-flux spin liquid. We discuss the relevance to pertinent experiments.

Title: Electrical Injection and Transport of Coherent Magnons in Non-Collinear Antiferromagnets
Authors: Ping Tang, Gerrit E. W. Bauer
Abstract: Non-collinear antiferromagnets (nAFMs) with a small net magnetic moment offer new opportunities for ultrafast spintronic devices, owing to unique physical properties. While in ferromagnets and collinear AFMs the spin current polarization is locked to the magnetization $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$ and Néel vector $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ directions, we predict that magnon spin currents injected by metal contacts into nAFMs can be polarized with both $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$ components when carried by a coherent superposition of magnon eigenstates. The spin injection efficiency is governed by an interface spin conductance tensor that depends on the non-collinear magnetic texture. While the $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$-component diffuses freely into the nAFM, the $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$-component oscillates as a function of distance from the injector and applied magnetic field, analogous to the Hanle effect of electron spins in metals. Our findings reveal the potential of nAFMs as platforms for the study of tensorial coherent spin transport.

Title: A review of UTe$_2$ at high magnetic fields
Authors: Sylvia K. Lewin, Corey E. Frank, Sheng Ran, Johnpierre Paglione, Nicholas P. Butch
Abstract: Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) is recognized as a host material to unconventional spin-triplet superconductivity, but it also exhibits a wealth of additional unusual behavior at high magnetic fields. One of the most prominent signatures of the unconventional superconductivity is a large and anisotropic upper critical field that exceeds the paramagnetic limit. This superconductivity survives to 35 T and is bounded by a discontinuous magnetic transition, which itself is also field-direction-dependent. A different, reentrant superconducting phase emerges only on the high-field side of the magnetic transition, in a range of angles between the crystallographic $b$ and $c$ axes. This review discusses the current state of knowledge of these high-field phases, the high-field behavior of the heavy fermion normal state, and other phases that are stabilized by applied pressure.

Title: Exploring the Strongly-Interacting Regime of Effective Multi-Body Interactions in a Trapped Ultracold Atom System
Authors: Kantaro Honda, Yosuke Takasu, Yuki Haruna, Yusuke Nishida, Yoshiro Takahashi
Abstract: A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.

Title: Robust boundary Luttinger surfaces in topological band structures
Authors: Kai Chen, Pavan Hosur
Abstract: The standard paradigm of topological phases posits that two phases with identical symmetries are separated by a bulk phase transition, while symmetry breaking provides a path in parameter space that allows adiabatic connection between the phases. Typically, if symmetry is broken only at the boundary, topological surface states become gapped, and single-particle surface properties no longer distinguish between the two phases. In this work, we challenge this expectation. We demonstrate that the single-particle surface Green's function contains zeros, or "Luttinger surfaces," which maintain the same bulk-boundary correspondence as topological surface states. Remarkably, these Luttinger surfaces persist under symmetry-breaking perturbations that destroy the surface states. Moreover, we point out that low-energy and surface theories, often used synonymously in discussions of (gapped) topological matter, are actually different, with the difference captured by the Luttinger surfaces.

Title: Irreversibility as divergence from equilibrium
Authors: David Andrieux
Abstract: The entropy production is commonly interpreted as measuring the distance from equilibrium. However, this explanation lacks a rigorous description due to the absence of a natural equilibrium measure. The present analysis formalizes this interpretation by expressing the entropy production of a Markov system as a divergence with respect to particular equilibrium dynamics. These equilibrium dynamics correspond to the closest reversible systems in the information-theoretic sense. This result yields new lower bounds for the entropy production and novel links between thermodynamics and information geometry.

Title: Dynamics of Polar-Core Spin Vortices in Inhomogeneous Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Zachary L. Stevens-Hough, Matthew J. Davis, Lewis A. Williamson
Abstract: In the easy-plane phase, a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate is magnetized in a plane transverse to the applied Zeeman field. This phase supports polar-core spin vortices (PCVs), which consist of phase windings of transverse magnetization. Here we show that spin-changing collisions cause a PCV to accelerate down density gradients in an inhomogeneous condensate. The dynamics is well-described by a simplified model adapted from scalar systems, which predicts the dependence of the dynamics on trap tightness and quadratic Zeeman energy. In a harmonic trap, a PCV accelerates radially to the condensate boundary, in stark contrast to the azimuthal motion of vortices in a scalar condensate. In a trap that has a local potential maximum at the centre, the PCV exhibits oscillations around the trap centre, which persist for a remarkably long time. The oscillations coincide with the emission and reabsorption of axial spin waves, which reflect off the condensate boundary.

Title: Global anomalies of Green's function zeros
Authors: Lei Su, Ivar Martin
Abstract: Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies of nonlocal effective theories that supposedly describe symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy. We view the nonlocal effective theories including the simplest Lagrangian and its two-pole variant associated with a gapless Dirac zero as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomaly, we discuss the global anomaly, the bulk-boundary correspondence, and the constraint on possible phases, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory studied by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.

Title: Space-time first-order correlations of an open Bose-Hubbard model with incoherent pump and loss
Authors: Martina Zündel, Leonardo Mazza, Léonie Canet, Anna Minguzzi
Abstract: We investigate the correlation properties in the steady state of driven-dissipative interacting bosonic systems in the quantum regime, as for example non-linear photonic cavities. Specifically, we consider the Bose-Hubbard model on a periodic chain and with spatially homogeneous one-body loss and pump within the Markovian approximation. The steady state is non-thermal and is formally equivalent to an infinite-temperature state with finite chemical potential set by the dissipative parameters. While there is no effect of interactions on the steady state, we observe a nontrivial behaviour of the space-time two-point correlation function, obtained by exact diagonalisation. In particular, we find that the decay width of the propagator is not only renormalised at increasing interactions, as it is the case of a single non-linear resonator, but also at increasing hopping strength. Furthermore, we numerically predict at large interactions a plateau value of the decay rate which goes beyond perturbative results in the interaction strength. We then compute the full spectral function, finding that it contains both a dispersive free-particle like dispersion at low energy and a doublon branch at energy corresponding to the on-site interactions. We compare with the corresponding calculation for the ground state of a closed quantum system and show that the driven-dissipative nature -- determining both the steady state and the dynamical evolution -- changes the low-lying part of the spectrum, where noticeably, the dispersion is quadratic instead of linear at small wavevectors. Finally, we compare to a high temperature grand-canonical equilibrium state and show the difference with respect to the open system stemming from the additional degree of freedom of the dissipation that allows one to vary the width of the dispersion lines.

Title: Variational Mapping of Chern Bands to Landau Levels: Application to Fractional Chern Insulators in Twisted MoTe$_2$
Authors: Bohao Li, Fengcheng Wu
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of mapping between Chern bands and generalized Landau levels in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($t$MoTe$_2$), where fractional Chern insulators down to zero magnetic fields have been observed. We construct an exact Landau-level representation of moiré bands, where the basis functions, characterized by a uniform quantum geometry, are derived from Landau-level wavefunctions dressed by spinors aligned or antialigned with the layer pseudospin skyrmion field. We further generalize the dressed zeroth Landau level to a variational wavefunction with an ideal yet nonuniform quantum geometry and variationally maximize its weight in the first moiré band. The variational wavefunction has a high overlap with the first band and quantitatively captures the exact diagonalization spectra of fractional Chern insulators at hole-filling factors $\nu_h=2/3$ and $3/5$, providing a clear theoretical mechanism for the formation and properties of the fractionalized states. Our work introduces a variational approach to studying fractional states by mapping Chern bands to Landau levels, with application to other systems beyond $t$MoTe$_2$ also demonstrated.

Title: Effects of Strain Compensation on Electron Mobilities in InAs Quantum Wells Grown on InP(001)
Authors: C.P. Dempsey, J.T. Dong, I. Villar Rodriguez, Y. Gul, S. Chatterjee, M. Pendharkar, S.N. Holmes, M. Pepper, C.J. Palmstrøm
Abstract: InAs quantum wells (QWs) grown on InP substrates are interesting for their applications in devices with high spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and their potential role in creating topologically nontrivial hybrid heterostructures. These QWs rely on InGaAs cladding layers and InAlAs barrier layers to confine electrons within a thin InAs well. The highest mobility QWs are limited by interfacial roughness scattering and alloy disorder scattering in the cladding and buffer layers. Increasing QW thickness has been shown to reduce the effect of both of these scattering mechanisms. However, for current state-of-the-art devices with As-based cladding and barrier layers, the critical thickness is limited to $\leq7$ nm. In this report, we demonstrate the use of strain compensation techniques in the In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As cladding layers, grown on In$_{0.81}$Al$_{0.19}$As barrier layers, to extend the critical thickness well beyond this limit. We induce tensile strain in the InGaAs cladding layers by reducing the In concentration from In$_{0.81}$Ga$_{0.19}$As to In$_{0.70}$Ga$_{0.30}$As and we observe changes in both the critical thickness of the well and the maximum achievable mobility. The peak electron mobility at 2 K is $1.16\times10^6$ cm$^2/$Vs, with a carrier density of $4.2\times10^{11}$ /cm$^2$. Additionally, we study the quantum lifetime and Rashba spin splitting in the highest mobility device as these parameters are critical to determine if these structures can be used in topologically nontrivial devices.

Title: Phases and dynamics of quantum droplets in the crossover to two-dimensions
Authors: Jose Carlos Pelayo, George Bougas, Thomás Fogarty, Thomas Busch, Simeon I. Mistakidis
Abstract: We explore the ground states and dynamics of ultracold atomic droplets in the crossover region from three to two dimensions by solving the two-dimensional and the quasi two-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii equations numerically and with a variational approach. By systematically comparing the droplet properties, we determine the validity regions of the pure two-dimensional description, and therefore the dominance of the logarithmic nonlinear coupling, as a function of the sign of the averaged mean-field interactions and the size of the transverse confinement. One of our main findings is that droplets become substantially extended upon transitioning from negative-to-positive averaged mean-field interactions. This is accompanied by a significant reduction of their binding energies which are approximately inversely proportional to the square of their size. To explore fundamental dynamical properties in the crossover region, we study interaction quenches and show that the droplets perform a periodic breathing motion for modest quench strengths, while larger quench amplitudes lead to continuous expansion exhibiting density ring structures. We also showcase that it is possible to form complex bulk and surface density patterns in anisotropic geometries following the quench. Since we are working with realistic parameters, our results can directly facilitate future experimental realizations.

Title: Learning Physics-Consistent Material Behavior from Dynamic Displacements
Authors: Zhichao Han, Mohit Pundir, Olga Fink, David S. Kammer
Abstract: Accurately modeling the mechanical behavior of materials is crucial for numerous engineering applications. The quality of these models depends directly on the accuracy of the constitutive law that defines the stress-strain relation. However, discovering these constitutive material laws remains a significant challenge, in particular when only material deformation data is available. To address this challenge, unsupervised machine learning methods have been proposed to learn the constitutive law from deformation data. Nonetheless, existing approaches have several limitations: they either fail to ensure that the learned constitutive relations are consistent with physical principles, or they rely on boundary force data for training which are unavailable in many in-situ scenarios. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach to learn physics-consistent constitutive relations solely from material deformation without boundary force information. This is achieved by considering a dynamic formulation rather than static equilibrium data and applying an input convex neural network (ICNN). We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a diverse range of hyperelastic material laws. We demonstrate that it is robust to a significant level of noise and that it converges to the ground truth with increasing data resolution. We also show that the model can be effectively trained using a displacement field from a subdomain of the test specimen and that the learned constitutive relation from one material sample is transferable to other samples with different geometries. The developed methodology provides an effective tool for discovering constitutive relations. It is, due to its design based on dynamics, particularly suited for applications to strain-rate-dependent materials and situations where constitutive laws need to be inferred from in-situ measurements without access to global force data.

Title: Effects of the pseudogap and the Fermi surface on the rapid Hall-coefficient changes in cuprates
Authors: Yingze Su, Hui Li, Huaqing Huang, Dingping Li
Abstract: High-$T_c$ cuprates are characterized by strong spin fluctuations, which give rise to antiferromagnetic and pseudogap phases and may be key to the high superconducting critical temperatures observed in these materials. Experimental studies have revealed significant changes in the Hall coefficient $R_H$ across these phases, a phenomenon closely related to both spin fluctuations and changes in the Fermi surface morphology. Using the perturbation correction to Gaussian approximation (PCGA), we investigate the two-dimensional(2D) square-lattice single-band Hubbard model and obtain the self-energy with a finite imaginary part due to scattering. We calculate the density dependence of the Hall number $n_H=1/(qR_H)$. For small hole (or electron) doping $p$ (or $x$), our numerical results show that $n_H$ transitions from $p$ to $1+p$ for hole-doped systems, and from $-x$ to $1-x$ for electron-doped systems -- both in agreement with experimental findings. Furthermore, we discuss the correlation between phase boundaries and the observed peculiar changes in the Hall number.

Title: Braided Ising spin-tube physics in a purported kagome magnet
Authors: J. Nagl, D. Flavián, B. Duncan, S. Hayashida, O. Zaharko, E. Ressouche, J. Ollivier, Z. Yan, S. Gvasaliya, A. Zheludev
Abstract: The magnetic insulator Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ has been previously proposed to realize the highly frustrated breathing kagome lattice model. We report a combination of single-crystal neutron scattering studies and numerical simulations that debunk this interpretation. We show that it is the inter-plane couplings that determine the physics. To explain the exotic magnetism, we derive a simple one-dimensional Ising model composed of twisted triangular spin-tubes, i.e., triple braids of Ising spin chains with almost-orthogonal anisotropy frames and competing ferro-antiferromagnetic interactions. This model can account for the ground state, excitations, the numerous field-induced fractional magnetization plateau phases and incommensurate magnetic correlations at elevated temperatures. Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ constitutes a rare example where rich magnetic phenomena can be understood and simulated quantitatively in terms of a simple classical Hamiltonian.

Title: Adaptive Resetting for Informed Search Strategies and the Design of Non-equilibrium Steady-states
Authors: Tommer D. Keidar, Ofir Blumer, Barak Hirshberg, Shlomi Reuveni
Abstract: Stochastic resetting, the procedure of stopping and re-initializing random processes, has recently emerged as a powerful tool for accelerating processes ranging from queuing systems to molecular simulations. However, its usefulness is severely limited by assuming that the resetting protocol is completely decoupled from the state and age of the process that is being reset. We present a general formulation for state- and time-dependent resetting of stochastic processes, which we call adaptive resetting. This allows us to predict, using a single set of trajectories without resetting and via a simple reweighing procedure, all key observables of processes with adaptive resetting. These include the first-passage time distribution, the propagator, and the steady-state. Our formulation enables efficient exploration of informed search strategies and facilitates the prediction and design of complex non-equilibrium steady states, eliminating the need for extensive brute-force sampling across different resetting protocols. Finally, we develop a general machine learning framework to optimize the adaptive resetting protocol for an arbitrary task beyond the current state of the art. We use it to discover efficient protocols for accelerating molecular dynamics simulations.

Title: Antiferroelectric Altermagnets: Antiferroelectricity Alters Magnets
Authors: Xunkai Duan, Jiayong Zhang, Ziye Zhu, Yuntian Liu, Zhenyu Zhang, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou
Abstract: Magnetoelectric coupling is crucial for uncovering fundamental phenomena and advancing technologies in high-density data storage and energy-efficient devices. The emergence of altermagnets, which unify the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, offers unprecedented opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling. However, electrically tuning altermagnets remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle supported by an effective model. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.

Title: Revealing nanoscale structural phase separation in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7-δ}$ single crystal via scanning near-field optical microscopy
Authors: Xiaoxiang Zhou, Weihong He, Kaipeng Ni, Mengwu Huo, Deyuan Hu, Yinghao Zhu, Enkang Zhang, Zhicheng Jiang, Shuaikang Zhang, Shiwu Su, Juan Jiang, Yajun Yan, Yilin Wang, Dawei Shen, Xue Liu, Jun Zhao, Meng Wang, Zengyi Du, Donglai Feng
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$ under high pressure,with an onset critical temperature around 80 K, has sparked significant interest in the superconducting phases of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, Lan+1NinO3n+1. While La4Ni3O10 exhibits nearly 100% superconductivity with Tc~30 K under high pressure, magnetic susceptibility studies on La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$, however, reveal a more complex picture, indicating either filamentary superconductivity or that approximately 50% of crystal phase becomes superconducting in polycrystalline samples. In this study, we employed scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy to visualize nanoscale structural phase separation in La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$, identifying enhanced optical conductivity with stripes approximately 183 nm wide. These stripes run diagonally with respect to the Ni-O-Ni bond directions in the a-b plane, ruling out the possibility that they arise from impurity phases, like the '1313', '214' or '4310' structures. The dark regions and bright stripes exhibit optical conductivities ~ 22% and 29% of gold's, respectively. Additionally, we find that the bright stripes constitute about 38% of the total field of view, while the remainder consists of dark regions and the transitional region between dark regions and bright stripes. Our results suggest that optical conductivity stripes originate from nanoscale structural phase separation. In contrast, La4Ni3O10 exhibits uniform and higher optical conductivity with no observable evidence of phase separation. Thus, our study represents a pioneering effort to directly image nanoscale phase separation in Lan+1NinO3n+1 nickelates. This observation could provide crucial insights into the factors that limit the superconducting volume fraction of La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$, highlighting SNOM as a powerful probe for exploring nanoscale low-energy physics in correlated quantum materials.

Title: Exploring transport mechanisms in atomic precision advanced manufacturing enabled pn junctions
Authors: Juan P. Mendez, Xujiao Gao, Jeffrey Ivie, James H. G. Owen, Wiley P. Kirk, John N. Randall, Shashank Misra
Abstract: We investigate the different transport mechanisms that can occur in pn junction devices made using atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) at temperatures ranging from cryogenic to room temperature. We first elucidate the potential cause of the anomalous behavior observed in the forward-bias response of these devices in recent cryogenic temperature measurements, which deviates from the theoretical response of a silicon Esaki diode. These anomalous behaviors include current suppression at low voltages in the forward-bias response and a much lower valley voltage at cryogenic temperatures than theoretically expected for a silicon diode. To investigate the potential causes of these anomalies, we studied the effects of a few possible transport mechanisms, including band-to-band tunneling, band gap narrowing, potential impact of non-Ohmic contacts, band quantization, impact of leakage, and inelastic trap-assisted tunneling, through semi-classical simulations. We find that a combination of two sets of band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) parameters can qualitatively approximate the shape of the tunneling current at low bias. This can arise from band quantization and realignment due to the strong potential confinement in $\delta$-layers. We also find that the lower-than-theoretically-expected valley voltage can be attributed to modifications in the electronic band structure within the $\delta$-layer regions, leading to a significant band-gap narrowing induced by the high density of dopants. Finally, we extend our analyses to room temperature operation and predict that trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) facilitated by phonon interactions may become significant, leading to a complex superposition of BTBT and TAT transport mechanisms in the electrical measurements.

Title: Field-Angle-Resolved Specific Heat in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$: Evidence against Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid
Authors: Shengjie Fang, Kumpei Imamura, Yuta Mizukami, Ryuichi Namba, Kota Ishihara, Kenichiro Hashimoto, Takasada Shibauchi
Abstract: Kitaev quantum spin liquids (KSLs) in layered honeycomb magnets are known to host Majorana quasiparticles, whose excitations depend strongly on the direction of the applied magnetic field. In the high-field phase of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, specific heat measurements have revealed characteristic field-angle dependence of low-energy excitations consistent with the Kitaev model, providing bulk evidence for the KSL state. Here we present low-temperature measurements of specific heat $C(T)$ for another KSL candidate $\textrm{Na}_2\textrm{Co}_2\textrm{Te}\textrm{O}_6$ (NCTO) under field rotation within the honeycomb plane. Above the critical field of antiferromagnetic order, the field-angle dependence of $C/T$ exhibits minima along the bond directions, contrasting with the maxima observed in the KSL state of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Our analysis indicates nodeless, fully-gapped excitations, which are inconsistent with the angle-dependent Majorana excitations with gapless nodes predicted by the Kitaev model. These findings suggest that low-energy excitations in NCTO are governed by gapped magnon excitations rather than Majorana quasiparticles, providing thermodynamic evidence against a KSL state.

Title: Effects of gravity on supersolid order in bubble-trapped bosons
Authors: Matteo Ciardi, Fabio Cinti, Giuseppe Pellicane, Santi Prestipino
Abstract: Unveiling the principles behind self-organization in quantum systems is of paramount importance, both intrinsically and practically, in view of foreseeable technological applications. Recently, increasing attention is being paid to atomic systems in curved geometries, which are a promising platform for the discovery of new emergent phenomena. A notable example is that of a gas of ultracold atoms loaded into a thin spherical shell, according to a protocol introduced by Zobay and Garraway more than twenty years ago. However, gravity prevents a dilute assembly of atoms from uniformly spreading throughout the shell, which explains why experiments on the condensation and superfluidity of bubble-trapped gases are usually conducted in space under microgravity conditions. In this paper, we focus instead on strongly-interacting quantum particles in a bubble trap, choosing the cluster supersolid of soft-core bosons as testbed. To study the impact of gravity on supersolid order, we consider a gedanken experiment in which the strength of gravity relative to the core repulsion is gradually enhanced. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we trace the parallel evolution of system structure and superfluidity at low temperature, finding that the latter is sizeable only when gravity is a small perturbation or, at the other extreme, so strong that particles are all gathered in one cluster at the bottom of the trap. Finally, we assess the relevance of gravity for the equilibrium behavior of ultracold Rydberg-dressed atoms in a bubble trap, concluding that in some cases clues of the supersolid phase in the absence of gravity could be found even in a laboratory on Earth.

Title: Structure factor and topological bound of twisted bilayer semiconductors at fractional fillings
Authors: Timothy Zaklama, Di Luo, Liang Fu
Abstract: The structure factor is a useful observable for probing charge density correlations in real materials, and its long-wavelength behavior encapsulated by ``quantum weight'' has recently gained prominence in the study of quantum geometry and topological phases of matter. Here we employ the static structure factor, S(q), to explore the phase diagram of twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically tMoTe2, at filling factors n=1/3, 2/3 under varying displacement fields. Our results reveal a topological phase transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a generalized Wigner crystal (GWC). This transition is marked by the appearance of Bragg peaks at charge-density-wave vectors, and simultaneously, large decrease of S(q) at small q which lowers the interaction energy. We further calculate the quantum weight of various FCI states, verifying the universal topological bound. Our findings provide new insights into the phase diagram of twisted TMDs and establish a general framework for characterizing topological phases through structure factor analysis.

Title: Long-Range Correlations under Temperature Gradients: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Simple Fluids
Authors: Hiroyoshi Nakano, Kazuma Yokota
Abstract: In fluids under temperature gradients, long-range correlations (LRCs) emerge generically, leading to enhanced density fluctuations. This phenomenon, characterized by the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the static structure factor (where $\boldsymbol{q}$ is the wavenumber), has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. However, they remain unexplored in Hamiltonian particle systems using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This Letter reports the first MD study to provide unambiguous observations of the LRCs. We demonstrate this by three distinct approaches: (1) measuring the static structure factor and directly observing the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence characterizing the LRCs; (2) detecting the corresponding $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the dynamic structure factor; (3) establishing a quantitative agreement between MD results and predictions from fluctuating hydrodynamics, the phenomenological theory that predicts the LRCs. Our findings demonstrate that MD simulations offer a powerful complementary tool to theoretical and experimental investigations of LRCs.

Title: Thermoelectric effect in a superconductor with Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces
Authors: Tomoya Sano, Takumi Sato, Akihiro Sasaki, Satoshi Ikegaya, Shingo Kobayashi, Yasuhiro Asano
Abstract: We study theoretically the thermoelectric effect in a superconducting state having the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces which stays in a thin superconducting layer between a conventional superconductor and an insulator. The thermoelectric coefficients calculated based on the linear response theory show the remarkable anisotropy in real space, which are explained well by the anisotropic shape of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surface in momentum space. Our results indicate a way to check the existence of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces in a stable superconducting state because the anisotropy is controlled by the direction of an applied magnetic field.

Title: Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and Application to Rare-Earth Magnets
Authors: Shouvik Sur, Chandan Setty
Abstract: Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2 chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoemission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.

Title: On the Hidden Transient Interphase in Metal Anodes: Dynamic Precipitation Controls Electrochemical Interfaces in Batteries
Authors: Stephen T. Fuller, J.-X. Kent Zheng
Abstract: The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, SEI, formed on a battery electrode has been a central area of research for decades. This thin, complex layer profoundly impacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of the metal in battery anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal dissolution, the reverse reaction of deposition, in battery environments using a state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode and in-operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a Transient Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, T-SEI, that forms during fast discharging at high dissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to transient local supersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI fundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface, leading to a self-limiting morphological evolution and eventually yielding a flat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte decomposition, the T-SEI is fully relaxable upon removal of the enforced dissolution current. The formation of T-SEI, surprisingly, plays a critical role in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a fully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that deposited on pristine or low-rate discharged metal electrodes. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggests a homoepitaxial relationship with the original grains in the electrode. This is in stark contrast to the isolated, particulate nuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Our findings provide important insights into the electrochemical kinetics at the metal-electrolyte interface, particularly in concentrated or water-in-salt electrolytes that are close to the salt saturation limit. The results suggest a new dimension for electrochemical engineering in batteries.

Title: Machine learning interatomic potential for the low-modulus Ti-Nb-Zr alloys in the vicinity of dynamical instability
Authors: Boburjon Mukhamedov, Ferenc Tasnadi, Igor A. Abrikosov
Abstract: Traditionally, alloying and thermal treatment are considered as the main tools for design of new materials. Application of first-principles simulations can significantly accelerate the process of materials design, however, to account for both, multicomponent chemical disorder and finite temperature effects in theoretical simulations is a challenging task. In this work we have trained machine learning interatomic potential to effectively simulate finite temperature elastic properties of multicomponent \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys. Our simulations predict the presence of the elinvar effect for the wide range of temperatures. Importantly, we predict that in a vicinity of dynamical and mechanical instability, the \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys demonstrate strongly non-linear concentration-dependence of elastic moduli, which leads to low values of moduli comparable to that of human bone. Moreover, these alloys demonstrate a strong anisotropy of directional Young's modulus which can be helpful for microstructure tailoring and design of materials with desired elastic properties.

Title: Crowding Effects during DNA Translocation in Nanopipettes
Authors: Rand A. Al-Waqfi, Cengiz Khan, Oliver J. Irving, Lauren Matthews, Tim Albrecht
Abstract: Quartz nanopipettes are an important emerging class of electric single-molecule sensors for DNA, proteins, their complexes as well as other biomolecular targets. However, in comparison to other resistive pulse sensors, nanopipettes constitute a highly asymmetric environment and the transport of ions and biopolymers can become strongly direction-dependent. For double-stranded DNA, this can include the characteristic translocation time and its tertiary structure, but as we show here, nanoconfinement can not only lead to unexplored features in the transport characteristics of the sensor, but also unlock new capabilities for biophysical and bioanalytical studies at the single-molecule level. To this end, we show how the accummulation of DNA inside the nanochannel leads to crowding effects, and in some cases reversible blocking of DNA entry, and provide a detailed analysis based on a range of different DNA samples and experimental conditions. Moreover, using biotin-functionalised DNA and streptavidin-modified gold nanoparticles as target, we demonstrate in a proof-of-concept study how the crowding effect, and the resulting increased residence time in nanochannel, can be exploited in a new analytical paradigm, involving DNA injection into the nanochannel, incubation with the nanoparticle target and analysis of the complex by reverse translocation. We thereby integrate elements of sample processing and detection into the nanopipette, as an important conceptual advance, and make a case for the wider applicability of this device concept.

Title: Emergence of Topological Non-Fermi Liquid Phases in a Modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Long-Range Interactions
Authors: Sepide Mohamadi, Jahanfar Abouie
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the emergence of a topological non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase in a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain model subjected to long-range interactions characterized by the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. While Fermi liquid theory has been instrumental in understanding low temperature properties of metals, it fails to account for the complex behaviors exhibited by strongly correlated systems, where interactions lead to emergent phenomena such as non-Fermi liquid behavior. Our analysis reveals that the SSH-HK model supports a rich ground state phase diagram, exhibiting distinct NFL phases marked by many body Zak phases of $2\pi$ and $0$, corresponding to topological and trivial NFL states, respectively. We demonstrate that the topological NFL state manifests unique electronic polarization characteristics akin to those in the non-interacting SSH model. Through exact diagonalization of the interacting SSH-HK Hamiltonian, we explore the spectral functions and density of states, revealing significant departures from traditional quasiparticle behavior in various particle number sectors. Our findings extend the understanding of topological non-Fermi liquids and their potential implications for high-temperature superconductivity and other correlated electron systems, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology and strong electron correlations.

Title: Revisiting ab-initio excited state forces from many-body Green's function formalism: approximations and benchmark
Authors: Rafael R. Del Grande, David A. Strubbe
Abstract: Ab initio techniques for studying the optical and vibrational properties of materials are well-established, but only a few recent studies have focused on the interaction between excitons and atomic vibrations. In this paper, we revisit the excited state forces method, which integrates results from GW/BSE and DFPT calculations to determine the gradient of the excited state energy. We explore its technical aspects, including convergence and the quality of approximations used. We successfully apply this method to investigate self-trapped excitons in LiF. The excited state forces method provides valuable insights into ionic dynamics in the excited state and the microscopic mechanism of exciton self-trapping.

Title: Multicomponent one-dimensional quantum droplets across the mean-field stability regime
Authors: I. A. Englezos, P. Schmelcher, S. I. Mistakidis
Abstract: The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.

Title: DFT+DMFT study on pressure-induced valence instability of CeCoSi
Authors: Shuai-Kang Zhang, Yuanji Xu, Guojun Li, Junshuai Wang, Zhongpo Zhou, Yipeng An
Abstract: Rare-earth compounds RCoSi exhibit unique properties, with distinct structural behaviors depending on whether R is a light, middle or heavy rare-earth element. Among them, CeCoSi undergoes a structural phase transition under high pressure, with the phase transition pressure increasing as temperature rises. Some experimental studies suggest that the transition is closely related to the behavior of Ce-4f electrons. In this work, we systematically studied the evolution of the electronic structure of CeCoSi with temperature and pressure. First, we used the DFT+DMFT to calculate the energy-volume curve of CeCoSi, which was in good agreement with the experimental results and far superior to the DFT method. Next, we studied the electronic structure of CeCoSi under different pressures and temperatures using DFT+DMFT. Our results show that CeCoSi is a Kondo metal with hybridization of Ce-4f and Co-3d. As pressure increases, the renormalization factor Z of Ce-4f5/2 increases, the occupancy number of Ce-4f electrons decreases, and CeCoSi transitions to a mixed-valence state at ~5.5 GPa in 100 K. The pressure of the quantum phase transition PQ is slightly higher than the experimentally observed structural phase transition pressure PS, and the PQ increases with increasing temperature, which is consistent with the behavior of PS in experiment. In addition, the hybridization strength of Ce-4f in the mixed-valence state is significantly greater than in the Kondo metal state. Our results suggest that the valence instability of Ce-4f is the cause of the structural phase transition. As pressure increases, Ce-4f electrons delocalize and CeCoSi transitions to mixed-valence state. This valence instability may cause redistribution of electron density, thus inducing a structural phase transition. Our work reveals the cause of the structural phase transition of CeCoSi under high pressure.

Title: Tunable electron-electron interaction and anomalous enhancement of large-momentum scattering in moiré superlattices
Authors: Taiki Sato, Hiroaki Ishizuka
Abstract: Using a microscopic model, we show that the electron-electron interaction of flat bands deviates significantly from the Coulomb interaction. In particular, we find that large-momentum scattering is enhanced at $\theta\lesssim4^\circ$, with a non-monotonic momentum dependence appearing near the magic angle. For $\theta \gtrsim 1.2^\circ$, the enhanced large-momentum scattering can be attributed to the compact Wannier function. On the other hand, for $\theta\lesssim1.2^\circ$, the nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the interaction matrix cannot be explained by a simple Wannier orbital, indicating a nontrivial modification to the el-el interaction. Notably, the range of angles $\theta$ where the large-momentum scattering is enhanced differs from the magic angles at which nearly-flat bands emerge, suggesting that the angle dependence of material properties provides information about the effect of interaction. The results highlight unusual features of the interaction in moiré graphene.

Title: Quantum Level-Crossing Induced by Anisotropy in Spin-1 Heisenberg Dimers: Applications to Quantum Stirling Engines
Authors: Bastian Castorene, Vinicius Gomez de Paula, Francisco J. Peña, Clebson Cruz, Mario Reis, Patricio Vargas
Abstract: This work explores the thermodynamic performance of a quantum Stirling heat engine implemented with an anisotropic spin-1 Heisenberg dimer as the working medium. Using the Hamiltonian of the system, we analyze the interplay of anisotropy, magnetic field, and exchange interactions and their influence on the energy spectrum and the quantum level crossing. Our results reveal that double-degenerate point (DDP) and a triple-degenerate point (TDP) play pivotal roles in shaping the operational regimes and efficiency of the quantum Stirling engine. At those points, the Carnot efficiency reaches higher work output and enhanced stability, making it a robust candidate for optimal thermodynamic performance. These findings highlight the potential of anisotropic spin systems as viable platforms for quantum heat engines and contribute to advancing the field of quantum thermodynamics.

Title: Spin waves in the bilayer van der Waals magnet CrSBr
Authors: Rob den Teuling, Ritesh Das, Artem V. Bondarenko, Elena V. Tartakovskaya, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Yaroslav M. Blanter
Abstract: We derive analytical expressions for the spin wave frequencies and precession amplitudes in monolayer and antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer CrSBr under in-plane external magnetic fields. The analysis covers the antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and canted phases, demonstrating that the spin wave frequencies in all phases are tunable by the applied magnetic field. We discuss the roles of intra- and interlayer exchange interactions, triaxial anisotropy, and intralayer dynamic dipolar fields in controlling the magnetization dynamics.

Title: Direct Summation of the Madelung Constant using Axial Multipoles
Authors: Joven V. Calara (1), Jan D. Miller (2) ((1) Dept of Engineering, Salt Lake Community College, Salt Lake City, Utah (2) Dept of Metallurgy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah)
Abstract: A direct summation method for the Madelung constant calculation is presented where a crystal lattice is constructed from linear arrays of charges or axial multipoles. An array is designed to have vanishing low order electric moments such that its potential at the origin from a distance $r$ decays at least as fast as $r^{-5}$, but preferably as fast as $r^{-13}$. High potential decay rates render the summation absolutely convergent in up to 6 dimensions. Convergence speed increases with higher decay rates. It is also shown that the limit approached by the summation is independent of the growth geometry. Madelung constants for NaCl bulk, surface, and edge lattice points are calculated, as well as on off-lattice points such as interstitial positions and external neighborhoods of surfaces. In addition, bulk CsCl Madelung constant was calculated. In 1D, 2D, and 3D, accuracy of 13 decimal places are attained within 40 nearest neighbor distance from the reference ion.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging and self-dualities of the $XX$ model and its cousins
Authors: Lei Su
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.

Title: On the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking in liquid hydrogen peroxide
Authors: Roberto Menta, Pablo G. Debenedetti, Roberto Car, Pablo M. Piaggi
Abstract: Molecular chirality is a key concept in chemistry with implications for the origin of life and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Previous simulations of a chiral molecular model with an energetic bias towards homochiral interactions show a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition from a supercritical racemic liquid into a subcritical liquid enriched in one of the two enantiomers. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations in order to test the possible existence of this phenomenon in hydrogen peroxide, the smallest chiral molecule. For this purpose, we study the fluid phase of this substance between 100 K and 1500 K, and from $10^{-4}$ GPa to 1 GPa. We find a glass transition and we suggest that hydrogen bonds play a central role in such behavior. We also test the possibility of observing chiral symmetry breaking by performing both constant temperature and cooling simulations at multiple pressures, and we do not observe the phenomenon. An analysis of the structure of the liquid shows negligible differences between homochiral and heterochiral interactions, supporting the difficulty in observing chiral symmetry breaking. If hydrogen peroxide manifests spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, it likely takes place significantly below room temperature and is hidden by other phenomena, such as the glass transition or crystallization. More broadly, our results, and recent experimental observations, suggest that greater molecular complexity is needed for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the liquid phase to occur.

Title: Spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking induced by electronic instability in the normal state of La_{1-x} Sr_{x} NiO_{2}

Abstract: The spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking (RSB), a hallmark phenomenon in cuprate and iron-based high-temperature superconductors, is believed to intimately connected to superconductivity, both of which originate from interactions among different degrees of freedoms and competing quantum states. Understanding RSB is pivotal for unraveling the microscopic origin of unconventional superconductivity. Although infinite-layer nickelates (ILNs) share similar crystalline structure and the same nominal 3d-electron configurations with cuprates, they have significant differences in Fermi surface topology, electronic band characteristics, and charge order. These distinctions make ILNs an ideal platform for studying RSB in unconventional superconductors. Through angular-resolved resistivity measurements within a large temperature and doping range, we identify pronounced RSB signatures near doping concentrations x=0.05 and 0.25. Based on the strongly correlated electronic structures from combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory calculations, we find that the calculated electronic susceptibility has a peak structure at the corresponding doping concentration, indicating pronounced electronic instabilities which drive RSB. Detailed analysis of the electronic susceptibility demonstrates that the van Hove singularity at the Fermi level significantly contributes to the electronic instability at 0.05 Sr doping. Our findings reveal the important role of electronic correlation, Van Hove singularity, and Fermi surface nesting in the emergence of RSB. Our work not only deepens the understanding of electronic behavior in ILNs, but also provides new ideas and methods for exploring RSB in other unconventional superconductors.

Title: Constraints from anti-unitary symmetries on phase diagrams of sign problem-free models
Authors: Xu Zhang, Nick Bultinck
Abstract: A powerful way to guarantee the absence of a sign problem in determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations is imposing a particular type of anti-unitary symmetries. It is shown that these same symmetries give rise to constraints on correlation functions, which can be used to identify local operators whose correlations upper bound those of a large class of physically relevant operators, including for example superconducting order parameters. Our results also help understand why it is difficult to realize generic finite-momentum orders in sign problem-free models.

Title: Altermagnetism and beyond in the $t$-$t^\prime$-$δ$ Fermi-Hubbard model
Authors: Saisai He, Jize Zhao, Hong-Gang Luo, Shijie Hu
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the phase diagram of the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Fermi-Hubbard model on the square lattice to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this correlated model at half filling. This model has recently become a prominent topic of research because it hosts altermagnetic phases. Using mean-field analysis, we identify four metallic phases and two insulating phases with nontrivial magnetic orders at an intermediate value of $\delta = 0.5$, presenting a rich ground-state phase diagram in the $U$-$t^\prime$ plane. We also highlight the distinct features of the Fermi surface topology for each metallic phase. To go beyond the mean-field theory, we employ the density-matrix renormalization group method to simulate the ground state numerically. The phase boundaries are determined from the discontinuities and peaks in the entanglement entropy and magnetizations. In addition to the phases identified in the mean-field theory, we find a valence-bond solid state in a narrow intermediate-$t'$ region. Our work offers a firm step forward in understanding the complex behaviors of correlated electrons in the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Hubbard model over a large parameter space.

Title: Non-linear vortex dynamics in the mixed state of superconducting a-MoGe and NbN thin films using low-frequency two-coil mutual inductance technique
Authors: Somak Basistha, Soumyajit Mandal, John Jesudasan, Vivas Bagwe, Pratap Raychaudhuri
Abstract: We use a two-coil mutual inductance technique to investigate the non-linear response of the vortex lattice of two type-II superconducting thin films, namely a very weakly pinned amorphous Molybdenum Germanium (a-MoGe) and a moderate-to-strongly pinned Niobium Nitride (NbN). We observe a strong dependence of the magnetic shielding response of the superconductors on the ac excitation amplitude in the primary coil of the two-coil setup. The sample response is studied through the evolution of the radial profile of the induced current density with increasing drive amplitude, which gets significantly modified by the effect of flux creep. We develop a computation scheme where we iteratively combine the coupled Maxwell-London equations for the geometry of the two coils and the sample involved, with a model developed by Coffey and Clem, to analyze the non-linear ac response. The central result of this analysis is that the effect of flux creep gives rise to a strong nonlinearity in the electrodynamic response in the vortex state of the superconducting thin films, that extends down to very low amplitudes of ac excitation. Our results also show that at subcritical low frequency ac drives, the vortex viscosity is exponentially larger than the Bardeen-Stephen estimate. We present a simple scheme to obtain the intrinsic value of the pinning force constant, which otherwise gets affected due to flux creep even at very low ac drives and point out some outstanding issues that need to be addressed in future theoretical and experimental studies.

Title: Ab Initio theory of Electron-phonon-coupling-induced Giant Magnetic Moments of Chiral Phonons in Magnetic Materials
Authors: Fuyi Wang, Xinqi Liu, Hong Sun, Huaiqiang Wang, Shuichi Murakami, Lifa Zhang, Haijun Zhang, Dingyu Xing
Abstract: Chiral phonons, characterized by nonzero angular momenta and magnetic moments, have attracted extensive attention. However, a long-standing critical issue in this field is the lack of ab initio methods to accurately calculate phonon magnetic moments resulting from electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Here, we resolve this challenge by developing an ab initio theory for calculating EPC-induced phonon magnetic properties, applicable to both insulating and metallic materials. Based on this theory, we demonstrate EPC-induced giant phonon magnetic moments and resulting phonon Zeeman splittings in magnetic metals, which are orders of magnitude larger than classical predictions from point-charge models. Interestingly, these splittings could open observable topological gaps in phonon spectra of magnets, generating intrinsic phonon Chern states. Through first-principles calculations, we first propose candidate materials with such intrinsic phonon Chern states hosting robust edge phonon currents which may be applied to detecting neutral particles such as dark matter particles. Our work not only establishes a theoretical foundation for EPC-induced phonon magnetic properties, but also enables the ab initio calculation of long-sought TRS-breaking phonon spectra throughout the Brillouin zone in realistic materials.

Title: Solvable entanglement dynamics in quantum circuits with generalized space-time duality
Authors: Chuan Liu, Wen Wei Ho
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of kicked Ising models in $1+1$ dimensions which have interactions alternating between odd and even bonds in time. These models can be understood as quantum circuits tiling space-time with the generalized space-time dual properties of tri-unitarity (three "arrows of time") at the global level, and also second-level dual-unitarity at the local level, which constrains the behavior of pairs of local gates underlying the circuit under a space-time rotation. We identify a broad class of initial product states wherein the effect of the environment on a small subsystem can be exactly represented by influence matrices with simple Markovian structures, resulting in the subsystem's full dynamics being efficiently computable. We further find additional conditions under which the dynamics of entanglement can be solved for all times, yielding rich phenomenology ranging from linear growth at half the maximal speed allowed by locality, followed by saturation to maximum entropy (i.e., thermalization to infinite temperature); to entanglement growth with saturation to extensive but sub-maximal entropy. Intriguingly, for certain parameter regimes, we find a nonchaotic class of dynamics which is neither integrable nor Clifford, exemplified by nonzero operator entanglement growth but with a spectral form factor which exhibits large, apparently time-quasiperiodic revivals.

Title: Hilbert Space Fragmentation and Subspace Scar Time-Crystallinity in Driven Homogeneous Central-Spin Models
Authors: Abhishek Kumar, Rafail Frantzeskakis, Edwin Barnes
Abstract: We study the stroboscopic non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of periodically kicked Hamiltonians involving homogeneous central-spin interactions. The system exhibits a strong fragmentation of Hilbert space into four-dimensional Floquet-Krylov subspaces, which oscillate between two disjointed two-dimensional subspaces and thus break the discrete time-translation symmetry of the system. Our analytical and numerical analyses reveal that fully polarized states of the satellite spins exhibit fragmentations that are stable against perturbations and have high overlap with Floquet eigenstates of atypically low bipartite entanglement entropy (scar states). Motivated by the breaking of discrete time translation symmetry by Floquet-Krylov subspaces, we introduce a novel type of time crystal that we call a ``subspace time crystal''. We present evidence of robust time-crystalline behavior in the form of a period doubling of the total magnetization of fully polarized satellite spin states that persists over long time scales. We compute non-equilibrium phase diagrams with respect to a magnetic field, coupling terms, and pulse error for various interaction types, including Heisenberg, Ising, XXZ, and XX. We also discuss possible experimental realizations of scar time crystals in color center, quantum dot, and rare-earth ion platforms.

Title: Performance of wave function and Green's functions based methods for non equilibrium many-body dynamics
Authors: Cian C. Reeves, Gaurav Harsha, Avijit Shee, Yuanran Zhu, Thomas Blommel Chao Yang, K Birgitta Whaley, Dominika Zgid, Vojtech Vlcek
Abstract: Theoretical descriptions of non equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems essentially employ either (i) explicit treatments, relying on truncation of the expansion of the many-body wave function, (ii) compressed representations of the many-body wave function, or (iii) evolution of an effective (downfolded) representation through Green's functions. In this work, we select representative cases of each of the methods and address how these complementary approaches capture the dynamics driven by intense field perturbations to non equilibrium states. Under strong driving, the systems are characterized by strong entanglement of the single particle density matrix and natural populations approaching those of a strongly interacting equilibrium system. We generate a representative set of results that are numerically exact and form a basis for critical comparison of the distinct families of methods. We demonstrate that the compressed formulation based on similarity transformed Hamiltonians (coupled cluster approach) is practically exact in weak fields and, hence, weakly or moderately correlated systems. Coupled cluster, however, struggles for strong driving fields, under which the system exhibits strongly correlated behavior, as measured by the von Neumann entropy of the single particle density matrix. The dynamics predicted by Green's functions in the (widely popular) GW approximation are less accurate by improve significantly upon the mean-field results in the strongly driven regime.

Title: Hydrodynamics and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
Authors: Luca Capizzi, Jiaozi Wang, Xiansong Xu, Leonardo Mazza, Dario Poletti
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) describes the properties of diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in the eigenenergy basis. In this work, we propose a relation between (i) the singular behaviour of the off-diagonal part of ETH at small energy differences, and (ii) the smooth profile of the diagonal part of ETH as a function of the energy density. We establish this connection from the decay of the autocorrelation functions of local operators, which is constrained by the presence of local conserved quantities whose evolution is described by hydrodynamics. We corroborate our predictions with numerical simulations of two non-integrable spin-1 Ising models, one diffusive and one super-diffusive, which we perform using dynamical quantum typicality up to 18 spins.

Title: Boltzmann approach to collective motion via nonlocal visual interaction
Authors: Susumu Ito, Nariya Uchida
Abstract: Visual cues play crucial roles in the collective motion of animals, birds, fish, and insects. The interaction mediated by visual information is essentially non-local and has many-body nature due to occlusion, which poses a challenging problem in modeling the emergent collective behavior. In this paper, we introduce a Boltzmann-equation approach incorporating non-local visual interaction. Occlusion is treated in a self-consistent manner via a coarse-grained density field, which renders the interaction effectively pairwise. Our model also incorporates the recent finding that each organism stochastically selects a neighbor to interact at each instant. We analytically derive the order-disorder transition point, and show that the visual screening effect raises the transition threshold, which does not vanish when the density of the agents or the range of the intrinsic interaction is taken to infinity. Our analysis suggests that the model exhibits a discontinuous transition as in the local interaction models, and but the discontinuity is weakened by the non-locality. Our study clarifies the essential role of non-locality in the visual interactions among moving organisms.

Title: Engineering Bosonic Codes with Quantum Lattice Gates
Authors: Lingzhen Guo, Tangyou Huang, Lei Du
Abstract: Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. We explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.

Title: Low-density functionalized amorphous carbon nanofoam as binder-free Supercapacitor electrode
Authors: Subrata Ghosh, Massimiliano Righi, Andrea Macrelli, Francesco Goto, Marco Agozzino, Gianlorenzo Bussetti, Valeria Russo, Andrea Li Bassi, Carlo S. Casari
Abstract: Nanoporous carbon materials containing small domains of sp2-carbon with highly disordered structures are promising for supercapacitor applications. Herein, we synthesize amorphous carbon nanofoam with 98% volumetric void fraction and low mass density of around 30 mg/cm3 by pulsed laser deposition at room temperature. With the unavoidable oxygen functional groups on the nanoporous surface, carbon nanofoam and nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanofoams are directly grown on the desired substrate under different background gases (Ar, N2, N2-H2), and employed as supercapacitor electrodes. Among the background gases used in synthesis, the use of nitrogen yields nanofoam with higher thickness and more N-content with higher graphitic-N. From the test of amorphous carbon nanofoam supercapacitor device, nitrogenated amorphous carbon electrode shows a higher areal capacitance of 4.1 mF/cm2 at 20 mV/s in aqueous electrolyte, a better capacitance retention at higher current, and excellent cycle stability (98%) over 10000 charge-discharge cycles are achieved compared to not-functionalized counterpart prepared under Ar background gas (2.7 mF/cm2 and cycle stability of 88%).

Title: Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries
Authors: Barak Gabai, Victor Gorbenko, Jiaxin Qiao, Bernardo Zan, Aleksandr Zhabin
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.

Title: Linear response in a charged gas in curved spacetime and covariant heat equation
Authors: Long Cui, Xin Hao, Liu Zhao
Abstract: We consider the linear response of a near-equilibrium charged relativistic gas in the presence of electromagnetic and gravitational field in a generic stationary spacetime up to the second order of relaxation time and calculate the tensorial kinetic coefficients introduced by the presence of the strong electromagnetic and/or gravitational field. Using the covariant transfer equations thus developed, a covariant heat equation governing the relativistic heat conduction is derived, which, in Minkowski spacetime, reduces into a form which is remarkably similar to the well-known Cattaneo equation but with a different sign in front of the second-order time derivative term. We also perform a comparative analysis on the different behaviors of our heat equation and the Cattaneo equation in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, the effect of gravity on the heat conduction predicted by our heat equation is illustrated around Schwarzschild black hole, which makes a sharp contrast to the Minkowski case.

Title: Identifying the impact of local connectivity patterns on dynamics in excitatory-inhibitory networks

Abstract: Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.

Authors: Francesco Toppan
Abstract: In this paper I present the state of the art concerning the theoretical detectability (and the open challenges for the experimental detectability) of a special class of paraparticles beyond bosons and fermions. The particles under considerations, obeying a parastatistics, are mutually exchanged via the permutation group and can exist in any space dimension (the anyons, which transform under the more general braid group, cannot exist in more than two space dimensions).

Title: A unified framework of unitarily residual measures for quantifying dissipation
Authors: Tomohiro Nishiyama, Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: Open quantum systems are governed by both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, with dissipation arising from the latter. Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.

Title: Rational RG flow, extension, and Witt class
Authors: Ken Kikuchi
Abstract: Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets. The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.

Title: Characterization of Tunnel Diode Oscillator for Qubit Readout Applications
Authors: Ivan Grytsenko, Sander van Haagen, Oleksiy Rybalko, Asher Jennings, Rajesh Mohan, Yiran Tian, Erika Kawakami
Abstract: We developed a tunnel diode oscillator and characterized its performance, highlighting its potential applications in the quantum state readout of electrons in semiconductors and electrons on liquid helium. This cryogenic microwave source demonstrates significant scalability potential for large-scale qubit readout systems due to its compact design and low power consumption of only 1 uW, making it suitable for integration on the 10 mK stage of a dilution refrigerator. The tunnel diode oscillator exhibits superior amplitude stability compared to commercial microwave sources. The output frequency is centered around 140 MHz, commonly used for qubit readout of electrons in semiconductors, with a frequency tunability of 10 MHz achieved using a varactor diode. Furthermore, the phase noise was significantly improved by replacing the commercially available voltage source with a lead-acid battery, achieving a measured phase noise of -115 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset.

Title: Hybrid quantum network for sensing in the acoustic frequency range
Authors: Valeriy Novikov, Jun Jia, Túlio Brito Brasil, Andrea Grimaldi, Maimouna Bocoum, Mikhail Balabas, Jörg Helge Müller, Emil Zeuthen, Eugene Simon Polzik
Abstract: Ultimate limits for sensing of fields and forces are set by the quantum noise of a sensor. Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for a number of applications. Here we demonstrate a novel tool for broadband quantum sensing by performing quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum, and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble is strongly coupled to one of the frequency-tunable beams of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR beam of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative- or positive-mass oscillator we demonstrate frequency-dependent quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble allows to target quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of the broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to gravitational wave detectors. Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing.

Title: QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow
Authors: Ning Bao, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Zhihan Liu
Abstract: By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$. This kernel is directly related to the quantum path integral of the Virasoro TQFT, and manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.

Title: Violation of Parity and Flavor Symmetries in a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model
Authors: Yukimi Goto, Tohru Koma
Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with certain continuous chiral and two-flavor symmetries. For the Hamiltonian of the model, we construct a ground state which breaks the parity and flavor symmetries. In our argument, the chiral symmetry plays a crucial role for proving the violation of the parity and flavor symmetries, although the model does not contain the so-called Wilson term.

Title: An unusual BPS equation
Authors: Constantin Bachas, Lorenzo Bianchi, Zhongwu Chen
Abstract: We prove a conjectured relation between the energy-momentum and the displacement norm of superconformal defects. The proof completes earlier results, and shows that supersymmetry identifies two natural notions of brane tension in Anti-de Sitter gravity. As a byproduct we show that a modification of the energy-momentum tensor that removes the stress of static superconformal defects, ensures also that the radiation these emit obeys the Null Energy Condition. This sheds new light on the radiation-reaction problem for moving charges.

Title: Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter
Authors: Qingyuan Wang, Romain Vasseur, Simon Trebst, Andreas W.W. Ludwig, Guo-Yi Zhu
Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.

Title: MoMa: A Modular Deep Learning Framework for Material Property Prediction
Authors: Botian Wang, Yawen Ouyang, Yaohui Li, Yiqun Wang, Haorui Cui, Jianbing Zhang, Xiaonan Wang, Wei-Ying Ma, Hao Zhou
Abstract: Deep learning methods for material property prediction have been widely explored to advance materials discovery. However, the prevailing pre-train then fine-tune paradigm often fails to address the inherent diversity and disparity of material tasks. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MoMa, a Modular framework for Materials that first trains specialized modules across a wide range of tasks and then adaptively composes synergistic modules tailored to each downstream scenario. Evaluation across 17 datasets demonstrates the superiority of MoMa, with a substantial 14% average improvement over the strongest baseline. Few-shot and continual learning experiments further highlight MoMa's potential for real-world applications. Pioneering a new paradigm of modular material learning, MoMa will be open-sourced to foster broader community collaboration.

Title: Magnetic Permeability Time-varying Metamaterials at Microwave Frequencies
Authors: Toshiyuki Kodama, Nobuaki Kikuchi, Takahiro Chiba, Seigo Ohno, Satoshi Okamoto, Satoshi Tomita
Abstract: We demonstrate magnetic permeability time-varying metamaterials at GHz frequencies using ferromagnetic permalloy (Ni80Fe20; Py). We observe frequency up and down conversion of 4 GHz microwaves through the metamaterials, which is caused by the temporal modulation of permeability in the Py layer. Moreover, the efficiency of the up-conversion to a higher frequency is much larger than that of the down conversion to a lower frequency. These experimental results are reproduced well via numerical calculation, verifying that the significant up-conversion efficiency is traced back to nonlinear magnetization dynamics in the metamaterials. The present study opens a door to microwave sources toward the 6th-generation mobile communication system, four-dimensional metamaterials with spatio-temporal modulation, and nonlinear spintronics.

Title: Probing Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning
Authors: Abhinav Sinha, Trideb Shit, Avinash Tetarwal, Diptiman Sen, Sebabrata Mukherjee
Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic intra-cell coupling disorder in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.

Title: Flow birefringence of shear-thinning fluid in a Hele-Shaw cell
Authors: Misa Kawaguchi, William Kai Alexander Worby, Yuto Yokoyama, Ryuta X. Suzuki, Yuichiro Nagatsu, Yoshiyuki Tagawa
Abstract: Flow birefringence measurement is an emerging technique for visualizing stress fields in fluid flows. This study investigates flow birefringence in the steady radial Hele-Shaw flow of a shear-thinning fluid. In this flow configuration, stress is dominant along the optical axis, challenging the applicability of the conventional stress-optic law (SOL). We conduct flow birefringence measurements at various flow rates and compare the results with theoretical predictions. The observed phase retardation cannot be quantitatively explained using the conventional SOL, but is successfully described using the second-order SOL, which accounts for stress along the optical direction, using the results of rheo-optical measurements. Furthermore, we investigate the shear-thinning effects on phase retardation from two perspectives: (i) stress changes resulting from viscosity variations and (ii) the variation of the shear-dependent stress-optic coefficient in the second-order SOL. Our findings indicate that the latter is more significant and shear-thinning behavior suppresses radial variations in phase retardation. This study demonstrates that the combination of the second-order SOL and rheo-optical measurements is essential for an accurate interpretation of flow birefringence in Hele-Shaw flow, providing a noninvasive approach for stress field analysis in high-aspect-ratio geometries.
