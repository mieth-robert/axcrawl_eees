Title: Exact mobility line and mobility ring in the complex energy plane of a flat band lattice with a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic potential
Authors: Guang-Xin Pang, Zhi Li, Shan-Zhong Li, Yan-Yang Zhang, Jun-Feng Liu, Yi-Cai Zhang
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the problem of Anderson localization in a one-dimensional flat band lattice with a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic on-site potential. First of all, we discuss the influences of non-Hermitian potentials on the existence of critical states. Our findings show that, unlike in Hermitian cases, the non-Hermiticity of the potential leads to the disappearance of critical states and critical regions. Furthermore, we are able to accurately determine the Lyapunov exponents and the mobility edges. Our results reveal that the mobility edges form mobility lines and mobility rings in the complex energy plane. Within the mobility rings, the eigenstates are extended, while the localized states are located outside the mobility rings. For mobility line cases, only when the eigenenergies lie on the mobility lines, their corresponding eigenstates are extended this http URL, as the energy approaches the mobility edges, we observe that, differently from Hermitian cases, here the critical index of the localization length is not a constant, but rather varies depending on the positions of the mobility edges.

Title: Dew harvesting grass: role of epicuticular wax in regulating condensation dynamics
Authors: Bashra Mahamed, Francis James Dent, Robert Simpson, Nicola Weston, Fanny Nascimento Costa, Sepideh Khodaparast
Abstract: Identification and characterization of natural dew collecting models is instrumental for the inspiration, design and development of engineered dew harvesting systems. Short low growing grass is one of the most ubiquitous and proficient examples of natural dew harvesting, owing to its large surface area, small thermal capacity, structured rough surface and proximity to ground level. Here, we provide a closer look at the formation, growth, and dynamics of microscale dew droplets on the surface of wheatgrass leaves, investigating the role of epicuticular wax. The wheatgrass leaf exhibits biphilic properties emerging from the hydrophilic lamina covered by hydrophobic wax microsculptures. As a result, the regulation of the dew formation and condensation dynamics is largely governed by the arrangement and density of epicuticular wax micromorphologies. At moderate subcooling levels (4-10 $^{\circ}$C below the dew point), we observe drop-wise condensation on the superhydrophobic adaxial side, while significant flooding and film condensation usually appear on abaxial surfaces with lower wax coverage. On the adaxial side of the leaves, the fairly uniform coverage of the hydrophobic epicuticular wax crystals on the hydrophilic background promotes drop-wise condensation nucleation while facilitating droplet mobility. Frequent coalescence of multiple droplets of 5 - 20 ${\mu}$m diameter results in self-propelled departure events, creating free potential sites for new nucleation. The findings of this study advance our understanding of dew formation on natural surfaces while providing inspiration and guidance for the development of sustainable functional microstructured coatings for various drop-wise condensation applications.

Title: Towards scientific machine learning for granular material simulations -- challenges and opportunities
Authors: Marc Fransen, Andreas Fürst, Deepak Tunuguntla, Daniel N. Wilke, Benedikt Alkin, Daniel Barreto, Johannes Brandstetter, Miguel Angel Cabrera, Xinyan Fan, Mengwu Guo, Bram Kieskamp, Krishna Kumar, John Morrissey, Jonathan Nuttall, Jin Ooi, Luisa Orozco, Stefanos-Aldo Papanicolopulos, Tongming Qu, Dingena Schott, Takayuki Shuku, WaiChing Sun, Thomas Weinhart, Dongwei Ye, Hongyang Cheng
Abstract: Micro-scale mechanisms, such as inter-particle and particle-fluid interactions, govern the behaviour of granular systems. While particle-scale simulations provide detailed insights into these interactions, their computational cost is often prohibitive. Attended by researchers from both the granular materials (GM) and machine learning (ML) communities, a recent Lorentz Center Workshop on "Machine Learning for Discrete Granular Media" brought the ML community up to date with GM challenges. This position paper emerged from the workshop discussions. We define granular materials and identify seven key challenges that characterise their distinctive behaviour across various scales and regimes, ranging from gas-like to fluid-like and solid-like. Addressing these challenges is essential for developing robust and efficient digital twins for granular systems in various industrial applications. To showcase the potential of ML to the GM community, we present classical and emerging machine/deep learning techniques that have been, or could be, applied to granular materials. We reviewed sequence-based learning models for path-dependent constitutive behaviour, followed by encoder-decoder type models for representing high-dimensional data. We then explore graph neural networks and recent advances in neural operator learning. Lastly, we discuss model-order reduction and probabilistic learning techniques for high-dimensional parameterised systems, which are crucial for quantifying uncertainties arising from physics-based and data-driven models. We present a workflow aimed at unifying data structures and modelling pipelines and guiding readers through the selection, training, and deployment of ML surrogates for granular material simulations. Finally, we illustrate the workflow's practical use with two representative examples, focusing on granular materials in solid-like and fluid-like regimes.

Title: Anomalous interference drives oscillatory dynamics in wave-dressed active particles
Authors: Austin M. Blitstein, Rodolfo R. Rosales, Pedro J. Sáenz
Abstract: A recent surge of discoveries has sparked significant interest in active systems where a particle moves autonomously due to a resonant interaction with its self-generated wave field, leading to notable wave-mediated effects including new propulsion mechanisms, spontaneous oscillatory dynamics, and quantum-like phenomena. Drawing from an archetypical model of wave-dressed active particles, we unveil a wave-mediated non-local force driving their dynamics, arising from the particle's path memory and an unconventional form of wave interference near jerking points, locations where the particle's velocity changes rapidly. In contrast to the typical case of constructive interference at points of stationary phase, waves excited by the particle near jerking points avoid cancellation through rapid changes in frequency. Through an asymptotic analysis, we derive the wave force from jerking points, revealing it as an elusive but crucial remnant of the particle's past motion that allows us to rationalize mechanistically in-line speed oscillations, wave-like statistics in potential wells, and non-specular reflections. The results we derive follow from generic wave superposition principles, suggesting their applicability to a broad class of wave-dressed active particles.

Title: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation of silicon nanoparticle crystallization during laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) printing
Authors: Youwen Liang, Wan Shou
Abstract: Laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) printing is a versatile technique to realize micro/nano-scale additive manufacturing of functional materials, including metals, and semiconductors. However, the crystallization phenomena during LIFT printing have not been well understood. In this work, we attempt to gain a comprehensive understanding of silicon crystallization during LIFT printing. Specifically, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is used to investigate the size effect on the melting and crystallization of Si nanoparticles during transportation in air. We found with the decrease in nanoparticle size, crystallization becomes rare, even with a low cooling rate. The nucleation location of different particles is also analyzed and almost always starts at a sub-surface location (below 5 Å). The atomic structure evolution during solidification is also monitored to provide guidance for LIFT printing of Si. Our simulation results indicate that nano-confinement can lead to single-crystal structure formation, which may shed light on single-crystal additive manufacturing.

Title: Twist-Induced Effects on Weyl Pairs in Magnetized Graphene Nanoribbons
Authors: Semra Gurtas Dogan, Kobra Hasanirokh, Omar Mustafa, Abdullah Guvendi
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.

Title: Imbibition of Oil in Dry and Prewetted Calcite Nanopores
Authors: Ejaz Ahmed (1), Huajie Zhang (1), Mert Aybar (1), Bikai Jin (2), Shihao Wang (2), Rui Qiao (1) ((1) Department of Mechanical Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA, (2) Chevron Energy Technology Co., Houston, USA)
Abstract: Fluid imbibition into porous media featuring nanopores is ubiquitous in applications such as oil recovery from unconventional reservoirs and material processing. While the imbibition of pure fluids has been extensively studied, the imbibition of fluid mixture is little explored. Here we report the molecular dynamics study of the imbibition of model crude oil into nanometer-wide mineral pores, both when pore walls are dry and prewetted by a residual water film. Results show the fastest imbibition and quickest propagation of molecularly thin precursor films ahead of the oil meniscus in the dry pore system. The presence of a thin water film on pore walls corresponding to an environmental relative humidity of 30% slows down but still allows the spontaneous imbibition of single-component oil. Introducing polar components into the oil slows down the imbibition into dry nanopores, due partly to the clogging of the pore entrance. Strong selectivity toward nonpolar oil is evident. The slowdown of imbibition by polar oil is less significant in the prewetted pores than in dry pores, but the selectivity toward nonpolar oil remains strong.

Title: Banana DNA derivatives as homeotropic alignment layers in optical devices
Authors: Rafał Węgłowski, Anna Spadło, Dorota Węgłowska
Abstract: In this study, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from bananas was extracted and functionalized and used for the first time as a homeotropic alignment layer for liquid crystals (LCs). Our research was aimed at extracting and investigating DNA from bananas via the synthesis and study of DNA complexes with various surfactants to examine the usefulness of such a complex as an alignment layer in electro-optical transducers. We proposed a simple and eco-friendly synthesis of the DNA complexes isolated from bananas with surfactants, so we transformed the DNA isolated from bananas into a functionalized alignment layer. A biopolymer alignment layer like deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from a banana complexed with a cationic surfactant is an excellent alternative to a commonly used but toxic polyimide alignment layer. DNA-based materials are promising for photonic applications and biosensors because of their excellent optical and physical properties, biodegradability, and low production cost. The novelty of the research lies in the potential use of these materials as biodegradable biopolymer alignment layers for optical devices instead of conventional polymers, which are usually harmful for the environment.

Title: Enhanced Classical Nucleation Theory for Cavitation Inception in the Presence of Gaseous Nuclei
Authors: Mazyar Dawoodian, Ould el Moctar
Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced Classical Nucleation Theory model to predict the cavitation inception pressure and to describe the behavior of nanoscale gaseous nuclei during cavitation. Validation is achieved through molecular dynamics simulations. The findings highlight the significant role of nanoscale gaseous nuclei in lowering the tensile strength required for cavitation initiation. The results show that our enhanced CNT model predicts lower cavitation pressures than the Blake threshold, closely matching molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, our results illustrate that differences between cavitation pressures using the Van der Waals and ideal gas models are greatest for smaller nuclei and lower temperatures.

Title: Tuning Charge Density Wave in the Transition from Magnetically Frustrated Conductor to Ferrimagnetic Insulator in Carbon Nanowire within Boron Nitride Nanotube
Authors: Chi Ho Wong, Zong Liang Guo, King Cheong Lam, Chun Pong Chau, Wing Yu Chan, Chak-yin Tang, Yuen Hong Tsang, Leung Yuk Frank Lam, Xijun Hu
Abstract: The emergence of exotic charge density wave (CDW) alongside ferrimagnetism materials opens exciting new possibilities for quantum switching, particularly in field-tuning CDW electronics. However, these two phenomena often compete and rely heavily on strong electronic correlations. While carbon nanowire arrays have been experimentally shown to exhibit ferromagnetism above 400 K, our research shows that encapsulating a linear carbon chain (LCC) within zigzag boron nitride nanotubes (BNT) induces a short-range CDW state under a competing effect of ferrimagnetism and magnetic frustrations. However, for this exotic feature to occur, the LCC needs to break the symmetry along the circular plane of the BNT. Then we utilize a Monte Carlo model to identify the optimal length of LCC@BNT to tackle its size effect, while also comparing the stability of chains provided by carbon nanotubes. The shorter LCC@BNT displays a more prominent long-range CDW pattern with a tunneling barrier of 2.3 eV on the Fermi surface, transitioning into an unconventional insulator. Meanwhile, magnetic frustrations disappear, and ferrimagnetism remains stable up to 280 K. Our discovery of ferrimagnetic CDW carbyne insulators, which function without conventional periodic lattice distortion, spin-orbit coupling, or complex d and f hybridization represents a groundbreaking shift in thinking, which demonstrates that such exotic properties are not exclusive to transition metal elements. We anticipate that spin fluctuations in LCC@BNT could enable fine-tuning of the CDW pattern, and applying an electric excitation of 2.3 eV triggers an abrupt insulator-to-conductor transition for quantum switching applications.

Title: The temperature dependent thermal vector potential in spinor Boltzmann equation
Authors: Zheng-Chuan Wang
Abstract: The thermal scalar and vector potential were introduced to investigate the thermal transport under a temperature gradient in terms of linear response theory[1,2]. However, the microscopic origin of these phenomenological thermal potentials had not been addressed clearly. In this manuscript, we try to derive a temperature dependent damping force based on the spinor Boltzmann equation (SBE), and relate it with the thermal gauge potential, which is exactly the temperature dependent thermal scalar and vector potential. It is shown that the thermal potential originates from the scattering of conduction electrons and impurity or other scattering mechanisms. We also derive a temperature dependent inverse relaxation time, which depends on momentum, it is different from the usual constant relaxation time. We evaluate the temperature dependent damping force by an approximated analytical solution of SBE. The other physical observable such as charge current and spin current are also explored.

Title: PolyConf: Unlocking Polymer Conformation Generation through Hierarchical Generative Models
Authors: Fanmeng Wang, Wentao Guo, Qi Ou, Hongshuai Wang, Haitao Lin, Hongteng Xu, Zhifeng Gao
Abstract: Polymer conformation generation is a critical task that enables atomic-level studies of diverse polymer materials. While significant advances have been made in designing various conformation generation methods for small molecules and proteins, these methods struggle to generate polymer conformations due to polymers' unique structural characteristics. The scarcity of polymer conformation datasets further limits progress, making this promising area largely unexplored. In this work, we propose PolyConf, a pioneering tailored polymer conformation generation method that leverages hierarchical generative models to unlock new possibilities for this task. Specifically, we decompose the polymer conformation into a series of local conformations (i.e., the conformations of its repeating units), generating these local conformations through an autoregressive model. We then generate corresponding orientation transformations via a diffusion model to assemble these local conformations into the complete polymer conformation. Moreover, we develop the first benchmark with a high-quality polymer conformation dataset derived from molecular dynamics simulations to boost related research in this area. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PolyConf consistently generates high-quality polymer conformations, facilitating advancements in polymer modeling and simulation.

Title: Breaking better: Imperfections increase fracture resistance in architected lattices
Authors: Alessandra Lingua, Antoine Sanner, François Hild, David S. Kammer
Abstract: Architected materials offer unique opportunities to tailor fracture properties through local structural modifications. In this study, we investigate how the failure of architected materials with triangular lattice topology is affected by the removal of individual struts, which represent well-controlled and localized imperfections. Using a combination of macroscopic mechanical testing and digital image correlation (DIC), we analyze both global response and local crack propagation. We observe that the designed imperfections do not alter the failure initiation site nor the peak tensile load but significantly increase the work to failure. DIC-based tracking reveals that this increase correlates with deviations in the crack path and may also involve mechanisms such as crack bridging or temporary pinning near defects. These results demonstrate that small, well-characterized imperfections, when properly mastered, can be harnessed to improve failure resistance and expand the design space of architected materials beyond regular, periodic structures.

Title: Entropically Driven Agents
Authors: M. Andrecut
Abstract: Populations of agents often exhibit surprising collective behavior emerging from simple local interactions. The common belief is that the agents must posses a certain level of cognitive abilities for such an emerging collective behavior to occur. However, contrary to this assumption, it is also well known that even noncognitive agents are capable of displaying nontrivial behavior. Here we consider an intermediate case, where the agents borrow a little bit from both extremes. We assume a population of agents performing random-walk in a bounded environment, on a square lattice. The agents can sense their immediate neighborhood, and they will attempt to move into a randomly selected empty site, by avoiding this http URL, the agents will temporary stop moving when they are in contact with at least two other agents. We show that surprisingly, such a rudimentary population of agents undergoes a percolation phase transition and self-organizes in a large polymer like structure, as a consequence of an attractive entropic force emerging from their restricted-valence and local spatial arrangement.

Title: Unveiling Berry curvature contributions to Hall current in $C_4K$ materials
Authors: T. Farajollahpour, R. Ganesh, K. V. Samokhin
Abstract: We identify a new contribution to the conventional Hall effect that emerges in materials with $C_4K$ symmetry. This contribution originates from the modification of phase space density due to the Berry curvature, as we demonstrate using semiclassical equations of motion for band electrons. As an illustration, we build a minimal two-band tight-binding model with altermagnetic order that breaks $C_4$ and $K$ symmetries while preserving $C_4K$. The resulting Hall conductivity shows a square-root feature at the altermagnetic phase transition, which is due to the novel Berry curvature-driven contribution emerging below the critical temperature. This effect may offer a simple transport-based signature of an altermagnetic phase transition.

Title: Measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum inference problems and quantum hidden Markov models
Authors: Sun Woo P. Kim, Curt von Keyserlingk, Austen Lamacraft
Abstract: Recently, there is interest in coincident 'sharpening' and 'learnability' transitions in monitored quantum systems. In the latter, an outside observer's ability to infer properties of a quantum system from measurements undergoes a phase transition. Such transitions appear to be related to the decodability transition in quantum error correction, but the precise connection is not clear. Here, we study these problems under one framework we call the general quantum inference problem. In cases as above where the system has a Markov structure, we say that the inference is on a quantum hidden Markov model. We show a formal connection to classical hidden Markov models and that they coincide for certain setups. For example, we prove this for those involving Haar-random unitaries and measurements. We introduce the notion of Bayes non-optimality, where parameters used for inference differs from true ones. This allows us to expand the phase diagrams of above models. At Bayes optimality, we obtain an explicit relation between 'sharpening' and 'learnability' order parameters, explicitly showing that the two transitions coincide. Next, we study concrete examples. We review quantum error correction on the toric and repetition code and their mapping to 2D random-bond Ising model (RBIM) through our framework. We study the Haar-random U(1)-symmetric monitored quantum circuit and tree, mapping each to inference models that we call the planted SSEP and planted XOR, respectively, and expanding the phase diagram to Bayes non-optimality. For the circuit, we deduce the phase boundary numerically and analytically argue that it is of a single universality class. For the tree, we present an exact solution of the entire phase boundary, which displays re-entrance as does the 2D RBIM. We discuss these phase diagrams, with their interpretations for quantum inference problems and rigorous arguments on their shapes.

Title: How quantum fluctuations freeze a classical liquid and then melt it into a topological one
Authors: Hao Chen, Dan Mao, Andrea Kouta Dagnino, Glenn Wagner, Mark H. Fischer, Juraj Hasik, Eun-Ah Kim, Titus Neupert
Abstract: Topologically ordered quantum liquids are highly sought-after quantum phases of matter and recently, fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) joined the few experimental realizations of such phases. Here, we ask whether a gapped classical, highly degenerate liquid can be the birthplace of FCIs upon the addition of suitable quantum fluctuations. Two competing tendencies can be anticipated: (i) following the quantum order-by-disorder paradigm, quantum fluctuations could induce symmetry-breaking (charge) order, or (ii) the classical liquid builds up long-range entanglement and turns into a quantum liquid. We study spinless fermions on a honeycomb lattice subject to cluster-charging interactions and introduce quantumness through a Haldane kinetic term. Based on extensive exact diagonalization calculations and high-order perturbation theory, we find that neither scenario (i) or (ii) prevails, but (i) and (ii) manifest sequentially as the kinetic energy is increased. We demonstrate how the gradual lifting of kinematic constraints gives rise to this sequence of phases. Our results relate to the regime of intermediate-scale interactions present in moiré systems, where band projections are not suitable to model FCIs and competing charge-ordered phases have been identified.

Title: Gate-tunable electroresistance in a sliding ferroelectric tunnel junction
Authors: Bozo Vareskic, Finn G. Kennedy, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Kenji Yasuda, Daniel C. Ralph
Abstract: We fabricate and measure electrically-gated tunnel junctions in which the insulating barrier is a sliding van der Waals ferroelectric made from parallel-stacked bilayer hexagonal boron nitride and the electrodes are single-layer graphene. Despite the nominally-symmetric tunnel-junction structure, these devices can exhibit substantial electroresistance upon reversing the ferroelectric polarization. The magnitude and sign of tunneling electroresistance are tunable by bias and gate voltage. We show that this behavior can be understood within a simple tunneling model that takes into account the quantum capacitance of the graphene electrodes, so that the tunneling densities of states in the electrodes are separately modified as a function of bias and gate voltage.

Title: Magnetic order and physical properties of the Kagome metal UNb$_6$Sn$_6$
Authors: Z. W. Riedel, W. Simeth, C. S. Kengle, S. M. Thomas, J. D. Thompson, A. O. Scheie, F. Ronning, C. Lane, Jian-Xin Zhu, P. F. S. Rosa, E. D. Bauer
Abstract: The $RM_6X_6$ family of materials ($R$ = rare-earth, $M$ = transition metal, $X$ = Ga, Si, Ge, Sn) produces an array of emergent phenomena, such as charge density waves, intrinsic Hall effects, and complex magnetic order, due to its Kagome net of transition metal atoms, its local-moment magnetic anisotropies, and its extensive chemical tunability. Here, we report a new ``166" material containing both an actinide (uranium) and a 4$d$ transition metal (niobium) to investigate the properties of a 5$f$-4$d$ electron 166 system. UNb$_6$Sn$_6$ crystallizes in the hexagonal $P$6/$mmm$ space group with a small degree of disorder due to shifts in the size of the CoSn-like cages along the $c$ axis. Upon cooling at zero magnetic field, the material undergoes two magnetic phase transitions at $T_\mathrm{2}$ = 46 K and $T_\mathrm{N}$ = 43 K. The low-temperature, zero-field phase is an antiferromagnet with ordered uranium moments and a $\textbf{k}$=(0,0,1/2) propagation vector determined by neutron diffraction. Remarkably, with a magnetic field applied along the $c$ axis, five additional magnetic transitions occur, evidenced by magnetization and resistivity data, before the moment saturates at 2.62 ${\mu}_{\mathrm{B}}$/U at 2 K and $\ge$13.6 T. In two magnetic phase regions, the Hall resistivity of UNb$_6$Sn$_6$ significantly deviates from the magnetization, suggesting that the phases have a large Berry curvature or a change in the Fermi surface. The unknown magnetic ordering of the field-dependent phases of UNb$_6$Sn$_6$ demonstrates the complexity of the 5$f$-4$d$ 166 system and encourages further study of its properties.

Title: Tunable Magnon Polaritons via Eddy-Current-Induced Dissipation in Metallic-Banded YIG Spheres
Authors: Tatsushi Uno, Shugo Yoshii, Sotaro Mae, Ei Shigematsu, Ryo Ohshima, Yuichiro Ando, Masashi Shiraishi
Abstract: We demonstrate a robust method to dynamically tune magnon dissipation in yttrium iron garnet spheres by equipping a metallic band around the sphere's equator, enabling precise control over magnon-photon coupling states. The collective magnetization dynamics in the YIG sphere induce circular eddy currents in the metallic band, whose magnitude can be systematically varied by adjusting the angle between the metallic band plane and an external static magnetic field. This angular dependence yields a pronounced modulation of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth, facilitating seamless transitions between the Purcell and strong coupling regimes without altering photon cavity parameters. Systematic FMR and cavity spectroscopy measurements confirm that eddy-current-induced losses govern the primary mechanism behind the observed tunable damping. By achieving extensive periodic-angular dependence of magnon relaxation rate, we precisely control the magnon-photon coupling state, approaching the critical coupling condition. These results establish the YIG-metallic-band platform as a versatile and practical approach for engineering tunable magnon-polariton systems and advancing magnonic applications, including those exploring non-Hermitian magnonics.

Title: Insights into Nb2C and Nb2CO2 as high-performance anodes for sodium- and lithium-ion batteries: An ab initio investigation
Authors: Nishat Sultana, Abdullah A. Amin, Eric J. Payton, Woo Kyun Kim
Abstract: In this study, we employ first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the electrochemical properties of Nb2C and Nb2CO2 MXenes as potential anode materials for sodium-ion (SIBs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Our findings reveal that Li and Na intercalation primarily modifies the electronic properties of Nb2C without inducing significant structural distortions, as indicated by Raman intensity variations. Adsorption energy calculations show that the T4 and H3 sites are the most favorable for metal intercalation, with Nb2CO2 exhibiting stronger adsorption due to oxygen functionalization. We find that Nb2C offers lower diffusion barriers, especially for Na ions, making it a promising candidate for fast-charging SIBs. In contrast, Nb2CO2 enhances charge retention through stronger electrostatic interactions but introduces higher migration resistance. Electronic structure analysis confirms the metallic nature of both MXenes, ensuring efficient electron transport. Open-circuit voltage (OCV) calculations indicate that Nb2CO2 exhibits higher OCV values than Nb2C, highlighting the role of surface functionalization in tuning electrochemical performance. Our study suggests that, while Li-based systems achieve slightly higher theoretical capacities, Na-based systems exhibit comparable performance, reinforcing the viability of sodium-ion batteries as a cost-effective alternative. Overall, our results demonstrate that Nb2C is better suited for rapid ion transport, whereas Nb2CO2 offers enhanced charge retention. These insights provide a foundation for the optimization of MXene-based electrodes for next-generation high performance energy storage applications.

Title: High-Throughput Transition-State Searches in Zeolite Nanopores
Authors: Pau Ferri-Vicedo, Alexander J. Hoffman, Avni Singhal, Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli
Abstract: Zeolites are important for industrial catalytic processes involving organic molecules. Understanding molecular reaction mechanisms within the confined nanoporous environment can guide the selection of pore topologies, material compositions, and process conditions to maximize activity and selectivity. However, experimental mechanistic studies are time- and resource-intensive, and traditional molecular simulations rely heavily on expert intuition and hand manipulation of chemical structures, resulting in poor scalability. Here, we present an automated computational pipeline for locating transition states (TS) in nanopores and exploring reaction energy landscapes of complex organic transformations in pores. Starting from the molecular structure of potential reactant and products, the Pore Transition State finder (PoTS) locates gas-phase transition states using DFT, docks them in favorable orientations near active sites in nanopores, and leverages the gas-phase reaction mode to seed condensed-phase DFT calculations using the dimer method. The approach sidesteps tedious manipulations, increases the success rate of TS searches, and eliminates the need for long path-following calculations. This work presents the largest ensemble of zeolite-confined transition states computed at the DFT level to date, enabling rigorous analysis of mechanistic trends across frameworks, reactions, and reactant types. We demonstrate the applicability of PoTS by analyzing 644 individual reaction steps for transalkylation of diethylbenzene in BOG, IWV, UTL and FAU zeolites, and in skeletal isomerization of 162 individual reaction steps in BEA, FER, FAU, MFI and MOR zeolites finding good experimental agreement in both cases. Lastly, we propose a path to address the limitations we observe regarding unsuccessful TS searches and insufficient theory in other reactions, like alkene cracking.

Title: Spectral signatures of residual electron pairing in the extended-Hubbard-Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model
Authors: Debshikha Banerjee, Alberto Nocera, George A. Sawatzky, Mona Berciu, Steven Johnston
Abstract: We study the electron addition spectrum of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard-Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (HSSH) model in the dilute limit using the density matrix renormalization group method. In addition to the expected renormalization to the band structure, we find that the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction produces an anomalous spectral feature when electrons are added in the singlet channel but which is absent in the triplet channel. By comparing these results with those obtained from perturbation theory in the antiadiabatic limit, we demonstrate that this anomalous feature is a remnant of the strong electron-electron interaction mediated by the SSH coupling previously derived in the two-particle limit. By studying the evolution of this feature as a function of doping, we track the fate of this attraction to higher carrier concentrations and provide predictions for the spectral features to help guide future searches for strong e-ph mediated pairing.

Title: Worm-like emulsion droplets
Authors: Jatin Abacousnac, Wenjun Chen, Jasna Brujic, David G. Grier
Abstract: Forming an interface between immiscible fluids incurs a free-energy cost that usually favors minimizing the interfacial area. An emulsion droplet of fixed volume therefore tends to form a sphere, and pairs of droplets tend to coalesce. Surfactant molecules adsorbed to the droplets' surfaces stabilize emulsions by providing a kinetic barrier to coalescence. Here, we show that the bound surfactants' osmotic pressure also competes with the droplet's intrinsic surface tension and can reverse the sign of the overall surface free energy. The onset of negative surface tension favors maximizing surface area and therefore favors elongation into a worm-like morphology. Analyzing this system in the Gibbs grand canonical ensemble reveals a phase transition between spherical and worm-like emulsions that is governed by the chemical potential of surfactant molecules in solution. Predictions based on this model agree with the observed behavior of an experimental model system composed of lipid-stabilized silicone oil droplets in an aqueous surfactant solution.

Title: Density-driven segregation of binary granular mixtures in a vertically vibrating drum the role of filling fraction
Authors: Anghao Li, Zaizheng Wang, Haoyu Shi, Min Sun, Decai Huang
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of filling fraction on segregation patterns of binary granular mixtures in a vertically vibrating drum through experiments and simulations. Glass and stainless steel spherical grains, which differ in mass density, are used to form density-driven segregation. The results reveal four segregation patterns, including the Brazil-nut-effect (BNE) segregation, counterclockwise two-eye-like segregation, dumpling-like segregation, and clockwise two-eye-like segregation. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that grains predominantly exhibit counterclockwise convection at low filling fractions, while clockwise convection dominates at high filling fractions. The competition between buoyancy and convection forces determines the final stable segregation pattern. These findings provide valuable insights into controlling segregation in granular systems, which is crucial for optimizing industrial processes in fields such as pharmaceuticals and chemical engineering.

Title: Revisiting the Contact Model with Diffusion Beyond the Conventional Methods
Authors: Roberto da Silva, Eliseu Venites Filho, Henrique Almeida Fernandes, Paulo F. Gomes
Abstract: The contact process is a non-equilibrium Hamiltonian model that, even in one dimension, lacks an exact solution and has been extensively studied via Monte Carlo simulations, both in steady-state and time-dependent scenarios. Although the effects of particle mobility/diffusion on criticality have been preliminarily investigated, they remain incompletely understood. In this work, we examine how the critical rate of the model varies with the probability of particle mobility. By analyzing different stochastic evolutions of the system, we employ two modern approaches: 1) Random Matrix Theory (RMT): By building on the success of RMT, particularly Wishart-like matrices, in studying statistical physics of systems with up-down symmetry via magnetization dynamics [R. da Silva, IJMPC 2022], we demonstrate its applicability to models with an absorbing state. 2) Optimized Temporal Power Laws: By using short-time dynamics, we optimize power laws derived from ensemble-averaged evolutions of the system. Both methods consistently reveal that the critical rate decays with mobility according to a simple Belehradek function. Additionally, a straightforward mean-field analysis supports the decay of the critical parameter with mobility, although it predicts a simpler linear dependence.

Title: Controllable and Non-Dissipative Inertial Dynamics of Skyrmion in a Bosonic Platform

Abstract: It has been understood in the past a decade or two that the dynamics of spin or magnetization in ultrafast regime necessarily involves inertial term that reflects the reluctance to follow abrupt or sudden change in the spin or magnetization orientation. The role of inertial spin dynamics in governing the motion of Skyrmion, a topological spin texture, is elucidated. Using nonequilibrium Green's function Keldysh formalism, an equation of motion is derived in terms of collective coordinates for a Skyrmion coupled via a ''minimal coupling'' to a bath of harmonic oscillators of frequency $\omega$. A deterministic and non-dissipative dynamics equation of motion is obtained with an explicit mass term for the Skyrmion emerging due the coupling, even within rigid Skyrmion picture. This results in a cyclotronic motion of Skyrmion, with a frequency that can go ultrafast, depending on that of the oscillator. Controlling the oscillator frequency can therefore guide the Skyrmion dynamics. Our theory bridges inertial dynamics and topology in magnetism and opens a pathway to ultrafast control of topological spin textures.

Title: Quantum thermocouples: nonlocal conversion and control of heat in semiconductor nanostructures
Authors: José Balduque, Rafael Sánchez
Abstract: Nanoscale conductors are interesting for thermoelectrics because of their particular spectral features connecting separated heat and particle currents. Multiterminal devices in the quantum regime benefit from phase-coherent phenomena, which turns the thermoelectric effect nonlocal, and from tunable single-particle interactions. This way one can define quantum thermocouples which convert an injected heat current into useful power in an isothermal conductor, or work as refrigerators. Additionally, efficient heat management devices can be defined. We review recent theoretical and experimental progress in the research of multiterminal thermal and thermoelectric quantum transport leading to proposals of autonomous quantum heat engines and thermal devices.

Title: Research on the Crystal Growth, Band Structure and Luminescence Mechanism of (CH3NH3)2HgI4
Authors: Linlin Liu, Zuanquan Chen, Wensi Yang, Sen Zhang, Jiaqi Zhu
Abstract: Nuclear radiation detectors play a crucial role in fields such as nuclear safety and medical imaging. The core of their performance lies in the selection of detection materials. Semiconductor detectors have become a hot topic in current research due to their advantages such as small size, good energy resolution, and high detection efficiency. As one of the most promising materials for fabricating room - temperature nuclear radiation semiconductor detectors, HgI2 exhibits excellent detection performance due to its high atomic number, large band gap, strong ray - stopping power, and high volume dark resistivity. However, issues such as poor chemical stability and low vacancy mobility of HgI2 limit its development. Therefore, researchers have carried out inorganic doping/organic hybridization on it. By introducing the organic ligand CH3NH3I, the synthesis of organic - inorganic hybrid compounds based on HgI2 is expected to significantly improve the stability of HgI2. Research on organic - inorganic hybrid metal halide crystals shows that this material has great application potential in the field of luminescent materials.

Title: Tunable Molecular Interactions Near an Atomic Feshbach Resonance: Stability and Collapse of a Molecular Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Zhiqiang Wang, Ke Wang, Zhendong Zhang, Qijin Chen, Cheng Chin, K. Levin
Abstract: Understanding and controlling interactions of ultracold molecules has been a central goal in quantum chemistry research. Recent experiments on atoms near a Feshbach resonance offer the key to prepare and investigate molecules in the quantum many-body regime. Just as Feshbach resonances allow tuning of the scattering length of bosonic atoms, we show that they also modify the scattering length of Feshbach molecules which are constituted from these atoms. Based on calculations of the compressibility, we determine the stability phase diagrams of molecular condensates and show that their instability can be associated with a sign change of the inter-molecular interactions. We derive universal expressions for the molecular scattering lengths, presented in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. These will enable control of interactions between Feshbach molecules as well as further studies of few- and many-body reactions involving Feshbach molecules in the quantum regime.

Title: Unsupervised learning of non-Abelian multi-gap topological phases
Authors: Xiangxu He, Ruo-Yang Zhang, Xiaohan Cui, Lei Zhang, C. T. Chan
Abstract: Recent experiments have successfully realized multi-band non-Abelian topological insulators with parity-time symmetry. Their topological classification transcends the conventional ten-fold classification, necessitating the use of non-Abelian groups, manifesting novel properties that cannot be described using integer topological invariants. The unique non-commutative multiplication of non-Abelian groups, along with the distinct topological classifications in the context of homotopy with or without a fixed base point, makes the identification of different non-Abelian topological phases more nuanced and challenging than in the Abelian case. In this work, we present an unsupervised learning method based on diffusion maps to classify non-Abelian multi-gap topological phases. The automatic adiabatic pathfinding process in our method can correctly sort the samples in the same phase even though they are not connected by adiabatic paths in the sample set. Most importantly, our method can deduce the multiplication table of the non-Abelian topological charges in a data-driven manner without requiring \textit{a priori} knowledge. Additionally, our algorithm can provide the correct classifications for the samples within both the homotopy with and without a fixed base point. Our results provide insights for future studies on non-Abelian phase studies using machine learning approaches.

Title: Macroscopic fluctuation theory of correlations in hard rod gas
Authors: Anupam Kundu
Abstract: Recently, a theoretical framework known as ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory has been developed to study large-scale fluctuations and correlations in many-body systems exhibiting ballistic transport. In this paper, we review this theory in the context of a one-dimensional gas of hard rods. The initial configurations of the rods are sampled from a probability distribution characterized by slowly varying conserved density profiles across space. Beginning from a microscopic description, we first formulate the macroscopic fluctuation theory in terms of the phase-space density of quasiparticles. In the second part, we apply this framework to compute the two-point, two-time correlation functions of the conserved densities in the Euler scaling limit. We derive an explicit expression for the correlation function, which not only reveals its inherent symmetries but is also straightforward to evaluate numerically for a given initial state. Our results also recover known expressions for space-time correlations in equilibrium for the hard rod gas.

Title: Discovery of a Robust Non-Janus Hybrid MoSH Monolayer as a Two-Gap Superconductor via High-Throughput Computational Screening
Authors: Zhijing Huang, Hongmei Xie, Zhibin Gao, Longyuzhi Xu, Lin Zhang, Li Yang, Zonglin Gu, Shuming Zeng
Abstract: The atomic-scale determination of hydrogen positions in MoSH monolayers remains experimentally challenging, and existing studies are confined to Janus-type configurations. Here, we combine high-throughput structural screening with first-principles calculations to predict a novel non-Janus Hybrid 1T$^{'}$-MoSH monolayer, which energetically surpasses all previously reported MoSH phases with a binding energy of -3.02 eV. This structure emerges as a hybrid of MoS$_2$ and MoH$_2$, featuring alternating S and H atoms on both sides of the Mo layer. Comprehensive stability analyses confirm its robustness in energy, mechanics, dynamics, and thermodynamics (stable up to 1600 K). Remarkably, anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg theory predicts Hybrid 1T$^{'}$-MoSH as a two-gap superconductor with a critical temperature T$_c$ of 16.34 K, driven by strong electron-phonon coupling ($\lambda$$=$1.39). Substituting Mo with Hf, Ta, or Ti drastically suppresses T$_c$ $\sim$ (0.53-2.42 K), highlighting Mo$^{'}$s unique role in enhancing superconductivity. Our work not only expands the family of 2D transition metal chalcogenides but also proposes a promising candidate for quantum technologies, bridging theoretical design to functional material discovery.

Title: Strain-induced polarization rotation in freestanding ferroelectric oxide membranes
Authors: Alban Degezelle, Razvan Burcea, Pascale Gemeiner, Maxime Vallet, Brahim Dkhil, Stéphane Fusil, Vincent Garcia, Sylvia Matzen, Philippe Lecoeur, Thomas Maroutian
Abstract: Freestanding ferroelectric membranes have emerged as a versatile tool for strain engineering, enabling the exploration of ferroelectric properties beyond traditional epitaxy. The resulting ferroelectric domain patterns stem from the balance at the local scale of several effects playing a key role, i.e. piezoelectricity linked to strain, and flexoelectricity arising from strain gradients. To weight their respective contributions for a given membrane geometry, the strain profile has to be mapped with respect to the ferroelectric polarization landscape, a necessary step to allow for a controlled tailoring of the latter. In this study, we examine the effect of bending strain on a Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 membrane in a fold-like structure, observing a polarization rotation from out-of-plane to in-plane at the fold apex. Combining piezoresponse force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy, we map the ferroelectric polarization direction relative to the height profile of the membrane, and discuss the contributions of strain and strain gradients for this archetypal fold geometry. Our findings offer new insights into strain-engineered polarization configurations, and emphasize strain effects at the nanoscale to tune the functional properties in freestanding membranes.

Title: Design of altermagnetic models from spin clusters
Authors: Xingchuan Zhu, Xingmin Huo, Shiping Feng, Song-Bo Zhang, Shengyuan A. Yang, Huaiming Guo
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new class of collinear compensated magnetic phase, has garnered tremendous interest because of its rich physics and promising applications. Physical models and verified material candidates for altermagnetism remain limited. Here, we propose a general scheme to construct altermagnetic models, which explicitly exhibits the blend of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations in real space via the design of spin clusters, echoing the observation that properties of altermagnets resemble a mixture of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We show that in some of our models, the desired altermagnetic order can be spontaneously realized by electron-electron interaction in a broad range of the phase diagram. This development facilitates the study of fascinating physics of altermagnetism and sheds light on the discovery of new altermagnetic materials.

Title: Vortices in Tunable Dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates with Attractive Interactions
Authors: S. Sabari, R. Sasireka, R. Radha, A. Uthayakumar, L. Tomio
Abstract: We investigate the formation of vortices in quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) through the interplay between two-body contact and long-ranged dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs), as both interactions can be tuned from repulsive to attractive. By solving the associated Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a rotating system, our initial approach concentrates on stabilizing a collapsing condensate with attractive s-wave two-body interactions by employing sufficiently large repulsive DDIs. Subsequently, the same procedure was applied after reversing the signs of both interactions to evaluate the sensitivity of vortex formation to such an interchange of interactions. As a reference to guide our investigation, valid for generic dipolar atomic species, we have assumed a condensate with the strong dipolar dysprosium isotope, 164Dy. The correlation of the results with other dipolar BEC systems was exemplified by considering rotating BECs with two other isotopes, namely 168Er and 52Cr. For a purely dipolar condensate (with zero contact interactions) under fixed rotation, we demonstrate how the number of visible vortices increases as the DDI becomes more repulsive, accomplished by tuning the orientation of the dipoles through a characteristic angle parameter.

Title: Directional driving of vortex lines with oscillating magnetic field
Authors: A. E. Koshelev
Abstract: The possibility of driving vortex lines with an oscillating magnetic field could be useful in many applications. For example, it can be used for the removal of undesired trapped flux from contactless elements of superconducting devices. We investigate the dynamics of vortex lines in a superconducting film with a ratchet thickness profile driven by an oscillating magnetic field applied parallel to the film. We numerically simulate the dynamics of a single flux line modeled as an elastic string with a variable length. We explore the behavior for different frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field and find several dynamic regimes. For moderate frequencies, the average velocity is finite only within specific amplitude ranges. A notable feature is the presence of extended velocity plateaus, which correspond to regimes when the line moves by integer multiples of the spatial period $w$ during integer multiples of the time period $T$. The transitions to these plateau states are rather steep, especially at low frequencies. The plateau at velocity $w/T$ dominates at intermediate frequencies but vanishes at high frequencies. The onset field amplitude of finite velocity nonmonotonically depends on the frequency and passes through a minimum at a certain frequency value. At low frequencies, the velocity exceeds $w/T$ and progressively increases with the amplitude. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of vortex lines driven by oscillating magnetic field in patterned superconducting films, offering potential pathways for controlling the magnetic flux in superconducting devices.

Title: Multi-band fractional Thouless pumps
Authors: Marius Jürgensen, Jacob Steiner, Gil Refael, Mikael C. Rechtsman
Abstract: Quantization of particle transport lies at the heart of topological physics. In Thouless pumps - dimensionally reduced versions of the integer quantum Hall effect - quantization is dictated by the integer winding of single-band Wannier states. Here, we show that repulsive interactions can drive a transition from an integer- to a fractional-quantized Thouless pump (at fixed integer filling) by stabilizing a crystal of multi-band Wannier states, each with fractional winding. We numerically illustrate the concept in few-particle systems, and show that a dynamical Hartree-Fock ansatz can quantitatively reproduce the pumping phase diagram.

Title: Two-dimensional Indium Oxide at the Epitaxial Graphene/SiC Interface: Synthesis, Structure, Properties, and Devices

Auker, Ke Wang, Mehmet Z. Baykara, Vincent Meunier, Nabil Bassim, Adri C.T. van Duin, Vincent H. Crespi, Joshua A. Robinson
Abstract: High-quality two-dimensional (2D) dielectrics are crucial for fabricating 2D/3D hybrid vertical electronic devices such as metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) based Schottky diodes and hot electron transistors, the production of which is constrained by the scarcity of bulk layered wide bandgap semiconductors. In this research, we present the synthesis of a new 2D dielectric, monolayer InO2, which differs in stoichiometry from its bulk form, over a large area (>300 um2) by intercalating at the epitaxial graphene (EG)/SiC interface. By adjusting the lateral size of graphene through optical lithography prior to the intercalation, we tune the thickness of InO2 where predominantly (~85%) monolayer InO2 is formed. The preference for monolayer formation of InO2 is explained using ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, the band gap of InO2 is calculated to be 4.1 eV, differing from its bulk form (2.7 eV). Furthermore, MOS-based Schottky diode measurements on InO2 intercalated EG/n-SiC demonstrate that the EG/n-SiC junction transforms from ohmic to a Schottky junction upon intercalation, with a barrier height of 0.87 eV and a rectification ratio of ~10^5. These findings introduce a new addition to the 2D dielectric family, showing significant potential for monolayer InO2 to be used as a barrier in vertical electronic devices.

Title: Stability diagram of layer-polarized quantum Hall states in twisted trilayer graphene
Authors: Konstantin Davydov, Daochen Long, Jack Alexander Tavakley, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ke Wang
Abstract: In the twisted trilayer graphene (tTLG) platform, the rich beating patterns between the three graphene layers give rise to a plethora of new length scales and reconstructed electronic bands arising from the emergent moiré and moiré-of-moiré superlattices. The co-existing lattices and superlattices interact and compete with each other to determine the overall transport properties of tTLG, the hierarchy of which can be electrostatically controlled by tuning the out-of-plane charge distribution or layer polarization. In this work, we measure the stability diagram of layer-polarized quantum Hall states in tTLG by systematically mapping out layer-specific Chern numbers in each layer, and intra- and interlayer Chern transitions as a function of displacement field D and total carrier density n. In contrast to twisted bilayer systems, the rich interplay between the three atomic layers gives rise to a complex layer-polarized stability diagram with unconventional transport features that evolve rapidly with electric and magnetic fields. The stability diagram quantitatively characterizes the interlayer screening and charge distribution in tTLG with implication of strong inter-atomic-layer Coulomb coupling. Our work provides comprehensive guidance and insights into predicting and controlling layer-polarization and interlayer transitions in tTLG, and for tuning the individual role and interactions of each participating constituent towards novel material properties.

Title: Magnetic Interactions between Nanoscale Domains in Correlated Liquids
Authors: Mohammadhasan Dinpajooh, Giovanna Ricchiuti, Andrew J. Ritchhart, Tao E. Li, Elias Nakouzi, Sebastian T. Mergelsberg, Venkateshkumar Prabhakaran, Jaehun Chun, Maria L. Sushko
Abstract: The formation of nanoscale domains (NDs) in correlated liquids and the emerging collective magnetic properties have been suggested as key mechanisms governing ion transport under external magnetic fields (eMFs). However, the molecular-level understanding of these magnetic field-driven phenomena and the interaction between these domains remain elusive. To this end, we introduce a simplified model of a solvated nanoparticle (NP) that consists of localized magnetic domains at their surfaces to represent groups of paramagnetic ions, forming NDs, whose effective magnetic dipole moments are at least one order of magnitude greater than the individual ions. We use classical density functional theory (cDFT) to estimate the effective interactions between these localized magnetic NPs (LMNPs). Our findings indicate that, unlike individual ions, magnetic dipole interactions of NDs in the LMNP model can indeed compete with the electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydration interactions. Depending on the direction of eMF, the cDFT effective interactions between two LMNPs turn out to become more attractive or repulsive, which may play a critical role in ion separation and nucleation processes. This indicates that the cDFT interaction barrier heights can be significantly affected by the magnetic dipole interactions and the barrier heights tend to increase as the size of LMNPs increases.

Title: Probing Spin Defects via Single Spin Relaxometry
Authors: Alex L. Melendez, Peter Groszkowski, Yueh-Chun Wu, Steven Randolph, Sujoy Ghosh, Liangbo Liang, Stephen Jesse, An-Ping Li, Joshua T. Damron, Yan Wang, Benjamin J. Lawrie, Ivan V. Vlassiouk, Huan Zhao
Abstract: Spin defects in solids offer promising platforms for quantum sensing and memory due to their long coherence times and compatibility with quantum networks. Here, we integrate a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond with scanning probe microscopy to discover, read out, and spatially map arbitrary spin-based quantum sensors at the nanoscale. Using the boron vacancy (V$_B^-$) center in hexagonal boron nitride$\unicode{x2013}$an emerging two-dimensional spin system$\unicode{x2013}$as a model, we detect its electron spin resonance through changes in the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) of a nearby NV center, without requiring direct optical excitation or readout of the V$_B^-$ fluorescence. Cross-relaxation between the NV and V$_B^-$ ensembles results in a pronounced NV $T_1$ reduction, enabling nanoscale mapping of spin defect distributions beyond the optical diffraction limit. This approach highlights NV centers as versatile quantum probes for characterizing spin systems, including those emitting at wavelengths beyond the range of silicon-based detectors. Our results open a pathway to hybrid quantum architectures where sensing and readout qubits are decoupled, facilitating the discovery of otherwise inaccessible quantum defects for advanced sensing and quantum networking.

Title: Strong altermagnetism and topological features in a two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure via broken time reversal symmetry
Authors: Anil Kumar Singh, Pritam Deb
Abstract: The advent of altermagnetism, a new phase of magnetism, has garnered significant interest due to its extraordinary spin-polarized electronic bands despite zero net magnetization. Such spin-symmetry-guided robust non-relativistic alternating spin splitting in a compensated collinear magnet presents a novel platform for magnetotransport and nontrivial topology. Predominantly, altermagnetic behavior is observed in bulk magnetic materials upon incorporating external perturbations. However, van der Waals heterostructures can offer exceptional flexibility in tailoring their various emerging properties without the need for external perturbations in the two-dimensional regime. Here, an unconventional time reversal symmetry breaking with sizeable spin splitting via broken space-spin symmetry (\textit{P$\mathcal{T}$}) has been demonstrated in an antiferromagnet/nonmagnet vdW heterostructure. The lifted Kramer's degeneracy alongwith spin-orbit interactions result in non-zero Berry curvature, contributing to the outstanding magnetotransport with a large value of anomalous Hall conductivity ($\sim 732.9\ {\mathit{\Omega}}^{-1}{cm}^{-1}$). The presence of relativistic spin-orbit interactions in addition to predominant non-relativistic effects governed spin-momentum locking with a weak out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which induces small spin canting. Further, the lowest magnetic anisotropy energy confirms collinear antiferromagnetic ground state. In particular, a nontrivial topology is observed along the surface [001], which is confirmed by the non-zero Chern number. This study provides a novel approach to realize strong altermagnetism in broken space-spin symmetry systems and fosters emergent transport behaviors.

Title: Photocurrent Nanoscopy of Quantum Hall Bulk

Abstract: Understanding nanoscale electronic and thermal transport of two-dimensional (2D) electron systems in the quantum Hall regime, particularly in the bulk insulating state, poses considerable challenges. One of the primary difficulties arises from the presence of chiral edge channels, whose transport behavior obscures the investigation of the insulating bulk. Using near-field (NF) optical and photocurrent (PC) nanoscopy, we probe real-space variations of the optical and thermal dynamics of graphene in the quantum Hall regime without relying on complex sample or electrode geometries. Near the charge neutrality point (CNP), we detect strong optical and photothermal signals from resonant inter-Landau level (LL) magnetoexciton excitations between the 0th and +-1st LLs, which gradually weaken with increasing doping due to Pauli blocking. Interestingly, at higher doping levels and full integer LL fillings, photothermal signals reappear across the entire sample over a ~10-micrometer scale, indicating unexpectedly long cooling lengths and nonlocal photothermal heating through the insulating bulk. This observation suggests thermal conductivity persists for the localized states even as electronic transport is suppressed - a clear violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. Our experiments provide novel insights into nanoscale thermal and electronic transport in incompressible 2D gases, highlighting the roles of magnetoexcitons and chiral edge states in the thermo-optoelectric dynamics of Dirac quantum Hall state.

Title: Luttinger compensated magnetic material LaMn2SbO6
Authors: Xiao-Yao Hou, Ze-Feng Gao, Huan-Cheng Yang, Peng-Jie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: Unconventional magnetism including altermagnetism and Luttinger compensated magnetism, characterized by its duality of real-space antiferromagnetic alignment and momentum-space spin splitting, has garnered widespread attention. While altermagnetism has been extensively studied, research on Luttinger compensated magnetism remains very rare. In particular, Luttinger com pensated magnetic materials are only theoretically predicted and have not yet been synthesized experimentally. In this study, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic struc ture calculations, we predict that LaMn2SbO6 is a Luttinger compensated magnetic semiconductor. Given that the Mn ions at opposite spin lattice cannot be connected by any symmetry, the spin splitting in LaMn2SbO6 is isotropic. More importantly, LaMn2SbO6 has already been synthesized experimentally, and its magnetic structure has been confirmed by neutron scattering experiments. Therefore, LaMn2SbO6 serves as an excellent material platform for investigating the novel physical properties of Luttinger compensated magnetic materials.

Title: Inverse ac Josephson effect in Josephson diode
Authors: Huarong Zhong, Zhi Wang
Abstract: We study the Josephson junction where nonreciprocal critical current was induced by the interplay of the $4\pi$-periodic and $2\pi$-periodic current-phase relation of the junction. We take the model of a topological junction which serves as a Josephson diode with nonreciprocal critical currents. For this Josephson diode, we demonstrate an inverse ac Josephson effect where an effective dc voltage is induced by a pure ac driving current. We show that this inverse ac Josephson effect originates from the voltage rectification by the nonreciprocal critical current of the system. We explore the dependence of the induced dc voltage on the amplitude and frequency of the ac driving current and reveal the optimized condition for the inverse ac Josephson effect.

Title: Micro Heat Engines With Hydrodynamic Flow
Authors: P. S. Pal, Sourabh Lahiri, Arnab Saha
Abstract: Hydrodynamic flows are often generated in colloidal suspensions. Since colloidal particles are frequently used to construct stochastic heat engines, we study how the hydrodynamic flows influence the output parameters of the engine. We study a single colloidal particle confined in a harmonic trap with time-periodic stiffness that provides the engine protocol, in presence of a steady linear shear flow. The nature of the flow (circular, elliptic or hyperbolic) is externally tunable. At long times, the work done by the flow field is shown to dominate over the thermodynamic (Jarzynski) work done by the trap, if there is an appreciable deviation from the circular flow. The work by the time dependent trap is the sole contributor only for a perfectly circular flow. We also study an extended model, where a microscopic spinning particle (spinor) is tethered close to the colloidal particle, i.e. the working substance of the engine, such that the flow generated by the spinor influences the dynamics of the colloidal particle. We simulate the system and explore the influence of such a flow on the thermodynamics of the engine. We further find that for larger spinning frequencies, the work done by the flow dominates and the system cannot produce thermodynamic work.

Title: Tri-component-pairing chiral superconductivity on the honeycomb lattice with mixed s- and d-wave symmetries
Authors: Yu-Hang Li, Jiarui Jiao, Xiao-Xiao Zhang, Congjun Wu, Wang Yang
Abstract: In this work, we investigate chiral topological superconductors on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with coexisting d_1- (i.e., x^2-y^2), d_2- (i.e., xy), and s-wave pairing symmetries. Using a Ginzburg-Landau free energy analysis, the pairing gap function is shown to exhibit a tri-component form s + d_1 exp(i phi_1) + d_2 exp(i phi_2), where phi_1 and phi_2 are phase differences between the d- and s-wave pairing components, which spontaneously breaks both time reversal and C_6 rotational symmetries. Chern numbers of the energy bands are calculated to be nonzero, demonstrating the topologically nontrivial nature of the system. The anomalous AC Hall conductivity is also computed, which is not invariant under C_6 rotations, reflecting the anisotropic nature of the pairing gap function.

Title: Asymmetric real topology of conduction and valence bands
Authors: J. X. Dai, Chen Zhang, Y. X. Zhao
Abstract: Previously, it was believed that conduction and valence bands exhibit a symmetry: they possess opposite topological invariants (e.g., the Chern numbers of conduction and valence bands for the Chern insulator are $\pm C$). However, we present a counterexample: The second Stiefel-Whitney numbers for conduction and valence bands over the Klein bottle may be asymmetric, with one being nontrivial while the other trivial. Here, the Stiefel-Whitney classes are the characteristic classes for real Bloch functions under $PT$ symmetry with $(PT)^2=1$, and the Klein bottle is the momentum-space unit under the projective anti-commutation relation of the mirror reflection reversing $x$ and the translation along the $y$-direction. The asymmetry originates from the algebraic difference of real cohomology classes over Klein bottle and torus. This discovery is rooted in the fundation of topological band theory, and has the potential to fundamentally refresh our current understanding of topological phases.

Title: Effects resulting from magnetic interactions in low-dimensional systems
Authors: José Holanda
Abstract: This research delves into the critical effects of magnetic interactions in low-dimensional systems, offering invaluable insights that deepen our comprehension of magnetic behavior at the nanoscale. By implementing this innovative approach, one can unequivocally identify two distinct magnetic states: demagnetizing and magnetizing. The resulting measurements significantly enhance our grasp of the magnetic dynamics within these nanostructures, paving the way for spin-wave excitations. To validate the effectiveness of this methodology, it was conducted rigorous numerical simulations on a diverse array of nanostructures, including one-dimensional nanowires and three-dimensional hexagonal arrays of nanowires. Each nanowire is precisely modeled as a chain of interacting ellipsoidal grains, illustrating the intricate nature of these magnetic interactions.

Title: Reentrant localization transition induced by a composite potential
Authors: Xingbo Wei
Abstract: We numerically investigate the localization transition in a one-dimensional system subjected to a composite potential consisting of periodic and quasi-periodic components. For the rational wave vector $\alpha=1/2$, the periodic component reduces to a staggered potential, which has been reported to induce the reentrant localization transition. In addition to $\alpha=1/2$, we find that other rational wave vectors can also lead to the reentrant phenomenon. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the reentrant localization transition, we vary the parameters of the composite potential and find that the reentrant localization transition is sensitive to the phase factor of the periodic component. By further studying the structure of the periodic component, we confirm that this sensitivity arises from the periodic phase factor modulating the mirror symmetry. Finally, we map out a global phase diagram and reveal that the reentrant localization transition originates from a paradoxical effect: increasing the amplitude of the periodic component enhances localization but simultaneously strengthens the mirror symmetry, which favors the formation of extended states. Our numerical analysis suggests that the interplay between these competing factors drives the reentrant localization transition.

Title: Electron Transport in Compacted Powders of VO2 Nanoparticles: Variable Range Hopping vs Percolation Behavior
Authors: E. Yu. Beliayev, Yogendra Kumar Mishra, Horst-Gunter Rubahn, I. A. Chichibaba, I. G. Mirzoiev, V. A. Horielyi, A. V. Terekhov
Abstract: Electron transport properties in compacted VO2 nanopowders were studied. While VO2 usually exhibits a first-order metal-insulator transition (MIT) at ~340K, in our compressed nanopowder samples the MIT was significantly broadened due to structural disorder, interparticle barriers, and phase coexistence. Resistivity measurements in the temperature range of 78 - 682 K initially suggested a variable range hopping (VRH) transport mechanism, but further analysis indicates that the observed temperature dependence is governed by percolative conductivity, modified by activation-assisted tunneling effects. Suppression of the expected resistance jump at the MIT is attributed to dynamic intergranular barrier restructuring, residual localized states, and percolative electron transport. These findings highlight the necessity of considering percolation effects when analyzing transport mechanisms in granular VO2-based systems.

Title: Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors
Authors: S. I. Mukhin
Abstract: Proposed recently by the author Q-ball mechanism of the pseudogap state and high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates (2022) was supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ (2023). In the present paper it is demonstrated that T-linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity arises naturally in the Q-ball gas phase, that may explain corresponding experimental data in the "strange metal" phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates, as reviewed by Barisic et al. (2013). In the present theory it arises due to scattering of electrons on the Q-balls gas of condensed charge/spin fluctuations. Close to the lowest temperature boundary of the "strange metal" phase, at which Q-ball radius diverges, electrical resistivity caused by a slide of the Q-balls as a whole is calculated using fluctuation paraconductivity calculation method by Alex Abrikosov (1987). The diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas is calculated as well and shows good accord with experimental data by this http URL et al. (2010) in the "strange metal" phase. In total, obtained results demonstrate different properties of the correlated electrons systems that arise due to formation of Q-balls possessing internal bosonic frequency $\Omega=2\pi nT$ in Matsubara time and, thus, forming the quantum thermodynamic time polycrystals. Presented theory may give a clue concerning a possible mechanism of the experimentally measured properties of high-T$_c$ cuprates in the "strange metal" phase of their phase diagram. We believe , these results provide support to the quantum thermodynamic time crystal model of the Euclidean Q-balls considered in the present paper.

Title: Evolution of a single spin in ideal Bose gas at finite temperatures
Authors: O. Hryhorchak, G. Panochko, V. Pastukhov
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature dynamics of non-interacting bosons with a single static spinful impurity immersed. A non-zero contact boson-impurity pairwise interaction is assumed only for the spin-up impurity state. By tracing out bosonic degrees of freedom, the exact time evolution of the impurity spin is calculated for pure and mixed initial ensembles of states. The time-dependent momentum distribution of bosons initially created in the Bose condensed state and driven by the interaction with spin is analyzed.

Title: Organic-Inorganic Polaritonics: Linking Frenkel and Wannier-Mott Excitons
Authors: V. G. M. Duarte, A. J. Chaves, N. M. R. Peres
Abstract: In recent years, organic materials have emerged as promising candidates for a variety of light-harvesting applications ranging from the infrared to the visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Their enhanced excitonic binding energies and large transition dipole moments enable strong coupling with light, with some systems already reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime. In contrast, a wide range of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been extensively explored in the literature, exhibiting high exciton stability and strong electron-hole coupling due to reduced screening effects. In this Letter, we present a microscopic model describing the interaction of 2D materials and organic molecular aggregates in an optical cavity. We predict the formation of a hybrid Wannier-Mott-Frenkel exciton-polariton with an enhanced Rabi splitting, exceeding that of the pure organic cavity by several tens of meV. To elucidate this phenomenon, we examine a cavity with 2D tungsten sulfide and a cyanine dye, where this enhancement corresponds to a $5\%$ increase relative to the organic cavity. The complementary characteristics of Wannier-Mott and Frenkel excitons enable the formation of tunable polariton states that merge into a single hybrid state as a function of detuning, allowing for dual Rabi splitting mechanisms. This provides a promising platform for exploring quantum optical phenomena in both the strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes.

Title: Multiphysics analysis of acoustically actuated nanospherical antennas embedded in polymer/metal medium with magneto-electro-elastic surface/interface effects
Authors: Mohsen Farsiani, Hossein M. Shodja
Abstract: A precise analytical treatment for predicting the behavior of nano-sized magneto-electro-elastic (MEE) antennas and resonators under incident acoustic waves requires consideration of multiphysics surface/interface effects, including magnetization, polarization, and elasticity. No analytical solutions to date have incorporated all three phenomena simultaneously. This work presents a rigorous mathematical analysis of a nano-sized spherically isotropic embedded MEE spherical shell subjected to acoustic waves. The study distinguishes between the coupled spectral constitutive relations for the bulk of the MEE shell and those for its free inner surface and matrix-shell interface. The surrounding matrix may be isotropic dielectric or metallic. Conventional electrodynamics theories do not address MEE effects at the surface or interface. To overcome this, the equivalent impedance matrix (EIM) method combined with surface/interface elasticity is used to model the MEE behaviors. For metallic matrices, a plasmonics-based framework with optical properties described by the plasma model captures metallic behavior. The spectral EIM method, along with vector and tensor spherical harmonics, solves the coupled elastodynamics and Maxwell's equations. This approach enables the exploration of surface/interface characteristic lengths, revealing size-dependent effects on electromagnetic radiated power and resonance frequency. The findings provide insights into the behavior of acoustically actuated nanospherical antennas, sensors, and resonators, with implications for the design of nanoscale devices in advanced technological applications.

Title: Impact of network assortativity on disease lifetime in the SIS model of epidemics
Authors: Elad Korngut, Michael Assaf
Abstract: To accurately represent disease spread, epidemiological models must account for the complex network topology and contact heterogeneity. Traditionally, most studies have used random heterogeneous networks, which ignore correlations between the nodes' degrees. Yet, many real-world networks exhibit degree assortativity - the tendency for nodes with similar degrees to connect. Here we explore the effect degree assortativity (or disassortativity) has on long-term dynamics and disease extinction in the realm of the susceptible-infected-susceptible model on heterogeneous networks. We derive analytical results for the mean time to extinction (MTE) in assortative networks with weak heterogeneity, and show that increased assortativity reduces the MTE and that assortativity and degree heterogeneity are interchangeable with regard to their impact on the MTE. Our analytical results are verified using the weighted ensemble numerical method, on both synthetic and real-world networks. Notably, this method allows us to go beyond the capabilities of traditional numerical tools, enabling us to study rare events in large assortative networks, which were previously inaccessible.

Title: Harnessing Machine Learning for Quantum-Accurate Predictions of Non-Equilibrium Behavior in 2D Materials
Authors: Yue Zhang, Robert J. Appleton, Kui Lin, Megan J. McCarthy, Jeffrey T. Paci, Subramanian K.R.S. Sankaranarayanan, Alejandro Strachan, Horacio D. Espinosa
Abstract: Accurately predicting the non-equilibrium mechanical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials is essential for understanding their deformation, thermo-mechanical properties, and failure mechanisms. In this study, we parameterize and evaluate two machine learning (ML) interatomic potentials, SNAP and Allegro, for modeling the non-equilibrium behavior of monolayer MoSe2. Using a density functional theory (DFT) derived dataset, we systematically compare their accuracy and transferability against the physics-based Tersoff force field. Our results show that SNAP and Allegro significantly outperform Tersoff, achieving near-DFT accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Allegro surpasses SNAP in both accuracy and efficiency due to its advanced neural network architecture. Both ML potentials demonstrate strong transferability, accurately predicting out-of-sample properties such as surface stability, inversion domain formation, and fracture toughness. Unlike Tersoff, SNAP and Allegro reliably model temperature-dependent edge stabilities and phase transformation pathways, aligning closely with DFT benchmarks. Notably, their fracture toughness predictions closely match experimental measurements, reinforcing their suitability for large-scale simulations of mechanical failure in 2D materials. This study establishes ML-based force fields as a powerful alternative to traditional potentials for modeling non-equilibrium mechanical properties in 2D materials.

Title: Activity drives self-assembly of passive soft inclusions in active nematics
Authors: Ahmet Umut Akduman, Yusuf Sariyar, Giuseppe Negro, Livio Nicola Carenza
Abstract: Active nematics are out-of-equilibrium systems in which energy injection at the microscale drives emergent collective behaviors, from spontaneous flows to active turbulence. While the dynamics of these systems have been extensively studied, their potential for controlling the organization of embedded soft particles remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate how passive droplets suspended in an active nematic fluid self-organize under varying activity levels and packing fractions. Through numerical simulations, we uncover a rich phase diagram featuring dynamic clustering, activity-induced gelation, and a novel inverse motility-induced phase separation regime where activity stabilizes dense droplet assemblies. Crucially, we demonstrate that temporal modulation of activity enables precise control over structural morphological transitions. Our results suggest new routes to design adaptive smart materials with tunable microstructure and dynamics, bridging active nematics with applications in programmable colloidal assembly and bio-inspired material design.

Title: Interface-Induced Stability of Nontrivial Topological Spin Textures: Unveiling Room-Temperature Hopfions and Skyrmions
Authors: F. Katmis, V. Lauter, R. Yagan, L.S. Brandt, A.M. Cheghabouri, H. Zhou, J.W. Freeland, C.I.L. de Araujo, M.E. Jamer, D. Heiman, M.C. Onbasli, J. S. Moodera
Abstract: Topological spin configurations, such as soliton-like spin texture and Dirac electron assemblies, have emerged in recent years in both fundamental science and technological applications. Achieving stable topological spin textures at room-temperature is crucial for enabling these structures as long-range information carriers. However, their creation and manipulation processes have encountered difficulties due to multi-step field training techniques and competitive interactions. Thus, a spontaneous ground state for multi-dimensional topological spin textures is desirable, as skyrmions form swirling, hedgehog-like spin structures in two dimensions, while hopfions emerge as their twisted three-dimensional counterparts. Here, we report the first observation of robust and reproducible topological spin textures of hopfions and skyrmions observed at room temperature and in zero magnetic field, which are stabilized by geometric confinement and protected by interfacial magnetism in a ferromagnet/topological insulator/ferromagnet trilayer heterostructure. These skyrmion-hopfion configurations are directly observed at room temperature with Lorenz transmission electron microscopy. Using micromagnetic modelling, the experimental observations of hopfion-skyrmion assemblies are reproduced. Our model reveals a complete picture of how spontaneously organized skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings are controlled by surface electrons, uniaxial anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, all at ambient temperature. Our study provides evidence that topological chiral spin textures can facilitate the development of magnetically defined information carriers. These stable structures hold promise for ultralow-power and high-density information processing, paving the way for the next generation of topologically defined devices.

Koptiev, Mikhail D. Volnyanskii, Juliya M. Gudenko, Eugene A. Eliseev, Mikhail P. Trubitsyn, Anna N. Morozovska
Abstract: We revealed the resistive switching and charge accumulation effect in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method. To explain the experimental results, we analyze phase composition of the nanopowder samples annealed at temperatures from 500°C to 800°C, determined by the X-ray diffraction analysis, and relate it with the peculiarities of their electronic paramagnetic resonance spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.

Title: Optical spatial dispersion via Wannier interpolation
Authors: Andrea Urru, Ivo Souza, Óscar Pozo Ocaña, Stepan S. Tsirkin, David Vanderbilt
Abstract: We present a numerical implementation, based on Wannier interpolation, of a Kubo-Greenwood formalism for computing the spatially dispersive optical conductivity in crystals at first order in the wave vector of light. This approach is more efficient than direct $\textit{ab initio}$ methods because, with less computational cost, it allows for a much finer sampling of reciprocal space, resulting in better resolved spectra. Moreover, Wannier interpolation avoids errors arising from truncation of the sums over conduction bands when evaluating the spatially dispersive optical matrix elements. We validate our method by computing the optical activity spectrum of selected crystals, both polar (GaN) and chiral (trigonal Te, trigonal Se, and $\alpha$-quartz), and comparing with existing literature.

Title: Stiffness, strength, energy dissipation and reusability in heterogeneous architected polycrystals
Authors: Seunghwan Lee, Hansohl Cho
Abstract: We design, fabricate and test heterogeneous architected polycrystals, composed of hard plastomers and soft elastomers, which thus show outstanding mechanical resilience and energy dissipation simultaneously. Grain boundaries that separate randomly oriented single crystalline grains is carefully designed, first enabling coherent connectivity and strength in the grain boundary regions throughout the polycrystalline network. By combining experiments and numerical simulations on 3D-printed prototypes, we show that the interplay between grain interiors and grain boundaries is responsible for the grain-size effects emerging in these architected materials, analogous to those in their atomic or metallic counterparts. Furthermore, direct visualization of inter- and intra-grain deformation and failure mechanisms at the macroscopic scale reveals that crystallographic texture throughout the polycrystalline aggregates plays a fundamental role in the key mechanical features in our new heterogeneous polycrystals. Our results show that the engineered grain boundary and crystallographic texture not only modify the highly resilient yet dissipative global responses but also critically influence reusability in this new class of architected materials.

Title: Many-body localization properties of one-dimensional anisotropic spin-1/2 chains
Authors: Taotao Hu, Yuting Li, Jiameng Hong, Xiaodan Li, Dongyan Guo, Kangning Chen
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate the many-body localization (MBL) properties of one-dimensional anisotropic spin-1/2 chains by using the exact matrix diagonalization method. Starting from the Ising spin-1/2 chain, we introduce different forms of external fields and spin coupling interactions, and construct three distinct anisotropic spin-1/2 chain models. The influence of these interactions on the MBL phase transition is systematically explored. We first analyze the eigenstate properties by computing the excited-state fidelity. The results show that MBL phase transitions occur in all three models, and that both the anisotropy parameter and the finite system size significantly affect the critical disorder strength of the transition. Moreover, we calculated the bipartite entanglement entropy of the system, and the critical points determined by the intersection of curves for different system sizes are basically consistent with those obtained from the excited-state fidelity. Then, the dynamical characteristics of the systems are studied through the time evolution of diagonal entropy (DE), local magnetization, and fidelity. These observations further confirm the occurrence of the MBL phase transition and allow for a clear distinction between the ergodic (thermal) phase and the many-body localized phase. Finally, to examine the effect of additional interactions on the transition, we incorporate Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions into the three models. The results demonstrate that the MBL phase transition still occurs in the presence of DM interactions. However, the anisotropy parameter and finite system size significantly affect the critical disorder strength. Moreover, the critical behavior is somewhat suppressed, indicating that DM interactions tend to inhibit the onset of localization.

Title: Symphony of Symmetry Selective Resonances in Fe-MgO-ZnO-MgO-Fe
Authors: Sabarna Chakraborti, Arti Kashyap, Abhishek Sharma
Abstract: We propose the perspective of symmetry-selective resonance of the $\Delta_1$ states in the Fe/MgO/ZnO/MgO/Fe heterostructures, offering a broad landscape to design magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) that yield a towering tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) up to $3.5\times10^4\%$ with the resistance area (RA) product dipping down to a minimum of $0.05~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$, while maintaining a nearly perfect (99\%) spin polarization. Our predictions are based on the self-consistent coupling of the non-equilibrium Green's function with density functional theory. We also present the charge current, spin current, and TMR with applied voltage of the Fe/MgO(3-layer)/ZnO(3-layer)/MgO(3-layer)/Fe MTJ, which offers a superior performance triad of TMR ($1.3\times10^4\%$), RA ($0.45~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$), and spin polarization (99\%) over a regular Fe/MgO(6-layer)/Fe based MTJ (TMR $\approx 3.4\times10^3\%$, RA $\approx 22~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$). We provide a comprehensive insight integrating the transmission eigenchannel, spectral density, and the band structure of the Fe contacts to establish the role of symmetry-selective resonance in the Fe/MgO/ZnO/MgO/Fe MTJ.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalizations of three-dimensional stabilizer codes
Authors: Chanbeen Lee, Yaozong Hu, Gil Young Cho, Haruki Watanabe
Abstract: In this work, we generalize several three-dimensional Z2 stabilizer models--including the X-cube model, the three-dimensional toric code, and Haah's code--to their ZN counterparts. Under periodic boundary conditions, we analyze their ground state degeneracies and topological excitations, and uncover behaviors that strongly depend on system size. For the X-cube model, we identify excitations with mobility restricted under local operations but relaxed under nonlocal ones derived from global topology. These excitations, previously confined to open boundaries in the Z2 model, now appear even under periodic boundaries. In the toric code, we observe nontrivial braiding between string and point excitations despite the absence of ground state degeneracy, indicating long-range entanglement independent of topological degeneracy. Again, this effect extends from open to periodic boundaries in the generalized models. For Haah's code, we find new excitations--fracton tripoles and monopoles--that remain globally constrained, along with a relaxation of immobility giving rise to lineons and planons. These results reveal new forms of topological order and suggest a broader framework for understanding fracton phases beyond the conventional Z2 setting.

Title: Evaporative Refrigeration Effect in Evaporation and Condensation between Two Parallel Plates
Authors: Peiyi Chen, Qin Li, Gang Chen
Abstract: It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is known that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the vapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the liquid-vapor interface. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on a quasi-continuum approach. Experimental evidence for this effect has been scarce so far. Here, we examine evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates, including the liquid films on both sides, by coupling the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum treatments in both liquid films. Our solution shows that the vapor phase temperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall temperature at the condensing surface, i.e., the evaporative refrigeration effect. Our work not only re-affirms the refrigeration effect, but clarifies that this effect is caused by two mechanisms. At the interface, the asymmetry in the distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules creates a cooling effect, which is the dominant mechanism. Additional cooling occurs within the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion similar to the Joule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial expansion is not an isenthalpic process. Our work will motivate future experiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential applications in air-conditioning and refrigeration.

Title: The Universal Gap-to-Critical Temperature Ratio in Superconductors: a Statistical Mechanical Perspective
Authors: Chung-Ru Lee
Abstract: We propose a statistical mechanical framework to unify the observed relationship between the superconducting energy gap $\Delta$, the pseudogap $\Delta^\ast$, and the critical temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$. In this model, fermions couple as a composite boson and condense to occupy a single bound state as the temperature drops. We derive a concise formula for $T_\mathrm{c}$ in terms of $\Delta$ and $\Delta^\ast$, namely: $$\frac{\Delta}{k_\mathrm{B} T_\mathrm{c}} = 1.4+4\log(\Delta^\ast/\Delta).$$ This expression reproduces the standard BCS gap-to-$T_\mathrm{c}$ ratio in the absence of a pseudogap, while naturally explaining its enhancement in unconventional superconductors. The model is supported by comparisons with experimental data from several cuprates and iron-based superconductors, which highlight its generality. This formulation also offers a theoretical explanation for the observed persistence of the pseudogap phase into the overdoped regime.

Title: Probing the Quantum Capacitance of Rydberg Transitions of Surface Electrons on Liquid Helium via Microwave Frequency Modulation
Authors: Asher Jennings, Ivan Grytsenko, Yiran Tian, Oleksiy Rybalko, Jun Wang, Josef Barabash, Erika Kawakami
Abstract: We present a method for probing the quantum capacitance associated with the Rydberg transition of surface electrons on liquid helium using RF reflectometry. Excitation to Rydberg states induces a redistribution of image charges on capacitively coupled electrodes, giving rise to a quantum capacitance. By applying frequency-modulated resonant microwaves to drive the Rydberg transition, we systematically measured a capacitance sensitivity of 0.38~aF/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. This level of sensitivity is sufficient to resolve the Rydberg transition of a single electron, providing a scalable pathway toward the implementation of qubit readout schemes based on surface electrons on helium.

Title: A mechanical approach to facilitate the formation of dodecagonal quasicrystals and their approximants
Authors: Zhehua Jiang, Jianhua Zhang, Mengyuan Zhan, Jiaqi Si, Junchao Huang, Hua Tong, Ning Xu
Abstract: The conditions for forming quasicrystals and their approximants are stringent, normally requiring multiple length scales to stabilize the quasicrystalline order. Here we report an unexpected finding that the approximants and motifs of dodecagonal quasicrystals can be spontaneously formed in the simplest system of identical hard disks, utilizing the unstable feature of the initial square packing subject to mechanical perturbations. Because there is only one length scale involved, this finding challenges existing theories of quasicrystals and their approximants. By applying the same approach to a system known to form a dodecagonal quasicrystal, we develop decent quasicrystalline order in a purely mechanical manner. With the aid of thermal treatment, we achieve a significantly better quasicrystalline order than that from the direct self-assembly of the liquid state within the same period of time. In sufficiently low temperatures where the self-assembly of a liquid is significantly hindered, our approach still promotes the formation of quasicrystals. Our study thus opens a venue for high-efficiency search and formation of quasicrystals, and may have broader implications for the design and synthesis of quasicrystalline materials.

Title: Berry curvature-induced intrinsic spin Hall effect in light-element-based CrN system for magnetization switching
Authors: Gaurav K. Shukla, Prabhat Kumar, Shinji Isogami
Abstract: The current-induced spin-orbit torque-based devices for magnetization switching are commonly relied on the 4d and 5d heavy metals owing to their strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to produce large spin current via spin Hall effect (SHE). Here we present the sizable SHE in CrN, a light element-based system and demonstrate the current-induced magnetization switching in the adjacent ferromagnetic layer [Co(0.35nm)/Pt(0.3nm)]3, which exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We found the switching current density of 2.6 MA/cm2. The first principles calculation gives the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) to be 120 (hcross/e) S/cm due to intrinsic Berry curvature arising from SOC induced band splitting near Fermi-energy. The theoretically calculated intrinsic SHC is close to the experimental SHC extracted from second harmonic Hall measurement. We estimated spin Hall angle to be 0.09, demonstrating efficient charge-to-spin conversion in CrN system.

Baldoví, M. Reyes Calvo
Abstract: Tailoring magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals magnetic materials is essential for advancing their integration into technological applications. In this regard, strain engineering has emerged as a powerful and versatile strategy to control magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here, we demonstrate that compressive biaxial strain significantly enhances the magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy of few-layer CrSBr flakes. Strain is efficiently transferred to the flakes from the thermal compression of a polymeric substrate upon cooling, as confirmed by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. This strain induces a remarkable increase in the magnetoresistance ratio and in the saturation fields required to align the magnetization of CrSBr along each of its three crystalographic directions, reaching a twofold enhancement along the magnetic easy axis. This enhancement is accompanied by a subtle reduction of the Néel temperature by ~10K. Our experimental results are fully supported by first-principles calculations, which link the observed effects to a strain-driven modification in interlayer exchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy energy. These findings establish strain engineering as a key tool for fine-tuning magnetotransport properties in 2D magnetic semiconductors, paving the way for implementation in spintronics and information storage devices.

Title: Enhancement and Suppression of Active Particle Movement Due to Membrane Deformations
Authors: Adam Hitin Bialus, Bhargav Rallabandi, Naomi Oppenheimer
Abstract: Microswimmers and active colloids often move in confined systems, including those involving interfaces. Such interfaces, especially at the microscale, may deform in response to the stresses of the flow created by the active particle. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of a nearby membrane due to the motion of an active particle whose flow fields are generated by force-free singularities. We demonstrate our result on a particle represented by a combination of a force dipole and a source dipole, while the membrane resists deformation due to tension and bending rigidity. We find that the deformation either enhances or suppresses the motion of the active particle, depending on its orientation and the relative strengths between the fundamental singularities that describe its flow. Furthermore, the deformation can generate motion in new directions.

Title: Probing Temperature at Nanoscale through Thermal Vibration Characterization using Scanning Precession Electron Diffraction
Authors: Kun Yang, Chao Zhang, Chengwei Wu, Qian Du, Bingzhi Li, Zhen Fang, Liang Li, Jianbo Wu, Tianru Wu, Hui Wang, Tao Deng, Wenpei Gao
Abstract: Accurate, non-contact temperature measurement with high spatial resolution is essential for understanding thermal behavior in integrated nanoscale devices and heterogeneous interfaces. However, existing techniques are often limited by the need for physical contact or insufficient spatial resolution for the measurement of local temperature and mapping its distribution. Here, we showcase the direct temperature measurement of graphene with nanometer spatial resolution in transmission electron microscopy. In experiments, combining a scanning nanobeam with precession electron diffraction offers the collection of kinemetic diffraction from a local area at the nanometer scale. In analysis, we use a pre-calculated, sample-specific structure-factor-based correction method to enable the linear fitting of the diffraction intensities, allowing the determination of the Debye-Waller factor as a function of temperature at the precision of 10-4Å2/°C. With the high spatial resolution and measurement precision, the temperature and thermal vibration mapping further reveal the influence of graphene lattice parameters and thickness on the Debye-Waller factor, providing valuable insights into the vibrational properties impacted by temperature, lattice structure, and graphene layer thickness.

Authors: Caeli L. Benyacko, Garrett T. Hauser, Raven J. Rawson, Alan J. Sherman, Quinton L. Wiebe, Krittin Poottafai, Daniel R. Talham, Mark W. Meisel
Abstract: The static magnetic properties of the silica-based aergoels of Cryogel$^{\tiny{\circledR}}$ and Pyrogel$^{\tiny{\circledR}}$, manufactured by Aspen Aerogels$^{\tiny{\circledR}}$, were measured over a range of temperatures (2 K $\leq$ T $\leq$ 400 K) and in magnetic fields up to 70 kG. These data and a model of the responses are reported so these properties are familiar to others who may benefit from knowing them before the materials are employed in potential applications.

Title: Learning rate matrix and information-thermodynamic trade-off relation
Authors: Kenshin Matsumoto, Shin-ichi Sasa, Andreas Dechant
Abstract: Non-equilibrium systems exchange information in addition to energy. In information thermodynamics, the information flow is characterized by the learning rate, which is not invariant under coordinate transformations. To formalize the property of the learning rate under variable transformations, we introduce a learning rate matrix. This matrix has the learning rates as its diagonal elements and characterizes the changes in the learning rates under linear coordinate transformations. The maximal eigenvalue of the symmetric part of the learning rate matrix gives the maximal information flow under orthogonal transformations. Furthermore, we derive a new trade-off relation between the learning rate and the heat dissipation of a subsystem. Finally, we illustrate the results using analytically solvable yet experimentally feasible models.

Title: Nonlinear transport of Wigner solid phase surrounding the two-flux composite fermion liquid
Authors: Yu-jiang Dong, Xinghao Wang, Jianmin Zheng, Weiliang Qiao, Rui-Rui Du, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Kenneth W. West, Kirk W. Baldwin
Abstract: We have investigated the low temperature (T) transport properties of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in a high-mobility two-dimensional hole gas. According to the composite fermion (CF) model, FQH states stemming from a half-filled Landau level, specifically at filling factors ${\nu}=p/(2p+1) (p=\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3,...)$, can be associated with two-flux-attached CFs at the corresponding Lambda filling factor p. The zero-resistance minima and Hall plateaus of these states exhibit unusual temperature dependencies, characterized by rapid increases in width below a threshold temperature around 100 mK. Differential conductivity measurements from Corbino samples reveal that the regimes surrounding the CF liquid display clear nonlinear transport characteristics. This nonlinearity implies that each CF liquid is surrounded by CF solid phase composed of dilute CF excitations. Quantitatively, the applied electric field E influences the motion of CF solid in a way analogous to T, which is dubbed the "E-T duality". Our analysis indicates that this E-T duality is consistent with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless theory in two-dimensional phase transitions.

Title: Many-Body Colloidal Dynamics under Stochastic Resetting: Competing Effects of Particle Interactions on the Steady State Distribution
Authors: Ron Vatash, Yael Roichman
Abstract: The random arrest of the diffusion of a single particle and its return to its origin has served as the paradigmatic example of a large variety of processes undergoing stochastic resetting. While the implications and applications of stochastic resetting for a single particle are well understood, less is known about resetting of many interacting particles. In this study, we experimentally and numerically investigate a system of six colloidal particles undergoing two types of stochastic resetting protocols: global resetting, where all particles are returned to their origin simultaneously, and local resetting, where particles are reset one at a time. Our particles interact mainly through hard-core repulsion and hydrodynamic flows. We find that the most substantial effect of interparticle interactions is observed for local resetting, specifically when particles are physically dragged to the origin. In this case, hard-core repulsion broadens the steady-state distribution, while hydrodynamic interactions significantly narrow the distribution. The combination results in a steady-state distribution that is wider compared to that of a single particle system both for global and local resetting protocols.

Title: Deconfined Quantum Critical Point: A Review of Progress
Authors: Yi Cui, Rong Yu, Weiqiang Yu
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) have been proposed as a class of continuous quantum phase transitions occurring between two ordered phases with distinct symmetry-breaking patterns, beyond the conventional framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) theory. At the DQCP, the system exhibits emergent gauge fields, fractionalized excitations, and enhanced symmetries. Here we review recent theoretical and experimental progress on exploring DQCPs in condensed matter systems. We first introduce theoretical advancements in the study of DQCPs over the past twenty years, particularly in magnetic models on square lattices, honeycomb lattices, kagome lattices, and one-dimensional spin chains. We then discuss recent progress on experimental realization of DQCP in quantum magnetic systems. Experimentally, the Shastry-Sutherland model, realized in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, offers a particularly promising platform for realizing DQCPs. The magnetic frustration inherent to this model drives phase transitions between two distinct symmetry-breaking states: a valence bond solid (VBS) phase and a Néel antiferromagnetic phase. Remarkably, SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ has provided the first experimental evidence of a proximate DQCP through a field-induced Bose-Einstein condensation, transitioning from the VBS state to the Néel state. Nevertheless, the direct experimental realization of a DQCP remains a significant challenge. Despite this, it offers a promising platform for exploring emergent phenomena through quantum phase transition in low-dimensional quantum systems.

Title: CMOS-compatible vanadium dioxide via Pulsed Laser and Atomic Layer deposition: towards ultra-thin film phase-change layers
Authors: Anna Varini, Cyrille Masserey, Vanessa Conti, Zahra Saadat Somaehsofla, Ehsan Ansari, Igor Stolichnov, Adrian M. Ionescu
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide, a well-known Mott insulator, is a highly studied electronic material with promising applications in information processing and storage. While fully crystalline layers exhibit exceptional properties, such as a sharp and abrupt conductivity change at the metal-insulator transition, fabricating poly-crystalline films on silicon substrates often involves trade-offs in transport characteristics and switching performance, especially for ultra-thin layers required in advanced gate applications. In this study, we explore the growth of vanadium dioxide films on standard wet-oxidized silicon wafers using two established deposition techniques with pulsed laser deposition and atomic layer deposition. Thin films, ranging in thickness from 200 to 10 nano meters, were systematically characterized through structural and electrical analyses to optimize key growth parameters. Temperature and pressure were identified as the primary factors affecting film quality, and the optimal growth conditions across the entire thickness range are discussed in detail. We demonstrate that both pulsed laser deposition and atomic layer deposition methods can successfully produce ultra-thin vanadium dioxide layers down to 8 nano meters with functional properties suitable for practical applications. This work underscores the potential of vanadium dioxide for fully industry compatible phase-change switching devices and provides valuable insights into optimizing growth processes for poly-crystalline films.

Title: Long-range magnetic interactions in Nd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and the formation of skyrmion phases in centrosymmetric metals

Abstract: We present an extensive X-ray and neutron scattering study of the structure and magnetic excitations of Nd$_2$PdSi$_3$, a sister compound of Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ which was recently found to host a skyrmion lattice phase despite its centrosymmetric crystal structure. Dispersive magnetic excitations were measured throughout the Brillouin zone and modelled using mean-field random-phase approximation to determine the magnetic interactions between Nd ions. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic interactions in this system extend over large distances and are significantly affected by a crystallographic superstructure formed by ordering of the Pd and Si atoms. The results suggest that the mechanism for the skyrmion phase formation in this family of materials, e.g. Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ is through the long-range RKKY interactions rather than short-range triangular-lattice frustration.

Abstract: Magnetostriction is a crystal's deformation under magnetic fields, usually in the range of $10^{-6}$ - $10^{-3}$, where the lattice change occurs with the change of spin and orbital state through spin-lattice couplings. In strong magnetic fields beyond 100 T, the significant Zeeman energy competes with the lattice interactions, where one can expect considerable magnetostriction. However, directly observing magnetostriction above 100 T is challenging, because generating magnetic fields beyond 100 T accompanies the destruction of the coil with a single-shot $\mu$-second pulse. Here, we observed the giant and anisotropic magnetostriction of $\sim$1 % at 110 T in the spin-controlled crystal of $\beta$-O$_{2}$, by combining the single-shot diffraction of x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) and the state-of-the-art portable 100 T generator. The magnetostriction of $\sim$1 % is the largest class as a deformation of the unit cell. It is a response of the soft lattice of $\beta$-O$_{2}$ originating, not only in the competing van der Waals force and exchange interaction, but also the soft state of spin and lattice frustrated on the triangular network. Meanwhile, the anisotropy originates from the strong two-dimensionality of the spin system. Giant magnetostriction in crystals should become more ubiquitous and diverse beyond 100 T, where our XFEL experiment above 100 T opens a novel pathway for their exploration, providing fundamental insights into the roles of spin in stabilizing crystal structures.

Title: Influence of packing protocol on fractal exponents in dense polydisperse packings
Authors: Artem A. Vladimirov, Alexander Yu. Cherny, Eugen M. Anitas, Vladimir A. Osipov
Abstract: We study fractal properties of a system of densely and randomly packed disks, obeying a power-law distribution of radii, which is generated by using various protocols: Delaunay triangulation (DT) with both zero and periodic boundary conditions and the constant pressure protocol with periodic boundary conditions. The power-law exponents of the mass-radius relation and structure factor are obtained numerically for various values of the size ratio of the distribution, defined as the largest-to-smallest radius ratio. It is shown that the size ratio is an important control parameter responsible for the consistency of the fractal properties of the system: the greater the ratio, the less the finite size effects are pronounced and the better the agreement between the exponents. For the DT protocol, the exponents of the mass-radius relation, structure factor, and power-law distribution coincide even at moderate values of the size ratio. By contrast, for the constant-pressure protocol, all three exponents are found to be different for both moderate (around 300) and large (around 1500) size ratios, which might indicate a biased rather than random spatial distribution of the disks. Nevertheless, there is a tendency for the exponents to converge as the size ratio increases, suggesting that all the exponents become equal in the limit of infinite size ratio.

Title: Performances in solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the Yambo code
Authors: Petru Milev, Blanca Mellado-Pinto, Muralidhar Nalabothula, Ali Esquembre Kucukalic, Fernando Alvarruiz, Enrique Ramos, Ludger Wirtz, Jose E. Roman, Davide Sangalli
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the performances of two different strategies in solving the structured eigenvalue problem deriving from the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) in condensed matter physics. The first strategy employs direct diagonalization, while the second is based on an iterative solver. The BSE matrix is constructed with the Yambo code, and the two strategies are implemented by interfacing Yambo with the ScaLAPACK and ELPA libraries for direct diagonalization, and with the SLEPc library for the iterative approach. We consider both the hermitian (Tamm-Dancoff approximation) and pseudo-hermitian forms, addressing dense matrices of three different sizes. A description of the implementation is also provided, with details for the pseudo-hermitian case. Timing and memory utilization are analyzed on both CPU and GPU clusters. The CPU simulations are performed on a local cluster in Rome, while the GPU simulations are performed on the Leonardo HPC cluster of CINECA. Our results demonstrate that it is now feasible to handle dense BSE matrices of the order 10$^5$.

Title: Preliminary experimental investigation on the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow
Authors: Durbar Roy, Ikbal Ahmed, Abdul Hakkim, Rama Govindarajan
Abstract: We study the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow experimentally using optical diagnostics in the Reynolds and Froude parameter space ($7.7{\times}10^3<Re<3.8{\times}10^4$, $0.1<Fr<0.4$). Interactions between the turbulent flow and the granular structure give rise to transient erosion-deposition dynamics leading to various types of particle transport. The subaqueous structures in the channel bed evolves due to shear-stress-induced erosion, gravity-driven deposition, and subsequent particle transport. We study the centroid motion and the granular structure shape evolution. At lower end of our $Re-Fr$ parameter space, we observe no erosion and the structure remains at rest. At intermediate values of $Re$ and $Fr$, we observe very slow erosion and the granular structure moves vere slowly as a rigid body without significant shape deformation. Higher values of $Re$ and $Fr$ causes vortex formation at the upstream of the dune resulting in stronger erosion, rapid shape deformation and relatively higher translation velocity of the centroid.

Title: $t$-$J$ model for strongly correlated two-orbital systems: Application to bilayer nickelate superconductors
Authors: Tatsuya Kaneko, Masataka Kakoi, Kazuhiko Kuroki
Abstract: We derive a $t$-$J$ model applicable to strongly correlated two-orbital systems including bilayer nickelate superconductors. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states raising the on-site Coulomb energy and derive resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.

Title: Design Optimization of Flip FET Standard Cells with Dual-sided Pins for Ultimate Scaling
Authors: Rui Gui, Haoran Lu, Jiacheng Sun, Xun Jiang, Lining Zhang, Ming Li, Yibo Lin, Runsheng Wang, Heng Wu, Ru Huang
Abstract: Recently, we proposed a novel transistor architecture for 3D stacked FETs called Flip FET (FFET), featuring N/P transistors back-to-back stacked and dual-sided interconnects. With dual-sided power rails and signal tracks, FFET can achieve an aggressive 2.5T cell height. As a tradeoff, the complex structure and limited numbers of M0 tracks could limit the standard cell design. As a solution, multiple innovations were introduced and examined in this work. Based on an advanced node design rule, several unique building blocks in FFET such as drain merge (DM), gate merge (GM), field drain merge (FDM) and buried signal track (BST) were investigated. Other key design concepts of multi-row, split gate and dummy gate insertion (DG) were also carefully studied, delivering around 35.6% area reduction compared with 3T CFET. Furthermore, the symmetric design of FFET has unique superiority over CFET thanks to the separate N/P logic on two sides of the wafer and their connections using DM and GM. New routing scheme with dual-sided output pins on both wafer frontside (FS) and backside (BS) was proposed for the first time. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation on complex cell design, taking AOI22 as an example. New strategies were proposed and examined. The FDM design is identified as the best, outperforming the BST and dummy gate design by 1.93% and 5.13% for the transition delay.

Title: Unravelling the Flow of Information in a Nonequilibrium Process
Authors: Biswajit Das, Sreekanth K Manikandan, Ayan Banerjee
Abstract: Identifying the origin of nonequilibrium characteristics in a generic interacting system having multiple degrees of freedom is a challenging task. In this context, information theoretic measures such as mutual information and related polymorphs offer valuable insights. Here, we explore these measures in a minimal experimental model consisting of two hydrodynamically coupled colloidal particles, where a nonequilibrium drive is introduced via an exponentially correlated noise acting on one of the particles. We show that the information-theoretic tools considered enable a systematic, data-driven dissection of information flow within the system. These measures allow us to identify the driving node and reconstruct the directional dependencies between particles. Notably, they help explain a recently observed, counterintuitive trend in the dependence of irreversibility on interaction strength under coarse-graining (B. Das this http URL., arXiv:2405.00800 (2024)). Finally, our results demonstrate how directional information measures can uncover the hidden structure of nonequilibrium dynamics and provide a framework for studying similar effects in more complex systems.

Title: Topological exciton bands and many-body exciton phases in transition metal dichalcogenide trilayer heterostructures
Authors: Ze-Hong Guo, Tao Yan, Jin-Zhu Zhao, Yuan-Jun Jin, Qizhong Zhu
Abstract: Twisted multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a promising platform for realizing topological exciton phases. Here we propose that twisted TMD heterotrilayers WX$_2$/MX$_2$/WX$_2$ with layer symmetry represents a realistic system for realizing topological exciton bands and interesting many-body excitonic phases, simply by tuning the twist angle. These symmetric heterotrilayers form a type-II band alignment, where the electrons are confined in the middle layer and holes are distributed among the outer two layers, for the lowest energy excitons. The outer two layers are then rotated at different centers by opposite angles, forming a helical structure. Interlayer excitons with opposite dipoles are hybridized by the coupling between outer two layers, resulting in topological moiré exciton bands. Furthermore, by constructing a three-orbital tight-binding model, we map the many-body phase diagram of interacting dipolar and quadrupolar excitons at different twist angles and exciton densities and reveal the existence of sublattice-dependent staggered superfluid and Mott insulator phases. The recent experimental observation of quadrupolar excitons in symmetric heterotrilayers brings the intriguing phases predicted in this study within immediate experimental reach.

Title: Orbital orders under magnetic fields in cubic PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$
Authors: Hitoko Okanoya, Kazumasa Hattori
Abstract: We study orbital orders in quadrupolar heavy-fermion compound PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$ under magnetic fields on the basis of the Landau theory. Assuming E$_g$ orbital (electric quadrupolar) orders in the cubic symmetry with the ordering wavenumber at the L points in the face-centered cubic lattice Brillouin zone as observed experimentally, we construct the Landau free energy and analyze it. We find that the unidentified high-temperature ordered phase under the magnetic field H ||[001] reported earlier can be interpreted as the consequence of the internal rotation in the orbital moments of f electrons at the Pr site. We discuss the phase diagram for various magnetic-field directions and also possible double-q quadrupolar orders in this system.

Title: Cryogenic Ferroelectric Behavior of Wurtzite Ferroelectrics
Authors: Ruiqing Wang, Jiuren Zhou, Siying Zheng, Feng Zhu, Wenxin Sun, Haiwen Xu, Bochang Li, Yan Liu, Yue Hao, Genquan Han
Abstract: This study presents the first experimental exploration into cryogenic ferroelectric behavior in wurtzite ferroelectrics. A breakdown field (EBD) to coercive field (EC) ratio of 1.8 is achieved even at 4 K, marking the lowest ferroelectric switching temperature reported for wurtzite ferroelectrics. Additionally, a significant evolution in fatigue behavior is captured, transitioning from hard breakdown to ferroelectricity loss at cryogenic temperatures. These findings unlock the feasibility for wurtzite ferroelectrics to advance wide temperature non-volatile memory.

Title: Tailoring Neel orders in Layered Topological Antiferromagnets
Authors: Xiaotian Yang, Yongqian Wang, Yongchao Wang, Zichen Lian, Jinsong Zhang, Yayu Wang, Chang Liu, Wenbo Wang
Abstract: In the two-dimensional limit, the interplay between Neel order and band topology in van der Waals topological antiferromagnets can give rise to novel quantum phenomena in the quantum anomalous Hall state, including the cascaded quantum phase transition and spin-modulation effect. However, due to the absence of net magnetization in antiferromagnets, probing the energetically degenerate Neel orders has long remained a significant challenge. Inspired by recent advances in realizing the quantum anomalous Hall effect in AlOx-capped layered topological antiferromagnet MnBi2Te4, we demonstrate deterministic control over the Neel order through surface anisotropy engineering enabled by the AlOx capping layer. By tuning the surface anisotropy, we uncover paritydependent symmetry breaking states that manifest as distinct odd-even boundary architectures, including 180 degree domain walls or continuous spin structures. Comparative studies between AlOx-capped and pristine odd-layer MnBi2Te4 flakes using domain-resolved magnetic force microscopy reveal pronounced differences in coercivity and magnetization-reversal dynamics. Notably, an unconventional giant exchange bias, which arises from perpendicular magnetic anisotropy rather than traditional interface pinning mechanisms, is observed for the first time. Our findings establish a pathway for manipulating Neel order through surface modification in A-type antiferromagnets, offering new opportunities for spintronic devices and quantum information technologies.

Title: Highly Hydrogenated Monolayer Graphene with Wide Band Gap Opening

Abstract: A thorough spectroscopic characterisation of highly hydrogenated monolayer graphene trasferred on TEM grids is herein reported. The graphene hydrogenation has the effect to distort the $sp^2$ arrangement of carbon atoms in the lattice toward a $sp^3$-like coordination, through the breaking of the $\pi$-bonds, as determined by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the C 1s core level. The hydrogen bonding was found to be favoured for a more distorted graphene lattice. Indeed, a 100$\%$ $sp^3$-saturation - the highest ever achieved - was observed after the hydrogenation of a sample with more pristine $sp^3$-like deformed bonds, while the flatter, more $sp^2$-arranged, sample reached a 59$\%$ $sp^3$-saturation. Electron energy loss spectroscopy confirmed the photoemission result showing the $\pi$-plasmon excitation quenching, in the totally hydrogenated sample, and significant reduction, for the other one. High loading levels of hydrogenation were also witnessed by the opening of a wide optical band gap (6.3 and 6.2 eV). The observation of the C-H stretching vibrational mode is also reported, as a direct footprint of graphene hydrogenation. Finally, valence band measurements of the 59$\%$ saturated sample suggest the coexistence of one-side and two-side hydrogenation morphologies.

Title: Elastic displacements in wedge-shaped geometries with a straight edge: Green's functions for perpendicular forces
Authors: Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: Edges are abundant when fluids are contained in vessels or elastic solids glide in guiding rails. We here address induced small-scale flows in viscous fluids or displacements in elastic solids in the vicinity of one such edge. For this purpose, we solve the underlying low-Reynolds-number flow equations for incompressible fluids and the elasticity equations for linearly elastic, possibly compressible solids. Technically speaking, we derive the associated Green's functions under confinement by two planar boundaries that meet at a straight edge. The two boundaries both feature no-slip or free-slip conditions, or one of these two conditions per boundary. Previously, we solved the simpler case of the force being oriented parallel to the straight edge. Here, we complement this solution by the more challenging case of the force pointing into a direction perpendicular to the edge. Together, these two cases provide the general solution. Specific situations in which our analysis may find application in terms of quantitative theoretical descriptions are particle motion in confined colloidal suspensions, dynamics of active microswimmers near edges, or actuated distortions of elastic materials due to activated contained functionalized particles.

Title: Universality, Robustness, and Limits of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Gabriel Almeida, Pedro Ribeiro, Masudul Haque, Lucas Sá
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) underpins much of our modern understanding of the thermalization of closed quantum many-body systems. Here, we investigate the statistical properties of observables in the eigenbasis of the Lindbladian operator of a Markovian open quantum system. We demonstrate the validity of a Lindbladian ETH ansatz through extensive numerical simulations of several physical models. To highlight the robustness of Lindbladian ETH, we consider what we dub the dilute-click regime of the model, in which one postselects only quantum trajectories with a finite fraction of quantum jumps. The average dynamics are generated by a non-trace-preserving Liouvillian, and we show that the Lindbladian ETH ansatz still holds in this case. On the other hand, the no-click limit is a singular point at which the Lindbladian reduces to a doubled non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindbladian ETH breaks down.

Title: Large magnetoreflectance and optical anisotropy due to $4f$ flat bands in the frustrated kagome magnet HoAgGe
Authors: F. Schilberth, L. DeFreitas, K. Zhao, F. LeMardelé, I. Mohelsky, M. Orlita, P. Gegenwart, H. Chen, I. Kézsmárki, S. Bordács
Abstract: We report peculiar optical properties of the frustrated itinerant magnet HoAgGe, which exhibits multiple magnetically ordered states obeying the kagome spin-ice rule. The optical conductivity is surprisingly higher for light polarization perpendicular to the kagome plane, both for the free carrier response and the interband transitions. The latter ones have strong contributions from Ho $4f$ flat bands located near the Fermi level, as revealed by our \textit{ab initio} calculations, explaining the unusual anisotropy of the optical properties and the pronounced temperature dependence of the interband transitions for out--of--plane light polarization. The key role of Ho $4f$ states is further supported by the large variation of the reflectivity upon the metamagnetic transitions, that follows the field dependence of the magnetization, in contrast to that of the dc magnetotransport data. Such heavy-electron bands near the Fermi level offer an efficient way to control transport and optical properties.

Title: Zero-shot Autonomous Microscopy for Scalable and Intelligent Characterization of 2D Materials

Abstract: Characterization of atomic-scale materials traditionally requires human experts with months to years of specialized training. Even for trained human operators, accurate and reliable characterization remains challenging when examining newly discovered materials such as two-dimensional (2D) structures. This bottleneck drives demand for fully autonomous experimentation systems capable of comprehending research objectives without requiring large training datasets. In this work, we present ATOMIC (Autonomous Technology for Optical Microscopy & Intelligent Characterization), an end-to-end framework that integrates foundation models to enable fully autonomous, zero-shot characterization of 2D materials. Our system integrates the vision foundation model (i.e., Segment Anything Model), large language models (i.e., ChatGPT), unsupervised clustering, and topological analysis to automate microscope control, sample scanning, image segmentation, and intelligent analysis through prompt engineering, eliminating the need for additional training. When analyzing typical MoS2 samples, our approach achieves 99.7% segmentation accuracy for single layer identification, which is equivalent to that of human experts. In addition, the integrated model is able to detect grain boundary slits that are challenging to identify with human eyes. Furthermore, the system retains robust accuracy despite variable conditions including defocus, color temperature fluctuations, and exposure variations. It is applicable to a broad spectrum of common 2D materials-including graphene, MoS2, WSe2, SnSe-regardless of whether they were fabricated via chemical vapor deposition or mechanical exfoliation. This work represents the implementation of foundation models to achieve autonomous analysis, establishing a scalable and data-efficient characterization paradigm that fundamentally transforms the approach to nanoscale materials research.

Title: Electron-Phonon Coupling Mediated by Fröhlich Interaction in Rb2SnBr6 Perovskite
Authors: C. C. S. Soares, J. S. Rodríguez-Hernández, Bruno P. Silva, Mayra A. P. Gómez, V. S. Neto, A. P. Ayala, C.W.A. Paschoal
Abstract: Due to their well-suited optoelectronic properties, metal halide perovskites are emerging semiconductor materials with potential applications in solar cells, detectors, and light-emitting diodes. Beyond the traditional 3D perovskites, low-dimensional counterparts have more attractive effects such as excitonic emissions and quantum confinements that are enhanced by the reduced dimensionality, which involve the Electron-Phonon Coupling (EPC). Such phenomenon, which comprehends the interaction between charge carriers and lattice vibrations, usually strongly impacts the photoluminescence (PL) response in low-dimensional frameworks. In this paper, we investigated the intrinsic EPC onto low-temperature PL of the zero-dimensional (0D) Rb2SnBr6 perovskite. Temperature-dependent PL measurements, complemented by various characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, revealed broadband emission with a significant Stokes shift attributed to self-trapped excitons (STEs). The Fröhlich mechanism, mediated by interactions between excitonic charge carriers and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, primarily accounts for the emission broadening through phonon-assisted radiative recombination. The EPC strength was evaluated through the Huang-Rhys factor S=34, confirming strong correlations between electronic and vibrational properties and supporting the STE emission assumption. The possible mechanism of STE formation was evaluated by the Fröhlich parameter {\alpha} of 1.94 for electrons and 4.73 for holes, which points out a major contribution of the hole-polaron quasi-particle on exciton trapping. Our findings give insights regarding the influence of EPC in 0D perovskites and STE formation, which leads to the assessment of Rb2SnBr6 for light-harvesting applications.

Title: Existence of Nonequilibrium Glasses in the Degenerate Stealthy Hyperuniform Ground-State Manifold
Authors: Salvatore Torquato, Jaeuk Kim
Abstract: Stealthy interactions are an emerging class of nontrivial, bounded long-ranged oscillatory pair potentials with classical ground states that can be disordered, hyperuniform, and infinitely degenerate. Their hybrid crystal-liquid nature endows them with novel physical properties with advantages over their crystalline counterparts. Here, we show the existence of nonequilibrium hard-sphere glasses within this unusual ground-state manifold as the stealthiness parameter $\chi$ tends to zero that are remarkably configurationally extremely close to hyperuniform 3D maximally random jammed (MRJ) sphere packings. The latter are prototypical glasses since they are maximally disordered, perfectly rigid, and perfectly nonergodic. Our optimization procedure, which leverages the maximum cardinality of the infinite ground-state set, not only guarantees that our packings are hyperuniform with the same structure-factor scaling exponent as the MRJ state, but they share other salient structural attributes, including a packing fraction of $0.638$, a mean contact number per particle of 6, gap exponent of $0.44(1)$, and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ and structures factors $S(k)$ that are virtually identical to one another for all $r$ and $k$, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that stealthy hyperuniform packings can be created within the disordered regime ($0 < \chi <1/2$) with heretofore unattained maximal packing fractions. As $\chi$ increases from zero, they always form interparticle contacts, albeit with sparser contact networks as $\chi$ increases from zero, resulting in linear polymer-like chains of contacting particles with increasingly shorter chain lengths. The capacity to generate ultradense stealthy hyperuniform packings for all $\chi$ opens up new materials applications in optics and acoustics.

Title: Performance of a Brownian information engine through potential profiling: Optimum output requisites, Heating-to-Refrigeration transition and their Re-entrance
Authors: Rafna Rafeek, Debasish Mondal
Abstract: Brownian Information engine (BIE) harnesses the energy from a fluctuating environment by utilizing the associated information change in the presence of a single heat bath. The engine operates in a space-dependent confining potential and requires an appropriate feedback control mechanism. In general, the feedback controller has three different steps: measurement, feedback, and relaxation. The feedback step is related to a sudden change in the potential energy that is essential for a nonzero work output. BIE utilises the amount of information (surprise) acquired during the measurement step for the energy output. However, due to the relaxation process, a certain amount of acquired information is lost or becomes unavailable. So, controlling information loss during relaxation is crucial for the overall efficiency of the engine. The net (available) information, therefore, can be monitored by tuning the feedback controller and the shape of the confining potential. In this paper, we explore the effect of the shape modulation of the confining potential, which may have multiple stable valleys and unstable hills, on the net available information and, hence, the performance of a BIE that operates under an asymmetric feedback protocol. We examine the optimal performance requirements of the BIE and the amount of maximum work output under different potential profiling. For monostable trapping, a concave shape in confining potential results in a higher work output than a convex one. We also find that hills and valleys in the confining potential may lead to multiple good operating conditions. An appropriate shape modulation can create a heater-refrigerator transition and their reentrance due to non-trivial changes in information loss during the relaxation process.

Title: MIPS is a Maxwell fluid with an extended and non-monotonic crossover
Authors: José Martín-Roca, Chantal Valeriani, Kristian Thijssen, Tyler Shendruk, Angelo Cacciuto
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical properties of active suspensions is crucial for their potential applications in materials engineering. Among the various phenomena in active matter that have no analogue in equilibrium systems, motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in active colloidal suspensions is one of the most extensively studied. However, the mechanical properties of this fundamental active state of matter remain poorly understood. This study investigates the rheology of a suspension of active colloidal particles under constant and oscillatory shear. Systems consisting of pseudo-hard active Brownian particles exhibiting co-existence of dense and dilute phases behave as a viscoelastic Maxwell fluid at low and high frequencies, displaying exclusively shear thinning across a wide range of densities and activities. Remarkably, the cross-over point between the storage and loss moduli is non-monotonic, rising with activity before the MIPS transition but falling with activity after the transition, revealing the subtleties of how active forces and intrinsically out-of-equilibrium phases affect the mechanical properties of these systems.

Title: Improving diffusion modeling in all-solid-state lithium batteries: a novel approach for grain boundary effects
Authors: Lena Scholz, Yongliang Ou, Blazej Grabowski, Felix Fritzen
Abstract: All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries offer promising advantages with respect to capacity, safety, and performance. The diffusion behavior of lithium ions in the contained polycrystalline solid-state electrolyte is crucial for battery function. While atomistic studies indicate that grain boundaries (GBs) and grain size significantly impact diffusivity, the corresponding effects are either neglected in simulations on larger scales or considered only under strong assumptions such as isotropy. Our approach considers the fully resolved crystalline structure with a parametrization aligned with the atomistic perspective to describe diffusion along and across GBs. The approach is embedded into a finite element simulation using a novel collapsed interface element based on an analytical description in thickness direction. Results are governed by different and potentially anisotropic diffusion coefficients in bulk and GB domains. The mesoscale response is derived using linear computational homogenization to capture large-scale effects. The novel collapsed interface description allows for a reconstruction of the 3D transport behavior within the GB domain without resolving it and is able to capture the relevant transport mechanisms such as channeling effects and concentration jumps. Grain size and GB volume fraction are expressed in terms of an affine parameter dependence and can be altered without any changes to geometry or mesh. Together with the observed dependence of the effective material response on the anisotropic GB parametrization, this leads to the identification of four distinct diffusion regimes, each with implications for the design of battery materials.

Title: Spin-Orbital Intertwined Topological Superconductivity in a Class of Correlated Noncentrosymmetric Materials
Authors: Lichuang Wang, Ran Wang, Xinliang Huang, Xianxin Wu, Ning Hao
Abstract: In this study, we propose an alternative route to achieving topological superconductivity (TSC). Our approach applies to a new class of correlated noncentrosymmetric materials that host two spin-split Fermi surfaces with identical spin textures due to a spin-orbital intertwined effect. Incorporating multi-orbital repulsive Hubbard interactions, we calculate the superconducting pairings of a minimal two-orbital effective model within a spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity framework. We find that, depending on the effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) strength and filling level, the Hubbard interaction can drive the leading pairing symmetry into the $A_1(S_{\pm})$, $B_1$, $B_2$ or $B_2(d_{\pm})$ irreducible representations (IRs) of the $C_{4v}$ point group. Notably, the $A_1(S_{\pm})$ pairing gives rise to a fully gapped TSC characterized by a $Z_2$ invariant, while the $B_2(d_{\pm})$ pairing results in a nodal TSC. Our analysis reveals that the fully gapped TSC is predominated by spin-singlet regardless of the presence of the spin-triplet components. This distinguishes our model from noncentrosymmetric materials with conventional Rashba-split band structures, where TSC typically emerges near the van Hove singularity and is primarily driven by $p$-wave or $f$-wave spin-triplet pairing. These features enhances its experimental accessibility, and we discuss potential experimental systems for its realization.

Title: Maximum entropy modeling of Optimal Transport: the sub-optimality regime and the transition from dense to sparse networks
Authors: Lorenzo Buffa, Dario Mazzilli, Riccardo Piombo, Fabio Saracco, Giulio Cimini, Aurelio Patelli
Abstract: We present a bipartite network model that captures intermediate stages of optimization by blending the Maximum Entropy approach with Optimal Transport. In this framework, the network's constraints define the total mass each node can supply or receive, while an external cost field favors a minimal set of links, driving the system toward a sparse, tree-like structure. By tuning the control parameter, one transitions from uniformly distributed weights to an optimal transport regime in which weights condense onto cost-favorable edges. We quantify this dense-to-sparse transition, showing with numerical analyses that the process does not hinge on specific assumptions about the node-strength or cost distributions. Finite-size analysis confirms that the results persist in the thermodynamic limit. Because the model offers explicit control over the degree of sub-optimality, this approach lends to practical applications in link prediction, network reconstruction, and statistical validation, particularly in systems where partial optimization coexists with other noise-like factors.

Title: Quantum geometry from the Moyal product: quantum kinetic equation and non-linear response
Authors: Takamori Park, Xiaoyang Huang, Lucile Savary, Leon Balents
Abstract: We systematically derive the dissipationless quantum kinetic equation for a multi-band free fermionic system with U(1) symmetry. Using the Moyal product formalism, we fully band-diagonalize the dynamics. Expanding to the second order in gradients, which is beyond the semiclassical limit, we give a complete analysis of the band-resolved thermodynamics and transport properties, especially those arising from the quantum geometric tensor. We apply our framework to a Bloch band theory under electric fields near equilibrium and find the linear and nonlinear transport coefficients. We also obtain the dynamical density-density response functions in the metallic case, including quantum metric corrections. Our results and approach can be applied very generally to multi-band problems even in situations with spatially varying Hamiltonians and distributions.

Title: AC Current-Driven Magnetization Switching and Nonlinear Hall Rectification in a Magnetic Topological Insulator
Authors: Yuto Kiyonaga, Masataka Mogi, Ryutaro Yoshimi, Yukako Fujishiro, Yuri Suzuki, Max T. Birch, Atsushi Tsukazaki, Minoru Kawamura, Masashi Kawasaki, Yoshinori Tokura
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque arising from the spin-orbit-coupled surface states of topological insulators enables current-induced control of magnetization with high efficiency. Here, alternating-current (AC) driven magnetization reversal is demonstrated in a semi-magnetic topological insulator (Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Bi,Sb)2Te3, facilitated by a low threshold current density of 1.5x10^9 A/m^2. Time-domain Hall voltage measurements using an oscilloscope reveal a strongly nonlinear and nonreciprocal Hall response during the magnetization reversal process. Fourier analysis of the time-varying Hall voltage identifies higher-harmonic signals and a rectified direct-current (DC) component, highlighting the complex interplay among the applied current, external magnetic field, and magnetization dynamics. Furthermore, a hysteretic behavior in the current-voltage characteristics gives rise to frequency mixing under dual-frequency excitation. This effect, distinct from conventional polynomial-based nonlinearities, allows for selective extraction of specific frequency components. The results demonstrate that AC excitation can not only switch magnetization efficiently but also induce tunable nonlinear responses, offering a new pathway for multifunctional spintronic devices with potential applications in energy-efficient memory, signal processing, and frequency conversion.

Authors: Neal Graneau
Abstract: The purpose of this work was to investigate historical claims of the existence of a longitudinal ElectroMagnetic (EM) force component acting on metallic atomic current elements in a direction parallel to the current flowing through them. This lies outside conventional textbook physics predictions, yet its existence has been indicated previously and if eventually confirmed will have a significant effect on physics theory and many technological applications, especially those involving high current density (> 10^9 A/m2). The experiment described here is based on the measurement of force on a copper armature submerged in a trough containing liquid metal through which constant DC current is passing. The coaxial symmetry of the experiment (CRE Coaxial Recoil Experiment) was able to limit all net force on the centred armature to the direction of interest, parallel to the current within it. All the experimental data related the measured forces on the armature to the current flowing through the circuit. Variations were made to the length and location of the armature along the central axis as well as modifications to the liquid metal configuration. Raw and processed results are presented, and an experimental technique described that revealed strong evidence for the existence of and discrimination between axial mechanical contact forces and longitudinal EM force. The original EM force law, proposed in 1822 by Ampere, includes a longitudinal component and has been found to be qualitatively consistent with all experiments to date, including these reported findings, and is considered a candidate explanatory theory.

Title: Corrosion of metal reinforcements within concrete and localisation of supporting reactions under natural conditions
Authors: T. Hageman, C. Andrade, E. Martínez-Pañeda
Abstract: Corrosion in concrete prevents in-situ observation, necessitating models to provide insight into the local reaction currents. We present a computational method for predicting corrosion rates of reinforcements within concrete under natural conditions, i.e. requiring the corrosion current to be supported by equal cathodic currents. In contrast to typical corrosion models, where these two counteracting currents are required to be co-located, we allow these currents to be separated such that pitting corrosion can be supported by cathodic reactions over a much larger area. Pitting corrosion is investigated, elucidating the effects of the concrete porosity and water saturation, the presence of dissolved oxygen, and chlorine concentration within the pore solution. The presented model is capable of capturing the dynamic growth of acidic regions around corrosion pits, showing the limited region over which the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs and how this region evolves over time. The ability of oxygen to diffuse towards the metal surface due to increased porosity is seen to have a major effect on the corrosion rate, whereas changes in the chlorine concentration (and thus changes in the conductivity of the pore solution) play a secondary role. Furthermore, external oxygen is seen to enhance corrosion but is not required to initialise and sustain acidic corrosion pits.

Title: The Exploratory Study on the Relationship Between the Failure of Distance Metrics in High-Dimensional Space and Emergent Phenomena
Authors: HongZheng Liu, YiNuo Tian, Zhiyue Wu
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework, integrating information theory and statistical mechanics, to connect metric failure in high-dimensional data with emergence in complex systems. We propose the "Information Dilution Theorem," demonstrating that as dimensionality ($d$) increases, the mutual information efficiency between geometric metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) and system states decays approximately as $O(1/d)$. This decay arises from the mismatch between linearly growing system entropy and sublinearly growing metric entropy, explaining the mechanism behind distance concentration. Building on this, we introduce information structural complexity ($C(S)$) based on the mutual information matrix spectrum and interaction encoding capacity ($C'$) derived from information bottleneck theory. The "Emergence Critical Theorem" states that when $C(S)$ exceeds $C'$, new global features inevitably emerge, satisfying a predefined mutual information threshold. This provides an operational criterion for self-organization and phase transitions. We discuss potential applications in physics, biology, and deep learning, suggesting potential directions like MI-based manifold learning (UMAP+) and offering a quantitative foundation for analyzing emergence across disciplines.

Title: PriM: Principle-Inspired Material Discovery through Multi-Agent Collaboration
Authors: Zheyuan Lai, Yingming Pu
Abstract: Complex chemical space and limited knowledge scope with biases holds immense challenge for human scientists, yet in automated materials discovery. Existing intelligent methods relies more on numerical computation, leading to inefficient exploration and results with hard-interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce a principles-guided material discovery system powered by language inferential multi-agent system (MAS), namely PriM. Our framework integrates automated hypothesis generation with experimental validation in a roundtable system of MAS, enabling systematic exploration while maintaining scientific rigor. Based on our framework, the case study of nano helix demonstrates higher materials exploration rate and property value while providing transparent reasoning pathways. This approach develops an automated-and-transparent paradigm for material discovery, with broad implications for rational design of functional materials. Code is publicly available at our \href{this https URL}{GitHub}.

Title: Effective-Field Theories of Analogue Gravity
Authors: Alessia Biondi
Abstract: We develop a novel method for building a gravitational analog model for a flowing Bose-Einstein condensate. The analogue metric is obtained using effective field theory methods, integrating out the heavy radial fluctuations. In this way, we also obtain interaction terms up to the quartic order in the fields. The microscopic Lagrangian describes a complex massive scalar field, with a global U(1) symmetry, that is spontaneously broken. From the quadratic effective Lagrangian, we obtain a dispersion law for phonons in presence of an acoustic horizon generated by the background flow. We observe that the phonon dispersion relation may exhibit a non-monotonic behavior determined by the Lagrangian's parameters. In this case, a non-trivial minimum appears associated with a characteristic length scale, indicating the breaking of translation symmetry. Then, we determine the constraints on the Lagrangian's parameters to make this happen. Finally, we design an original procedure to calculate the correlation functions through field theory tools. We apply this method to the density-density correlation function, reproducing known results. Moreover, we study the case of a non-monotonic phonon dispersion law, finding the existence of long range order.

Title: Engineering Dark Spin-Free Diamond Interfaces

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO2) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO2 interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in spin echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin depolarization with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits.

Title: Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries
Authors: Zijian Liang, Jens Niklas Eberhardt, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: We construct high-performance planar quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes with open boundaries, demonstrating substantially improved resource efficiency compared to the surface code. We present planar code families with logical dimensions ranging from $k=6$ to $k=13$ (e.g., $[[79, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[173, 8, 9]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[374, 10, 13]]$, $[[409, 11, 13]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$), all using local stabilizers of weight 6 or lower. These codes achieve an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) that is an order of magnitude greater than that of the surface code. They can be interpreted as planar bivariate bicycle codes, adapted from the original design based on a torus that is challenging to implement physically. Our construction method, which combines boundary anyon condensation with a novel "lattice grafting" optimization, circumvents this difficulty and produces codes featuring only local low-weight stabilizers suitable for 2D planar hardware architectures. Furthermore, we observe fractal logical operators in the form of Sierpinski triangles, with the code distances scaling proportionally to the area of the truncated fractal in finite systems. We anticipate that our codes and construction methods offer a promising pathway toward realizing near-term fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Title: Laser-induced spectral diffusion of T centers in silicon nanophotonic devices
Authors: Xueyue Zhang, Niccolo Fiaschi, Lukasz Komza, Hanbin Song, Thomas Schenkel, Alp Sipahigil
Abstract: Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.

Title: Fault-tolerant protocols through spacetime concatenation
Authors: Yichen Xu, Arpit Dua
Abstract: We introduce a framework called spacetime concatenation for fault-tolerant compilation of syndrome extraction circuits of stabilizer codes. Spacetime concatenation enables efficient compilation of syndrome extraction circuits into dynamical codes through structured gadget layouts and encoding matrices, facilitating low-weight measurements while preserving logical information. Our framework uses conditions that are sufficient for fault-tolerance of the dynamical code, including not measuring logical operators and preserving the spacetime distance. We construct explicit examples of dynamical codes using this framework, including the dynamical bivariate bicycle code and a dynamical Haah code, while illustrating their fault-tolerant properties. Furthermore, we analyze the classification and resource trade-offs of dynamical codes, demonstrating their adaptability to hardware constraints, including fabrication defects and qubit dropout scenarios.

Title: Universality of $SU(\infty)$ relaxation dynamics for $SU(n_f)$-symmetric spin-models
Authors: Duff Neill, Hanqing Liu
Abstract: Spin-models, where the $N$ spins interact pairwise with a $SU(n_f)$ symmetry preserving hamiltonian, famously simplify in the large $n_f$, $N$ limits, as derived by Sachdev and Ye when exploring mean-field behavior of spin-glasses. We present numerical evidence that for a large class of models, the large $n_f$ limit is not necessary: the same dynamical equations can describe the relaxation processes at high temperatures for a set of classical models inspired from mean-field treatments of interacting dense neutrino gases, up to times set by the radius of convergence of the perturbation series for the correlation function. After a simple rescaling of time, the dynamics display a surprising universality, being identical for any value of $n_f$ as long as the rank of the coupling matrix is small. As a corollary of our results, we find that the direct interaction approximation originating from the study of stochastic flows in fluid turbulence should be thought of as only a short-time approximation for generic random coupling systems.

Title: Bridging advection and diffusion in the encounter dynamics of sedimenting marine snow
Authors: Jan Turczynowicz, Radost Waszkiewicz, Jonasz Słomka, Maciej Lisicki
Abstract: Sinking marine snow particles, composed primarily of organic matter, control the global export of photosynthetically fixed carbon from the ocean surface to depth. The fate of sedimenting marine snow particles is in part regulated by their encounters with suspended, micron-sized objects, which leads to mass accretion by the particles and potentially alters their buoyancy, and with bacteria that can colonize the particles and degrade them. Their collision rates are typically calculated using two types of models focusing either on direct (ballistic) interception with a finite interaction range, or advective-diffusive capture with a zero interaction range. Since the range of applicability of the two models is unknown, and many relevant marine encounter scenarios span across both regimes, quantifying such encounters remains challenging, because the two models yield asymptotically different predictions at high Péclet numbers. Here, we reconcile the two limiting approaches by quantifying the encounters in the general case using a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Solving the advection-diffusion equation in Stokes flow around a sphere to model mass transfer to a large sinking particle by small yet finite-sized objects, we determine a new formula for the Sherwood number as a function of two dimensionless parameters: the Péclet number and the ratio of small to large particle sizes. We find that diffusion can play a significant role in generating encounters even at high Pe. At Pe as high as $10^6$, the direct interception model underestimates the encounter rate by up to two orders of magnitude. This overlooked contribution of diffusion to encounters suggests that important processes affecting the fate of marine snow, such as colonization by bacteria and plankton or accretion of neutrally buoyant gels, may proceed at a rate much faster than previously thought.

Title: Overcoming Discharge Inhibition in n-Butane Oxidation: Two-Component BaTiO3 and Mn-Cu Mixed Oxide Coatings
Authors: Timothy Oppotsch, Christian Oberste-Beulmann, Alexander Böddecker, Gerrit Hübner, Ihor Korolov, Peter Awakowicz, Martin Muhler
Abstract: A twin surface dielectric barrier discharge on the microsecond scale was used in combination with a two-component coating to oxidize 300 ppm n-butane as a model volatile organic compound to CO2 and H2O in synthetic air at room temperature and at 160 °C. The integration of BaTiO3 as a base material for the coating allowed the successful use of otherwise discharge-ignition-inhibiting materials such as MnO2-CuO applied as a full coating. Application of pure BaTiO3 led to highly porous coatings that do not hinder the discharge ignition and show a negligible influence on n-butane conversion while reducing byproduct formation. Thus, BaTiO3 was identified as a suitable structure-directing agent in two-component coatings, using 1:1 and 1:2 ratios of BaTiO3:catalyst coatings. Coated electrode configurations were compared to their respective uncoated state to highlight the coating-induced changes. The two-component coatings strongly increased the CO2 selectivity, reaching a maximum of 91.6 % at an energy density of 450 J/L and 160 °C for the 1:2 ratio, corresponding to an increase of 51.0 % relative to the uncoated electrode.

Title: Stability Control of Metastable States as a Unified Mechanism for Flexible Temporal Modulation in Cognitive Processing
Authors: Tomoki Kurikawa, Kunihiko Kaneko
Abstract: Flexible modulation of temporal dynamics in neural sequences underlies many cognitive processes. For instance, we can adaptively change the speed of motor sequences and speech. While such flexibility is influenced by various factors such as attention and context, the common neural mechanisms responsible for this modulation remain poorly understood. We developed a biologically plausible neural network model that incorporates neurons with multiple timescales and Hebbian learning rules. This model is capable of generating simple sequential patterns as well as performing delayed match-to-sample (DMS) tasks that require the retention of stimulus identity. Fast neural dynamics establish metastable states, while slow neural dynamics maintain task-relevant information and modulate the stability of these states to enable temporal processing. We systematically analyzed how factors such as neuronal gain, external input strength (contextual cues), and task difficulty influence the temporal properties of neural activity sequences - specifically, dwell time within patterns and transition times between successive patterns. We found that these factors flexibly modulate the stability of metastable states. Our findings provide a unified mechanism for understanding various forms of temporal modulation and suggest a novel computational role for neural timescale diversity in dynamically adapting cognitive performance to changing environmental demands.

Title: Strongly confined Mid-infrared to Terahertz Phonon Polaritons in Ultra-thin SrTiO3
Authors: Peiyi He, Jiade Li, Cong Li, Ning Li, Bo Han, Ruochen Shi, Ruishi Qi, Jinlong Du, Pu Yu, Peng Gao
Abstract: Surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) have emerged as a promising platform for subwavelength optical manipulation, offering distinct advantages for applications in infrared sensing, imaging, and optoelectronic devices. However, the narrow Reststrahlen bands of conventional polar materials impose significant limitations on their applications across the mid-infrared (MIR) to terahertz (THz) range. Addressing this challenge requires the development of materials capable of supporting SPhPs with broad spectral range, strong field confinement, slow group velocity, and high quality factor. Here, using monochromatic electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we demonstrate that ultra-thin SrTiO3 membranes encompass the exceptional properties mentioned above that have long been sought after. Systematic measurements across varying membrane thicknesses reveal two distinct SPhP branches characterized by wide spectral dispersion, high field confinement, and anomalously slow group velocities spanning from the MIR (68 ~ 99 meV) to THz (12 ~ 59 meV) range. Notably, in membranes approaching ~ 3 nm thickness (~ 8 unit cells), these polaritons exhibit unprecedented confinement factors exceeding 500 and group velocities as low as ~ 7 * 10-5 c, rivaling the best-performing van der Waals materials. These findings establish perovskite oxide such as SrTiO3 as a versatile platform for tailoring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, providing critical insights for the design of next-generation photonic devices requiring broadband operation and enhanced optical confinement.

Title: MatWheel: Addressing Data Scarcity in Materials Science Through Synthetic Data
Authors: Wentao Li, Yizhe Chen, Jiangjie Qiu, Xiaonan Wang
Abstract: Data scarcity and the high cost of annotation have long been persistent challenges in the field of materials science. Inspired by its potential in other fields like computer vision, we propose the MatWheel framework, which train the material property prediction model using the synthetic data generated by the conditional generative model. We explore two scenarios: fully-supervised and semi-supervised learning. Using CGCNN for property prediction and Con-CDVAE as the conditional generative model, experiments on two data-scarce material property datasets from Matminer database are conducted. Results show that synthetic data has potential in extreme data-scarce scenarios, achieving performance close to or exceeding that of real samples in all two tasks. We also find that pseudo-labels have little impact on generated data quality. Future work will integrate advanced models and optimize generation conditions to boost the effectiveness of the materials data flywheel.

Title: Adiabatic Encoding of Pre-trained MPS Classifiers into Quantum Circuits
Authors: Keisuke Murota
Abstract: Although Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) offer powerful methods for classification tasks, the training of QNNs faces two major training obstacles: barren plateaus and local minima. A promising solution is to first train a tensor-network (TN) model classically and then embed it into a QNN.\ However, embedding TN-classifiers into quantum circuits generally requires postselection whose success probability may decay exponentially with the system size. We propose an \emph{adiabatic encoding} framework that encodes pre-trained MPS-classifiers into quantum MPS (qMPS) circuits with postselection, and gradually removes the postselection while retaining performance. We prove that training qMPS-classifiers from scratch on a certain artificial dataset is exponentially hard due to barren plateaus, but our adiabatic encoding circumvents this issue. Additional numerical experiments on binary MNIST also confirm its robustness.

Title: Controlling Droplets at the Tips of Fibers
Authors: Mengfei He, Samay Hulikal, Marianna Marquardt, Hao Jiang, Anupam Pandey, Teng Zhang, Christian D. Santangelo, Joseph D. Paulsen
Abstract: Many complex wetting behaviors of fibrous materials are rooted in the behaviors of individual droplets attached to pairs of fibers. Here, we study the splitting of a droplet held between the tips of two cylindrical fibers. We discover a sharp transition between two post-rupture states, navigated by changing the angle between the rods, in agreement with our bifurcation analysis. Depinning of the bridge contact line can lead to a much larger asymmetry between the volume of liquid left on each rod. This second scenario enables the near-complete transfer of an aqueous glycerol droplet between two identical vinylpolysiloxane fibers. We leverage this response in a device that uses a ruck to pass a droplet along a train of fibers, a proof-of-concept for the geometric control of droplets on deformable, architected surfaces.

Title: Bending-compression coupling in extensible slender microswimmers
Authors: Kenta Ishimoto, Johann Herault, Clément Moreau
Abstract: Undulatory slender objects have been a central theme in the hydrodynamics of swimming at low Reynolds number, where the slender body is usually assumed to be inextensible, although some microorganisms and artificial microrobots largely deform with compression and extension. Here, we theoretically study the coupling between the bending and compression/extension shape modes, using a geometrical formulation of microswimmer hydrodynamics to deal with the non-commutative effects between translation and rotation. By means of a coarse-grained minimal model and systematic perturbation expansions for small bending and compression/extension, we analytically derive the swimming velocities and report three main findings. First, we revisit the role of anisotropy in the drag ratio of the resistive force theory and generally demonstrate that no motion is possible for uniform compression with isotropic drag. We then find that the bending-compression/extension coupling generates lateral and rotational motion, which enhances the swimmer's manoeuvrability, as well as changes in progressive velocity at a higher order of expansion, while the coupling effects depend on the phase difference between the two modes. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of often-overlooked Lie bracket contributions in computing net locomotion from a deformation gait. Our study sheds light on compression as a forgotten degree of freedom in swimmer locomotion, with important implications for microswimmer hydrodynamics, including understanding of biological locomotion mechanisms and design of microrobots.

Title: Dissipation induced localization-delocalization transition in a flat band
Authors: Mingdi Xu, Zijun Wei, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan
Abstract: The interplay between dissipation and localization in quantum systems has garnered significant attention due to its potential to manipulate transport properties and induce phase transitions. In this work, we explore the dissipation-induced extended-localized transition in a flat band model, where the system's asymptotic state can be controlled by tailored dissipative operators. By analyzing the steady-state density matrix and dissipative dynamics, we demonstrate that dissipation is able to drive the system to states dominated by either extended or localized modes, irrespective of the initial conditions. The control mechanism relies on the phase properties of the dissipative operators, which selectively favor specific eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Our findings reveal that dissipation can be harnessed to induce transitions between extended and localized phases, offering a novel approach to manipulate quantum transport in flat band systems. This work not only deepens our understanding of dissipation-induced phenomena in flat band systems but also provides a new avenue for controlling quantum states in open systems.

Title: Variational principle for the time evolution operator, its usefulness in effective theories of condensed matter systems and a glimpse into the role played by the quantum geometry of unitary transformations
Authors: Michael Vogl
Abstract: This work discusses a variational approach to determining the time evolution operator. We directly see a glimpse of how a generalization of the quantum geometric tensor for unitary operators plays a central role in parameter evolution. We try the method with the simplest ansatz (a power series in a time-independent Hamiltonian), which yields considerable improvements over a Taylor series. These improvements are because, unlike for a Taylor series of $\exp(-iHt)$, time $t$ is not forced to appear in the same order as $H$, giving more flexibility for the description. We demonstrate that our results can also be employed to improve degenerate perturbation theory in a non-perturbative fashion. We concede that our approach described here is most useful for finite-dimensional Hamiltonians. As a first example of applications to perturbation theory, we present AB bilayer graphene, which we downfolded to a 2x2 model; our energy results considerably improve typical second-order degenerate perturbation theory. We then demonstrate that the approach can also be used to derive a non-perturbatively valid Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Here, the approach for a finite-size lattice yields excellent results. However, the corrections are not ideal for the thermodynamic limit (they depend on the number of sites $N$). Nevertheless, the approach adds almost no additional technical complications over typical perturbative expansions of unitary operators, making it ready for deployment in physics questions. One should expect considerably improved couplings for the degenerate perturbation theory of finite-size systems. More work is needed in the many-body case, and we suggest a possible remedy to issues with the thermodynamic limit. Our work hints at how the appearance of mathematically beautiful concepts like quantum geometry can indicate an opportunity to dig for approximations beyond typical perturbation theory

Title: Dynamical spatial light modulation in the ultraviolet spectral range
Authors: Maximilian Ammenwerth, Hendrik Timme, Veronica Giardini, Renhao Tao, Flavien Gyger, Ohad Lib, Dirk Berndt, Dimitrios Kourkoulos, Tim Rom, Immanuel Bloch, Johannes Zeiher
Abstract: Spatial light modulators enable arbitrary control of the intensity of optical light fields and facilitate a variety of applications in biology, astronomy and atomic, molecular and optical physics. For coherent light fields, holography, implemented through arbitrary phase modulation, represents a highly power-efficient technique to shape the intensity of light patterns. Here, we introduce and benchmark a novel spatial light modulator based on a piston micro-mirror array. In particular, we utilize the reflection-based device to demonstrate arbitrary beam shaping in the ultraviolet regime at a wavelength of 322 nm. We correct aberrations of the reflected wavefront and show that the modulator does not add detectable excess phase noise to the reflected light field. We utilize the intrinsically low latency of the architecture to demonstrate fast switching of arbitrary light patterns synchronized with short laser pulses at an update rate of 1 kHz. Finally, we outline how the modulator can act as an important component of a zone-based architecture for a neutral-atom quantum computer or simulator, including ultraviolet wavelengths.

Title: Nonequilibrium plasmon fluid in a Josephson junction chain
Authors: Anton V. Bubis, Lucia Vigliotti, Maksym Serbyn, Andrew P. Higginbotham
Abstract: Equilibrium quantum systems are often described by a collection of weakly-interacting normal modes. Bringing such systems far from equilibrium, however, can drastically enhance mode-to-mode interactions. Understanding the resulting quantum fluid is a fundamental question for quantum statistical mechanics, and a practical question for engineering driven quantum devices. To tackle this question, we probe the nonequilibrium kinetics of one-dimensional plasmons in a long chain of Josephson junctions. We introduce multimode spectroscopy to controllably study the departure from equilibrium, witnessing the evolution from pairwise coupling between plasma modes at weak driving to dramatic, high-order, cascaded couplings at strong driving. Scaling to many-mode drives, we stimulate interactions between hundreds of modes, resulting in near-continuum internal dynamics. Imaging the resulting nonequilibrium plasmon populations, we then resolve the non-local redistribution of energy in the response to a weak perturbation -- an explicit verification of the emergence of a strongly interacting, non-equilibrium fluid of plasmons.

Title: Dynamical symmetries in the fluctuation-driven regime: an application of Noether's theorem to noisy dynamical systems
Authors: John J. Vastola
Abstract: Noether's theorem provides a powerful link between continuous symmetries and conserved quantities for systems governed by some variational principle. Perhaps unfortunately, most dynamical systems of interest in neuroscience and artificial intelligence cannot be described by any such principle. On the other hand, nonequilibrium physics provides a variational principle that describes how fairly generic noisy dynamical systems are most likely to transition between two states; in this work, we exploit this principle to apply Noether's theorem, and hence learn about how the continuous symmetries of dynamical systems constrain their most likely trajectories. We identify analogues of the conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum, and briefly discuss examples of each in the context of models of decision-making, recurrent neural networks, and diffusion generative models.

Title: Quantum Phase diagrams and transitions for Chern topological insulators
Authors: Ralph M. Kaufmann, Mohamad Mousa, Birgit Wehefritz-Kaufmann
Abstract: Topological invariants such as Chern classes are by now a standard way to classify topological phases. Varying systems in a family leads to phase diagrams, where the Chern classes may jump when crossingn a critical locus. These systems appear naturally when considering slicing of higher dimensional systems or when considering systems with parameters. As the Chern classes are topological invariants, they can only change if the ``topology breaks down''. We give a precise mathematical formulation of this phenomenon and show that synthetically any phase diagram of Chern topological phases can be designed and realized by a physical system, using covering, aka.\ winding maps. Here we provide explicit families realizing arbitrary Chern jumps. The critical locus of these maps is described by the classical rose curves. These give a lower bond on the number of Dirac points in general that is sharp for 2-level systems. In the process, we treat several concrete models. In particular, we treat the lattices and tight--binding models, and show that effective winding maps can be achieved using $k$--th nearest neighbors. We give explicit formulas for a family of 2D lattices using imaginary quadratic field extensions and their norms. This includes the square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices

Title: Simultaneous Multiphoton-Multiatom Processes in Atomic Gases and Their Application in Enhancing Ultraweak Atomic Absorption Transitions
Authors: Yongle Yu
Abstract: We investigate simultaneous multiphoton-multiatom (MPMA) processes in atomic gases subjected to laser fields. Our study reveals that the composite factor governing the transition rate of these processes can reach extraordinarily high magnitudes, with an intrinsic regulation mechanism causing the rate to exhibit near-saturation behavior. By integrating an MPMA process into an ultraweak atomic absorption transition, a substantial enhancement of the overall transition rate can be achieved. This enhancement enables the detection of transitions that would otherwise remain undetectable, thereby opening new avenues for exploring ultraweak quantum phenomena in atomic systems.

Title: Topological $π/2$ modes in photonic waveguide arrays
Authors: Gang Jiang, Siyuan Zhang, Weiwei Zhu, Y. X. Zhao, Haoran Xue
Abstract: Periodic driving is a powerful tool to generate exotic topological phases without static counterparts, such as the anomalous chiral edge modes from bulk bands with zero Chern number and topological $\pi$ modes exhibiting period-doubled dynamics. Recently, a new class of Floquet topological mode, namely the $\pi/2$ mode, which carries four-period periodicity and has potential applications in quantum computing, was proposed based on a square-root method and realized in an acoustic system. Here we propose a laser-written waveguide array lattice to realize topological $\pi/2$ modes in photonics. Our photonic model simulates a square-root periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and has a rich phase diagram allowing for the co-existence of conventional zero, $\pi$ modes, and the new $\pi/2$ modes. Through numerical simulations of the wave equation, we uncover the unique four-period evolution feature of the $\pi/2$ modes. Our model, which only contains four waveguides per unit cell and two driving steps, is easy to implement with current fabrication techniques and may find applications in quantum optics.

Title: Collective Superradiance: Estimating the Peak Emission Rate and Time
Authors: Raphael Holzinger, Susanne Yelin
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.

Title: Dissipation-Induced Threshold on Integrability Footprints
Authors: Rodrigo M. C. Pereira, Nadir Samos Sáenz de Buruaga, Kristian Wold, Lucas Sá, Sergey Denisov, Pedro Ribeiro
Abstract: The presence of a dissipative environment disrupts the unitary spectrum of dynamical quantum maps. Nevertheless, key features of the underlying unitary dynamics -- such as their integrable or chaotic nature -- are not immediately erased by dissipation. To investigate this, we model dissipation as a convex combination of a unitary evolution and a random Kraus map, and study how signatures of integrability fade as dissipation strength increases. Our analysis shows that in the weakly dissipative regime, the complex eigenvalue spectrum organizes into well-defined, high-density clusters. We estimate the critical dissipation threshold beyond which these clusters disappear, rendering the dynamics indistinguishable from chaotic evolution. This threshold depends only on the number of spectral clusters and the rank of the random Kraus operator. To characterize this transition, we introduce the eigenvalue angular velocity as a diagnostic of integrability loss. We illustrate our findings through several integrable quantum circuits, including the dissipative quantum Fourier transform. Our results provide a quantitative picture of how noise gradually erases the footprints of integrability in open quantum systems.

Title: Elastic Planetoids
Authors: Bartosz Żbik, Andrzej Odrzywołek
Abstract: Modeling the internal structure of self-gravitating solid and liquid bodies presents a challenge, as existing approaches are often limited to either overly simplistic constant-density approximations or more complex numerical equations of state. We present a detailed analysis of a tractable and physically motivated model for perfectly elastic, spherically symmetric self-gravitating bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model employs a logarithmic equation of state (logotropic EOS) with a non-zero initial density and constant bulk modulus. Importantly, scaling properties of the model allow all solutions to be derived from a single, universal solution of an ordinary differential equation, resembling the Lane-Emden and Chandrasekhar models. The model provides new insights into stability issues and reveals oscillatory asymptotic behavior in the mass-radius relation, including the existence of both a maximum mass and a maximum radius. We derive useful, simple analytical approximations for key properties, such as central overdensity, moment of inertia, binding energy, and gravitational potential, applicable to small, metallic bodies like asteroids and moons. These new approximations could aid future research, including space mining and the scientific characterization of small Solar System bodies.

Title: Quantum Liouvillian Tomography
Authors: Diogo Aguiar, Kristian Wold, Sergey Denisov, Pedro Ribeiro
Abstract: Characterization of near-term quantum computing platforms requires the ability to capture and quantify dissipative effects. This is an inherently challenging task, as these effects are multifaceted, spanning a broad spectrum from Markovian to strongly non-Markovian dynamics. We introduce Quantum Liouvillian Tomography (QLT), a protocol to capture and quantify non-Markovian effects in time-continuous quantum dynamics. The protocol leverages gradient-based quantum process tomography to reconstruct dynamical maps and utilizes regression over the derivatives of Pauli string probability distributions to extract the Liouvillian governing the dynamics. We benchmark the protocol using synthetic data and quantify its accuracy in recovering Hamiltonians, jump operators, and dissipation rates for two-qubit systems. Finally, we apply QLT to analyze the evolution of an idling two-qubit system implemented on a superconducting quantum platform to extract characteristics of Hamiltonian and dissipative components and, as a result, detect inherently non-Markovian dynamics. Our work introduces the first protocol capable of retrieving generators of generic open quantum evolution from experimental data, thus enabling more precise characterization of many-body non-Markovian effects in near-term quantum computing platforms.

Title: Purcell-enhanced quantum adsorption
Authors: Dennis P. Clougherty
Abstract: Cold atoms can adsorb to a surface with the emission of a single phonon when the binding energy is sufficiently small. The effects of phonon damping and adsorbent size on the adsorption rate in this quantum regime are studied using the multimode Rabi model. It is demonstrated that the adsorption rate can be either enhanced or suppressed relative to the Fermi golden rule rate, in analogy to cavity effects in the spontaneous emission rate in QED. A mesoscopic-sized adsorbent behaves as an acoustic cavity that enhances the adsorption rate when tuned to the adsorption transition frequency and suppresses the rate when detuned. This acoustic cavity effect occurs in the regime where the frequency spacing between vibrational modes exceeds the phonon linewidth.

Title: Overcoming light scattering with high optical nonlinearity
Authors: Pawel Szczypkowski, Adrian Makowski, Wojciech Zwoliński, Katarzyna Prorok, Artur Bednarkiewicz, Radek Lapkiewicz
Abstract: Achieving high-resolution optical imaging deep within heterogeneous and scattering media remains a fundamental challenge in biological microscopy, where conventional techniques are hindered by multiple light scattering and absorption. Here, we present a non-invasive imaging approach that harnesses the nonlinear response of luminescent labels in conjunction with the statistical and spatial properties of speckle patterns - an effect of random light interference. Using avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs) with strong photoluminescence nonlinearity, we demonstrate that random speckle illumination can be converted into a single, localized, sub-diffraction excitation spot. This spot can be scanned across the sample using the angular memory effect, enabling high-resolution imaging through a scattering layer. Our method is general, fast, and cost-effective. It requires no wavefront shaping, no feedback, and no reconstruction algorithm, offering a powerful new route to deep, high-resolution imaging through complex media.

Title: Donor-Acceptor Pairs near Silicon Carbide surfaces
Authors: Anil Bilgin, Ian N. Hammock, Alexander A. High, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.

Title: Theoretical bound of the efficiency of learning
Authors: Shanhe Su, Ousi Pan, Shihao Xia, Jincan Chen, Chikako Uchiyama
Abstract: A unified thermodynamic formalism describing the efficiency of learning is proposed. First, we derive an inequality, which is more strength than Clausius's inequality, revealing the lower bound of the entropy-production rate of a subsystem. Second, the inequality is transformed to determine the general upper limit for the efficiency of learning. In particular, we exemplify the bound of the efficiency in nonequilibrium quantum-dot systems and networks of living cells. The framework provides a fundamental trade-off relationship between energy and information inheriting in stochastic thermodynamic processes.

Title: Elastic anisotropy in heterogeneous materials
Authors: Abhilash M Nagaraja
Abstract: Heterogeneous materials exhibit anisotropy which is influenced by factors such as individual phase properties and microstructural configuration that form crucial descriptors of heterogeneity. A review of anisotropy indices proposed in the context of single crystals reveals that they do not account for the descriptors of heterogeneity limiting their utility in heterogeneous materials. To address this shortcoming, this work presents a novel approach to quantify elastic anisotropy in heterogeneous materials utilizing their effective elastic properties. Anisotropy quantification has been demonstrated considering two phase composite materials highlighting the crucial role of constituent volume fractions, secondary phase shape, and elastic contrast in influencing the extent of anisotropy. Additionally, specific material and microstructural descriptors leading to overall isotropy in composite materials are validated and an extension of the approach to account for defects such as porosity and cracks is presented. The presented results demonstrate the applicability of the anisotropy quantification approach to any configuration of heterogeneous materials.

Title: Equilibration of Topological Defects Near the Deconfined Quantum Multicritical Point
Authors: Yu-Rong Shu, Shao-Kai Jian, Anders W. Sandvik, Shuai Yin
Abstract: Deconfined quantum criticality (DQC) arises from fractionalization of quasi-particles and leads to fascinating behaviors beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson description of phase transitions. Here, we study the critical dynamics when driving a two-dimensional quantum magnet through a weakly first-order transition point near a putative deconfined multicritical point separating antiferromagnetic and spontaneously dimerized ground states. Numerical simulations show that the conventional Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS) mechanism is inadequate for describing the annealing process. We introduce the concept of dual asymmetric KZS, where both a pseudocritical relaxation time and the deconfinement time enter and the scaling also depends on the driving direction according to a duality principle connecting the topological defects in the two phases. These defects require a much longer time scale for equilibration than the amplitude of the order parameter. Beyond advancing the DQC scenario, our scaling approach provides a new window into out-of-equilibrium criticality with multiple length and time scales.

Title: Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks
Authors: Uday S. Goteti, Robert C. Dynes
Abstract: Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Numerical simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems, leading to two universal laws describing the nature of information dynamics.

Title: Operator dynamics in Floquet many-body systems
Authors: Takato Yoshimura, Samuel J. Garratt, J. T. Chalker
Abstract: We study operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems, focusing on generic features of systems that are ergodic, spatially extended, and lack conserved densities. Quantum circuits of various types provide simple models for such systems. We focus on Floquet quantum circuits, comparing their behaviour with what has been found previously for circuits that are random in time. Floquet circuits, which have discrete time-translation symmetry, represent an intermediate case between circuits that are random in time and lack any symmetry, and systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian and continuous time-translation invariance. By making this comparison, one of our aims is to identify signatures of time-translation symmetry in Floquet operator dynamics. To characterise behaviour we examine a variety of quantities in solvable models and numerically: operator autocorrelation functions; the partial spectral form factor; the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC); and the paths in operator space that make the dominant contributions to the ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions. Our most striking result is that ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions show behaviour that is distinctively different in Floquet systems compared to systems in which successive time-steps are independent. Specifically, while average autocorrelation functions decay on a microscopic timescale for circuits that are random in time, in Floquet systems they have a late-time tail with a duration that grows parametrically with the size of the operator support. The existence of these tails provides a way to understand deviations of the spectral form factor from random matrix behaviour at times shorter than the Thouless time. In contrast to this feature in autocorrelation functions, we find no new aspects to the behaviour of OTOCs for Floquet models compared to random-in-time circuits.

Title: Dynamics of a Nonequilibrium Discontinuous Quantum Phase Transition in a Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Matthew T. Wheeler, Hayder Salman, Magnus O. Borgh
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions lead to the production of topological defects or domain walls in a wide range of physical systems. In second-order transitions, these exhibit universal scaling laws described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, but for first-order transitions a similarly universal approach is still lacking. Here we propose a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate as a testbed system where critical scaling behavior in a first-order quantum phase transition can be understood from generic properties. We demonstrate the applicability of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for this transition to determine the critical exponents for: (1) the onset of the decay of the metastable state on short times scales, and (2) the number of resulting phase-separated ferromagnetic domains at longer times, as a one-dimensional spin-1 condensate is ramped across a first-order quantum phase transition. The predictions are in excellent agreement with mean-field numerical simulations and provide a paradigm for studying the decay of metastable states in experimentally accessible systems.

Title: Non-local origin and correlations in the Johnson noise at nonuniform temperatures
Authors: Jorge Berger, Guy Katriel
Abstract: We propose an alternative scenario for the propagation of thermal noise in a conductor. In this scenario, the noise in the emf (electromotive force) between two terminals cannot be described as a sum of contributions from uncorrelated regions, each in local thermal equilibrium. We review previous studies of thermal noise in circuits with nonuniform temperature. We suggest experiments that could distinguish between different scenarios. We build a workable 1D model for a gas of particles that undergo stochastic collisions with the lattice and exert distance-dependent forces on each other. We enunciate definitions of current, voltage, and emf, appropriate to a wire with limited number of particles. For uniform temperature, within appropriate length and temperature ranges, our simulations comply with Nyquist's result. Analytic results can be obtained in the limit of strong interparticle interaction. The simulations indicate that (1) thermal noise in a resistor at uniform temperature within an electric circuit can be larger (smaller) than predicted by Nyquist due to the presence of a resistor with higher (lower) temperature in the circuit; (2) for sufficiently long circuits, the deviation from the Nyquist prediction is inversely proportional to the distance between the centers of the resistors; (3) if the resistors differ in temperature, their emf can be correlated, even if they are detached. The long-range repulsion between charges in electrically connected resistors may have conceptual and technological impact in nanodevices.

Title: Magnon hydrodynamics in an atomically-thin ferromagnet

Abstract: Strong interactions between particles can lead to emergent collective excitations. These phenomena have been extensively established in electronic systems, but are also expected to occur for gases of neutral particles like magnons, i.e. spin waves, in magnets. In a hydrodynamic regime where magnons are strongly interacting, they can form a slow collective density mode -- in analogy to sound waves in water -- with characteristic low-frequency signatures. While such a mode has been predicted in theory, its signatures have yet to be observed experimentally. In this work, we isolate exfoliated sheets of CrCl$_3$ where magnon interactions are strong, and develop a technique to measure its collective magnon dynamics via the quantum coherence of nearby Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We find that the thermal magnetic fluctuations generated by monolayer CrCl$_3$ exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence, whereby fluctuations increase upon decreasing temperature. Our analysis suggests that this anomalous trend is a consequence of the damping rate of a low-energy magnon sound mode which sharpens as magnon interactions increase with increasing temperature. By measuring the magnetic fluctuations emitted by thin multilayer CrCl$_{3}$ in the presence of a variable-frequency drive field, we observe spectroscopic evidence for this two-dimensional magnon sound mode.

Title: The trimer paradox: the effect of stiff constraints on equilibrium distributions in overdamped dynamics
Authors: Radost Waszkiewicz, Maciej Lisicki
Abstract: We reconsider the classical problem of a freely joined chain of Brownian particles connected by elastic springs and study its conformational probability distribution function in the overdamped regime in the limit of infinite stiffness of constraints. We show that the well-known solution by Fixman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 71, 3050 (1974)] is missing a shape-related term, later alluded to but not computed by Helfand [J. Chem. Phys 71, 5000 (1979)]. In our approach, the shape term, also termed zero-point energy, arises explicitly from a careful treatment of the distributional limit. We present a computationally feasible method for the calculation of the shape term and demonstrate its validity in a couple of examples.

Title: Geometric superfluid weight of composite bands in multiorbital superconductors
Authors: Guodong Jiang, Yafis Barlas
Abstract: The superfluid weight of an isolated flat band in multi-orbital superconductors contains contributions from the band's quantum metric and a lattice geometric term that depends on the orbital positions in the lattice. Since the superfluid weight is a measure of the superconductor's energy fluctuation, it is independent of the lattice geometry, leading to the minimal quantum metric of a band [Phys. Rev. B 106, 014518 (2022)]. Here, a perturbation approach is developed to study the superfluid weight and its lattice geometric dependence for composite bands. When all orbitals exhibit uniform pairing, the quantum geometric term contains each band's contribution and an inter-band contribution between every pair of bands in the composite. Based on a band representation analysis, they provide a topological lower bound for the superfluid weight of an isolated composite of flat bands. Using this perturbation approach, an analytical expression of the lattice geometric contribution is obtained. It is expressed in terms of Bloch functions, providing a convenient formula to calculate the superfluid weight for multi-orbital superconductors.

Title: Observation of Unprecedented Fractional Magnetization Plateaus in a New Shastry-Sutherland Ising Compound
Authors: Lalit Yadav, Afonso Rufino, Rabindranath Bag, Matthew Ennis, Jan Alexander Koziol, Clarina dela Cruz, Alexander I. Kolesnikov, V. Ovidiu Garlea, Keith M. Taddei, David Graf, Kai Phillip Schmidt, Frédéric Mila, Sara Haravifard
Abstract: Geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, such as those based on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL), offer a rich playground for exploring unconventional magnetic states. The delicate balance between competing interactions in these systems leads to the emergence of novel phases. We present the characterization of Er2Be2GeO7, an SSL compound with Er3+ ions forming orthogonal dimers separated by non-magnetic layers whose structure is invariant under the P-421m space group. Neutron scattering reveals an antiferromagnetic dimer structure at zero field, typical of Ising spins on that lattice and consistent with the anisotropic magnetization observed. However, magnetization measurements exhibit fractional plateaus at 1/4 and 1/2 of saturation, in contrast to the expected 1/3 plateau of the SSL Ising model. By comparing the energy of candidate states with ground-state lower bounds we show that this behavior requires spatially anisotropic interactions, leading to an anisotropic Shastry-Sutherland Ising Model (ASSLIM) symmetric under the Cmm2 space group. This anisotropy is consistent with the small orthorhombic distortion observed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The other properties, including thermodynamics, which have been investigated theoretically using tensor networks, point to small residual interactions, potentially due to further couplings and quantum fluctuations. This study highlights Er2Ge2GeO7 as a promising platform for investigating exotic magnetic phenomena.

Title: Projected Augmented Waves (PAW): extended resolution of unity method
Authors: Garry Goldstein
Abstract: The Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) method is based on a linear transformation between the pseudo wavefunctions and the all electron wavefunctions. To obtain high accuracy with this method, it is important that the local part of the linear transform (inside each atomic sphere) be defined over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work and without modifying the transformation in any significant way thereby making the modifications we propose easy to implement in current electronic structure codes for PAW.. This is done by extending the resolution of unity used for the transform to include more smooth wavefunctions (which have nothing to do with the atomic problem) and having them linearly transform via the identity.

Title: Detecting Thermodynamic Phase Transition via Explainable Machine Learning of Photoemission Spectroscopy
Authors: Xu Chen, Yuanjie Sun, Eugen Hruska, Vivek Dixit, Jinming Yang, Yu He, Yao Wang, Fang Liu
Abstract: Identifying thermodynamic signatures of electronic phases, such as superconductivity, is challenging in low-dimensional materials due to strong fluctuations and low probing volume. Spectroscopic methods are often used to identify new bulk phases, but their main measurable quantity -- electronic energy gaps -- is no longer an effective order parameter in low-dimensional and fluctuating systems. Combining angle-resolved photoemission with a domain-adversarial neural network, we report a data-driven method to identify thermodynamic phase transitions solely based on single-particle spectra. We demonstrate 97.6$\%$ accuracy in cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ with strong superconducting fluctuations. This model notably compensates for the scarcity of experimental data by leveraging virtually inexhaustible simulated data. Further, its explainability reveals the crucial role of in-gap spectral weight in detecting phase fluctuations and thermodynamic transitions. Our work pinpoints the spectroscopic signatures of fluctuating orders and enables using spectroscopy for machine-learning-assisted material discovery for low-dimensional and strong coupling systems.

Title: Topological Corner States in Bilayer and Trilayer Systems with Vertically Stacked Topological Heterostructures
Authors: Natsuko Ishida, Motohiko Ezawa, Guangtai Lu, Wenbo Lin, Yasutomo Ota, Yasuhiko Arakawa, Satoshi Iwamoto
Abstract: We investigate bilayer and trilayer systems composed of topologically distinct, vertically stacked layers, forming topological heterostructures based on the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. We find that a topological phase transition induced by interlayer coupling significantly alters the number of corner states in these topological structures. Furthermore, we find that traditional nested Wilson loop analysis inaccurately classifies certain phases, leading us to evaluate multipole chiral numbers (MCNs) as a more appropriate topological invariant for this scenario. The MCNs not only enable accurate classification of topological phases but also directly correspond to the number of zero-energy corner states, effectively characterizing $\mathbb{Z}$-class HOTI phases. Our study proposes the novel concept of topological heterostructures, providing critical insights into the control of localized corner states within multilayer systems and expanding potential research directions.

Title: Using operator covariance to disentangle scaling dimensions in lattice models
Authors: Anders W. Sandvik
Abstract: In critical lattice models, distance ($r$) dependent correlation functions contain power laws $r^{-2\Delta}$ governed by scaling dimensions $\Delta$ of an underlying continuum field theory. In Monte Carlo simulations, the leading dimensions can be extracted by data fitting, which is difficult when two or more powers contribute significantly. Here a method utilizing covariance between multiple lattice operators is developed where the $r$ dependent eigenvalues of the covariance matrix reflect scaling dimensions of individual field operators. This disentangling is demonstrated explicitly for conformal field theories. The scheme is first tested on the critical point of the 2D Ising model, where the two primary scaling dimensions and their respective two lowest descendant dimensions are extracted. The 3D Ising model is studied next, revealing the two relevant primaries and their lowest descendants to high precision. The 2D tricritical Ising point is studied with the Blume-Capel model. Here the scaling dimensions of all three symmetric primary operators are successfully isolated along with the leading descendants. The eigenvectors are also studied and give useful information on the boundary between the ordered and disordered phases in the neighborhood of the tricritical point. Finally, the crossover from regular to tricritical Ising scaling is investigated on several points on the phase boundary of the Blume-Capel model away from its tricritical point. The scaling of the eigenvalues corresponding to tricritical descendant operators are found to be remarkably stable even far from the tricritical point. The covariance method represents a simple extension of standard analysis of correlation functions and can significantly enhance the utility of Monte Carlo simulations and other computational methods in studies of criticality, in particular conformal critical points.

Authors: M.V. Sadovskii
Abstract: We present simple qualitative estimates for the maximal superconducting transition temperature, which may be achieved due to electron - phonon coupling in Eliashberg-McMillan theory. It is shown that in the limit of very strong coupling the upper limit for transition temperature is determined in fact by a combination of atomic constants and density of conduction electrons.

Title: Superfluid weight cross-over and critical temperature enhancement in singular flat bands
Authors: Guodong Jiang, Päivi Törmä, Yafis Barlas
Abstract: Non-analytic Bloch eigenstates at isolated band degeneracy points exhibit singular behavior in the quantum metric. Here, a description of superfluid weight for zero-energy flat bands in proximity to other high-energy bands is presented, where they together form a singular band gap system. When the singular band gap closes, the geometric and conventional contributions to the superfluid weight as a function of the superconducting gap exhibit different crossover behaviors. The scaling behavior of superfluid weight with the band gap is studied in detail, and the effect on the Berezinskii-KosterlitzThouless (BKT) transition temperature is explored. It is discovered that tuning the singular band gap provides a unique mechanism for enhancing the supercurrent and critical temperature of two-dimensional (2D) superconductors.

Abstract: We present the first polarized neutron transmission image of a model Neel ferrimagnetic material, polycrystalline terbium iron garnet (Tb3Fe5O12, TbIG for short), as it is taken through its compensation temperature Tcomp where the macroscopic magnetization vanishes. Our polarized neutron imaging data and the additional supporting measurements using neutron spin echo spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry are all consistent with a vanishing internal magnetization at Tcomp.

Title: Low-energy critical behavior in two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals driven by fermion-fermion interactions
Authors: Wen Liu, Wen-Hao Bian, Xiao-Zhuo Chu, Jing Wang
Abstract: Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.

Title: Entanglement Spectrum Dynamics as a Probe for Non-Hermitian Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in Systems with Periodic Boundaries
Authors: Pablo Bayona-Pena, Ryo Hanai, Takashi Mori, Hisao Hayakawa
Abstract: It has recently been established that open quantum systems may exhibit a strong spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions, known as the non-Hermitian/Liouvillian skin effect (NHSE/LSE), making the topological properties of the system boundary-condition sensitive. In this Letter, we ask the query: Can topological phase transitions of open quantum systems, captured by open boundary conditioned invariants, be observed in the dynamics of a system in a periodic boundary condition, even in the presence of NHSE/LSE? We affirmatively respond to this question, by considering the quench dynamics of entanglement spectrum in a periodic open quantum fermionic system. We demonstrate that the entanglement spectrum exhibits zero-crossings only when this periodic system is quenched from a topologically trivial to non-trivial phase, defined from the spectrum in open boundary conditions, even in systems featuring LSE. Our results reveal that non-Hermitian topological phases leave a distinctive imprint on the unconditional dynamics within a subsystem of fermionic systems.

Title: Magneto-optical spectra of an organic antiferromagnet as a candidate for an altermagnet
Authors: Satoshi Iguchi, Hiroki Kobayashi, Yuka Ikemoto, Tetsuya Furukawa, Hirotake Itoh, Shinichiro Iwai, Taro Moriwaki, Takahiko Sasaki
Abstract: We have measured the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) in an orthorhombic organic antiferromagnet $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl, which is a candidate for an altermagnet. From the Maxwell equations, we derived matrix-type general formulae describing the optical propagation and reflection for arbitrary crystals. These formulae enabled us to correctly measure and obtain the off-diagonal optical responses of $\kappa$-Cl. The MOKE of $\kappa$-Cl appeared at around the Néel temperature and exhibited a nonlinear field dependence in the antiferromagnetic phase. These nonlinear field dependence eliminates a simple origin due to the net canted magnetization. The obtained off-diagonal optical conductivity spectra for almost entire $\pi$-electron band clearly shows three features. One is the large peaks at the spectral ends due to the magnetic origin with the large energy scale compared to the very small spin-orbit interaction in $\kappa$-Cl. The others are the middle region spectra proportional to the diagonal conductivities, possibly related to the symmetric piezomagnetic effect and the standard antisymmetric origins. These results suggest the altermagnetic response of $\kappa$-Cl. We also discuss the analogy between the magnetization in ferromagnets and the net magnetization and Néel vector with respect to the magneto-optical configurations.

Title: Thickness-dependent conductivity of nanometric semiconductor thin films
Authors: Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of semiconductor thin films that are only a few nanometers thick. In spite of intense research, the thickness-dependent resistivity or conductivity of semiconductor thin films is not understood at a fundamental physical level. We develop a theory based on quantum confinement which yields the dependence of the concentration of intrinsic carriers on the film thickness. The theory predicts that the resistivity $\rho$, in the 1-10 nm thickness range, increases exponentially as $\rho \sim \exp(const/L^{1/2})$ upon decreasing the film thickness $L$. This law is able to reproduce the remarkable increase in resistivity observed experimentally in Si thin films, whereas the effect of surface scattering (Fuchs-Sondheimer theory) alone cannot explain the data when the film thickness is lower than 10 nm.

Title: Electrical Transport in Tunably-Disordered Metamaterials
Authors: Caitlyn Obrero, Mastawal Tirfe, Carmen Lee, Sourabh Saptarshi, Christopher Rock, Karen E. Daniels, Katherine A. Newhall
Abstract: Naturally occurring materials are often disordered, with their bulk properties being challenging to predict from the structure, due to the lack of underlying crystalline axes. In this paper, we develop a digital pipeline from algorithmically-created configurations with tunable disorder to 3D printed materials, as a tool to aid in the study of such materials, using electrical resistance as a test case. The designed material begins with a random point cloud that is iteratively evolved using Lloyd's algorithm to approach uniformity, with the points being connected via a Delaunay triangulation to form a disordered network metamaterial. Utilizing laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing with stainless steel 17-4 PH and titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, we are able to experimentally measure the bulk electrical resistivity of the disordered network. The effective resistance of the structure calculated from the combinatorial weighted graph Laplacian is in good agreement with experimental data. However, the effective resistance is sensitive to anisotropy and global network topology, preventing a single network statistic or disorder characterization from predicting global resistivity.

Title: Specific heat of Gd$^{3+}$- and Eu$^{2+}$-based magnetic compounds
Authors: D. J. Garcia, J. G. Sereni, A. A. Aligia
Abstract: We have studied theoretically the specific heat of a large number of non-frustrated magnetic structures described by the Heisenberg model for systems with total angular momentum $J=7/2$, corresponding to the 4f$^7$ configuration of Gd$^{+3}$ and Eu$^{+2}$. For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors, which dictates the extent of quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. Our work opens the possibility of describing the specific heat of 4f$^7$ systems within a general framework.

Abstract: The disorder parameter, defined as the expectation value of the symmetry transformation acting on a subsystem, can be used to characterize symmetric phases as an analogy to detecting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases using local order parameters. In a dual picture, disorder parameters actually detect SSB of higher-form symmetries. In this work, we show that the non-local disorder parameters can be conveniently and efficiently evaluated using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS). Moreover, we propose a finite correlation length scaling theory of the disorder parameter within the quantum critical region and validate the scaling theory with variationally optimized iPEPS. We find from the finite correlation length scaling that the disorder parameter satisfies perimeter law at a critical point, i.e., it decays exponentially with the boundary size of the subsystem, indicating spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking at the critical point of the dual model.

Title: Non-monotonic motion of sliding droplets on strained soft solids
Authors: Youchuang Chao, Hansol Jeon, Stefan Karpitschka
Abstract: Soft materials are ubiquitous in technological applications that require deformability, for instance, in flexible, water-repellent coatings. However, the wetting properties of pre-strained soft materials are only beginning to be explored. Here we study the sliding dynamics of droplets on pre-strained soft silicone gels, both in tension and in compression. Intriguingly, in compression we find a non-monotonic strain dependence of the sliding speed: mild compressions decelerate the droplets, but stronger compressions lead again to faster droplet motion. Upon further compression, creases nucleate under the droplets until finally, the entire surface undergoes the creasing instability, causing a ``run-and-stop" motion. We quantitatively elucidate the speed modification for moderate pre-strains by incremental viscoelasticity, while the acceleration for larger pre-strains turns out to be linked to the solid pressure, presumably through a lubrication effect of expelled oligomers.

Title: Condensation of Composite Bosonic Trions in Interacting Bose-Fermi Mixtures
Authors: Qi Song, Jie Lou, Yan Chen
Abstract: We reveal a quantum coherent state characterized by composite bosonic trions, wherein paired fermions further bind with bosons, in one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures. This phase emerges in two distinct models, featuring onsite boson-fermion attraction that induces negative binding energy for the composite trions. The first is the Bose-Fermi pair-hopping model, in which spinless fermions undergo pair hopping to form preformed pairs. The second is the extended Bose-Fermi Hubbard model, which describes dipolar bosons and fermions with density-density interactions. Notably, the formation of composite trions is independent of the specific pairing interactions of fermions. Extensive density matrix renormalization group calculations demonstrate the quasi-condensation of the composite trions, evidenced by algebraically decaying correlations of trions, gapped single particle excitations, and suppressed fermion pair correlations. Our findings provide novel insights into a general three-body pairing mechanism among particles with distinct quantum statistics.

Title: Out-of-equilibrium quantum thermochemical engine with one-dimensional Bose gas
Authors: Vijit V. Nautiyal
Abstract: We theoretically explore the finite-time performance of a quantum thermochemical engine using a harmonically trapped 1D Bose gas in the quasicondensate regime as the working fluid. Operating on an Otto cycle, the engine's unitary work strokes involve quenches of interatomic interactions, treating the fluid as a closed many-body quantum system evolving dynamically from an initial thermal state. During thermalization strokes, the fluid is an open system in diffusive contact with a reservoir, enabling both heat and particle exchange. Using a c--field approach, we demonstrate that the engine operates via chemical work, driven by particle flow from the hot reservoir. The engine's performance is analyzed in two regimes: (i) the out-of-equilibrium regime, maximizing power at reduced efficiency, and (ii) the quasistatic limit, achieving maximum efficiency but zero power due to slow driving. Remarkably, chemical work enables maximum efficiency even in sudden quench regime, offering a favorable trade-off between power and efficiency. Finally, we connect this work to prior research, showing that a zero-temperature adiabatic cycle provides an upper bound for efficiency and work at finite temperatures.

Title: Geometric theory of (extended) time-reversal symmetries in stochastic processes -- Part II: field theory
Authors: Jérémy O'Byrne, Michael E. Cates
Abstract: In this article, we study the time-reversal properties of a generic Markovian stochastic field dynamics with Gaussian noise. We introduce a convenient functional geometric formalism that allows us to straightforwardly generalize known results from finite dimensional systems to the case of continuous fields. We give, at field level, full reversibility conditions for three notions of time-reversal defined in the first article of this two-part series, namely T-, MT-, and EMT-reversibility. When the noise correlator is invertible, these reversibility conditions do not make reference to any generically unknown function like the stationary probability, and can thus be verified systematically. Focusing on the simplest of these notions, where only the time variable is flipped upon time reversal, we show that time-reversal symmetry breaking is quantified by a single geometric object: the vorticity two-form, which is a two-form over the functional space $\mathbb{F}$ to which the field belongs. Reversibility then amounts to the cancellation of this vorticity two-form. This condition applies at distributional level and can thus be difficult to use in practice. For fields that are defined on a spatial domain of dimension $d=1$, we overcome this problem by building a basis of the space of two-forms $\Omega^2(\mathbb{F})$. Reversibility is then equivalent to the vanishing of the vorticity's coordinates in this basis, a criterion that is readily applicable to concrete examples. Furthermore, we show that this basis provides a natural direct-sum decomposition of $\Omega^2(\mathbb{F})$, each subspace of which is associated with a distinctive kind of phenomenology. This decomposition enables a classification of celebrated out-of-equilibrium phenomena, ranging from non-reciprocal (chaser/chased) interactions to the flocking of active agents, dynamical reaction-diffusion patterns, (...)

Title: Application of Madelung Hydrodynamics to Plasmonics and Nonlinear Optics in Two-Dimensional Materials
Authors: Simão S. Cardoso, A. J. Chaves, N. Asger Mortensen, N. M. R. Peres
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Madelung hydrodynamic models to study two-dimensional electron gases, with a focus on nonlocal plasmonics and nonlinear optics. We begin by reviewing the derivation of the Madelung equations. Using the Madelung equations in conjunction with Poisson's equation, we calculate the spectrum of magnetoplasmons and the magneto-optical conductivity in the electrostatic regime, incorporating nonlocal corrections due to the Fermi pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra.

Title: First-principles theory of nonlinear long-range electron-phonon interaction
Authors: Matthew Houtput, Luigi Ranalli, Carla Verdi, Serghei Klimin, Stefano Ragni, Jacques Tempere, Cesare Franchini
Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions in solids are crucial for understanding many interesting phenomena, such as conventional superconductivity, temperature-dependent band-gap renormalization, and polarons. For harmonic materials, the linear interaction of one electron with one phonon is sufficient to quantitatively describe these properties. However, in anharmonic materials such as quantum paraelectrics, halide perovskites, and high-pressure hydrides, the nonlinear electron-phonon interactions may play an important role. Currently, the only available Hamiltonians for nonlinear electron-phonon interaction are model Hamiltonians, written in terms of phenomenological parameters. Here, we present a microscopic theory for long-range nonlinear electron-phonon interactions, which can be combined with first-principles calculations. We provide a semi-analytical expression for the long-range part of the 1-electron-2-phonon matrix element. We show that in contrast to the long-range 1-electron-1-phonon interaction, the continuum approximation is not sufficient and the entire phonon dispersion must be taken into account. Additionally, we show that the quasiparticle energies can be written in terms of a 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function. To demonstrate the method, we calculate the 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function for LiF and KTaO$_3$ from first principles. Our framework is a step forward toward complete first-principles calculations of nonlinear electron-phonon interactions in solids.

Title: First-principles theory of nonlinear long-range electron-phonon interaction
Authors: Matthew Houtput, Luigi Ranalli, Carla Verdi, Serghei Klimin, Stefano Ragni, Cesare Franchini, Jacques Tempere
Abstract: Describing electron-phonon interactions in a solid requires knowledge of the electron-phonon matrix elements in the Hamiltonian. State-of-the-art first-principles calculations for the electron-phonon interaction are limited to the 1-electron-1-phonon matrix element, which is suitable for harmonic materials. However, there is no first-principles theory for 1-electron-2-phonon interactions, which occur in anharmonic materials with significant electron-phonon interaction such as halide perovskites and quantum paraelectrics. Here, we derive an analytical expression for the long-range part of the 1-electron-2-phonon matrix element, written in terms of microscopic quantities that can be calculated from first principles. We show that the long-range 1-electron-2-phonon interaction is described by the derivative of the phonon dynamical matrix with respect to an external electric field. We calculate the quasiparticle energy of a large polaron including 1-electron-2-phonon interaction, and show that it can be written in terms of a 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function $\mathcal{T}_{\alpha \beta}(\omega)$. We demonstrate how to calculate this spectral function and its temperature dependence for the benchmark materials LiF and KTaO$_3$. The first-principles framework developed in this article is general, paving the way for future calculations of 1-electron-2-phonon interactions from first principles.

Title: Spectroscopic signatures of magnetization-induced band renormalization and strong spin-charge-lattice coupling in EuZn$_2$As$_2$
Authors: Zhiyu Liao, Boxuan Li, Shaohui Yi, Lincong Zheng, Yubiao Wu, Enkui Yi, Premysl Marsik, Bing Shen, Hongming Weng, Bing Xu, Xianggang Qiu, Christian Bernhard
Abstract: We report an infrared spectroscopy study of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator EuZn$_2$As$_2$ over a broad frequency range, spanning temperatures both above and below the AFM transition $T_{\rm N} \simeq$ 20 K. The optical response reveals an insulating behavior, featuring two prominent infrared-active phonon modes at around 95 and 190 cm$^{-1}$, and two subtle absorption peaks at around 130 ($\alpha$ peak) and 2700 cm$^{-1}$ ($\beta$ peak), along with a strong absorption edge rising around 9000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\gamma$ peak). Significantly, the temperature-dependent changes in these peaks show noticeable anomalies across the AFM transition, particularly the emergence of the $\alpha$ peak and an unusual redshift of the $\gamma$ peak, suggesting a strong interaction between the charge excitations and the AFM order. Band structure calculations reveal that these anomalies arise from magnetization-induced band renormalizations, including shifts and foldings. Additionally, both phonon modes feature asymmetric Fano line shapes at low temperatures, with the 95 cm$^{-1}$ phonon mode exhibiting strong coupling to the fluctuations of Eu spins. These findings highlight a complex interplay of spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in EuZn$_2$As$_2$.

Title: Magnetic bound states embedded in tantalum superconducting thin films
Authors: Soroush Arabi, Qili Li, Ritika Dhundhwal, Dirk Fuchs, Thomas Reisinger, Ioan M. Pop, Wulf Wulfhekel
Abstract: In the fabrication of superconducting devices, both in situ and ex situ processes are utilized, making the removal of unwanted oxide layers and impurities under vacuum conditions crucial. Oxygen descumming and argon milling are standard in situ cleaning methods employed for device preparation. We investigated the impact of these techniques on tantalum superconducting thin films using scanning tunneling microscopy at millikelvin temperatures. We demonstrate that these cleaning methods inadvertently introduce magnetic bound states within the superconducting gap of tantalum, likely by oxygen impurities. These bound states can be detrimental to superconducting qubit devices, as they add to dephasing and energy relaxation.

Title: Anomalous skew scattering of plasmons in a Dirac electron fluid
Authors: Cooper Finnigan, Dmitry K. Efimkin
Abstract: The Berry phase-related nontrivial electronic band geometries can significantly influence bulk and edge plasmons resulting in their non-reciprocal propagation and opening new opportunities for plasmonics. In the present work, we extend the hydrodynamic framework to describe the scattering of plasmons in a Dirac electron fluid off a circular region with an induced nonzero anomalous Hall response, i.e. a Berry flux target. We demonstrate that the scattering has a giant asymmetry or skewness and exhibits a series of resonances. The latter appears due to a chiral non-topological trapped mode circulating the target. We discuss possible experimental realizations, including the surface of a topological insulator film and graphene irradiated by the circularly polarized beam.

Title: Two-fluid mobility model from coupled hydrodynamic equations for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches
Authors: Qile Wu, Antonín Sojka, Brad D. Price, Nikolay I. Agladze, Anup Yadav, Sophie L. Pain, John D. Murphy, Tim Niewelt, Mark S. Sherwin
Abstract: We introduce a two-fluid mobility model incorporating fundamental aspects of electron-hole (e-h) scattering such as momentum conservation for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches (LDSSs). Compared to previous works that use Matthiessen's rule, the two-fluid mobility model predicts distinct AC responses of e-h plasmas in semiconductors. Based on the two-fluid mobility model, we develop a theory with very few adjustable parameters for simulating the switching performance of LDSSs based on high-purity indirect-gap semiconductors such as silicon (Si). As a prototypical application, we successfully reproduce experimentally measured reflectance at around 320 GHz in a laser-driven Si switch. By injecting e-h plasmas with densities up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$, we reveal the importance of carrier-screening effects in e-h scattering and Auger recombination for carrier densities above the critical carrier density for exciton-plasma Mott transition. Our results also suggest a way to characterize the intrinsic momentum-relaxation mechanism, e-h scattering, and the intrinsic e-h recombination mechanism in indirect-gap semiconductors, Auger recombination. We reassess the ambipolar Auger coefficient of high-purity Si with high injection levels of e-h plasmas up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$ and find a minimal value of $1.8\times10^{-41}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$. The value is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the ambipolar Auger coefficient widely used for simulating LDSSs, $3.8\times10^{-40}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$, which was deduced from minority-carrier lifetime in highly doped silicon more than four decades ago.

Abstract: Bulk magnetic properties of Ba2NaOsO6 are examined in the context of an appropriate space group and an atomic model of the Kramers doublet for the osmium ion. It possesses symmetry demanded by the Wykoff position assigned to the osmium ion in a canted ferromagnet. Calculated and measured values of the saturation magnetic moment, and x-ray magnetic dichroic signals (XMCD) at osmium L2 and L3 absorption edges agree well.

Title: Learning by Confusion: The Phase Diagram of the Holstein Model
Authors: George Issa, Owen Bradley, Ehsan Khatami, Richard Scalettar
Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.

Title: Identifying Electronic Doorway States in the Secondary Electron Emission from Layered Materials
Authors: Anna Niggas, Maosheng Hao, Peter Richter, Florian Simperl, Felix Blödorn, Melvin Cap, Johannes Kero, D Hofmann, Alessandra Bellissimo, Joachim Burgdörfer, Thomas Seyller, Richard A Wilhelm, Florian Libisch, Wolfgang S M Werner
Abstract: We investigate the secondary low-energy electron emission induced by inelastic electron scattering from graphene and layered materials thereof. By applying a coincidence detection of the primary scattered and the emitted secondary electron we unravel pronounced resonance features otherwise overshadowed by the largely structureless secondary electron energy distribution. Supported by density functional theory calculations we show that these structures are the signature of prominent Feshbach resonances above the vacuum threshold which originate from interlayer states acting as a doorway state for electron emission. Remarkably, some of these doorway states open up only for samples with more than 5 layers.

Title: Probing non-Gaussian correlations through entanglement generation in a many-body quantum system
Authors: J. van de Kraats, D.J.M. Ahmed-Braun, V.E. Colussi, S.J.J.M.F. Kokkelmans
Abstract: In understanding strongly correlated quantum systems, quantifying the non-Gaussian nature of interparticle correlations is invaluable. We show that, for a uniform quantum gas, there exists a natural connection between non-Gaussian correlations and the generation of momentum-space entanglement. Furthermore, this entanglement can be directly measured in an experiment using time-of-flight techniques. To prototype our method, we numerically study entanglement generation in a degenerate Bose gas following a quench to the unitary regime, where Gaussian and non-Gaussian correlations are generated sequentially in time.

Title: Optical coherence and hyperfine structure of the 7F0-5D0 transition in EuCaWO4
Authors: Xiantong An, Weiye Sun, Zhehao Xu, Wanting Xiao, Miaomiao Ren, Mucheng Guo, Shuping Liu, Fudong Wang, Manjin Zhong
Abstract: Rare-earth ions doped in crystals with low nuclear-spin densities are highly promising candidates for quantum technology applications. In this study, we investigated the spectroscopic properties of the 7F0 - 5 D0 optical and the hyperfine transitions of Eu3+ ions in a CaWO4 crystal, where the nuclear spin arises solely from the 183W isotope, with a natural abundance of 14%. At a temperature of 3 K, we experimentally identified four distinct crystal field environments for Eu3+ ions in a 0.1 at.% Eu3+ doped CaWO4 crystal. The optical coherence properties of Eu3+ ions in these environments were characterized. Additionally, we resolved the hyperfine structures in the 7F0 ground state and 5D0 excited state, and determined the 7F0 ground state lifetimes using spectral hole-burning techniques. These findings highlight the significant potential of Eu3+:CaWO4 for optical quantum memory applications.

Title: Bulk superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals
Authors: Enkang Zhang, Di Peng, Yinghao Zhu, Lixing Chen, Bingkun Cui, Xingya Wang, Wenbin Wang, Qiaoshi Zeng, Jun Zhao
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.

Title: Strange relaxation and metastable behaviours of the Ising ferromagnetic thick cubic shell
Authors: Ishita Tikader, Muktish Acharyya
Abstract: We have studied the equilibrium and nonequilibrium behaviours of the Ising ferromagnetic thick cubic shell by Monte Carlo simulation. Our goal is to find the dependence of the responses on the thickness of the shell. In the equilibrium results, we found that the pseudo-critical temperature of ferro-para phase transition of thick cubic shell increases with the increase of the thickness following a hyperbolic tangent relation. In the nonequilibrium studies, the relaxation time has been found to decrease with the increase of the thickness of the cubic shell. Here three different regimes are found, namely rapid fall, plateau and linear region. The metastable behaviour has been studied also as another kind of non-equilibrium response. The metastable lifetime has been studied as function of the thickness of the cubic shell. A non-monotonic variation of metastable lifetime with the thickness of the shell is observed. A specified thickness for longest-lived metastability has been identified.

Title: Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability
Authors: Akihiro Hokkyo
Abstract: The integrability of a quantum many-body system, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for determining integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our results significantly simplify existing proofs of nonintegrability, such as those for the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg chain with nearest-and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, the $S=1$ bilinear-biquadratic chain and the $S=1/2$ XYZ model in two or higher dimensions. Moreover, our results also yield the first proof of nonintegrability for models such as the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg chain with a non-uniform magnetic field, the $S=1/2$ XYZ model on the triangular lattice, and the general spin XYZ model. This work also offers a partial resolution to the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the existence of local conserved quantities with small support. Our framework ensures that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be verified algorithmically, independently of system size.

Title: Coulomb correlated multi-particle polarons
Authors: Petr Klenovsky
Abstract: The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.

Title: A Microcanonical Inflection Point Analysis via Parametric Curves and its Relation to the Zeros of the Partition Function
Authors: Julio Cesar Siqueira Rocha, Rodrigo Alves Dias, Bismarck Vaz da Costa
Abstract: In statistical physics, phase transitions are arguably among the most extensively studied phenomena. In the computational approach to this field, the development of algorithms capable of estimating entropy across the entire energy spectrum in a single execution has highlighted the efficacy of microcanonical inflection point analysis, while Fisher's zeros technique has re-emerged as a powerful methodology for investigating these phenomena. This paper presents an alternative protocol for analyzing phase transitions using a parameterization of entropy function in the microcanonical ensemble. We also provide a clear demonstration of the relation of the linear pattern of the Fisher's zeros on the complex inverse temperature map (a circle in the complex $x=e^{-\beta \varepsilon}$ map) with the order of the transition, showing that the specific heat is inversely related to the distance between the zeros. We study various model systems, including the Lennard-Jones cluster, the Ising, the XY, and the Zeeman models. By examining the behavior of thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and its derivatives in the microcanonical ensemble, we identify key features - such as loops and discontinuities in parametric curves - which signal phase transitions' presence and nature. We are confident that this approach can facilitate the classification of phase transitions across various physical systems.

Title: Magnetizing altermagnets by ultrafast asymmetric spin dynamics
Authors: Zhaobo Zhou, Sangeeta Sharma, John Kay Dewhurst, Junjie (Julian)He
Abstract: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave compensated altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This metastable magnetization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. We identify the underlying mechanism as an anisotropic optical-induced intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) effect, originating from the momentum-dependent spin splitting unique to altermagnets. This a-OISTR effect enables the polarization of light to drive direction-selective transient spin-dependent currents between sublattices, leading to a controllable ultrafast magnetic state transition in AM. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferrimagnetic state.

Title: Intrinsic Phononic Dressed States in a Nanomechanical System
Authors: M. Yuksel, M. P. Maksymowych, O. A. Hitchcock, F. M. Mayor, N. R. Lee, M. I. Dykman, A. H. Safavi-Naeini, M. L. Roukes
Abstract: Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) provide a platform for probing the quantum nature of mechanical motion in mesoscopic systems. This nature manifests most profoundly when the device vibrations are nonlinear and, currently, achieving vibrational nonlinearity at the single-phonon level is an active area of pursuit in quantum information science. Despite much effort, however, this has remained elusive. Here, we report the first observation of intrinsic mesoscopic vibrational dressed states. The requisite nonlinearity results from strong resonant coupling between an eigenmode of our NEMS resonator and a single, two-level system (TLS) that is intrinsic to the device material. We control the TLS in situ by varying mechanical strain, tuning it in and out of resonance with the NEMS mode. Varying the resonant drive and/or temperature allows controlled ascent of the nonequidistant energy ladder and reveals the energy multiplets of the hybridized system. Fluctuations of the TLS on and off resonance with the mode induces switching between dressed and bare states; this elucidates the complex quantum nature of TLS-like defects in mesoscopic systems. These quintessential quantum effects emerge directly from the intrinsic material properties of mechanical systems - without need for complex, external quantum circuits. Our work provides long-sought insight into mesoscopic dynamics and offers a new direction to harness nanomechanics for quantum measurements.

Title: Band Renormalization, Quarter Metals, and Chiral Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Tetralayer Graphene
Authors: Guillermo Parra-Martinez, Alejandro Jimeno-Pozo, Vo Tien Phong, Hector Sainz-Cruz, Daniel Kaplan, Peleg Emanuel, Yuval Oreg, Pierre A. Pantaleon, Jose Angel Silva-Guillen, Francisco Guinea
Abstract: Recently, exotic superconductivity emerging from a spin-and-valley-polarized metallic phase has been discovered in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. To explain this observation, we study the role of electron-electron interactions in driving flavor symmetry breaking, using the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation, and in stabilizing superconductivity mediated by repulsive interactions. Though mean-field HF correctly predicts the isospin flavors and reproduces the experimental phase diagram, it overestimates the band renormalization near the Fermi energy and suppresses superconducting instabilities. To address this, we introduce a physically motivated scheme that includes internal screening in the HF calculation. Using this formalism, we find superconductivity arising from the spin-valley polarized phase for a range of electric fields and electron dopings. Our findings reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a p-wave, finite-momentum, time-reversal-symmetry-broken superconducting state, encouraging further investigation into exotic phases in graphene multilayers.

Title: Deconfined criticality as intrinsically gapless topological state in one dimension
Authors: Sheng Yang, Fu Xu, Da-Chuan Lu, Yi-Zhuang You, Hai-Qing Lin, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.

Title: Geometric Asymmetry-Enhanced Nonreciprocal Supercurrent Transport Revealed by Second-Harmonic Response
Authors: Yu He, Zifeng Wang, Jiaxu Li, Fenglin Zhong, Haozhe Yang, Kewen Shi, Le Wang, Guang Yang, Weisheng Zhao
Abstract: Nonreciprocal transport in superconducting systems serves as a powerful probe of symmetry-breaking mechanisms, with the superconducting diode effect emerging as a key manifestation enabling cryogenic rectification. While theoretical models have extensively explored superconducting nonreciprocity, experimental verification remains challenging, as conventional transport measurements struggle to disentangle intrinsic and extrinsic contributions. Nonlinear transport analysis, particularly second-harmonic response, offers an alternative approach by providing a sensitive probe for detecting spatial inversion symmetry breaking in the presence of time-reversal symmetry violation. Here, we systematically investigate the influence of geometric symmetry on nonreciprocal transport by comparing two triangular-extended Hall bar configurations with a symmetric Hall bar control. Second-harmonic nonlinear transport measurements reveal that the triangular extension significantly enhances nonreciprocal response, exhibiting a clear dependence on the base angle of the extension. These findings establish a direct connection between mesoscopic geometry and macroscopic nonreciprocity, demonstrating how spatial symmetry and vortex dynamics govern nonlinear transport. This insight offers a guiding principle for designing superconducting rectification architectures.

Title: Finite-size corrections from the subleading magnetic scaling field for the Ising and Potts models in two dimensions
Authors: Yihao Xu, Jesús Salas, Youjin Deng
Abstract: In finite-size scaling analyses of critical phenomena, proper consideration of correction terms, which can come from different sources, plays an important role. For the Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation of the $Q$-state Potts model in two dimensions, although the subleading magnetic scaling field, with exactly known exponent, is theoretically expected to give rise in finite-size-scaling analyses, numerical observation remains elusive probably due to the mixing of various corrections. We simulate the O($n$) loop model on the hexagonal lattice, which is in the same universality class as the $Q=n^2$ Potts model but has suppressed corrections from other sources, and provides strong numerical evidence for the attribution of the subleading magnetic field in finite-size corrections. Interestingly, it is also observed that the corrections in small- and large-cluster-size regions have opposite magnitudes, and, for the special $n=2$ case, they compensate with each other in observables like the second moment of the cluster-size distribution. Our finding reveals that the effect of the subleading magnetic field should be taken into account in finite-size-scaling analyses, which was unfortunately ignored in many previous studies.

Title: Giant spin shift current in two-dimensional altermagnetic multiferroics VOX$\mathrm{_2}$
Authors: Yao Yang, Jinxiong Jia, Longjun Xiang, Fuming Xu, Hao Jin
Abstract: Altermagnets, which exhibit spin-split electronic bands without net magnetization, provide an appealing platform for exploring unconventional spin and ferroic physics. Through symmetry analyses and first-principles calculations, we show that monolayer \(\mathrm{VOX_2}\) (\(\mathrm{X = Cl, Br, I}\)) is a two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric altermagnet (FEAM). The spin splitting in its electronic band structure can be precisely tuned by ferroelectric polarization and magnetic order, accompanied by a giant magnetoelectric coupling coefficient. Owing to the absence of inversion symmetry, this material also exhibits pronounced nonlinear optical responses. The altermagnetic \(\mathrm{VOI_2}\) monolayer show an exceptionally large spin shift current of up to \(330.072\,\mu\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{V}^2\), which is switchable by reversing the magnetic order. These results uncover a strong interplay between magnetic and ferroelectric orders, offering a route toward electrically and magnetically tunable nonlinear spin photocurrents in 2D multiferroic systems.

Title: Universal Rule for Topological Hopf Term via Dirac-Spin Coupling
Authors: Yan-Guang Yue, Shuai Yang, Zheng-Xin Liu, Yan Chen
Abstract: It is known that the topological Hopf term in two-dimensional (2D) spin systems can be derived by coupling to massless Dirac fermions. We establish a universal rule governing the generation of Hopf terms in 2D quantum spin systems coupled to Dirac fermions. The key insight identifies the Hopf coefficient as the oriented volume in the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ Lie algebra space formed by Dirac cone matrix bases. This geometric interpretation allows direct determination of Hopf term without path integral computations. Applying this framework, we demonstrate nontrivial Hopf term in tailored checkerboard lattice models and recover known results in graphene-based systems.

Title: Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered One Dimensional Critical States
Authors: Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.

Title: Quantum Geometry of Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Flat-Band Superconductivity
Authors: Aaron Dunbrack, Pauli Virtanen, Tero T. Heikkilä
Abstract: Several physical phenomena in superconductors, such as helical superconductivity and the diode effect, rely on breaking time-reversal symmetry. This symmetry-breaking is usually accounted for via the Lifshitz invariant, a contribution to the free energy which is linear in the phase gradient of the order parameter. In dispersive single-band superconductors with conventional pairing, the Lifshitz invariant can be computed from the asymmetries of the spectrum near the Fermi surface. We show that in multi-band superconductors, the quantum geometry also contributes to the Lifshitz invariant, and this is the dominant contribution when the low-energy bands are flat.

Title: Imaging Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2
Authors: Shuqiu Wang, Kuanysh Zhussupbekov, Joseph P. Carroll, Bin Hu, Xiaolong Liu, Emile Pangburn, Adeline Crepieux, Catherine Pepin, Christopher Broyles, Sheng Ran, Nicholas P. Butch, Shanta Saha, Johnpierre Paglione, Cristina Bena, J.C. Séamus Davis, Qiangqiang Gu
Abstract: Although no known material definitely exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, where a spin-triplet electron pairing potential $\Delta(k)$ has odd parity, UTe2 is now the leading candidate. Ideally, the parity of $\Delta(k)$ might be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, a recognized technique for $\Delta(k)$ determination in complex superconductors. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) on crystal termination surfaces only for energies within the superconductive energy gap. The QPI should then be dominated by the QSB electronic structure and only reveal bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics excursively. Here, by using a superconducting scan-tip to achieve $\sim$ 10 $\mu$eV energy resolution QPI for UTe2 studies, we discover and visualize the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of its QSB. QPI visualization then yields a characteristic sextet $q_{i}:i$ = 1-6 of interference wavevectors from which we establish QSB dispersions, and their existence only for energies $|E| \leq \Delta_{\text{max}}$ within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. Quantitative evaluation of this sextet $q_{i}$ then demonstrates precisely how the QSB is projected from the subtending bulk Fermi surface. Finally, a novel theoretical framework has been developed to predict the QPI signatures of a topological QSB at this (0-11) surface. Its predictions are demonstrably consistent with the experimental results if the bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry. Ultimately, these new techniques adumbrate a novel spectroscopic approach to identification of intrinsic topological superconductors and their superconductive topological surface states.

Title: Strain-induced non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect
Authors: Wancheng Zhang, Mingkun Zheng, Yong Liu, Rui Xiong, Zhenhua Zhang, Zhihong Lu
Abstract: Recently, the large time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin current generated by the non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) has demonstrated significant potential for spintronic applications, with both computational and experimental validations. However, considering the broad application prospects and the scarcity of conductive altermagnetic materials, the development of novel reliable methods for inducing altermagnetism is necessary. Here, strain engineering is proposed as a simple yet effective approach. This work focuses on $\mathrm{OsO}_2$--the $5d$ counterpart of $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ sharing the rutile structure--employing $ab~initio$ calculations to systematically investigate strain effects on its ASSE. We find that applying a minor equibiaxial tensile strain $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ to $\mathrm{OsO}_2$ can induce a transition from non-magnetic to altermagnetic states. Only $3\%$ $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ is required to achieve a spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim7\%$ for the $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin current generated by ASSE, far exceeding the intrinsic spin Hall angle $\theta_{\text{IS}}$ produced by the conventional spin Hall effect (CSHE). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to non-relativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's non-relativistic origin. Further calculations reveal that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.

Title: Computing ternary liquid phase diagrams: Fe-Cu-Ni
Authors: Dallas R. Trinkle (Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign)
Abstract: We compute the phase separation of the immiscible liquid alloy Fe-Cu-Ni. Our computational approach uses a virtual semigrand canonical Widom approach to determine differences in excess chemical potentials between different species. Using an embedded atom potential for Fe-Cu-Ni, we simulate liquid states over a range of compositions and temperatures. This raw data is then fit to Redlich-Kister polynomials for the Gibbs free energy with a simple temperature dependence. Using the analytic form, we can determine the phase diagram for the ternary liquid, compute the miscibility gap and spinodal decomposition as a function of temperature for this EAM potential. In addition, we compute density as a function of composition and temperature, and predict pair correlation functions. We use static structure factors to estimate the second derivative of the Gibbs free energy (the $S^0$ method) and compare with our fit Gibbs free energy. Finally, using a nonequilibrium Hamiltonian integration method, we separately compute absolute Gibbs free energies for the pure liquid states; this shows that our endpoints are accurate to within 1 meV for our ternary Gibbs free energy, as well as the absolute Gibbs free energy for the ternary liquid.

Title: Dome-like pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$
Authors: Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco, James M. A. Steele, Shiyu Deng, Xiaotian Zhang, Dominik Daisenberger, Annalena R. Genreith-Schriever, Siddharth S. Saxena, Clare P. Grey, Si^an E. Dutton
Abstract: NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$ K, which disappears in a first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$ K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to ~5 GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied via variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of ~67 GPa at 294 K and 403 K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed via the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at ~18 GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.

Title: Phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model via Krylov spread complexity
Authors: E.Medina-Guerra, I.V. Gornyi, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with an imaginary chemical potential via Krylov spread complexity and Krylov fidelity. The spread witnesses the $\mathcal{PT}$-transition for the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum of the SSH Hamiltonian, where the spectrum goes from purely real to complex (oscillatory dynamics to damped oscillations). In addition, it also witnesses the transition occurring in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, where the spectrum goes from complex to purely imaginary (damped oscillations to sheer decay). For a purely imaginary spectrum, the Krylov spread fidelity, which measures how the time-dependent spread reaches its stationary state value, serves as a probe of previously undetected dynamical phase transitions.

Title: Topological Degeneracy Induced Flat Bands in two-Dimensional Holed Systems
Authors: Yuge Chen, Hui Yu, Yun-Peng Huang, Zhen-Yu Zheng, Jiangping Hu
Abstract: Systems hosting flat bands offer a powerful platform for exploring strong correlation physics. Theoretically topological degeneracy rising in systems with non-trivial topological orders on periodic manifolds of non-zero genus can generate ideal flat bands. However, experimental realization of such geometrically engineered systems is very difficult. In this work, we demonstrate that flat planes with strategically patterned hole defects can engineer ideal flat bands. We constructing two families of models, singular flat band systems where degeneracy is stabilized by non-contractible loop excitations tied to hole defects and perfectly nested van Hove systems where degeneracy arises from line excitations in momentum space. These models circumvent the need for exotic manifolds while retaining the essential features of topological flat bands. By directly linking defect engineering to degeneracy mechanisms, our results establish a scalable framework for experimentally accessible flat band design.

Title: Entropy Production and Thermodynamic Dynamics in Active and Passive Brownian Systems Driven by Time Dependent Forces and Temperatures
Authors: Mesfin Taye
Abstract: In this work, we examine the impact of time-varying temperature and force on the thermodynamic features of active Brownian motor that moves with velocity against the force as well as passive Brownian motor. By deriving analytical expressions In this work, we examine the impact of time-varying temperature and force on the thermodynamic features of active Brownian motor that moves with velocity against the force as well as passive Brownian motor. By deriving analytical expressions for entropy production and entropy extraction rates, we extend the existing theoretical frameworks by considering a force or temperature that varies exponentially, linearly, and quadratically. By studying the system analytically, we investigate how thermal relaxation, steady-state conditions, and nonlinear dissipation effects are affected over time. We find that the total entropy depends only on temperature and viscous friction if the Brownian particle moves freely, while the entropy production and dissipation rates are strongly influenced by the external force.

Title: The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results
Authors: Xin-Chi Zhou, Bing-Chen Yao, Yongjian Wang, Yucheng Wang, Yudong Wei, Qi Zhou, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.

Title: A Clue on Small-Capacitance Josephson Junction: What to Expect from Cooper Pair Ideal Conductor and Ohmic Resistor in Parallel?
Authors: Francesco Giuseppe Capone, Antonio de Candia, Vittorio Cataudella, Naoto Nagaosa, Carmine Antonio Perroni, Giulio De Filippis
Abstract: By using analytical and Worldline Monte Carlo approaches, we investigate the effects induced by quantum phase fluctuations combined with quasiparticle subgap and shunt resistances on a small-capacitance Josephson junction. By using the linear response theory in the presence of two biasing schemes, we prove that the ideal conduction, foreseen in the pioneering papers on this topic, is not robust against either quantum phase fluctuations or dissipative effects. By including both of them in the Hamiltonian, we prove that an increase of the Ohmic dissipation strength induces a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition in thermodynamic equilibrium. Then we study charge and phase fluctuations at the thermodynamic equilibrium within the linear response theory. We find that the phase particle motion, in a quantum Josephson junction, does not change from diffusive to localized, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition, as is commonly believed. At the transition, we prove that: i) the motion of the phase particle changes from ballistic to localized; ii) by turning on the coupling with the environment, a long-lived excitation at finite frequency emerges in the charge response function: it evolves first into a resonance and then disappears at the transition. Consequences beyond the linear response regime are investigated, leading to an alternative comprehensive physical picture for this system: we predict a transition from a dissipative quasiparticle current to a polaronic Cooper pair current.

Title: Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor artificial graphene
Authors: Gökhan Öztarhan, Paweł Potasz, A. D. Güçlü
Abstract: We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene with realistic Coulomb interaction using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the extended Hubbard model. Specifically, we analyze a model of an armchair hexagonal geometry comprising $42$ lattice sites, nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells with nearest-neighbor distance of $a = 50$ nm. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling where the ferromagnetic phase is further stabilized by Coulomb scattering terms. We determine effective Hubbard model parameters and identify the magnetic phase transition near $U/t \approx 60$.

Title: High-Yield Assembly of Plasmon-Coupled Nanodiamonds via DNA Origami for Tailored Emission
Authors: Niklas Hansen, Jakub Copak, Marek Kindermann, David Roesel, Federica Scollo, Ilko Bald, Petr Cigler, Vladimira Petrakova
Abstract: Controlling the spatial arrangement of optically active elements is crucial for the advancement of engineered photonic systems. Color centers in nanodiamond offer unique advantages for quantum sensing and information processing; however, their integration into complex optical architectures is limited by challenges in precise and reproducible positioning, as well as efficient coupling. DNA origami provides an elegant solution, as demonstrated by recent studies showcasing nanoscale positioning of fluorescent nanodiamonds and plasmonic gold nanoparticles. Here, we present a scalable and robust method for covalently functionalizing nanodiamonds with DNA, enabling high-yield, spatially controlled assembly of diamond and gold nanoparticles onto DNA origami. By precisely controlling the interparticle spacing, we reveal distance-dependent modulation of NV center photoluminescence with a 10-fold increase in the fastest decay pathway at short interparticle distances. Our findings indicate selective plasmon-driven effects and interplay between radiative and non-radiative processes. This work overcomes key limitations in current nanodiamond assembly strategies and provides insights into engineering NV photoluminescence by plasmonic coupling that advance toward quantum photonic and sensing applications.

Title: Graph theory and tunable slow dynamics in quantum East Hamiltonians
Authors: Heiko Georg Menzler, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner
Abstract: We show how graph theory concepts can provide an insight into the origin of slow dynamics in systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we observe that slow dynamics is related to the presence of strong hierarchies between nodes on the Fock-space graph in the particle occupation basis, which encodes configurations connected by a given Hamiltonian. To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.

Title: Quantum Otto engine mimicking Carnot near pseudotransitions in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit
Authors: Onofre Rojas, Moises Rojas, S. M. de Souza
Abstract: The one-dimensional extended Hubbard model (EHM) in the atomic limit has recently been found to exhibit a curious thermal pseudo-transition behavior, which closely resembles first and second-order thermal phase transitions. This phenomenon, occurring at half-filling, is influenced by the quantum phase transition between the alternating pair (AP) and paramagnetic (PM) phases at zero temperature. In this study, we leverage this anomalous behavior to investigate the performance of quantum many-body machines, using the EHM as the working substance. Our analysis reveals that the quantum Otto engine, when operating in the anomalous region, closely mimics the ideal Carnot engine. In this region, both the work output and thermal efficiency of the Otto engine increase, approaching the performance of a Carnot engine. This highlights the potential of many-body systems, such as the EHM, in enhancing quantum thermodynamic performance. Our findings demonstrate that, although the second law of thermodynamics prevents engines from surpassing Carnot efficiency, the Otto engine can operate remarkably close to this limit in the anomalous region, offering insights into new directions for future research on quantum thermodynamic cycles and working substances.

Title: Non-equilibrium Dynamics and Universality of 4D Quantum Vortices and Turbulence
Authors: Wei-can Yang
Abstract: The study of quantum vortices provides critical insights into non-equilibrium dynamics across diverse physical systems. While previous research has focused on point-like vortices in two dimensions and line-like vortices in three dimensions, quantum vortices in four spatial dimensions are expected to take the form of extended vortex surfaces, thereby fundamentally enriching dynamics. Here, we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of 4D quantum vortices and turbulence. Using a special visualization method, we discovered the decay of topological numbers that does not exist in low dimensions, as well as the high-dimensional counterpart of the vortex reconnection process. We further explore quench dynamics across phase transitions in four dimensions and verify the applicability of the higher-dimensional Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our simulations provide numerical evidence of 4D quantum turbulence, characterized by universal power-law behavior. These findings reveal universal principles governing topological defects in higher dimensions, offering insights for future experimental realizations using synthetic dimensions.

Title: Enhancing TiFe Alloy Activation for Hydrogen Storage Through Al, Cr, Co, and Cu Substitutions as a Step Towards Future Recycling
Authors: Francesca Garelli, Erika Michela Dematteis, Vitalie Stavila, Giuseppe Di Florio, Claudio Carbone, Alessandro Agostini, Mauro Palumbo, Marcello Baricco, Paola Rizzi
Abstract: This study investigates the activation behavior of $TiFe_{0.80}$-$X_{0.20}$ (X = Co, Cu, Cr, Al) alloys to identify the most effective materials for producing hydrogen storage alloys from recycled sources in view of a circular economy perspective. Activation was tested using two methods: a Sievert Volumetric Apparatus at room temperature and 64 bar of hydrogen, and high-pressure differential scanning calorimetry with 50 bar hydrogen under thermal cycles up to 400 °C. Activation properties were analyzed by assessing time for incubation and for full charging, that are influenced, respectively, by surface and bulk diffusion of hydrogen. Results showed that Cr-substituted alloys are rapidly activated, due to the presence of $TiCr_{2}$ compound, while Al-containing alloys absorbed hydrogen immediately. In contrast, Co- and Cu-substituted alloys required extended activation times, due to less quantity of secondary phases and limited diffusion channels.

Title: Mott transition in excitonic Bose polarons
Authors: E. A. Szwed, B. Vermilyea, D. J. Choksy, Zhiwen Zhou, M. M. Fogler, L. V. Butov, K. W. Baldwin, L. N. Pfeiffer
Abstract: For a neutral system of positive and negative charges, such as atoms in a crystal, increasing the density causes the Mott transition from bound electrons to free electrons. The density of optically generated electron-hole systems can be controlled in situ by the power of optical excitation that enables the Mott transition from excitons, the bound pairs of electrons and holes, to free electrons and holes with increasing density. These Mott transitions occur in systems of pairs of the same kind, such as atoms or excitons. However, a different type of the Mott transition can occur for Bose polarons. A Bose polaron is a mobile particle of one kind in a Bose gas of particles of another kind. For the Mott transition in polarons, the polaron states vanish with increasing density of the surrounding gas. In this paper, we present the observation of this type of the Mott transition and the measurement of the Mott transition parameter $n_{\rm M}^{1/2} a_{\rm B}$ in 2D excitonic Bose polarons.

Title: The dynamical role of optical phonons and sub-lattice screening in a solid-state ion conductor
Authors: Kim H. Pham, Vijaya Begum-Hudde, Amy K. Lin, Natan A. Spear, Jackson McClellan, Michael W. Zuerch, Andre Schleife, Kimberly A. See, Scott Cushing
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) require ionic conductivities that are competitive with liquid electrolytes to realize applications in all-solid state batteries. Although numerous materials have been discovered, the underlying mechanisms enabling superionic conduction remain elusive. In particular, the role of ultrafast lattice dynamics in mediating ion migration, which involves couplings between ions, phonons, and electrons, is rarely explored experimentally at their corresponding timescales. To investigate the contributions of coupled lattice dynamics on ion migration, we modulate the charge density occupations within the crystal, and then measure the time-resolved change in impedance on picosecond timescales for a candidate SSE, Li0.5La0.5TiO3. Upon perturbation, we observe enhanced ion migration at ultrafast timescales that are shorter than laser-induced heating. The respective transients match the timescales of optical and acoustic phonon vibrations, suggesting their involvement in ion migration. We further computationally evaluate the effect of a charge transfer from the O 2p to Ti 3d band on the electronic and physical structure of LLTO. We hypothesize that the charge transfer excitation distorts the TiO6 polyhedra by altering the local charge density occupancy of the hopping site at the migration pathway saddle point, thereby causing a reduction in the migration barrier for the Li+ hop, shown using computation. We rule out the contribution of photogenerated electrons and laser heating. Overall, our investigation introduces a new spectroscopic tool to probe fundamental ion hopping mechanisms transiently at ultrafast timescales, which has previously only been achieved in a time-averaged manner or solely via computational methods. Our proposed technique expands our capability to answer dynamical questions previously limited by incumbent spectroscopic strategies.

Title: Wigner distribution, Wigner entropy, and Anomalous Transport of a Generalized Aubry-André model
Authors: Feng Lu, Hailin Tan, Ao Zhou, Shujie Cheng, Gao Xianlong
Abstract: In this paper, we study a generalized Aubry-André model with tunable quasidisordered potentials. The model has an invariable mobility edge that separates the extended states from the localized states. At the mobility edge, the wave function presents critical characteristics, which can be verified by finite-size scaling analysis. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the extended, critical, and localized states can be effectively distinguished via their phase space representation, specially the Wigner distribution. Based on the Wigner distribution function, we can further obtain the corresponding Wigner entropy and employ the feature that the critical state has the maximum Wigner entropy to locate the invariable mobility edge. Finally, we reveal that there are anomalous transport phenomena between the transition from ballistic transport to the absence of diffusion.

Title: Stochastic elastohydrodynamics of soft valves
Authors: Mengfei He, Sungkyu Cho, Gianna Dafflisio, Sitaram Emani, L. Mahadevan
Abstract: Soft valves serve to modulate and rectify flows in complex vasculatures across the tree of life, e.g. in the heart of every human reading this. Here we consider a minimal physical model of the heart mitral valve modeled as a flexible conical shell capable of flow rectification via collapse and coaptation in an impinging (reverse) flow. Our experiments show that the complex elastohydrodynamics of closure features a noise-activated rectification mechanism. A minimal theoretical model allows us to rationalize our observations while illuminating a dynamical bifurcation driven by stochastic hydrodynamic forces. Our theory also suggests a way to trigger the coaptation of soft valves on demand, which we corroborate using experiments, suggesting a design principle for their efficient operation.

Title: Altermagnetism Without Crystal Symmetry
Authors: Peru d'Ornellas, Valentin Leeb, Adolfo G. Grushin, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a collinear magnetic order in which opposite spin species are exchanged under a real-space rotation. Hence, the search for physical realizations has focussed on crystalline solids with specific rotational symmetry. Here, we show that altermagnetism can also emerge in non-crystalline systems, such as amorphous solids, despite the lack of global rotational symmetries. We construct a Hamiltonian with two directional orbitals per site on an amorphous lattice with interactions that are invariant under spin rotation. Altermagnetism then arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin and orbital degrees of freedom around each atom, displaying a common point group symmetry. This form of altermagnetism exhibits anisotropic spin transport and spin spectral functions, both experimentally measurable. Our mechanism generalizes to any lattice and any altermagnetic order, opening the search for altermagnetic phenomena to non-crystalline systems.

Title: A simple method for detection and quantitative estimation of deep levels in a barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures by analysis of light induced threshold voltage shift
Authors: Maciej Matys, Atsushi Yamada, Yoichi Kamada, Toshihiro Ohki
Abstract: The characterization of deep levels in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures is one of the most important problems in GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) technology. This work reports on a technique for determination of deep level concentration in AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. The proposed method is relatively simple, and it is based on the detection of free holes created by optically induced transitions of electrons from the deep levels to the conduction band. The developed method can detect and provide quantitative estimation of deep level traps in a barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. Furthermore, it provides a framework for analysis of light induced threshold voltage shift, which includes an important experimental criterion of determination whether the holes are generated or not in the AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures by sub-band gap illumination. The method was verified by applications it to a study of the deep levels in GaN HEMTs grown on various substrates, i.e. SiC and GaN.

Title: Spin-chain based quantum thermal machines
Authors: Edoardo Maria Centamori, Michele Campisi, Vittorio Giovannetti
Abstract: We study the performance of quantum thermal machines in which the working fluid of the model is represented by a many-body quantum system that is periodically connected with external baths via local couplings. A formal characterization of the limit cycles of the set-up is presented in terms of the mixing properties of the quantum channel that describes the evolution of the fluid over a thermodynamic cycle. For the special case in which the system is a collection of spin 1/2 particles coupled via magnetization preserving Hamiltonians, a full characterization of the possible operational regimes (i.e., thermal engine, refrigerator, heater and thermal accelerator) is provided: in this context we show in fact that the different regimes only depend upon a limited number of parameters (essentially the ratios of the energy gaps associated with the local Hamiltonians of the parts of the network which are in direct thermal contact with the baths).

Abstract: Thermalization phenomena, while ubiquitous in quantum systems, have traditionally been viewed as obstacles to be mitigated. In this study, we demonstrate the ability, instead, to harness thermalization to dynamically engineer and stabilize structured quantum states in a mesoscopically large ensemble of spins. Specifically, we showcase the capacity to generate, control, stabilize, and read out 'shell-like' spin texture with interacting $ {}^{ 13}\mathrm{C}$ nuclear spins in diamond, wherein spins are polarized oppositely on either side of a critical radius. The texture spans several nanometers and encompasses many hundred spins. We capitalize on the thermalization process to impose a quasi-equilibrium upon the generated texture; as a result, it is highly stable, immune to spin diffusion, and endures over multiple-minute long periods -- over a million times longer than the intrinsic interaction scale of the spins. Additionally, the texture is created and interrogated without locally controlling or probing the nuclear spins. These features are accomplished using an electron spin as a nanoscale injector of spin polarization, and employing it as a source of spatially varying dissipation, allowing for serial readout of the emergent spin texture. Long-time stabilization is achieved via prethermalization to a Floquet-induced Hamiltonian under the electronic gradient field. Our work presents a new approach to robust nanoscale spin state engineering and paves the way for new applications in quantum simulation, quantum information science, and nanoscale imaging.

Title: Simulating Floquet scrambling circuits on trapped-ion quantum computers
Authors: Kazuhiro Seki, Yuta Kikuchi, Tomoya Hayata, Seiji Yunoki
Abstract: Complex quantum many-body dynamics spread initially localized quantum information across the entire system. Information scrambling refers to such a process, whose simulation is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We demonstrate the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the interferometric protocol for calculating out-of-time-ordered correlators to study the scrambling property of a one-dimensional kicked-Ising model on 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum processors. The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states. Our experiments are made possible by extensively utilizing one of the highest-fidelity quantum processors currently available and, thus, should be considered as a benchmark for the current status of the most advanced quantum computers.

Abstract: We often rely on probabilistic measures--e.g. event probability or expected time--to characterize systems safety. However, determining these quantities for extremely low-probability events is generally challenging, as standard safety methods usually struggle due to conservativeness, high-dimension scalability, tractability or numerical limitations. We address these issues by leveraging rigorous approximations grounded in the principles of Large Deviations theory. By assuming deterministic initial conditions, Large Deviations identifies a single dominant path as the most significant contributor to the rare-event probability: the instanton. We extend this result to incorporate stochastic uncertainty in the initial states, which is a common assumption in many applications. To that end, we determine an expression for the probability density of the initial states, conditioned on the instanton--the most dominant path hitting the unsafe region--being observed. This expression gives access to the most probable initial conditions, as well as the most probable hitting time and path deviations, leading to an unsafe rare event. We demonstrate its effectiveness by solving a high-dimensional and non-linear problem: a space collision.

Title: Observation of a non-Hermitian supersonic mode on a trapped-ion quantum computer
Authors: Yuxuan Zhang, Juan Carrasquilla, Yong Baek Kim
Abstract: Quantum computers have long been anticipated to excel in simulating quantum many-body physics. While most previous work has focused on Hermitian physics, we demonstrate the power of variational quantum circuits for resource-efficient simulations of dynamical and equilibrium physics in non-Hermitian systems, revealing new phenomena beyond standard Hermitian quantum machines. Using a variational quantum compilation scheme for fermionic systems, we reduce gate count, save qubits, and eliminate the need for postselection, a major challenge in simulating non-Hermitian dynamics via standard Trotterization. Experimentally, we observed a supersonic mode in the connected density-density correlation function on an $ n = 18 $ fermionic chain after a non-Hermitian, locally interacting quench, which would otherwise be forbidden by the Lieb-Robinson bound in a Hermitian system. Additionally, we investigate sequential quantum circuits generated by tensor networks for ground state preparation, here defined as the eigenstate with the lowest real part eigenvalue, using a variance minimization scheme. Through a trapped-ion implementation on the Quantinuum H1 quantum processor, we accurately capture correlation functions and energies across an exceptional point on a dissipative spin chain up to length $ n = 20 $ using only 3 qubits. Motivated by these advancements, we provide an analytical example demonstrating that simulating single-qubit non-Hermitian dynamics for $\Theta(\log(n))$ time from certain initial states is exponentially hard on a quantum computer, offering insights into the opportunities and limitations of using quantum computation for simulating non-Hermitian physics.

Title: Collective quantum enhancement in critical quantum sensing
Authors: Uesli Alushi, Alessandro Coppo, Valentina Brosco, Roberto Di Candia, Simone Felicetti
Abstract: Critical systems represent a valuable resource in quantum sensing and metrology. Critical quantum sensing (CQS) protocols can be realized using finite-component phase transitions, where criticality arises from the rescaling of system parameters rather than the thermodynamic limit. Here, we show that a collective quantum advantage can be achieved in a multipartite CQS protocol using a chain of parametrically coupled critical resonators in the weak-nonlinearity limit. We derive analytical solutions for the low-energy spectrum of this unconventional quantum many-body system, which is composed of locally critical elements. We then assess the scaling of the quantum Fisher information with respect to fundamental resources. We demonstrate that the coupled chain outperforms an equivalent ensemble of independent critical sensors, achieving quadratic scaling in the number of resonators. Finally, we show that even with finite Kerr nonlinearity or Markovian dissipation, the critical chain retains its advantage, making it relevant for implementing quantum sensors with current microwave superconducting technologies.

Title: A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to QAOA: finding a needle in the haystack
Authors: Andoni Agirre, Evert Van Nieuwenburg, Matteo M. Wauters
Abstract: The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.

Title: Galilei covariance of the theory of Thouless pumps
Authors: Tilman Esslinger, Gian Michele Graf, Filippo Santi
Abstract: The Thouless theory of quantum pumps establishes the conditions for quantized particle transport per cycle, and determines its value. When describing the pump from a moving reference frame, transported and existing charges transform, though not independently. This transformation is inherent to Galilean space and time, but it is underpinned by a transformation of vector bundles. Different formalisms can be used to describe this transformation, including one based on Bloch theory. Depending on the chosen formalism, the two types of charges will be realized as indices of either the same or different kinds. Finally, we apply the bulk-edge correspondence principle, so as to implement the transformation law within Büttiker's scattering theory of quantum pumps.

Title: Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study
Authors: Shenwei Yin, Jin-Woo Cho, Demeng Feng, Hongyan Mei, Tanuj Kumar, Chenghao Wan, Yeonghoon Jin, Minjeong Kim, Mikhail A. Kats
Abstract: Fitting oscillator models to variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) data can lead to non-unique, unphysical results. We demonstrate using temperature-dependent trends to prevent overfitting and ensure model physicality. As a case study, we performed mid-infrared VASE measurements on fused silica (SiO2) of various grades, from room temperature to 600 °C. We fitted oscillator models independently at each temperature, and confirmed the model's physical validity by observing the expected monotonic trends in vibrational oscillator parameters. Using this technique, we generated a highly accurate dataset for the temperature-dependent complex refractive index of fused silica for modeling mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.

Title: Thermal quantum information capacity in a topological insulator
Authors: Leonardo A. Navarro-Labastida
Abstract: Thermal effects in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (SSH) topological insulator are studied. Particularly, we focus on quantum information processing (QIP) capacity for thermal ensembles. To evaluate QIP an optimized quantum Fisher information (OQFI) is introduced as a quantifier of entanglement and topological phases are calculated by a definition in real space for the electric polarization of mixture states. For the thermal ensemble, there is a relationship between the Fisher metric and the electric polarization in such a way that in the topological region, there is more entanglement, therefore, these generate more robustness and protection in the quantum information due to thermal effects. Also, long-range hopping effects are studied and it is found that in this case, the OQFI captures these topological phase transitions in the limit of low temperature by this formalism in real space.

Title: Thermodynamics and DC conductivity of 2D anisotropic fluids from axion holography
Authors: Alfonso Ballon-Bayona, Jonathan P. Shock, Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: We investigate a strongly coupled finite-density anisotropic fluid in $2+1$ dimensions dual to an asymptotically AdS black brane that is a solution of Einstein-Maxwell-Axion theory in $3+1$ dimensions. Despite the anisotropy, the fluid thermodynamic properties align with those of a conformal fluid. Moreover, we show that the fluid is stable under the increase of the anisotropy parameter. Additionally, we analyse the DC conductivity of the anisotropic fluid, showing its compatibility with momentum dissipation due to translational symmetry breaking. In the limit of very large anisotropy we find that the DC conductivity vanishes as a consequence of dimensionality reduction. We also find that a metal-insulator transition arises driven by the anisotropy.

Title: An accurate and efficient framework for modelling the surface chemistry of ionic materials
Authors: Benjamin X. Shi, Andrew S. Rosen, Tobias Schäfer, Andreas Grüneis, Venkat Kapil, Andrea Zen, Angelos Michaelides
Abstract: Quantum-mechanical simulations can offer atomic-level insights into chemical processes on surfaces. This understanding is crucial for the rational design of new solid catalysts as well as materials to store energy and mitigate greenhouse gases. However, achieving the accuracy needed for reliable predictions has proven challenging. Density functional theory (DFT), the workhorse quantum-mechanical method, can often lead to inconsistent predictions, necessitating accurate methods from correlated wave-function theory (cWFT). However, the high computational demands and significant user intervention associated with cWFT have traditionally made it impractical to carry out for surfaces. In this work, we address this challenge, presenting an automated framework which leverages multilevel embedding approaches, to apply accurate cWFT methods to the surfaces of ionic materials with computational costs approaching DFT. With this framework, we have reproduced experimental adsorption enthalpies for a diverse set of 19 adsorbate-surface systems. Moreover, we resolve debates on the adsorption configuration of several systems, while offering benchmarks to assess DFT. This framework is open-source, making it possible to more routinely apply cWFT to complex problems involving the surfaces of ionic materials.

Title: Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States
Authors: Qiaofeng Liu, Ian Low, Zhewei Yin
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.

Title: On the generalized Langevin equation and the Mori projection operator technique
Authors: Christoph Widder, Johannes Zimmer, Tanja Schilling
Abstract: In statistical physics, the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism (also called Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator formalism) is used to derive a linear integro-differential equation for observables in Hilbert space, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). This technique relies on the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part. We prove that the GLE together with the second fluctuation dissipation theorem (2FDT) uniquely define the fluctuating forces as well as the memory kernel. The GLE and 2FDT are an immediate consequence of the existence and uniqueness of solutions of linear Volterra equations. They neither rely on the Dyson identity nor on the concept of orthogonal dynamics. This holds true for autonomous as well as non-autonomous systems. Further results are obtained for the Mori projection for autonomous systems, for which the fluctuating forces are orthogonal to the observable of interest. In particular, we prove that the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup generated by $\overline{\mathcal{QL}}Q$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the time evolution operator, and $\mathcal{P}=1-\mathcal{Q}$ is the Mori projection operator. As a consequence, the corresponding orbit maps (e.g. the fluctuating forces) are the unique mild solutions of the associated abstract Cauchy problem. Furthermore, we show that the orthogonal dynamics is a unitary group, if $\mathcal{L}$ is skew-adjoint. In this case, the fluctuating forces are stationary. In addition, we present a proof of the GLE by means of semigroup theory, and we retrieve the commonly used definitions for the fluctuating forces, memory kernel, and orthogonal dynamics. Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems, whose time evolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup. This includes large classes of systems in classical statistical mechanics.

Abstract: The utility of near-term quantum computers for simulating realistic quantum systems hinges on the stability of digital quantum matter--realized when discrete quantum gates approximate continuous time evolution--and whether it can be maintained at system sizes and time scales inaccessible to classical simulations. Here, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to simulate digitized dynamics of the quantum Ising model and observe the emergence of Floquet prethermalization on timescales where accurate simulations using current classical methods are extremely challenging (if feasible at all). In addition to confirming the stability of dynamics subject to achievable digitization errors, we show direct evidence of the resultant local equilibration by computing diffusion constants associated with an emergent hydrodynamic description of the dynamics. Our results were enabled by continued advances in two-qubit gate quality (native partial entangler fidelities of 99.94(1)%) that allow us to access circuit volumes of over 2000 two-qubit gates. This work establishes digital quantum computers as powerful tools for studying continuous-time dynamics and demonstrates their potential to benchmark classical heuristics in a regime of scale and complexity where no known classical methods are both efficient and trustworthy.

Title: Spin-Phonon Relaxation of Boron-Vacancy Centers in Two-Dimensional Boron Nitride Polytypes
Authors: Nasrin Estaji, Ismaeil Abdolhosseini Sarsari, Gergő Thiering, Adam Gali
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.

Title: How does the entanglement entropy of a many-body quantum system change after a single measurement?
Authors: Bo Fan, Can Yin, Antonio M. García-García
Abstract: For one-dimensional free Dirac fermions, we compute numerically the probability distribution of the change in the entanglement entropy (EE), after the saturation time, resulting from a single measurement of the occupation number by using different measurement protocols. For the quantum jump and the projective measurement protocols, we observe clear deviations from Gaussianity characterized by broader and asymmetric tails, exponential for positive values of the change, and a peak at zero that increases with the system size and the monitoring strength supporting that in all cases the EE is in the area law phase. Another distinct feature of the distribution is its spatial inhomogeneity. In the weak monitoring limit, the distribution is close to Gaussian with a broad support for boundary point separating the two subsystems defining the EE while for the rest of sites has asymmetric exponential tails and a much narrower support. For a quantum state diffusion protocol, the distribution is Gaussian for weak monitoring. As the monitoring strength increases, it gradually develops symmetric exponential tails. In the strong monitoring limit, the tails are still exponential but the core turns from Gaussian to strongly peaked at zero suggesting the dominance of quantum Zeno effect. For all monitoring strengths, the distribution is size independent.

Title: Non-local charges from perturbed defects via SymTFT in 2d CFT
Authors: Federico Ambrosino, Ingo Runkel, Gérard M. T. Watts
Abstract: We investigate non-local conserved charges in perturbed two-dimensional conformal field theories from the point of view of the 3d SymTFT of the unperturbed theory. In the SymTFT we state a simple commutation condition which results in a pair of compatible bulk and defect perturbations, such that the perturbed line defects are conserved in the perturbed CFT. In other words, the perturbed defects are rigidly translation invariant, and such defects form a monoidal category which extends the topological symmetries. As examples we study the A-type Virasoro minimal models $M(p,q)$. Our formalism provides one-parameter families of commuting non-local conserved charges for perturbations by a primary bulk field with Kac label $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, or $(1,5)$, which are the standard integrable perturbations of minimal models. We find solutions to the commutation condition also for other bulk perturbations, such as $(1,7)$, and we contrast this with the existence of local conserved charges. There has been recent interest in the possibility that in certain cases perturbations by fields such as $(1,7)$ can be integrable, and our construction provides a new way in which integrability can be found without the need for local conserved charges.

Title: Noise-Aware Entanglement Generation Protocols for Superconducting Qubits with Impedance-Matched FBAR Transducers
Authors: Erin Sheridan, Michael Senatore, Samuel Schwab, Eric Aspling, Taylor Wagner, James Schneeloch, Stephen McCoy, Daniel Campbell, David Hucul, Zachary Smith, Matthew LaHaye
Abstract: Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $>90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.

Title: Lifetime-limited Gigahertz-frequency Mechanical Oscillators with Millisecond Coherence Times
Authors: Yizhi Luo, Hilel Hagai Diamandi, Hanshi Li, Runjiang Bi, David Mason, Taekwan Yoon, Xinghan Guo, Hanlin Tang, Ryan O. Behunin, Frederick J. Walker, Charles Ahn, Peter T. Rakich
Abstract: High-frequency mechanical oscillators with long coherence times are essential to realizing a variety of high-fidelity quantum sensors, transducers, and memories. However, the unprecedented coherence times needed for quantum applications require exquisitely sensitive new techniques to probe the material origins of phonon decoherence and new strategies to mitigate decoherence in mechanical oscillators. Here, we combine non-invasive laser spectroscopy techniques with materials analysis to identify key sources of phonon decoherence in crystalline media. Using micro-fabricated high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators ($\mu$HBARs) as an experimental testbed, we identify phonon-surface interactions as the dominant source of phonon decoherence in crystalline quartz; lattice distortion, subsurface damage, and high concentration of elemental impurities near the crystal surface are identified as the likely causes. Removal of this compromised surface layer using an optimized polishing process is seen to greatly enhance coherence times, enabling $\mu$HBARs with Q-factors of > 240 million at 12 GHz frequencies, corresponding to > 6 ms phonon coherence times and record-level f-Q products. Complementary phonon linewidth and time-domain ringdown measurements, performed using a new Brillouin-based pump-probe spectroscopy technique, reveal negligible dephasing within these oscillators. Building on these results, we identify a path to > 100 ms coherence times as the basis for high-frequency quantum memories. These findings clearly demonstrate that, with enhanced control over surfaces, dissipation and noise can be significantly reduced in a wide range of quantum systems.

Title: Ground State Energy of He molecule Using a Four-Qubit Photonic Processor with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Badie Ghavami, Forouzan Mirmasoudi
Abstract: To understand the properties and interactions of materials, and determining the ground state energies is one of the important challenges in quantum chemistry, materials science, and quantum mechanics, where quantum computing can play an important role for studying the properties of materials. In this study, we have explored the quantum processor application to compute the He molecule ground state energy which utilizes the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In here, we have implemented VQE on a state-of-the-art quantum processor, optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit to minimize the energy expectation value of the He molecule's Hamiltonian on the four qubits processor. The obtained results of this work show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to classical computational methods, such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, which demonstrate the compute potential of quantum algorithms in quantum many-body problems. Thus, these results demonstrate the advantages of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy in simulations of molecular and material properties, and pave the way for future applications in more complex systems. This work highlights the potential of quantum processors in the fields of quantum chemistry, computational physics, and data science.
