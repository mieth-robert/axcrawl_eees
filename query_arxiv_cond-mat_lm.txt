Title: Intermittent shot noise generating 1/f fluctuations
Authors: Ferdinand Grueneis
Abstract: When the rate of shot noise is controlled by on-off states we speak of intermittent shot noise. The on-off states lead to alternately occurring clusters of events and intermissions, respectively. We derive the power spectrum of the intermittent shot noise by applying the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. Besides reduced shot noise, we obtain excess noise, which depends on the parameters of the on-off states. We calculate the excess noise for power-law distributed on-states; within the scaling region, the excess noise is excellently approximated by C/f^b. The behavior of the slope b and of the amplitude C in dependence of the on-off times is investigated. For large scaling regions we find a preference for a pure 1/f shape. Finally, we regard the variance of events occurring within a time interval. In the presence of 1/f fluctuations, the variance of counts attains extreme values which are accompanied by an extreme property of slope b.

Title: Investigation of electronic energy levels in a weak ferromagnetic oxygen-deficient BiFeO2.85 thick film using absorption and X ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies
Authors: Ramachandran Balakrishnan, Ambesh Dixit, Mamidanna Sri Ramachandra Rao
Abstract: We grew a 2 micron thick film of single-phase BiFeO3 on a Si (100) substrate by pulsed laser deposition with a substrate temperature of 575 oC and an oxygen partial pressure of 0.06 mbar. X ray diffraction analysis indicated that the film exhibits textured growth along the (110) plane and possesses a rhombohedral R3c structure. Investigations using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed an average grain size of about 300 nm and a surface roughness of 18 nm for the film. Energy dispersive X ray analysis estimated the composition of the film to be BiFeO2.85. Temperature- and magnetic field dependent magnetization measurements demonstrated weak ferromagnetic properties in the BiFeO2.85 film, with a non-zero spontaneous magnetization at H = 0 Oe across the temperature range of 2 to 300 K. Furthermore, the exchange bias field (HEB) of the film changed from the positive exchange bias field (+HEB = +6.45 Oe) at 200 K to a negative field (-HEB = -8.12 Oe) at 100 K, indicating a shift in macroscopic magnetism from antiferromagnetic to weak ferromagnetic order below 200 K. Elemental analysis via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the Fe ions in the BiFeO2.85 film are in a 3+ valence state, and a peak feature at 532.1 eV confirmed the presence of induced oxygen vacancies. UV visible NIR and valence band spectroscopic studies showed that the direct band-gap energy, and the separation between the valence band maximum and Fermi energy were approximately 2.27 eV and 0.9 eV, respectively, which are red-shifted when compared to its bulk form.

Title: Negative and positive anisotropic thermal expansion in 2D fullerene networks
Authors: Armaan Shaikh, Bo Peng
Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular double bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.

Title: Grotthuss-type oxygen hole polaron transport in desodiated Na$_{2}$Mn$_3$O$_7$
Authors: Ming Lei, Iwnetim I. Abate
Abstract: Polarons are quasiparticles that arise from the coupling of electrons or holes with ionic vibrations in polarizable materials. Typically, they are either localized at a single atomic site or delocalized over multiple sites. However, after the desodiation of Na$_{2}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$, we identify a rare split-hole polaron, where a single hole is shared between two adjacent oxygen atoms rather than fully localized or delocalized. We present a density functional theory (DFT) study on the migration and transport properties of these oxygen hole polarons in NaMn$_{3}$O$_{7}$ and Na$_{1.5}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$. Our calculations reveal that the split polaron configuration near a sodium vacancy is the ground state, while the localized polaron acts as the transition state. Migration occurs via a stepwise charge transfer mechanism along the $b$-axis, where the split-hole polaron transitions through a localized hole state. This transport behavior closely resembles the Grotthuss mechanism, which describes proton transport in H$_{2}$O. We compute the polaron mobility as $\mu$ = 1.37 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^2$/(V$\cdot$s) with an energy barrier of 242 meV. Using the Mulliken-Hush theory, we determine the electronic coupling parameter $V_{AB}$ = 0.87 eV. A similar migration mechanism is observed in Na$_{1.5}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$, where the split polaron remains more stable than in the localized state. This study provides the first theoretical investigation of split-hole polaron migration, offering new insights into the charge transport of exotic polaronic species in materials with implications for a wide range of functional materials including battery cathodes, thermoelectrics, photocatalysts, and next-generation optoelectronic devices.

Title: One-dimensional conduction channels in the correlated Mott NiS2 arising from obstructed Wannier charges
Authors: Mikel Iraola, Haojie Guo, Fabio Orlandi, Sebastian Klemenz, Martina Soldini, Sandra Sajan, Pascal Manuel, Jeroen van den Brink, Titus Neupert, Miguel M. Ugeda, Leslie M. Schoop, Maia G. Vergniory
Abstract: NiS2, a compound characterized by its pyrite structure, uniquely bridges the realms of strong correlation physics and topology. While bulk NiS2 is known to be a Mott or charge-transfer insulator, its surface displays anomalous metallic behavior and finite conductivity. Using high-resolution neutron scattering data and symmetry analysis, we propose a refined description of NiS2's magnetic phases by introducing a novel model for its ground state. Combined with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we unveil the presence of edge states in both Ni- and S-terminated surfaces, which exhibit remarkable resilience to external magnetic fields. Although both types of edge states exhibit similar properties, only the edge states at the Ni termination populate the vicinity of the Fermi level and, therefore contribute to the surface conductivity. Utilizing ab initio methods combined with a topological quantum chemistry analysis, we attribute these edge states to obstructed atomic charges originating from bulk topology. Overall, this work not only deepens our understanding of NiS2 but also lays a robust experimental and theoretical foundation for further exploration of the interplay between one-dimensional step-edge states and the Wannier obstruction in correlated materials.

Title: Engineering 2D Surface Patterns with the VicCa Model
Authors: Marta A. Chabowska, Magdalena A. Załuska-Kotur
Abstract: We employed the VicCA model to investigate the influence of step-edge potential on nucleation and pattern formation, aiming to gain deeper insights into island formation and growth. Our study explores fractal structures governed by general cellular automaton (CA) rules, as well as compact structures shaped by density-dependent attachment mechanisms. We demonstrate that modifications to the CA framework have a significant impact on surface patterning, emphasizing the critical role of adatom attachment rules and the substantial effect of potential well depth on the resulting surface morphology.

Title: Topological Phase Transition in the Two-Leg Hubbard Model: Emergence of the Haldane Phase via Diagonal Hopping and Strong Interactions
Authors: João Pedro Gama D'Elia, Thereza Paiva
Abstract: We investigate the two-leg Hubbard model with diagonal hopping to explore the interplay between geometrical frustration and strong electron-electron interactions. Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, we demonstrate the emergence of a topological Haldane phase, which results explicitly from the complementary effects of diagonal hopping-induced frustration and strong on-site Coulomb repulsion. The topological phase transition from a trivial insulator to the nontrivial Haldane phase is characterized by significant changes in magnetic properties, edge correlations, and the appearance of a nonzero string order parameter. Furthermore, we confirm the topological nature of this phase through a detailed analysis of the spin gap and entanglement spectrum, demonstrating clear signatures of symmetry-protected topological order.

Title: Exploring non-collinear magnetic ground states in tetragonal Mn$_2$-based Heusler compounds
Authors: Jorge Cardenas-Gamboa, Edouard Lesne, Arthur Ernst, Maia G. Vergniory, Paul McClarty, Claudia Felser
Abstract: Heusler compounds constitute a large family of intermetallic materials notable for their wide variety of properties such as magnetism, multi-ferroicity, nontrivial band topology, superconductivity and so on. Among their magnetic properties one finds a tremendous variety of states from simple ferromagnetism to skyrmion crystals. In most Mn$_2$-based Heuslers the magnetism is typically collinear. An exception is Mn$_2$RhSn in which an unusual ground state with magnetic canting and a temperature-induced spin re-orientation into the collinear ferrimagnetic phase has been reported from experiments. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations and mean field theory to provide a simple account of the unusual phase diagram in this magnet. We also highlight Weyl points in the computed band structure of \mrs\ and the resulting Fermi arcs.

Title: Homes' Law and Universal Planckian Relaxation
Authors: A. Shekhter, M. K. Chan R. D. McDonald, N. Harrison
Abstract: According to Zaanen's interpretation of Homes' empirical law~[Zaanen, {\it Nature} {\bf 430}, 512 (2004)], the superconducting transition temperatures in the cuprates are high because their metallic states are as viscous as quantum mechanics permits. Here, we show that Homes' law in fact implies three key points: (i) the resistivity is linear in temperature in the normal state near the transition temperature; (ii) the dimensionless coefficient of proportionality of the relaxation rate with temperature is of order unity -- the so-called universal Planckian relaxation rate; and (iii) the logarithmically broad applicability of this law arises from an unusually wide range of effective masses throughout the cuprate phase diagram. In fact, a universal Planckian relaxation rate implies Homes' law only if the mechanism of mass renormalization is independent of the Planckian relaxation.

Title: Decoupling Coherent and Particle-like Phonon Transport through Bonding Hierarchy in Soft Superionic Crystals
Authors: Wenjie Xiong, Hao Huang, Yu Wu, Xinji Xu, Geng Li, Zonglin Gu, Shuming Zeng
Abstract: Within the framework of the unified theory thermal transport model, the competing contributions of coherent and incoherent terms create a trade-off relationship, posing substantial challenges to achieving a reduction in overall $\rm \kappa_L$. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that the superionic crystals X$_6$Re$_6$S$_8$I$_8$ (X = Rb, Cs) exhibit ultralow glass-like and particle-like thermal conductivities. The weak interactions between free alkali metal ions X$^+$ (X = Rb, Cs) and I$^-$ anions induce pronounced lattice anharmonicity, which enhances phonon scattering and suppresses group velocities, thereby reducing the particle-like thermal conductivity ($\rm \kappa_p$). Concurrently, the significant bonding heterogeneity within the [Re$_6$S$_8$I$_6$]$^{4-}$ clusters promotes phonon dispersion flattening and low-frequency phonon localization. The resulting discretized phonon flat bands substantially diminish the glass-like thermal conductivity ($\rm \kappa_c$). At room temperature, the total $\rm \kappa_L$ of X$_6$Re$_6$S$_8$I$_8$ (X = Rb, Cs) falls below 0.2 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. Furthermore, the bonding characteristics between X$^+$ and I$^{-1}$ anions induce an anomalous cation mass-independent stiffening of low-frequency phonon branches in this system, resulting in counterintuitive thermal transport behavior. This work elucidates fundamental mechanisms governing heat transfer in ultralow $\rm \kappa_L$ materials and establishes novel pathways for transcending conventional thermal conductivity limitations.

Title: Frequency Dependent Magnetic Susceptibility and the $q^2$ effective conductivity tensor
Authors: Alistair H. Duff, J. E. Sipe
Abstract: We apply a microscopic formalism for the calculation of material response properties to the problem of the generalization of a first-principles, i.e based on the energy spectrum and geometric properties of the Bloch functions, derivation of the AC magnetic susceptibility. We find that the AC susceptibility forms only a part of the $q^2$ -- where $q$ is the wavevector of the applied field -- effective conductivity tensor, and many additional response tensors characterizing both electric and magnetic multipole moments response to electromagnetic fields and their derivatives must be included to create the full gauge-invariant response. As was seen with the DC magnetic susceptibility and optical activity (characterized by the linear in $q$ contribution to the conductivity) one must be careful with the diagonal elements of the Berry connection. To our knowledge this is the only derivation of such a result general for crystalline insulators, with both `atomic like' contributions and `itinerant contributions' due to overlap of atomic orbitals and non-flat bands. Additionally, quantities familiar from quantum geometry like the Berry connection, curvature, and quantum metric appear extensively.

Title: Experimental evidence of non-equilibrium phase separation in supercritical fluids
Authors: Juho Lee, Yeonguk Kim, Jong Dae Jang, Changwoo Do, Min Young Ha, Gunsu Yun
Abstract: Supercritical fluids (SCFs) have long been considered homogeneous and structureless, yet recent studies suggest the existence of transient, liquid-like clusters under dynamic processes. In this study, we provide experimental evidence of semi-stable non-equilibrium phase separation in SCFs through opacity measurements and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). By investigating the thermophysical properties of helium, argon, and krypton during adiabatic expansion, we show that cooling dynamics vary significantly among species, influencing cluster formation. Neutron scattering measurements reveal distinct variations in signal intensity, supporting that the clusters slowly dissolve into the background with a surprisingly long time scale of tens of minutes. Given that SCFs in industrial applications frequently experience dynamic, non-equilibrium conditions rather than in strict thermodynamic equilibrium, our results provide crucial insights with potential implications for advanced material processing, energy systems, and chemical engineering.

Title: Extended Hybridization Expansion Solver for Impurity Models with Retarded Interactions
Authors: Lei Gu, Jia Luo, Ruqian Wu, Guoping Zhao
Abstract: We extend the continuous-time hybridization expansion solver to a general form, where the hybridization function and retarded interaction are treated on equal footing. Correlation functions can now be directly obtained via functional derivatives with respect to the bosonic propagators, similar to the measurement of Green's functions. We devise a combinatorial scheme of measuring the correlation function, whose efficiency partially emulates that of the Green's function measurement. The algorithm and numerical methods are validated through application to an impurity model involving both electron-phonon coupling and exchange interactions, a case where the previous hybridization expansion algorithm is not applicable. Our improvement of the hybridization expansion solver promotes its applicability in studies of electron-phonon coupling, the extended dynamical mean field theory, and the dual boson method.

Title: Two-stage evolution of magnetic correlations in spiral spin liquid material, Ca$_{10}$Cr$_{7}$O$_{28}$
Authors: Changhyun Koo, Jaena Park, Johannes Werner, Suheon Lee, Christian Balz, A.T.M. Nazmul Islam, Yugo Oshima, Bella Lake, Kwang-Yong Choi, Rüdiger Klingeler
Abstract: We present an X-band and tunable high-frequency/high-field electron spin resonance (HF-ESR) study of single-crystalline Ca$_{10}$Cr$_{7}$O$_{28}$, which constitutes alternating antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic kagome bilayers. At high temperatures, a phonon-assisted relaxation process is evoked to account for the pronounced increase of the linewidth in an exchange-narrowing regime ($k_{\rm B}T\gg J$). In contrast, at low temperatures ($k_{\rm B}T\lesssim J$), a power-law behavior in line narrowing is observed. Our data reveal two distinct power-law regimes for the linewidth which crossover at $T^*\approx 7.5$~K. Notably, the intriguing evolution of the ESR linewidth in this alternating kagome bilayer system with opposite sign of exchange interactions highlights distinct spin dynamics compared to those in a uniform kagome antiferromagnet.

Title: In situ and real-time ultrafast spectroscopy of photoinduced reactions in perovskite nanomaterials
Authors: Gi Rim Han, Mai Ngoc An, Hyunmin Jang, Noh Soo Han, JunWoo Kim, Kwang Seob Jeong, Tai Hyun Yoon, Minhaeng Cho
Abstract: Employing two synchronized mode-locked femtosecond lasers and interferometric detection of the pump-probe spectra -- referred to as asynchronous and interferometric transient absorption (AI-TA) -- we have developed a method for broad dynamic range and rapid data acquisition. Using AI-TA, we examined photochemical changes during femtosecond pump-probe experiments on all-inorganic cesium lead halide nanomaterials, including perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) and nanoplatelets (PeNPLs). The laser pulse train facilitates photoreactions while allowing real-time observation of charge carrier dynamics. In PeNCs undergoing halide anion photo-substitution, transient absorption spectra showed increasing bandgap energy and faster relaxation dynamics as the Cl/Br ratio increased. For colloidal PeNPLs, continuous observation revealed both spectral and kinetic changes during the light-induced coalescence of nanoplatelets, by analyzing temporal segments. This integrated technique not only deepens understanding of exciton dynamics and environmental influences in perovskite nanomaterials but also establishes AI-TA as a transformative tool for real-time observation of photochemical dynamics.

Title: Exact characterization of anisotropic properties in confined hard-sphere systems
Authors: Ana M. Montero, Andrés Santos
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) system of hard spheres confined within a cylindrical pore so narrow that only nearest-neighbor interactions are possible. By mapping the Q1D system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse mixture of nonadditive hard rods, we obtain exact thermodynamic and structural properties, including the radial distribution function, which had remained elusive in previous studies. We derive analytical expressions for limiting cases, such as small pore diameters, virial coefficients, and extreme pressures. Additionally, we identify a transition in the anisotropic pressure components, where the transverse pressure surpasses the longitudinal one at high densities if the pore diameter exceeds a critical threshold. Finally, we analyze spatial correlations in particle arrangements and fluctuations in radial positioning, providing insight into the emergence of ordering in confined systems.

Title: CrystalFormer-RL: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Materials Design
Authors: Zhendong Cao, Lei Wang
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning has instrumental enhanced the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we explore the applications of reinforcement fine-tuning to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer (arXiv:2403.15734) using discriminative machine learning models such as interatomic potentials and property prediction models. By optimizing reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material property figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning enables not only the property-guided novel material design ability of generative pre-trained model but also unlocks property-driven material retrieval from the unsupervised pre-training dataset. Leveraging rewards from discriminative models to fine-tune materials generative models opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials.

Title: Weak Itinerant Ferromagnetism (WIFM) in MAX phase compound Cr$_{1.9}$Fe$_{0.1}$GeC
Authors: Suman Mondal, Mohamad Numan, Kurt Kummer, Sawada Masahiro, Subham Majumdar
Abstract: Magnetic MAX phase compounds are important materials for studying the two-dimensional magnetism because of their layered crystallographic structure. The hexagonal MAX phase compound Cr$_2$GeC is a Pauli paramagnet, and here we report the induction of an ordered magnetic state by doping Fe at the Cr site. Induced magnetism for small doping concentrations (indicated as 5% and 2.5%) is found to have a weak itinerant ferromagnetic character. The Rhodes-Wolhfarth ratio is found to be 13.29, while the coefficient of electronic heat capacity ($\Gamma$) is 27 mJ-mol$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ for Cr$_{1.9}$Fe$_{0.1}$GeC. Our x-ray magnetic circular dichorism measurement confirms that the magnetic moment arises from the Fe atom only, and Cr has negligible contribution towards the ordered moment. Our critical analysis indicates that the magnetic phase transition in Cr$_{1.9}$Fe$_{0.1}$GeC follows mean field theory.

Title: Response of magnetic particle to rotating magnetic field in viscoelastic fluid
Authors: Han Gao, Zhiyuan Zhao, Masao Doi, Ye Xu
Abstract: The rotational dynamics of a freely suspended ferromagnetic particle in viscoelastic fluid subjected to a rotating magnetic field is studied by experiments and theory. Our result reveals that when the characteristic relaxation time of the fluid is much smaller than the inverse critical field frequency, the particle's rotation behavior aligns with that in Newtonian fluids. Increasing the relaxation time enhances the time-averaged rotation frequency of the particle that undergo asynchronous rotation. Moreover, the critical frequency is shown to scale linearly with the magnetic field intensity and inversely with the fluid's zero-shear viscosity. Our work is expected to guide precise manipulation of ferromagnetic particles in biomedical systems where viscoelastic environments dominate.

Title: Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity: stability and attractors in slip rate driven processes
Authors: Jalal Smiri, Oğuz Umut Salman, Ioan R. Ionescu
Abstract: Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructral changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. Interestingly, we demonstrate that even size-independent models can exhibit size-dependent effects through variations in initial dislocation density. Notably, the initial dislocation density significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of micro-pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.

Title: Designing optimal elastic filaments for viscous propulsion
Authors: Mariia Dvoriashyna, Eric Lauga
Abstract: The propulsion of many eukaryotic cells is generated by flagella, flexible slender filaments that are actively oscillating in space and time. The dynamics of these biological appendages have inspired the design of many types of artificial microswimmers. The magnitude of the filament's viscous propulsion depends on the time-varying shape of the filament, and that shape depends in turn on the spatial distribution of the bending rigidity of the filament. In this work, we rigorously determine the relationship between the mechanical (bending) properties of the filament and the viscous thrust it produces using mathematical optimisation. Specifically, by considering a model system (a slender elastic filament with an oscillating slope at its base), we derive the optimal bending rigidity function along the filament that maximises the time-averaged thrust produced by the actuated filament. Instead of prescribing a specific functional form, we use functional optimisation and adjoint-based variational calculus to formally establish the link between the distribution of bending rigidity and propulsion. The optimal rigidities are found to be stiff near the base, and soft near the distal end, with a spatial distribution that depends critically on the constraints used in the optimisation procedure. These findings may guide the optimal design of future artificial swimmers.

Title: Finite steady-state current defies non-Hermitian many-body localization
Authors: Pietro Brighi, Marko Ljubotina, Federico Roccati, Federico Balducci
Abstract: Non-Hermitian many-body localization (NH MBL) has emerged as a possible scenario for stable localization in open systems, as suggested by spectral indicators identifying a putative transition for finite system sizes. In this work, we shift the focus to dynamical probes, specifically the steady-state spin current, to investigate transport properties in a disordered, non-Hermitian XXZ spin chain. Through exact diagonalization for small systems and tensor-network methods for larger chains, we demonstrate that the steady-state current remains finite and decays exponentially with disorder strength, showing no evidence of a transition up to disorder values far beyond the previously claimed critical point. Our results reveal a stark discrepancy between spectral indicators, which suggest localization, and transport behavior, which indicates delocalization. This highlights the importance of dynamical observables in characterizing NH MBL and suggests that traditional spectral measures may not fully capture the physics of non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, we observe a non-commutativity of limits in system size and time, further complicating the interpretation of finite-size studies. These findings challenge the existence of NH MBL in the studied model and underscore the need for alternative approaches to understand localization in non-Hermitian settings.

Title: Optimal first-passage times of active Brownian particles under stochastic resetting
Authors: Yanis Baouche, Christina Kurzthaler
Abstract: We study the first-passage-time (FPT) properties of an active Brownian particle under stochastic resetting to its initial configuration, comprising its position and orientation, to reach an absorbing wall in two dimensions. Coupling a perturbative approach for low Péclet numbers, measuring the relative importance of self-propulsion with respect to diffusion, with the renewal framework for the stochastic resetting process, we derive analytical expressions for the survival probability, the FPT probability density, and the associated low-order moments. Depending on their initial orientation, the minimal mean FPT for active particles to reach the boundary can both decrease and increase relative to the passive counterpart. The associated optimal resetting rates depend non-trivially on the initial distance to the boundary due to the intricate interplay of resetting, rotational Brownian noise, and active motion.

Title: Rigid m-percolation in limited-valence gels
Authors: J. C. Neves, J. M. Tavares, N. A. M. Araújo, C. S. Dias
Abstract: Determining the onset of rigidity in gels is a fundamental challenge with significant practical implications across different applications. Limited-valence, or patchy-particle systems have proven to be a valuable model to study the relationship between microscopic interactions and macroscopic mechanical properties. It has been suggested that the emergence of rigidity coincides with the formation of an infinitely spanning cluster of particles with at least three bonds. This work explores this hypothesis, its implications, and its broader applicability across a range of system parameters, by associating the emergence of rigidity with m-percolation transition for m=3. The properties of m-percolation are developed using a mean-field theoretical approach validated with numerical simulations, and used to build phase and rigidity diagrams for different particle valences of both single-component systems and binary mixtures of patchy particles. The difference between connectivity and rigidity percolation thresholds is found to reduce with increasing valence, providing an explanation for the challenges encountered in experimental attempts to distinguish isotropic connectivity percolation from the onset of rigidity. For binary mixtures, we found a robust minimum average valence, below which the gel is never rigid.

Title: Tilted dipolar bosons in the quasi-2D regime: from liquid stripes to droplets
Authors: Juan Sánchez-Baena
Abstract: We characterize a system of tilted dipoles in a quasi two-dimensional (flattened) geometry and in the thermodynamic limit. We consider a finite trapping in the z-axis achievable in current experiments. We compute the phase diagram of the system at its equilibrium density for high tilting angles, where it becomes self-bound, and a striped liquid state emerges. To characterize the system, we perform a variational calculation, which is benchmarked with the solution of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We connect the phenomenology in the thermodynamic limit to the physics of the finite-size system, provide parameters for the realization of potentially supersolid striped states and study the critical number for dipolar droplet formation. Our results are helpful to guide potential experiments in the study of dipolar atoms in quasi two-dimensional geometries in the dipole-dominated regime.

Title: An all-electrical scheme for valley polarization in graphene
Authors: Sachchidanand Das, Abhiram Soori
Abstract: We propose an all-electrical setup for achieving valley polarization in graphene. The setup consists of a finite graphene sheet connected to normal metal electrodes on both sides, with the junctions aligned along the zigzag edges while the armchair edges remain free. Each normal metal has two terminals, and when a bias is applied at one terminal while keeping the other three grounded, valley polarization arises due to transverse momentum matching between graphene and the normal metal. The valley polarization is maximized when the Fermi wave vector of the normal metal is approximately half the separation between the $K$ and $K'$ valleys in graphene. We analyze the dependence of conductance and valley polarization on system parameters such as the width and length of the graphene sheet, as well as the chemical potentials of graphene and the normal metal. The conductance through graphene increases with its width, while an increase in length initially reduces the conductance before leading to oscillatory behavior due to Fabry-Pérot interference. The valley polarization efficiency decreases with increasing graphene length due to inter-valley mixing from back-and-forth reflections within the graphene region. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of disorder in graphene and find that while conductance near the Dirac point increases with disorder strength due to enhanced density of states, valley polarization efficiency decreases due to intervalley scattering. Our results provide insights into controlling valley polarization in graphene-based devices for valleytronic applications.

Title: An Overview of Josephson Junctions Based QPUs
Authors: Omid Mohebi, Alireza Hesam Mohseni
Abstract: Quantum processing units (QPUs) based on superconducting Josephson junctions promise significant advances in quantum computing. However, they face critical challenges. Decoherence, scalability limitations, and error correction overhead hinder practical, fault-tolerant implementations. This paper investigates these issues by exploring both fundamental quantum phenomena and practical engineering challenges. We analyze key quantum mechanical principles such as superposition, entanglement, and decoherence that govern the behavior of superconducting qubits. We also discuss quantum tunneling, Cooper pair formation, and the operational mechanics of Josephson junctions in detail. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis with alternative architectures, including ion trap and photonic systems. This comparison highlights the unique advantages and trade-offs of Josephson junction-based QPUs. Our findings emphasize the critical role of material innovations and optimized control techniques. These advances are essential for mitigating noise and decoherence and for realizing robust, scalable quantum computing.

Title: A complimentary impedance spectroscopy biosensing method with graphene
Authors: Munis Khan, Ivan Mijakovic, Santosh Pandit, August Yurgens
Abstract: We present a method where a bioactive functional layer on an electrically conductive thin film with high sheet resistance can be effectively used for complementary electrochemical impedance spectroscopy biosensing. The functional layer's properties, such as double-layer capacitance and charge-transfer resistance, influence the complex impedance of the thin film in direct contact with the layer. These measurements can be performed using a simple low-frequency setup with a lock-in amplifier. When graphene is used as the resistive thin film, the signal may also include contributions from graphene's quantum capacitance, which is sensitive to charge transfer to and from the graphene. Unlike in traditional graphene biosensors, changes in electrolyte properties over time, such as those caused by the dissolution of ambient gases, do not significantly affect AC measurements. This technique supports biosensor miniaturization, ensures stable operation, and provides reliable biomarker detection with a high signal-to-noise ratio.

Title: RAFFLE: Active learning accelerated interface structure prediction
Authors: Ned Thaddeus Taylor, Joe Pitfield, Francis Huw Davies, Steven Paul Hepplestone
Abstract: Interfaces between materials play a crucial role in the performance of most devices. However, predicting the structure of a material interface is computationally demanding due to the vast configuration space, which requires evaluating an unfeasibly large number of highly complex structures. We introduce RAFFLE, a software package designed to efficiently explore low-energy interface configurations between any two crystals. RAFFLE leverages physical insights and genetic algorithms to intelligently sample the configuration space, using dynamically evolving 2-, 3-, and 4-body distribution functions as generalised structural descriptors. These descriptors are iteratively updated through active learning, which inform atom placement strategies. RAFFLE's effectiveness is demonstrated across a diverse set of systems, including bulk materials, intercalation structures, and interfaces. When tested on bulk aluminium and MoS$_2$, it successfully identifies known ground-state and high-pressure phases. Applied to intercalation systems, it predicts stable intercalant phases. For Si|Ge interfaces, RAFFLE identifies intermixing as a strain compensation mechanism, generating reconstructions that are more stable than abrupt interfaces. By accelerating interface structure prediction, RAFFLE offers a powerful tool for materials discovery, enabling efficient exploration of complex configuration spaces.

Title: Superconductivity in the Medium-Entropy/High-Entropy Re-based Alloys with a Non-Centrosymmetric $α$-Mn Lattice
Authors: Kuan Li, Longfu Li, Lingyong Zenga, Yucheng Li, Rui Chen, Peifeng Yu, Kangwang Wang, Zaichen Xiang, Tian Shang, Huixia Luo
Abstract: Medium or high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs) and rhenium-based compounds with a non-centrosymmetric (NC) structure have received a lot of attention for offering a fertile soil in search for unconventional superconductivity. Here, five previously unreported NC Re-based MEA-HEA superconductors with an $\alpha$-Mn lattice are successfully synthesized, with their superconducting transition temperatures (Tcs) ranging from 4 to 5 K. An increase in the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) can be achieved by modulating the valence electron count (VEC) through compositional adjustments. Magnetization measurements confirm that all the synthesized Re-based MEA-HEAs are bulk type-II superconductors. Specific heat analysis reveals that the superconducting state of these HEAs can be well described by a single-gap s-wave model. Our results show that the Kadowaki-Woods ratio of these $\alpha$-Mn MEA/HEA superconductors are close to the typical value of heavy fermion compounds, suggesting the existence of strong electronic correlation. These findings provide promising material platforms to study the role of high disorder in the origin of superconductivity in the NC MEAs-HEAs.

Title: Aging of ring polymeric topological glass formers via thermal quench
Authors: Arabinda Behera, Projesh Roy, Pinaki Chaudhuri, Satyavani Vemparala
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical response of glass-forming systems composed of topologically constrained ring polymers subjected to an instantaneous thermal quench, employing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that the onset of glassiness depends on polymer stiffness, with increased rigidity enhancing configurational constraints and delaying structural relaxation. In the glassy regime, the system exhibits hallmark aging characteristics, as evidenced by two-time correlation functions, namely the mean square displacement and self-intermediate scattering function, which display a clear dependence on the waiting time following the thermal quench. The extracted relaxation timescale ($\tau_\alpha$) follows an approximate simple aging scenario with waiting time ($t_w$), described by $\tau_\alpha \sim t_w^b$, where $0.8 < b < 0.93$. Finally, we analyze the threading of rings during the thermal quench, demonstrating that both increased and persistent threading correlate with the emergence of glassiness. Moreover, the threading persistence timescale exhibits a strong correlation with the structural relaxation timescale. Our study thus provides a comprehensive view of structural relaxation and aging in dense ring polymer systems, highlighting the critical roles of topological constraints and polymer stiffness in governing non-equilibrium glassy dynamics.

Title: Enhanced coherent terahertz emission from critical superconducting fluctuations in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.6}$
Authors: D. Nicoletti, M. Rosenberg, M. Buzzi, M. Fechner, M. H. Michael, P. E. Dolgirev, E. Demler, R. A. Vitalone, D. N. Basov, Y. Liu, S. Nakata, B. Keimer, A. Cavalleri
Abstract: Coherent terahertz (THz) emission is emerging as a powerful new tool to probe symmetry breakings in quantum materials. This method relies on second order optical nonlinearities and is complementary to second harmonic generation spectroscopy. Here, we report coherent THz emission from Josephson plasmons in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, and find that the amplitude of the emitted field increases dramatically close to the superconducting transition temperature, $T_C$. We show theoretically how emission is enhanced by critical superconducting fluctuations, a nonlinear analogue of critical opalescence. This observation is expected to be of general importance for the study of many thermal and quantum phase transitions.

Title: Quasi-periodic moiré patterns and dimensional localization in three-dimensional quasi-moiré crystals
Authors: Ce Wang, Chao Gao, Zhe-Yu Shi
Abstract: Recent advances in spin-dependent optical lattices [Meng et al., Nature \textbf{615}, 231 (2023)] have enabled the experimental implementation of two superimposed three-dimensional lattices, presenting new opportunities to investigate \textit{three-dimensional moiré physics} in ultracold atomic gases. This work studies the moiré physics of atoms within a spin-dependent cubic lattice with relative twists along different directions. It is discovered that dimensionality significantly influences the low-energy moiré physics. From a geometric perspective, this manifests in the observation that moiré patterns, generated by rotating lattices along different axes, can exhibit either periodic or quasi-periodic behavior--a feature not present in two-dimensional systems. We develop a low-energy effective theory applicable to systems with arbitrary rotation axes and small rotation angles. This theory elucidates the emergence of quasi-periodicity in three dimensions and demonstrates its correlation with the arithmetic properties of the rotation axes. Numerical analyses reveal that these quasi-periodic moiré potentials can lead to distinctive dimensional localization behaviors of atoms, manifesting as localized wave functions in planar or linear configurations.

Title: Topological signatures of collective dynamics and turbulent-like energy cascades in active granular matter
Authors: Zihan Zheng, Cunyuan Jiang, Yangrui Chen, Matteo Baggioli, Jie Zhang
Abstract: Active matter refers to a broad class of non-equilibrium systems where energy is continuously injected at the level of individual ``particles." These systems exhibit emergent collective behaviors that have no direct thermal-equilibrium counterpart. Their scale ranges from micrometer-sized swarms of bacteria to meter-scale human crowds. In recent years, the role of topology and self-propelled topological defects in active systems has garnered significant attention, particularly in polar and nematic active matter. Building on these ideas, we investigate emergent collective dynamics in apolar active granular fluids. Using granular vibrators as a model experimental system of apolar active Brownian particles in a dry environment, we uncover a distinctive three-stage time evolution arising from the intricate interplay between activity and inelastic interactions. By analyzing the statistics, spatial correlations, and dynamics of vortex-like topological defects in the displacement vector field, we demonstrate their ability to describe and predict this intrinsic collective motion. Furthermore, we show that topological defects play a crucial role in the development of a turbulent-like inverse energy cascade, where kinetic energy transfers across different length scales over time. As the system evolves, the power scaling of the energy transfer increases with the duration of observation. Our findings demonstrate how topological concepts can be applied to predict macroscopic collective phenomena in apolar active matter. This establishes a direct link between microscopic topological dynamics and large-scale behaviors in active granular fluids.

Title: Native defects, hydrogen impurities, and metal dopants in CeO$_2$
Authors: Khang Hoang, Michelle D. Johannes
Abstract: Ceria (CeO$_2$) is a material of significant technological importance. A detailed understanding of the material's defect physics and chemistry is key to understanding and optimizing its properties. Here, we report a hybrid density-functional study of native point defects, hydrogen impurities, and metal dopants in CeO$_2$. We find that electron polarons ($\eta_{\rm Ce}^-$) and oxygen vacancies ($V_{\rm O}^{2+}$) are the dominant native defects under conditions ranging from extreme oxidizing to highly reducing. Hydrogen is stable either in the hydroxyl (H$_i^+$) or hydride (H$_{\rm O}^+$) structure but the substitutional H$_{\rm O}^+$ is energetically more favorable than H$_i^+$ only under highly reducing conditions. The interstitial H$_i^+$ is highly mobile in the bulk. Yttrium (Y) is energetically most favorable at the substitutional Ce site. Copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) can be incorporated at the substitutional site and/or an interstitial site, depending on actual conditions during preparation, and the dopants can exist in different charge and spin states. In light of the results, we discuss electronic and ionic conduction and the effects of metal doping on the formation of electron polarons and oxygen vacancies.

Title: Single-Particle Dispersion and Density of States of the Half-Filled 2D Hubbard Model
Authors: Gabe Schumm, Shiwei Zhang, Anders W. Sandvik
Abstract: Implementing an improved method for analytic continuation and working with imaginary-time correlation functions computed using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we resolve the single-particle dispersion relation and the density of states (DOS) of the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling. At intermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around the gap minimum at wave-vectors $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$ (the $\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi,0),(0,\pm \pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is quartic, leading to a sharp DOS maximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\Sigma$. The fraction of quasi-particle states within the ledge is $n_{\rm ledge} \approx 0.15$. Upon doping, within the rigid-band approximation, these results support Fermi pockets around the $\Sigma$ points, with states around the X points becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \ge n_{\rm ledge}$. The high density of states and the associated onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ scattering may be an important clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity in the cuprates.

Title: Valley and Spin Polarized States in Bernal Bilayer Graphene
Authors: R. David Mayrhofer, Andrey V. Chubukov
Abstract: We present the results for the evolution of the Fermi surfaces under variation of number density and displacement field for spin and valley-polarized states in Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG) using a realistic form of the electronic dispersion with trigonal warping terms. Earlier studies without trigonal warping have found discrete half-metal and quarter-metal states with full spin and/or valley polarization and complete depletion of some of the Fermi surfaces. We show that when trigonal warping terms are included in the dispersion, partially polarized states with large but non-complete polarization and with both majority and minority carriers present, emerge at small doping, as seen in the experimental data. We show the results when the intervalley and intravalley interactions are equal as well as when they are unequal.

Title: Self-bound monolayer crystals of ultracold polar molecules
Authors: Matteo Ciardi, Kasper Rønning Pedersen, Tim Langen, Thomas Pohl
Abstract: We investigate the physics of ultracold dipolar molecules using path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and construct the complete phase diagram extending from weak to strong interactions and from small to mesoscopic particle numbers. Our calculations predict the formation of self-bound quantum droplets at interaction strengths lower than previously anticipated. For stronger interactions, the droplet continuously loses superfluidity as correlations develop, and is eventually found to undergo a transition to a crystalline monolayer that remains self-bound without external confinement. The spontaneous formation of such two-dimensional phases from a three-dimensional quantum gas is traced back to the peculiar anisotropic form of the dipole-dipole interaction generated by microwave-dressing of rotational molecular states. For sufficiently large particle numbers, crystallization takes place for comparably low interaction strengths that do not promote two-body bound states and should thus be observable in ongoing experiments without limitations from three-body recombination.

Title: High Chern numbers and topological flat bands in high-field polarized Kitaev magnets on the star lattice
Authors: Zixuan Zou, Qiang Luo
Abstract: The geometrically frustrated Kitaev magnets are demonstrated to be fertile playgrounds that allow for the occurrence of exotic phenomena, including topological phases and the thermal Hall effect. Notwithstanding the established consensus that the field-polarized phase in the honeycomb-lattice Kitaev magnet hosts topological magnons exhibiting Chern numbers $C = \pm1$, the nature of magnon excitations in Kitaev magnets on the star lattice, a triangle-decorated honeycomb lattice, has rarely been explored primarily due to its complicated geometry. To this end, we study the band topology of magnons on the star lattice in the presence of a strong out-of-plane magnetic field using linear spin-wave theory. By calculating the Chern numbers of magnon bands, we find that topological phase diagrams are predominantly composed of two distinct topological phases whose Chern numbers are different by a sign in inverse order. Remarkably, each phase is characterized by a high Chern number of either $+2$ or $-2$. In addition, several topological flat bands with large flatness are identified. The two phases are separated by a dozen narrow topological high-Chern-number segments, whose region shrinks as the magnetic field increases and vanishes eventually. We also find that the thermal Hall conductivity approaches zero at certain parameters, and it changes (keeps) its sign when crossing the topological phase-transition points (flat-band points).

Title: Monitored Fluctuating Hydrodynamics
Authors: Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Ewan McCulloch, Romain Vasseur
Abstract: We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced ``sharpening'' phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known charge-sharpening transition for diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.

Title: Parity violation as enforced symmetry breaking in 3D fermionic topological order
Authors: Shang-Qiang Ning, Yang Qi, Chenjie Wang, Zheng-Cheng Gu
Abstract: Symmetry can be intrinsically broken in topological phases due to inherent incompatibilities, a phenomenon known as enforced symmetry breaking (ESB) in the framework of topological order. In our previous work, we developed a systematic framework to understand ESB within 2D invertible topological order. Meanwhile, the origin of parity violation in the Standard Model remains one of the most profound mysteries in physics, with no clear explanation to date. In this study, we explore the ESB of parity symmetry by three-dimensional fermionic topological order (fTO), offering potential insights into the origins of parity violation. As the simplest example, here we consider an fTO related to the intrinsic interacting fermionic SPT phase protected by $Z_2^f\times Z_2\times Z_8$ symmetry in three dimensions. We show that time-reversal symmetry (TRS) with ${T}^2=1$ on physical fermions is incompatible with such fTO; then, through the so-called crystalline equivalence principle, we show that the parity symmetry is also incompatible with it. In comparison, conventional TRS with ${T}^2={P}_f$ remains compatible to this fTO. We also discuss a general framework to study the ESB phenomenon for 3D fTO.

Title: Inequivalence of the low-density insulating state and quantum Hall insulating states in a strongly correlated two-dimensional electron system
Authors: M. Yu. Melnikov, D. G. Smirnov, A. A. Shashkin, S.-H. Huang, C. W. Liu, S. V. Kravchenko
Abstract: We find that the behaviors of the voltage-current characteristics as one enters the low-density insulating state and integer quantum Hall insulating states in the ultra-clean two-dimensional electron system in SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells are qualitatively different. The double-threshold voltage-current curves, representative of electron solid formation at low densities, are not observed in the quantum Hall regime, which does not confirm the existence of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid and indicates that quasi-particles near integer filling do not form an independent subsystem.

Title: Universal low-density power laws of the dc conductivity and Hall constant in the self-consistent Born approximation
Authors: Giacomo Morpurgo, Christophe Berthod, Thierry Giamarchi
Abstract: The dc conductivity tensor of two-dimensional one-band metals with weak pointlike disorder and magnetic field is studied in the self-consistent Born approximation, with special emphasis on the regime of low carrier density. In this theory, the Kubo conductivity is a functional of the electron dispersion and local (momentum-independent) electron self-energy, which is itself a causal functional of the dispersion and disorder strength. We obtain exact closed expressions for the asymptotic low-density conductivities at zero temperature in the form of power laws of the density and disorder strength with universal exponents. The crossover to the semiclassical regime of high density is studied numerically, as well as the temperature dependence. Our model and results may be relevant to interpret linear magneto-transport experiments performed in the metallic regime of gated two-dimensional semiconductors.

Title: Symmetry protected topological wire in a topological vacuum
Authors: Subrata Pachhal, Adhip Agarwala
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases host gapless modes at their boundary with a featureless environment of the same dimension or a trivial vacuum. In this study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment, which itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. In particular, we embed a one-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator, allowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the surrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a trivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced topology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the general framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in shaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their experimental exploration.

Title: Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice
Authors: Zhan Wang, Keyu Zeng, Ziqiang Wang
Abstract: Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. Here, we show that the LC order fundamentally changes the nature of the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In a single-orbital model on the kagome lattice near van Hove filling, the LC CDW is a Chern metal, realizable in concrete models, with a partially filled Chern band hosting three Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). We show that Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs is described by three SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings due to LC. The pairing instability is determined by the eigenvalues of the complex representation of the cubic group. We show that the Josephson phase is controlled by the discrete quantum geometry associated with the sublattice permutation group. A small LC can produce a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to a roton superconductor, where the internal phases of the three SC components are locked at 120^\circ and loop supercurrents circulate around an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. We demonstrate by self-consistent calculations the properties of the roton superconductor and make theoretical predictions related to the recent experimental evidence for an exotic SC state in CsV3Sb5 exhibiting TRS breaking, anisotropic SC gap, pair density wave modulations, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems such as the moire structures.

Title: Anomalous vortex Hall effect in a ferromagnet/superconductor heterostructure
Authors: Weideng Sun, Przemyslaw Swatek, Yihong Fan, Hwanhui Yun, Deyuan Lyu, K. Andre Mkhoyan, Jian-Ping Wang, Gang Qiu
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is a fascinating and complex phenomenon in condensed matter physics, as these two states are typically mutually exclusive due to their competing spin configurations. However, the interplay between these two orders through the proximity effect has been a subject of intense research as it opens up possibilities for novel technological applications. Here, we report the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in superconducting {\delta}-TaN/ferromagnetic CoFeB heterostructures grown by facing-target sputtering. Superconducting states are comprehensively investigated, with evidence of strong correlation between the superconducting and ferromagnetic order parameters. In particular, we observed an anomalous Hall signal without the presence of the magnetic field in the mixed state of the superconducting transition near the critical temperature. Systematic characterizations of the Hall resistance under varying temperatures and magnetic fields attribute this behavior to the vortex Hall effect (VHE), whereby superconducting vortices in the mixed state undergo transverse motions near the critical temperature. Unlike previously reported VHEs in conventional type-II superconductors, the anomalous VHE in TaN is induced by the stray field in the underlying CoFeB layers. The concurrency of strong spin-orbit coupling, the superconductivity in the TaN layer, and the highly spin-polarized ferromagnetic ordering in the CoFeB layer offers new insights into proximity-induced vortex dynamics and the design of novel superconducting spintronic devices.

Title: Learning dynamics on the picosecond timescale in a superconducting synapse structure
Authors: Ken Segall, Leon Nichols, Will Friend, Steven B. Kaplan
Abstract: Conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are running into limitations in terms of training time and energy. Following the principles of the human brain, spiking neural networks trained with unsupervised learning offer a faster, more energy-efficient alternative. However, the dynamics of spiking, learning, and forgetting become more complicated in such schemes. Here we study a superconducting electronics implementation of a learning synapse and experimentally measure its spiking dynamics. By pulsing the system with a superconducting neuron, we show that a superconducting inductor can dynamically hold the synaptic weight with updates due to learning and forgetting. Learning can be stopped by slowing down the arrival time of the post-synaptic pulse, in accordance with the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity paradigm. We find excellent agreement with circuit simulations, and by fitting the turn-on of the pulsing frequency, we confirm a learning time of 16.1 +/- 1 ps. The power dissipation in the learning part of the synapse is less than one attojoule per learning event. This leads to the possibility of an extremely fast and energy-efficient learning processor.

Abstract: Brushes formed by arm-tethered starlike polyelectrolytes may exhibit internal segregation into weakly and strongly extended populations (stratified two-layer structure) when strong ionic intermolecular repulsions induce stretching of the tethers up to the limit of their extensibility. We propose an approximate Poisson-Boltzmann theory for analysis of the structure of the stratified brush and compare it with results of numerical self-consistent field modelling. Both analytical and numerical models point to formation of a narrow cloud of counterions (internal double electrical layer) localized inside stratified brush at the boundary between the layers.

Title: Logarithmic entanglement lightcone from eigenstate correlations in the many-body localised phase
Authors: Ratul Thakur, Bikram Pain, Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: We investigate the operator entanglement of the time-evolution operator through the framework of eigenstate correlations. Focusing on strongly disordered quantum many-body systems in the many-body localised (MBL) regime, we analyse the operator entanglement across various spatiotemporal cuts, revealing the logarithmic lightcone of entanglement spreading. We demonstrate that this logarithmic lightcone arises directly from a hierarchy of energyscales and lengthscales encoded in eigenstate correlations. By characterising the statistics of these hierarchical scales, we develop a microscopic theory for the spatiotemporal structure of entanglement spreading in MBL systems -- without invoking phenomenological constructs such as $\ell$-bits. This approach reveals the fundamental connection between eigenstate correlations and the emergent entanglement structure in MBL systems.

Title: Observation of non-Hermitian dislocation bound states and dislocation skin effects
Authors: Jia-Xin Zhong, Bitan Roy, Yun Jing
Abstract: The confluence of Non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding edge dislocations in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. These NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states as the system arrives at the shore of fostering exceptional points in the Brillouin zone under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.

Title: Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay
Authors: Alexander C. Jenkins, Hiranya V. Peiris, Andrew Pontzen
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.

Title: Universal efficiency boost in prethermal quantum heat engines
Authors: Alberto Brollo, Adolfo del Campo, Alvise Bastianello
Abstract: Heat engines near the adiabatic limit typically assume a working medium at thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body systems often showcase conservation laws that hinder thermalization, leading to prethermalization in exotic stationary phases. This work explores whether prethermalization enhances or reduces engine efficiency. We investigate Otto cycles in quantum systems with varying numbers of conserved quantities. We find that additional conservation laws reduce efficiency at positive temperatures, but enhance it in regimes of negative temperatures. Our findings stem from general thermodynamic inequalities for infinitesimal cycles, and we provide evidence for integrable models undergoing finite cycles using the theoretical framework of Generalized Hydrodynamics. The relevance of our results for quantum simulators is also discussed.

Title: Braided Majorana qubits as a minimal setting for Topological Quantum Computation?
Authors: Francesco Toppan
Abstract: I point out that a possible minimal setting to realize Kitaev's proposal of a Topological Quantum Computation which offers topological protection from decoherence could in principle be realized by braided Majorana qubits. Majorana qubits and their braiding were introduced in Nucl. Phys. B 980, 115834 (2022) and further analyzed in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 435203 (2024). Braided Majorana qubits implement a Gentile-type parastatistics with at most $s-1$ excited states accommodated in a multiparticle sector (the integer $s=2,3,4,\ldots$ labels quantum group reps at roots of unity). It is argued that braided Majorana qubits could play, for topological quantum computers, the same role as standard bits for ordinary computers and as qubits for "ordinary" quantum computers.

Title: Quantum Gibbs states are locally Markovian
Authors: Chi-Fang Chen, Cambyse Rouzé
Abstract: The Markov property entails the conditional independence structure inherent in Gibbs distributions for general classical Hamiltonians, a feature that plays a crucial role in inference, mixing time analysis, and algorithm design. However, much less is known about quantum Gibbs states. In this work, we show that for any Hamiltonian with a bounded interaction degree, the quantum Gibbs state is locally Markov at arbitrary temperature, meaning there exists a quasi-local recovery map for every local region. Notably, this recovery map is obtained by applying a detailed-balanced Lindbladian with jumps acting on the region. Consequently, we prove that (i) the conditional mutual information (CMI) for a shielded small region decays exponentially with the shielding distance, and (ii) under the assumption of uniform clustering of correlations, Gibbs states of general non-commuting Hamiltonians on $D$-dimensional lattices can be prepared by a quantum circuit of depth $e^{O(\log^D(n/\epsilon))}$, which can be further reduced assuming certain local gap condition. Our proofs introduce a regularization scheme for imaginary-time-evolved operators at arbitrarily low temperatures and reveal a connection between the Dirichlet form, a dynamic quantity, and the commutator in the KMS inner product, a static quantity. We believe these tools pave the way for tackling further challenges in quantum thermodynamics and mixing times, particularly in low-temperature regimes.

Title: On the Clustering of Conditional Mutual Information via Dissipative Dynamics
Authors: Kohtaro Kato, Tomotaka Kuwahara
Abstract: Conditional mutual information (CMI) has recently attracted significant attention as a key quantity for characterizing quantum correlations in many-body systems. While it is conjectured that CMI decays rapidly in finite-temperature Gibbs states, a complete and general proof remains elusive. Previous work addressed this problem in the high-temperature regime using cluster expansion techniques [T. Kuwahara, K. Kato, F.G.S.L. Brandão, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 220601 (2020)]; however, flaws in the proof have been pointed out, and the method does not provide a uniformly convergent expansion at arbitrarily high temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate that the cluster expansion approach indeed fails to converge absolutely, even at any high-temperatures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach to proving the spatial decay of CMI. Our method leverages the connection between CMI and quantum recovery maps, specifically utilizing the Fawzi-Renner theorem. We show that such recovery maps can be realized through dissipative dynamics, and by analyzing the locality properties of these dynamics, we establish the exponential decay of CMI in high-temperature regimes. As a technical contribution, we also present a new result on the perturbative stability of quasi-local Liouvillian dynamics. Our results indicate that, contrary to common intuition, high-temperature Gibbs states can exhibit nontrivial mathematical structure, particularly when multipartite correlations such as CMI are considered.

Title: Super diffusive length dependent thermal conductivity in one-dimensional materials with structural defects: longitudinal to transverse phonon scattering leads to $κ\propto L^{1/3}$ law
Authors: Alexander L. Burin
Abstract: Structural defects in one-dimensional heat conductors couple longitudinal (stretching) and transverse (bending) vibrations. This coupling results in the scattering of longitudinal phonons to transverse phonons and backwards. We show that the decay rate of longitudinal phonons due to this scattering scales with their frequencies as $\omega^{3/2}$ within the long wavelength limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), which is more efficient scattering compared to the traditionally considered Rayleigh scattering within the longitudinal band ($\omega^2$). This scattering results in temperature independent thermal conductivity depending on the size as $\kappa \propto L^{1/3}$ for sufficiently long materials. This predicted length dependence is observed in nanowires, though the temperature dependence is seen there possibly because of deviations from pure one-dimensional behavior. The significant effect of interaction of longitudinal phonons with transverse phonons is consistent with the earlier observations of a substantial suppression of thermal energy transport by kinks, obviously leading to such interaction, though anharmonic interaction can also be significant.

Abstract: Quantum networking technologies use spin qubits and their interface to single photons as core components of a network node. This necessitates the ability to co-design the magnetic- and optical-dipole response of a quantum system. These properties are notoriously difficult to design in many solid-state systems, where spin-orbit coupling and the crystalline environment for each qubit create inhomogeneity of electronic g-factors and optically active states. Here, we show that GaAs quantum dots (QDs) obtained via the quasi-strain-free local droplet etching epitaxy growth method provide spin and optical properties predictable from assuming the highest possible QD symmetry. Our measurements of electron and hole g-tensors and of transition dipole moment orientations for charged excitons agree with our predictions from a multiband k.p simulation constrained only by a single atomic-force-microscopy reconstruction of QD morphology. This agreement is verified across multiple wavelength-specific growth runs at different facilities within the range of 730 nm to 790 nm for the exciton emission. Remarkably, our measurements and simulations track the in-plane electron g-factors through a zero-crossing from -0.1 to 0.3 and linear optical dipole moment orientations fully determined by an external magnetic field. The robustness of our results demonstrates the capability to design - prior to growth - the properties of a spin qubit and its tunable optical interface best adapted to a target magnetic and photonic environment with direct application for high-quality spin-photon entanglement.

Abstract: There exist several initiatives worldwide to deploy quantum key distribution (QKD) over existing fibre networks and achieve quantum-safe security at large scales. To understand the overall QKD network performance, it is required to transition from the analysis of individual links, as done so far, to the characterization of the network as a whole. In this work, we undertake this study by embedding QKD protocols on complex networks, which correctly model the existing fiber networks. We focus on networks with trusted nodes and on continuous-variable (CV) schemes, which have much higher key rates than their discrete-variable (DV) counterparts. In the effective CV network, however, many of the unique properties of complex networks, such as small-worldness and the presence of hubs, are lost due to the fast decay of the key rate with physical distance for CV systems. These properties can be restored when considering a hybrid network consisting of both CV and DV protocols, achieving at the same time high average rate and inter-connectivity. Our work opens the path to the study of QKD complex networks in existing infrastructures.

Title: Resistive switching characteristics of Cu/MgO/MoS2/Cu structure
Authors: He Xiaolong, Chen Peng
Abstract: During the study of resistive switching devices, researchers have found that the influence of the insertion layer cannot be ignored. Many reports have confirmed that the appropriate insertion layer can significantly improve the performance of the resistive switching devices. Therefore, in this work, we use magnetron sputtering to fabricate three devices: Cu/MgO/Cu, Cu/MgO/MoS2/Cu and Cu/MoS2/MgO/Cu. Through the characterization test of each device and the measurement of the I-V curve, it is found that the resistive switching characteristics of the Cu/MgO/Cu device will change greatly after adding an MoS2 insertion layer. The analysis results show that the inserted MoS2 layer does not change the main transmission mechanism (space charge limited conduction) of the device, but affects the regulating function of interfacial potential barrier, the effect also is related to the location of MoS2 inserted into the layer. Among the Cu/MgO/Cu, Cu/MgO/MoS2/Cu and Cu/MoS2/MgO/Cu devices, the Cu/MgO/MoS2/Cu device exhibits a larger switching ratio (about 103) and a lower reset voltage (about 0.21 V), which can be attributed to the regulation of the interface barrier between MgO and MoS2. In addition, when the MoS2 layer is inserted between the bottom electrodes Cu and MgO, the leakage current of the device is significantly reduced. Therefore, Cu/MoS2/MgO/Cu device has the highest commercial value from the point of view of practical applications. Finally, according to the XPS results and XRD results, we establish the conductive filament models for the three devices, and analyze the reasons for the different resistive switching characteristics of the three devices.

Title: Plasmonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains with strong coupling amplitudes
Authors: Benedikt Schurr, Matthias Hensen, Luisa Brenneis, Philipp Kessler, Jin Qin, Victor Lisinetskii, Ronny Thomale, Tobias Brixner, Bert Hecht
Abstract: Plasmonic many-particle systems with precisely tuned resonances and coupling strengths can exhibit emergent collective properties governed by universal principles. In one-dimensional chains with alternating couplings, known as Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) systems, this includes the formation of topologically protected mid-gap modes whose intensities localize at the chain's ends. This subwavelength localization at optical frequencies is crucial for achieving strong coupling of mid-gap modes to two-level systems under ambient conditions, extending topological protection to hybrid light-matter states. Here, we have fabricated SSH chains from plasmonic nanoslit resonators with strong inter-resonator coupling. The alternating distance between the nanoslit resonators is controlled with sub-nanometer precision, enabling accurate prediction and experimental observation of topologically protected mid-gap modes via photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). Our results open the path towards experimental realizations of two-dimensional photonic metasurfaces exhibiting higher-order topological modes that can be strongly coupled to single emitters and quantum materials at ambient conditions.

Title: Plasmon-interband hybridization and anomalous production of hot electrons in aluminum nanoantennas
Authors: Jérôme Martin, Oscar Avalos-Ovando, Thomas Simon, Gabriel Arditi, Florian Lamaze, Julien Proust, Luiz H.G. Tizei, Zhiming Wang, Mathieu Kociak, Alexander O. Govorov, Odile Stéphan, Davy Gérard
Abstract: Strong coupling typically occurs between two separate objects or between an object and its environment (such as an atom and a cavity). However, it can also occur between two different excitations within the same object, a situation that has been much less studied. In this study, we observe strong coupling between localized surface plasmon resonances and the interband transition in aluminum nanorods, as evidenced by optical spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, and corroborated with numerical simulations. Strong coupling is observed between the interband transition and multiple orders of the surface plasmon mode, including dark ones. We also obtain experimental maps of the hybrid modes at the nanoscale. In each case, the associated Rabi energy, which corresponds to the energy splitting between the two polaritonic branches, is obtained. Finally, a dedicated numerical model was employed to calculate the hot electron generation rate in the nanorods. The calculations demonstrate that efficient generation of hot electrons can be achieved in the near-infrared region, when the interband transition is strongly coupled with a plasmon resonance. This high generation rate stems from the hybrid nature of the mode, as its plasmonic component provides a high absorption cross-section, while the IT part ensures efficient conversion to hot electrons. Consequently, aluminum nanorods represent an efficient source of hot electrons in the visible and near-infrared regions, with potential applications in local photochemistry, photodetection, and solar energy harvesting.

Title: Learning quantum Gibbs states locally and efficiently
Authors: Chi-Fang Chen, Anurag Anshu, Quynh T. Nguyen
Abstract: Learning the Hamiltonian underlying a quantum many-body system in thermal equilibrium is a fundamental task in quantum learning theory and experimental sciences. To learn the Gibbs state of local Hamiltonians at any inverse temperature $\beta$, the state-of-the-art provable algorithms fall short of the optimal sample and computational complexity, in sharp contrast with the locality and simplicity in the classical cases. In this work, we present a learning algorithm that learns each local term of a $n$-qubit $D$-dimensional Hamiltonian to an additive error $\epsilon$ with sample complexity $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{e^{\mathrm{poly}(\beta)}}{\beta^2\epsilon^2}\right)\log(n)$. The protocol uses parallelizable local quantum measurements that act within bounded regions of the lattice and near-linear-time classical post-processing. Thus, our complexity is near optimal with respect to $n,\epsilon$ and is polynomially tight with respect to $\beta$. We also give a learning algorithm for Hamiltonians with bounded interaction degree with sample and time complexities of similar scaling on $n$ but worse on $\beta, \epsilon$. At the heart of our algorithm is the interplay between locality, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition, and the operator Fourier transform at arbitrary temperatures.

Authors: Mathias Peirlinck, Kevin Linka, Ellen Kuhl
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach for characterizing the mechanical behavior of atrial tissue using constitutive neural networks. Based on experimental biaxial tensile test data of healthy human atria, we automatically discover the most appropriate constitutive material model, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional, pre-defined models. This approach offers a new perspective on modeling atrial mechanics and is a significant step towards improved simulation and prediction of cardiac health.

Title: The odd-even effect of mosaic modulation period of quasi-periodic hopping on the Anderson localization in a one-dimensional lattice model
Authors: Yi-Cai Zhang, Rong Yuan, Shuwei Song, Mingpeng Hu, Chaofei Liu, Yongjian Wang
Abstract: In this study, we investigate Anderson localization in a one-dimensional lattice with a mosaic off-diagonal quasiperiodic hopping. Our findings reveal that the localization behavior of zero-energy states is highly dependent on the parity of the mosaic modulation period, denoted as $\kappa$. Specifically, when $\kappa$ is an odd integer, there is no Anderson localization transition even for large quasiperiodic hopping strengths, and the zero-energy state remains in a critical state. On the other hand, for an even $\kappa$ and a generic quasiperiodic hopping, the zero-energy state becomes a localized edge state at either the left or right end of the system. Additionally, we observe that the geometric mean value of the energy spectrum is equal to the constant hopping for an even $\kappa$, while for an odd $\kappa$, it is equal to the geometric mean value of the hopping. This odd-even effect of the mosaic period also extends to other eigenstates near zero energy. More specifically, for an odd $\kappa$, there exists an energy window in which the eigenstates remain critical even for strong quasiperiodic hopping. In contrast, for an even $\kappa$, an Anderson localization transition occurs as the hopping strength increases. Furthermore, we are able to accurately determine the Lyapunov exponent $\gamma(E)$ and the mobility edges $E_c$. By analyzing the Lyapunov exponent, we identify critical regions in the hopping-energy parameter planes. Additionally, as the energy approaches the mobility edges, we observe a critical index of localization length of $\nu=1$. Finally, we demonstrate that different systems can be characterized by their Lyapunov exponent $\gamma(E)$ and Avila's acceleration $\omega(E)$.

Title: Rényi entropies for one-dimensional quantum systems with mixed boundary conditions
Authors: Benoit Estienne, Yacine Ikhlef, Andrei Rotaru
Abstract: We present a general method for calculating Rényi entropies in the ground state of a one-dimensional critical system with mixed open boundaries, for an interval starting at one of its ends. In the conformal field theory framework, this computation boils down to the evaluation of the correlation function of one twist field and two boundary condition changing operators in the cyclic orbifold. Exploiting null-vectors of the cyclic orbifold, we derive ordinary differential equations satisfied by these correlation functions. In particular, we obtain an explicit expression for the second Rényi entropy valid for any diagonal minimal model, but with a particular set of mixed boundary conditions. In order to compare our results with numerical data for the Ising and three-state Potts critical chains, we also identify and compute the leading finite size corrections.

Title: Quantum many-body thermal machines enabled by atom-atom correlations
Authors: R. S. Watson, K. V. Kheruntsyan
Abstract: Particle-particle correlations, characterized by Glauber's second-order correlation function,play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.

Title: Emergence of Diffusional Hydrogen Escape in High-$T_c$ Superconducting Calcium Superhydride at Megabar Pressures
Authors: Xixi Jia, Haoran Chen, Xiaoqiu Ye, Jian Lv, Xitian Zhang, Hui Wang, Yansun Yao
Abstract: High-pressure metal superhydrides have attracted intense scientific interest due to their remarkable superconducting properties. While superconductivity is known to be sensitive to material composition, compositional variability is often overlooked in metal superhydrides at megabar pressures. Using ab initio path-integral simulations, we find that up to 7 % of the hydrogen atoms escape from the 215-kelvin superconducting CaH$_6$ upon decompression from 165 to 123 GPa. This loss of hydrogen leads to an elastic instability at low pressures, an "abnormal" positive pressure dependence of the superconducting $T_c$ and a quantum phase transition from a mixed superconducting-diffusive state to a pure superconducting phase. In this mixed phase, proton diffusivity reaches $10^{-8}$ $\mathrm{cm^2/s}$ at low temperatures and promotes to $10^{-7}$ $\mathrm{cm^2/s}$ at room temperature, which elucidates the escape of hydrogen at megabar pressures. Our results are consistent with many "anomalous" experimental observations and highlight the significance of composition effects in high-$T_c$ metal superhydrides.

Title: Minimal cyclic behavior in sheared amorphous solids
Authors: Chloe W. Lindeman, Sidney R. Nagel
Abstract: Although jammed packings of soft spheres exist in potential energy landscapes with a vast number of minima, when subjected to cyclic shear they may revisit the same configurations repeatedly. Simple hysteretic spin models, in which particle rearrangements are represented by interacting spin flips called hysterons, capture many features of this periodic behavior. Yet it has been unclear to what extent individual rearrangements can be described by such binary objects and how such objects interact with one another. Using a particularly sensitive algorithm, we identify rearrangements in simulated jammed packings and select pairs of rearrangements that undo one another to create periodic cyclic behavior. We find that the rearrangement pairs surprisingly persist down to the smallest increments in strain, even in the smallest systems we can study. We explore the statistics of these rearrangement pairs and find that there is a relation between the amount of hysteresis and the energy drop and mean-square displacement of the particles; these results are inconsistent with the scaling found in models that treat rearrangements as localized buckling events. Finally, our analysis shows that there is no clean distinction between the "core" of an individual rearrangement and the interactions between rearrangements. These results offer insight into how complex systems such as amorphous solids can reach a limit cycle.

Title: Skyrmion on magnetic tunnel junction: weaving quantum transport with micro-magnetism
Authors: Aashish Chahal, Abhishek Sharma
Abstract: Over the last two decades, non-trivial magnetic textures, especially the magnetic skyrmion family, have been extensively explored out of fundamental interest and for diverse possible applications. Given the possible technological and scientific ramifications of skyrmion-texture on magnetic tunnel junctions (Sk-MTJs), in this work, we present a non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) based description of Sk-MTJs for both Néel and Bloch textures to capture the spin/charge current across different voltages, temperatures, and sizes. We predict the emergence of a textured spin current from the uniform layer of the Sk-MTJs, along with a radially varying, asymmetric voltage dependence of spin torque. We discuss the identification of Néel-type and Bloch-type skyrmions, including their helicity, based on local measurements of the spin current. We describe the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) roll-off in Sk-MTJs with lower cross-sectional areas and higher temperatures based on transmission spectra analysis. Additionally, considering the significant implications of MTJ scaling, we uncover the scaling effects in all skyrmion(AS)-MTJs, where both contacts host skyrmions. We demonstrate the impact of scaling on TMR, spin, and charge currents, providing a pathway for the Sk/AS-MTJs design optimization with miniaturization. We also introduce a computationally efficient, analytically grounded coupled spatio-eigen framework of NEGF, alleviating the sine qua non of the 3D-NEGF for systems that lack translational invariance in the transverse direction, such as Sk/AS-MTJs.

Title: Collapse of a quantum vortex in an attractive two-dimensional Bose gas
Authors: Sambit Banerjee, Kai Zhou, Shiva Kant Tiwari, Hikaru Tamura, Rongjie Li, Panayotis Kevrekidis, Simeon I. Mistakidis, Valentin Walther, Chen-Lung Hung
Abstract: We experimentally and numerically study the collapse dynamics of a quantum vortex in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid following a fast interaction ramp from repulsion to attraction. We find the conditions and time scales for a superfluid vortex to radially converge into a quasi-stationary density profile, demonstrating the spontaneous formation of a vortex soliton-like structure in an atomic Bose gas. We record an emergent self-similar dynamics caused by an azimuthal modulational instability, which amplifies initial density perturbations and leads to the eventual splitting of a solitonic ring profile or direct fragmentation of a superfluid into disordered, but roughly circular arrays of Townes soliton-like wavepackets. These dynamics are qualitatively reproduced by simulations based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. However, a discrepancy in the magnitude of amplified density fluctuations predicted by our mean-field analysis suggests the presence of effects beyond the mean-field approximation. Our study sets the stage for exploring out-of-equilibrium dynamics of vortex quantum matter quenched to attractive interactions and their universal characteristics.

Title: The Interplay Between Forces, Particle Rearrangements, and Macroscopic Stress Fluctuations in Sheared 2D Granular Media
Authors: Kwangmin Lee, Ryan C. Hurley
Abstract: Recent studies have established correlations between non-affine motion and macroscopic stress fluctuations in sheared granular media. However, a comprehensive examination of the relationship between non-affine motion, macroscopic stress fluctuations, and inter-particle forces remains lacking. We investigated this interplay in simulations of 2D granular media during stick-slip events under plane shear. We found that particles exhibiting the greatest non-affine motion, as quantified by D2min, first coalesce into a single connected cluster during slip events. This cluster coincides with the region experiencing the greatest instantaneous reduction of inter-particle forces, indicating a significant correlation between inter-particle force fluctuations and particle rearrangements. Furthermore, the magnitude of the greatest non-affine motion within this cluster correlates strongly with the magnitude of macroscopic stress fluctuations during slip events. This correlation increased when the non-affine motion of particles in a neighborhood around the point of greatest non-affine motion were included in the analysis, suggesting that plastic events are best understood as regional rather than point-like occurrences. Our results held for various inter-particle friction coefficients. Our findings suggest that elastoplastic models should consider plastic events as regional rather than point-like and highlight the importance of studying the propagation of particle rearrangements.

Title: Magnetic and nematic order of Bose-Fermi mixtures in moiré superlattices of 2D semiconductors
Authors: Feng-Ren Fan, Tixuan Tan, Chengxin Xiao, Wang Yao
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic orders in a mixture of Boson (exciton) and Fermion (electron or hole) trapped in transition-metal dichalcogenides moiré superlattices. A sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interaction is found between a carrier and an interlayer exciton trapped at different high symmetry points of the moiré supercell. This interaction at a distance much shorter than the carrier-carrier separation dominates the magnetic order in the Bose-Fermi mixture, where the carrier sublattice develops ferromagnetism opposite to that in the exciton sublattice. We demonstrate the possibility of increasing the Curie temperature of moiré carriers through electrical tuning of the exciton density in the ground state. In a trilayer moiré system with a p-n-p type band alignment, the exciton-carrier interplay can establish a layered antiferromagnetism for holes confined in the two outer layers. We further reveal a spontaneous nematic order in the Bose-Fermi mixture, arising from the interference between the Coulomb interaction and p-wave interlayer tunneling dictated by the stacking registry.

Title: A general and modular approach to solid-state integration and readout of zero-dimensional quantum systems

Abstract: Here, we present an all-electrical readout mechanism for quasi-0D quantum states (0D-QS) such as point defects, adatoms and molecules, that is modular and general, providing an approach that is amenable to scaling and integration with other solid-state quantum technologies. Our approach relies on the crea-tion of high-quality tunnel junctions via the mechanical exfoliation and stacking of multi-layer gra-phene (MLG) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to encapsulate the target system in an MLG/hBN/0D-QS/hBN/MLG heterostructure. This structure allows for all-electronic spectroscopy and readout of candidate systems through a combination of coulomb and spin-blockade. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate electronic tunneling spectroscopy of point defects in hBN and the molecular qubit vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc). Our approach demonstrates a new pathway for the incorporation of molecules and atomic defects into solid-state quantum devices and circuits along with a readout scheme that does not rely on highly-constrained optical processes for photonic readout.

Title: Low-energy interband Kondo bound states in orbital-selective Mott phases
Authors: Jia-Ming Wang, Yin Chen, Yi-Heng Tian, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: Low-energy excitations in correlated electron systems may show intricate behaviors and provide essential insights into the dynamics of quantum states and phase transitions. Here, we study a typical half-filled two-orbital Hubbard model featuring the so-called holon-doublon (HD) low-energy excitations in the orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP), where the principal form of the low-energy excitations has been considered to be a HD bound state. We employ standard single-site dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), using NORG as an improved impurity solver to calculate the spectral functions at zero temperature. We show that the HD bound state gives an incomplete or even wrong picture for the low-energy excitations. Instead, the excitations are composed of a Kondo-like state in the wide band and a doublon in the narrow band, termed as inter-band Kondo-like (IBK) bound states. Remarkably, we find that, as the bandwidths of the two bands approach each other, anomalous IBK bound-state excitations appear in the metallic {\em wide} band. Our study provides a new picture for the low-energy excitations in the OSMP.

Title: Structurally triggered orbital and charge orderings in TlMnO$_3$ and related compounds
Authors: Subhadeep Bandyopadhyay, Philippe Ghosez
Abstract: Rare earth perovskites ($R^{3+}$M$^{3+}$O$_3$), with $e_g^1$ electronic occupation of the M $d$ states, display different types of metal-insulator transition. For manganites (M=Mn), metal-insulator transition is usually induced by the Jahn-Teller ($JT$) distortions, which stabilize orbital orderings (OO) at Mn sites. Among them, LaMnO$_3$ shows a $C$ type OO and crystallizes with $Pbnm$ structure. Whereas, TlMnO$_3$ shows a very distinct $G$ type OO with an unusual $P\overline{1}$ structure. Employing first principles calculations, and symmetry mode analysis we rationalize structural and electronic origin of $G$-type OO in TlMnO$_3$. Going further, we consider nickelates (M=Ni), where metal-insulator transition is driven by a breathing distortion, which stabilizes the charge ordering (CO) at Ni sites. Interestingly, different $JT$ and breathing distortions are very similar MO$_6$ octahedral distortions and stem from high frequency phonon modes of ideal $Pm\overline3m$ structure. Our comparative study reveals that following a common triggering mechanism these modes appear in their respective ground states.

Title: Interaction of Spinons with Magnetic Fields in a Fractionalized State
Authors: Yu Zhang, Hengdi Zhao, Tristan R. Cao, Rahul Nandkishore, Pedro Schlottmann, Lance Delong, Gang Cao
Abstract: The 4d-electron trimer lattice Ba4Nb1-xRu3+xO12 is believed to feature a universal heavy spinon Fermi surface that underpins both a quantum spin liquid (QSL) and an adjacent heavy-fermion strange metal (HFSM) phase, depending on Nb content. The itinerant spinons act as heat carriers that render the charge-insulating QSL a much better thermal conductor than the HFSM [1]. We find that application of magnetic field up to 14 T surprisingly induces an abrupt rise in the heat capacity by as much as 5000%, which breaks the signature linear temperature dependence of the heat capacity of both phases below 150 mK. In contrast, the AC magnetic susceptibility and the electrical resistivity show little response up to 14 T over the same milli-Kelvin temperature range. Applied magnetic field also readily suppresses the thermal conductivity by up to 40% with decreasing temperature below 4 K. All these complex thermal phenomena reveal that application of magnetic field drastically alters the behavior of spinons at low temperatures. The astonishing rise in the heat capacity (and thus entropy) at milli-Kelvin temperatures and strong magnetic fields presents a highly unusual situation that demands novel physics.

Title: Localized tension-induced giant folding in unstructured elastic sheets
Authors: Kexin Guo, Marc Suñé, Kwok Ming Li, K. Jimmy Hsia, Mingchao Liu, Dominic Vella
Abstract: Buckling in compression is the archetype of elastic instability: when compressed along its longest dimension, a thin structure such as a playing card will buckle out-of-plane accommodating the imposed compression without a significant change of length. However, recent studies have demonstrated that tension applied to sheets with microscopic structure leads to out-of-plane deformation in applications from `groovy metasheets' for multi-stable morphing to kirigami grippers. Here, we demonstrate that this counter-intuitive behavior -- a large transverse folding induced by a relatively small imposed longitudinal tension -- occurs also in unstructured sheets of isotropic material. The key to this behavior is that a localized uniaxial tension induces giant folding; we refer to this as `localized TUG folding' to reflect the importance of localized tension and its mode of actuation. We show that localized TUG folding occurs because of an efficient transfer of applied tensile load into compression -- a geometric consequence of a localized applied tension. We determine scaling results for the folding angle as a function of applied strain in agreement with both experiments and simulations. The generic nature of localized TUG folding suggests that it might be utilized in a broader range of materials and structures than previously realized.

Title: A numerical study of the localization transition of Aubry-André type models
Authors: Balázs Hetényi, István Balogh
Abstract: We use tools based on the modern theory of polarization for a numerical study of the localization transition of the Aubry-André model. In this model the spatial modulation of the potential, $\alpha$, is an irrational number, which we approximate as the ratio of Fibonacci numbers, $F_{n+1}/F_n$, where $F_n=L$ is also the system size. We calculate the phase diagram as a function of particle density (filling) and potential strength $W$. We calculate the geometric Binder cumulant and also apply a renormalization approach. At any given finite system size we find that at many densities the transition occurs at or near $W=2t$ ($t$ denotes the hopping). This is where single particle states are known to localize. However, we also find "spikes", densites at which the transition occurs in the range $0<W<2t$. These spikes occur for densities at which there are no partially filled bands. As the system size (and both $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$ in $\alpha$) is increased the spikes tend towards zero, but the density at which they occur also changes slightly: they approach irrational numbers which can be written as Fibonacci ratios or sums thereof. For densities which are fixed ratios for all system sizes, the transition occurs at $W=2t$. We also study an extension of the original Aubry-André model with second nearest neighbor hoppings. This model also exhibits a distorted phase diagram compared to the original one, with spikes which do not necessarily tend to zero, but to finite values of $W$, determined by the modifed gap structure.

Title: Ergodicity shapes inference in biological reactions driven by a latent trajectory
Authors: Benjamin Garcia de Figueiredo, Justin M. Calabrese, William F. Fagan, Ricardo Martinez-Garcia
Abstract: Many natural phenomena are quantified by counts of observable events, from the annihilation of quasiparticles in a lattice to predator-prey encounters on a landscape to spikes in a neural network. These events are triggered at random intervals, when an underlying, often unobserved and therefore latent, dynamical system occupies a set of reactive states within its phase space. We show how the ergodicity of this latent dynamical system, i.e. existence of a well-behaved limiting stationary distribution, constrains the statistics of the reaction counts. This formulation makes explicit the conditions under which the counting process approaches a limiting Poisson process, a subject of debate in the application of counting processes to different fields. We show that the overdispersal relative to this limit encodes properties of the latent trajectory through its hitting times. These results set bounds on how information about a latent process can be inferred from a local detector, which we explore for two biophysical scenarios. First, in estimating an animal's activity level by how often it crosses a detector, we show how the mean count can fail to give any information on movement parameters, which are encoded in higher order moments. Second, we show how the variance of the inter-reaction time sets a fundamental limit on how precisely the size of a population of trajectories can be inferred by a detector, vastly generalizing the Berg-Purcell limit for chemosensation. Overall, we develop a flexible theoretical framework to quantify inter-event time distributions in reaction-diffusion systems that clarifies existing debates in the literature and explicitly shows which properties of latent processes can be inferred from observed reactions.

Title: Machine-learning Guided Search for Phonon-mediated Superconductivity in Boron and Carbon Compounds
Authors: Niraj K. Nepal, Lin-Lin Wang
Abstract: We present a workflow that iteratively combines \textit{ab-initio} calculations with a machine-learning (ML) guided search for superconducting compounds with both dynamical stability and instability from imaginary phonon modes, the latter of which have been largely overlooked in previous studies. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) properties and critical temperature (T$_c$) of 417 boron, carbon, and borocarbide compounds have been calculated with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and isotropic Eliashberg approximation. Our study addresses T$_c$ convergence of Brillouin zone sampling with an ansatz test, stabilizing imaginary phonon modes for significant EPC contributions and comparing performance of two ML models especially when including compounds of dynamical instability. We predict a few promising superconducting compounds with formation energy just above the ground state convex hull, such as Ca$_5$B$_3$N$_6$ (35 K), TaNbC$_2$ (28.4 K), Nb$_3$B$_3$C (16.4 K), Y$_2$B$_3$C$_2$ (4.0 K), Pd$_3$CaB (7.0 K), MoRuB$_2$ (15.6 K), RuVB$_2$ (15.0 K), RuSc$_3$C$_4$ (6.6 K) among others.

Title: Near room-temperature ferromagnetism from double-exchange in the van der Waals material CrGeTe$_3$: evidence from optical conductivity under pressure
Authors: Jihaan Ebad-Allah, Daniel Guterding, Meera Varma, Mangesh Diware, Shraddha Ganorkar, Harald O. Jeschke, Christine A. Kuntscher
Abstract: The unexpected discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in layered van der Waals materials has sparked interest in both their fundamental properties and their potential for novel applications. Recent studies suggest near room-temperature ferromagnetism in the pressurized van der Waals crystal CrGeTe$_3$. We perform a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of magnetism and electronic correlations in CrGeTe$_3$, combining broad-frequency reflectivity measurements with density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. Our experimental optical conductivity spectra trace the signatures of developing ferromagnetic order and of the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) as a function of temperature and hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, we observe the emergence of a mid-infrared feature in the optical conductivity, indicating the development of strong orbital-selective correlations in the high-pressure ferromagnetic phase. We find a distinct relationship between the plasma frequency and Curie temperature of CrGeTe$_3$, which strongly suggests that a double-exchange mechanism is responsible for the observed near room-temperature ferromagnetism. Our results clearly demonstrate the existence of a charge-transfer gap in the metallic phase, ruling out its previously conjectured collapse under pressure.

Title: Entropy alternatives for equilibrium and out of equilibrium systems
Authors: Eugenio E. Vogel, Francisco J. Peña, G. Saravia, P. Vargas
Abstract: We introduce a novel entropy-related function, \textit{non-repeatability}, designed to capture dynamical behaviors in complex systems. Its normalized form, \textit{mutability}, has been previously applied in statistical physics as a dynamical entropy measure. To present the scope and advantages of these quantities, we analyze two distinct systems: (a) Monte Carlo simulations of magnetic moments on a square lattice and (b) seismic time series from the United States Geological Survey catalog. Both systems are well-established in the literature, serving as robust benchmarks. Shannon entropy is employed as a reference point to assess the similarities and differences with the proposed measures. A key distinction lies in the sensitivity of non-repeatability and mutability to the temporal ordering of data, which contrasts with traditional entropy definitions. Moreover, \textit{sorted mutability} -- the mutability computed from a reordered data version -- reveals additional insights into the critical behavior of the systems under study.

Title: Structural and Magnetic Properties of Co-rich bct CoMn Films
Authors: S. F. Peterson, Y. U. Idzerda
Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths.

Title: Topological Majorana zero modes and the superconducting diode effect driven by Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing in a helical Shiba chain
Authors: Sayak Bhowmik, Arijit Saha
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture deposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which also supports topological MZMs at the ends of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to superconducting diode effect in our system where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the presence of finite Cooper pair momentum of the FFLO ground state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the superconducting diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.

Title: Coulomb Drag in Altermagnets
Authors: Hao-Jie Lin, Song-Bo Zhang, Hai-Zhou Lu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: An altermagnet is a newly discovered antiferromagnet, characterized by unique anisotropic spin-split energy bands. It has attracted tremendous interest, because of its promising potential in information storage and processing. However, measuring the distinctive spin-split energy bands arising from altermagnetism remains a challenge. Here, we propose to employ the Coulomb drag to probe altermagnetism. In the Coulomb drag, an electric current in an active layer of electron gases can induce currents in a close but well-isolated passive layer, due to interlayer Coulomb interactions. We find that the Coulomb drag effects in altermagnets are highly sensitive to the orientation of the spin-split Fermi surfaces. As a result, transverse currents can be dragged in the passive layer, leading to Hall drag effects even in absence of spin-orbit coupling, a feature quite different from all previous systems. More importantly, all the drag effects of altermagnets have unique angle dependence, which can be measured in a multi-terminal setup to serve as signatures for altermagnetism. This proposal will inspire increasing explorations on emergent magnetism.

Title: Surface-dependent Majorana vortex phases in topological crystalline insulators
Authors: Xun-Jiang Luo, Xiao-Hong Pan, Yilin Shi, Fengcheng Wu
Abstract: The topological crystalline insulator SnTe exhibits two types of surface Dirac cones: one located at non-time-reversal-invariant momenta on the (001) and (110) surfaces, and the other at time-reversal-invariant momenta on the (111) surface. Motivated by the recent experimental evidence of Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) and their hybridization on the (001) surface [Nature 633, 71 (2024)], we present a comprehensive investigation of Majorana vortex phases in SnTe, including topological classification, surface-state Hamiltonians analysis, and lattice model calculations. By utilizing rotational and magnetic mirror symmetries, we present two equivalent methods to reveal the topology of Majorana phases on different surfaces. We find that the MVEMs on the (001) and (110) surfaces are protected by both magnetic group and rotational symmetries. In contrast, the MVEMs on the (111) surface are protected by magnetic group or particle-hole symmetry. Due to the different properties of Dirac fermions in the $\bar{\Gamma}$ and $\bar{M}$ valleys on the (111) surfaces, including Fermi velocities and energy levels, we find that abundant vortex phase transitions can occur for the [111]-direction vortex. As the chemical potential increases, the number of robust MVEMs can change from $0\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 2$. These vortex transitions are characterized by both $Z$ winding number and $Z_2$ pfaffian topological invariants.

Title: Learning by Confusion: The Phase Diagram of the Holstein Model
Authors: George Issa, Owen Bradley, Ehsan Khatami, Richard Scalettar
Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.

Title: Non-renormalization of the fractional quantum Hall conductivity by interactions
Authors: M. Selch, M.A.Zubkov, Souvik Pramanik, M.Lewkowicz
Abstract: We investigate the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) proposed a long time ago by Lopez and Fradkin \cite{Fradkin1991chern} to describe the principal Jain series. The magnetic fluxes of the statistical gauge field attached to electrons remain at rest in the reference frame moving together with the electron liquid. In the laboratory reference frame the electric field of the statistical gauge field forms and screens the external electric field. The fractional QHE conductivity appears as a consequence of this screening already on the mean field theory level. We consider a relativistic extension of the model, and propose an alternative description of the fractional QHE based on macroscopic motion of the electron liquid within the Zubarev statistical operator approach. It is this macroscopic motion of electrons which in this pattern gives rise to the fractional QHE. Within this approach we propose the proof to all orders of perturbation theory that the interaction corrections cannot change the above mentioned mean field theory result for the QHE conductivity.

Title: Phonon spectra, quantum geometry, and the Goldstone theorem
Authors: Guglielmo Pellitteri, Zenan Dai, Haoyu Hu, Yi Jiang, Guido Menichetti, Andrea Tomadin, B. Andrei Bernevig, Marco Polini
Abstract: Phonons are essential quasi-particles of all crystals and play a key role in fundamental properties such as thermal transport and superconductivity. In particular, acoustic phonons can be interpreted as Goldstone modes that emerge due to the spontaneous breaking of translational this http URL this article, we investigate the quantum geometric contribution to the phonon spectrum in the absence of Holstein phonons. Using graphene as a case study, we decompose the dynamical matrix into distinct terms that exhibit different dependencies on the electron energy and wavefunction. We then examine the role of quantum geometry in shaping the material's phonon spectrum.

Title: Enhanced collective vibrations in granular materials
Authors: Shihori Koyama, Norihiro Oyama, Hideyuki Mizuno, Atsushi Ikeda
Abstract: Granular materials are defined as collections of macroscopic dissipative particles. Although these systems are ubiquitous in our lives, the nature and the causes of their non-trivial collective dynamics still remain elusive and have attracted significant interest in non-equilibrium physics. Here, we focus on the vibrational dynamics of granular materials. While the vibrational dynamics of random packings have been examined concerning the jamming transition, previous research has overlooked the role of contact dissipations. We conducted numerical and analytical investigations into the vibrational dynamics of random packings influenced by the normal dissipative force, which is the simplest model for contact dissipations. Our findings reveal that the kinetic energy per mode diverges in the low-frequency range, following the scaling law $\mathcal{K}_l \propto \omega^{-2}_l$ with the frequency $\omega_l$, indicating that low-frequency modes experience strong excitation and that the equipartition of energy is violated. Additionally, the spatial structure factor of the velocity field displays the scaling law $S_v(q) \propto q^{-2}$ with the wavenumber $q$, which signifies that the velocity field has an infinitely long range. We demonstrate that these phenomena arise from the effects of weaker damping on softer modes, where the particle displacements parallel to the contacts are minimal in the low-frequency modes, rendering normal dissipation ineffective at dampening these modes.

Title: Effective medium theory for the electrical conductivity of random metallic nanowire networks
Authors: Yuri Yu. Tarasevich, Irina V. Vodolazskaya, Andrei V. Eserkepov
Abstract: Interest in studying the conductive properties of networks made from randomly distributed nanowires is due to their numerous technological applications. Although the sheet resistance of such networks can be calculated directly, the calculations require many characteristics of the system (distributions of lengths, diameters and resistances of nanowires, distribution of junction resistance), the measurement of which is difficult. Furthermore, such calculations can hardly offer an analytical dependence of the sheet resistance on the basic physical parameters of the systems under consideration. Although various theoretical approaches offer such analytical dependencies, they are often based on more or less reasonable assumptions rather than rigorously proven statements. Here, we offer an approach based on Foster's theorem to reveal a dependence of the sheet resistance of dense nanowire networks on the main parameters of such networks. This theorem offers an additional perspective on the effective medium theory and extends our insight. Since the application of Foster's theorem is particularly effective for regular random resistor networks, we propose a method for regularizing resistor networks corresponding to random nanowire networks. We found an analytical dependence of the effective electrical conductivity on the main parameters of the nanowire network (reduced number density of nanowires, nanowire resistance, and resistance of contacts between nanowires).

Title: Enhancing Electrical Properties of Selectively Grown In-Plane InAs Nanowires using InGaAs Buffer and Capping Layers
Authors: Pradip Adhikari, Anjali Rathore, Dayrl P Briggs, Srijanto R Bernadeta, Joon Sue Lee
Abstract: In-plane semiconductor nanowires with complex branched geometries, prepared via selective area growth (SAG), offer a versatile platform for advanced electronics, optoelectronics, and quantum devices. However, defects and disorder at the interfaces and top surfaces of the nanowires can significantly degrade their electrical properties. One effective method to mitigate these issues is the incorporation of buffer and capping layers. In this work, we achieved a wider growth selectivity window of InGaAs in the presence of atomic hydrogen (H) and employed it as buffer and capping layers for SAG InAs nanowires to enhance their electrical properties. Hall measurements on InAs nanowires, with and without InGaAs buffer and/or capping layers, revealed that incorporating closely lattice-matched InGaAs buffer and capping layers to InAs nanowires nearly tripled the electron mobility and doubled the phase coherence length compared to nanowires without these layers. These findings demonstrate that the use of InGaAs buffer and capping layers is a crucial strategy for significantly enhancing the quality of InAs nanowires, unlocking their full potential for high performance electronics and quantum devices.

Title: From Champagne to Confined Polymer:Natural and Artificial Bubble Nucleation
Authors: Carlos Arauz-Moreno, Keyvan Piroird, Elise Lorenceau
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel experimental work on bubble nucleation and growth using a model system comprised by viscoelastic polyvinyl butyral (PVB) confined in a Hele-Shaw cell geometry that is decompressed at elevated temperatures. The driver is connected to the temperature-induced shift in chemical equilibrium experienced simultaneously by two gases present in the bulk. The latter becomes at the same time oversaturated with water vapor and slightly undersaturated in air. Our bubbles grow with various shapes and sizes depending on the initial morphology of the nucleus or the presence of neighboring bubbles. The likelihood of nucleation is related to the amount of water dissolved in the bulk and the imposed temperature. Counter-intuitively, the number of nuclei whence a bubble can grow is inversely correlated with said temperature. In an analogy with Champagne, we show that nucleation can either be natural, at trapped fibers or dust particles, or artificial, at crenels we purposefully made in the glass surface. Our results indicate that the growth rate of bubbles can be impacted by the nucleation mechanism.

Title: Diffusive hydrodynamics of hard rods from microscopics
Authors: Friedrich Hübner, Leonardo Biagetti, Jacopo De Nardis, Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: We derive exact equations governing the large-scale dynamics of hard rods, including diffusive effects that go beyond ballistic transport. Diffusive corrections are the first-order terms in the hydrodynamic gradient expansion and we obtain them through an explicit microscopic calculation of the dynamics of hard rods. We show that they differ significantly from the prediction of Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics, as the correct hydrodynamics description is instead given by two coupled equations, giving respectively the evolution of the one point functions and of the connected two-point correlations. The resulting equations are time-reversible and reduce to the usual Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations in the limit of near-equilibrium evolution. This represents the first exact microscopic calculation showing how ballistic dynamics generates long-range correlations, in agreement with general results from the recently developed ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, and showing how such long range-correlations directly affect the diffusive hydrodynamic terms, in agreement with, and clarifying, recent related results.

Title: Imaging Ultrafast Dynamical Diffraction wavefronts of femtosecond laser-induced lattice distortions inside crystalline semiconductors
Authors: Angel Rodríguez-Fernández, Jan-Etienne Pudell, Roman Shayduk, Wonhyuk Jo, James Wrigley, Johannes Möller, Peter Zalden, Alexey Zozulya, Jörg Hallmann, Anders Madsen, Pablo Villanueva-Perez, Zdenek Matej, Thies J. Albert, Dominik Kaczmarek, Klaus Sokolowski-Tinten, Antonowicz Jerzy, Ryszard Sobierajski, Rahimi Mosafer, Oleksii I. Liubchenko, Javier Solis, Jan Siegel
Abstract: Material processing with femtosecond lasers has attracted enormous attention because of its potential for technology and industry applications. In parallel, time-resolved x-ray diffraction has been successfully used to study ultrafast structural distortion dynamics in semiconductor thin films. Gracing incident x-ray geometry has been also used to look to distortion dynamics, but this technique is only sensitive to the surface of bulk materials with a limited temporal resolution. However, 'real-world' processing applications deal mostly with bulk materials, which prevent the use of such techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon single-pulse excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of the temporal evolution of ultrafast distortion depth profiles. Our measurements were obtained in a thin crystalline Si wafer upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation revealing that even below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions appear on ps time scales due to the formation and propagation of high-amplitude strain waves into the bulk.

Title: Coupling between small polarons and ferroelectricity in BaTiO3
Authors: Darin Joseph, Cesare Franchini
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the formation of electron and hole small polarons in the prototypical ferroelectric material BaTiO3, with a focus on their interaction with ferroelectric distortive fields. To accurately describe the ferroelectric phase in electronically correlated BaTiO3, we employ the HSE06 hybrid functional, which addresses the limitations of conventional DFT and DFT+U models, providing a more precise depiction of both ferroelectric and polaronic behaviors. Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3: cubic, tetragonal, and rhombohedral. We uncover a unique phase-dependent trend in electron polaron stability, which progressively increases across the structural phases, peaking in the rhombohedral phase due to the constructive coupling between the polaron and ferroelectric phonon fields. In contrast, hole polarons exhibit a stability pattern largely unaffected by the phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe that polaron self-trapping significantly alters the local ferroelectric distortive pattern, which propagates to neighboring sites but has a minimal effect on the long-range macroscopic spontaneous polarization. Charge trapping is also associated with localized spin formation, opening new possibilities for enhanced functionalities in multiferroic materials.

Title: Deep Neural Network-Based Voltage Prediction for Alkali-Metal-Ion Battery Materials
Authors: Sk Mujaffar Hossain, Namitha Anna Koshi, Seung-Cheol Lee, G.P Das, Satadeep Bhattacharjee
Abstract: Accurate voltage prediction of battery materials plays a pivotal role in advancing energy storage technologies and in the rational design of high-performance cathode materials. In this work, we present a deep neural network (DNN) model, built using PyTorch, to estimate the average voltage of cathode materials across Li-ion, Na-ion, and other alkali-metal-ion batteries. The model is trained on an extensive dataset from the Materials Project, incorporating a wide range of descriptors-structural, physical, chemical, electronic, thermodynamic, and battery-specific-ensuring a comprehensive representation of material properties. Our model exhibits strong predictive performance, as corroborated by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The close alignment between the DNN predictions and DFT outcomes highlights the robustness and accuracy of our machine learning framework in effectively screening and identifying viable battery materials. Utilizing this validated model, we successfully propose novel Na-ion battery compositions, with their predicted behavior confirmed through rigorous computational assessment. By seamlessly integrating data-driven prediction with first-principles validation, this study presents an effective framework that significantly accelerates the discovery and optimization of advanced battery materials, contributing to the development of more reliable and efficient energy storage technologies.

Title: Error Bounds on the Universal Lindblad Equation in the Thermodynamic Limit
Authors: Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori
Abstract: It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors due to several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation keep small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of the accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Electronic structures and multi-orbital models of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure
Authors: Xunwu Hu, Wenyuan Qiu, Cun-Qun Chen, Zhihui Luo, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ exceeding 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks a significant breakthrough in the field of nickelate superconductors. Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.

Title: BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$: Strong Kitaev, After All
Authors: Pavel A. Maksimov, Shengtao Jiang, L. P. Regnault, A. L. Chernyshev
Abstract: The inelastic neutron scattering results and their analysis unequivocally point to a dominant Kitaev interaction in the honeycomb-lattice cobaltate BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. Our anisotropic-exchange model closely describes $all$ available neutron scattering data in the material's field-polarized phase. The density-matrix renormalization group results for our model are in close accord with the unusual double-zigzag magnetic order and the low in-plane saturation field of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$.

Title: Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation
Authors: Ludovic Gardré, Swen Helstroffer, Pierre Muller, Fabrice Thalmann, Thierry Charitat, Laurent Joly, Claire Loison
Abstract: Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity as the system enters the attractive regime, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics.

Title: Structural stability, elemental ordering, and transport properties in layered ScTaN2
Authors: Baptiste Julien, Ian A. Leahy, Rebecca W. Smaha, John S. Mangum, Craig L. Perkins, Sage R. Bauers, Andriy Zakutayev
Abstract: Some ternary TM nitrides are predicted to adopt layered structures that make them interesting for thermoelectric conversion and quantum materials applications. Synthesis of TM ternary nitride films by physical vapor deposition often favors disordered 3D structures rather than the predicted 2D-like layered structure. In this study, we investigate the structural interplay in the Sc-Ta-N material system, focusing on ScTaN2. We use a two-step combinatorial approach to deposit Sc-Ta-N films by RF co-sputtering and then process the resulting 3D-structured precursor with RTA. Synchrotron GIWAXS on films annealed at 1200 °C for 20 min reveals the nucleation of the layered structure (P63/mmc) within a composition window of Sc/(Sc+Ta) = 0.2-0.5. We estimate the long-range order parameter in stoichiometric ScTaN2 films to be 0.86. Interestingly, we find that the structure can accommodate large off-stoichiometry in the Ta-rich region (x < 0.5), facilitated by making an alloy with the nearly isostructural Ta5N6 compound that exists on a composition tie-line. Transport measurements on ScTaN2 reveal a nearly temperature-independent high carrier density (1021 cm-3), suggesting a heavily doped semiconductor or semimetallic character. The carrier mobility is relatively small (9.5 cm2V-1s-1 at 2 K) and the residual-resistivity ratio is small, suggesting that electrical conduction is dominated by defects or disorder. Measured magnetoresistance is indicative of weak antilocalization at low temperatures. We highlight the interplay between ScTaN2 and Ta5N6 in stabilizing layered structures, emphasizes the importance of cation order/disorder for potential tunable alloys, and suggests that ScTaN2 is promising platform for exploring electronic properties in a tie line of stoichiometry.

Title: SEMIDV: A Compact Semiconductor Device Simulator with Quantum Effects
Authors: Chien-Ting Tung
Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.

Title: Triplet superconductivity by the orbital Rashba effect at surfaces of elemental superconductors
Authors: Tom G. Saunderson, Martin Gradhand, Dongwook Go, James F. Annett, Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Mario Cuoco, Mathias Kläui, Jacob Gayles, Yuriy Mokrousov
Abstract: It is often assumed that in a superconductor without spin-triplet pairing, the formation of unconventional spin-triplet densities requires the spin-orbit interaction in combination with either broken inversion symmetry or broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.

Title: Quantum Algorithm for Green's Functions Measurements in the Fermi-Hubbard Model
Authors: Gino Bishop, Dmitry Bagrets, Frank K. Wilhelm
Abstract: In the framework of the hybrid quantum-classical variational cluster approach (VCA) to strongly correlated electron systems one of the goals of a quantum subroutine is to find single-particle correlation functions of lattice fermions in polynomial time. Previous works suggested to use variants of the Hadamard test for this purpose, which requires an implementation of controlled single-particle fermionic operators. However, for a number of locality-preserving mappings to encode fermions into qubits, a direct construction of such operators is not possible. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm, which uses an analog of the Kubo formula adapted to a quantum circuit simulating the Hubbard model. It allows to access the Green's function of a cluster directly using only bilinears of fermionic operators and circumvents the usage of the Hadamard test. We test our new algorithm in practice by using open-access simulators of noisy IBM superconducting chips.

Title: Surface and sub-surface modifications of copper electrodes exposed to high-field conditioning at cryogenic temperatures
Authors: Marek Jacewicz, Iaroslava Profatilova, Piotr Szaniawski, Inna Popov, Yinon Ashkenazy, Sergio Calatroni, Walter Wuensch
Abstract: In order to investigate the dependence of conditioning and field-holding on temperature, three pairs of copper electrodes underwent high voltage conditioning with direct current (DC) pulses while kept at a single temperature, unique for each set (300~K, 30~K and 10~K), until saturation field for each set was found. The sets conditioned at cold showed a significant increase in the field holding capability, reaching fields up to 147 MV/m after tens of millions of pulses and very few breakdowns (BDs). We interpret this as an indication of the conditioning effect being due to high field pulsing rather than exposure to BDs. The effect of the warm and cold conditioning was investigated with high-resolution microscopy, characterizing the BD spots on the anode and cathode according to their morphology and with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyzing the changes in the sub-surface regions. Atypical BD spot features were found on the cryogenically conditioned cathode surfaces, with very shallow craters of a star-like shape. The number of atypical spots increased with decreased temperatures, reaching 26 and 53 percent of the total number of spots at 30~K and 10~K, respectively. A hypothesis explaining the formation of these features is also presented. The very different morphology of the anode and cathode BD spots is presented in detail that suggesting an unknown shielding mechanism that prevents the center of the anode spot from melting. These results provide important experimental input for the development of quantitative theories and models for BD initiation and inter-electrode plasma formation.

Title: Controlling measurement-induced phase transitions with tunable detector coupling
Authors: Ritu Nehra, Alessandro Romito, Dganit Meidan
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.

Title: Phases and phase transition in Grover's algorithm with systematic noise
Authors: Sasanka Dowarah, Chuanwei Zhang, Vedika Khemani, Michael H. Kolodrubetz
Abstract: While limitations on quantum computation by Markovian environmental noise are well-understood in generality, their behavior for different quantum circuits and noise realizations can be less universal. Here we consider a canonical quantum algorithm - Grover's algorithm for unordered search on $L$ qubits - in the presence of systematic noise. This allows us to write the behavior as a random Floquet unitary, which we show is well-characterized by random matrix theory (RMT). The RMT analysis enables analytical predictions for phases and phase transitions of the many-body dynamics. We find two separate transitions. At moderate disorder $\delta_{c,\mathrm{gap}}\sim L^{-1}$, there is a ergodicity breaking transition such that a finite-dimensional manifold remains non-ergodic for $\delta < \delta_{c,\mathrm{gap}}$. Computational power is lost at a much smaller disorder, $\delta_{c,\mathrm{comp}} \sim L^{-1/2}2^{-L/2}$. We comment on relevance to non-systematic noise in realistic quantum computers, including cold atom, trapped ion, and superconducting platforms.

Title: Harnessing Nonlinear Dynamics for Time-Driven Berry Phase in Classical Systems
Authors: Kazi T. Mahmood, M. Arif Hasan
Abstract: Phases arising from cyclic processes are fundamental in physics, bridging quantum and classical domains and providing deeper insights into the topology and dynamics of physical systems. This study investigates the accumulation of a time-driven Berry phase in a classical nonlinear system comprised of two spherical granules and introduces a method in which gauge variants naturally evolve over time without altering internal or external conditions. We develop a perturbation-based model to map the system's elastic characteristics to Bloch states and confirm the theoretical predictions of the frequency-dependent Berry phase through experiments. Our findings reveal that the Berry phase can exhibit trivial and nontrivial values, influenced by external driving forces and static precompression. Our results demonstrate a rich array of vibrational modes, capable of displaying identical Berry phase signatures across different frequencies-a significant departure from previous studies that identified a single topological resonance. Multiple nontrivial Berry phases emerge in highly nonlinear settings, whereas more linear regimes exhibit a singular nontrivial phase. Notably, the behavior of the Berry phase in our system mirrors fundamental quantum mechanics concepts, such as path-dependent state evolution. This study highlights the potential of classical mechanical systems to mimic quantum phenomena, opening new pathways for quantum-inspired topological computation and offering fresh perspectives on using time-driven Berry phase accumulation to investigate topological properties in nonlinear media.

Title: Tensor tree learns hidden relational structures in data to construct generative models
Authors: Kenji Harada, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Naoki Kawashima
Abstract: Based on the tensor tree network with the Born machine framework, we propose a general method for constructing a generative model by expressing the target distribution function as the amplitude of the quantum wave function represented by a tensor tree. The key idea is dynamically optimizing the tree structure that minimizes the bond mutual information. The proposed method offers enhanced performance and uncovers hidden relational structures in the target data. We illustrate potential practical applications with four examples: (i) random patterns, (ii) QMNIST handwritten digits, (iii) Bayesian networks, and (iv) the pattern of stock price fluctuation pattern in S&P500. In (i) and (ii), the strongly correlated variables were concentrated near the center of the network; in (iii), the causality pattern was identified; and in (iv), a structure corresponding to the eleven sectors emerged.

Abstract: In this study, we leverage the massive amount of multi-modal on-machine metrology data generated from Laser Powder Directed Energy Deposition (LP-DED) to construct a comprehensive surrogate model of the 3D printing process. By employing Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc), a data-driven technique, we capture the complex physics inherent in this extensive dataset. This physics-based surrogate model emphasizes thermodynamically significant quantities, enabling us to accurately predict key process outcomes. The model ingests 21 process parameters, including laser power, scan rate, and position, while providing outputs such as melt pool temperature, melt pool size, and other essential observables. Furthermore, it incorporates uncertainty quantification to provide bounds on these predictions, enhancing reliability and confidence in the results. We then deploy the surrogate model on a new, unseen part and monitor the printing process as validation of the method. Our experimental results demonstrate that the predictions align with actual measurements with high accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of our approach. This methodology not only facilitates real-time predictions but also operates at process-relevant speeds, establishing a basis for implementing feedback control in LP-DED.

Title: Manifestations of $(2+1)d$ chiral anomaly in a graphene plate
Authors: Sergey N. Solodukhin
Abstract: Inspired by the Dirac model model of graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.

Title: Scar-induced imbalance in staggered Rydberg ladders
Authors: Mainak Pal, Madhumita Sarkar, K. Sengupta, Arnab Sen
Abstract: We demonstrate that the kinematically-constrained model of Rydberg atoms on a two-leg ladder with staggered detuning, $\Delta \in [0,1]$, has quantum many-body scars (QMBS) in its spectrum and represents a non-perturbative generalization of the paradigmatic PXP model defined on a chain. We show that these QMBS result in coherent many-body revivals and site-dependent magnetization dynamics for both Néel and Rydberg vacuum initial states around $\Delta=1$. The latter feature leads to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)-violating finite imbalance at long times in a disorder-free system. This is further demonstrated by constructing appropriate local imbalance operators that display nonzero long-time averages for Néel and vacuum initial states. We also study the fidelity and Shannon entropy for such dynamics which, along with the presence of long-time finite imbalance, brings out the qualitatively different nature of QMBS in PXP ladders with $\Delta \sim 1$ from those in the PXP chain. Finally, we identify additional exact mid-spectrum zero modes that stay unchanged as a function of $\Delta$ and violate ETH.

Title: Quantum vorticity: a not so effective field theory
Authors: Gabriel Cuomo, Fanny Eustachon, Eren Firat, Brian Henning, Riccardo Rattazzi
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive picture for the formulation of the perfect fluid in the modern effective field theory formalism at both the classical and quantum level. Due to the necessity of decomposing the hydrodynamical variables $(\rho, p, u^\mu)$ into other internal degrees of freedom, the procedure is inherently not unique. We discuss and compare the different inequivalent formulations. These theories possess a peculiarity: the presence of an infinite dimensional symmetry implying a vanishing dispersion relation $\omega = 0$ for the transverse modes. This sets the stage for UV-IR mixing in the quantum theory, which we study in the different formulations focussing on the incompressible limit. We observe that the dispersion relation gets modified by quantum effects to become $\omega \propto \mathbf{k}^2$, where the fundamental excitations can be viewed as vortex-anti-vortex pairs. The spectrum exhibits infinitely many types of degenerate quanta. The unusual sensitivity to UV quantum fluctuations renders the implementation of the defining infinite symmetry somewhat subtle. However we present a lattice regularization that preserves a deformed version of such symmetry.

Title: Emergence of network communities driven by local rules
Authors: Alexei Vazquez
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here I demonstrate that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_ \kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_ \kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conclude that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.

Title: Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Fibered Link States
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian, Charlie Cummings
Abstract: We study the patterns of multipartite entanglement in Chern-Simons theory with compact gauge group $G$ and level $k$ for states defined by the path integral on ``link complements'', i.e., compact manifolds whose boundaries consist of $n$ topologically linked tori. We focus on link complements which can be described topologically as fibrations over a Seifert surface. We show that the entanglement structure of such fibered link complement states is controlled by a topological invariant, the monodromy of the fibration. Thus, the entanglement structure of a Chern-Simons link state is not simply a function of the link, but also of the background manifold in which the link is embedded. In particular, we show that any link possesses an embedding into some background that leads to GHZ-like entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all fibered links with periodic monodromy have GHZ-like entanglement, i.e., a partial trace on any link component produces a separable state. These results generalize to any three dimensional topological field theory with a dual chiral rational conformal field theory.

Title: Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer
Authors: Jun Nishimura, Hiromasa Watanabe
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.

Title: Observation of Quantum Darwinism and the Origin of Classicality with Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Zitian Zhu, Kiera Salice, Akram Touil, Zehang Bao, Zixuan Song, Pengfei Zhang, Hekang Li, Zhen Wang, Chao Song, Qiujiang Guo, H. Wang, Rubem Mondaini
Abstract: The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? For instance, what makes two people, each absorbing an independent fraction of photons scattered from this screen or paper, agree on the observation of the text written here? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this emergence of classicality by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality we perceive. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of the foundational framework of quantum Darwinism and the accompanying underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a separate quantifier for classicality, originating a computationally and experimentally inexpensive method to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.
