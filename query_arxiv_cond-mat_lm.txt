Title: Non-ideal subthreshold swing in aligned carbon nanotube transistors due to variable occupancy discrete charge traps
Authors: Saurabh S. Sawant, Teo Lara, Francois Leonard, Zhi Yao, Andrew Nonaka
Abstract: Carbon nanotube transistors have been experimentally demonstrated to reach performance comparable and even surpassing that of silicon transistors. Further improvement requires addressing non-idealities arising from device fabrication that impact performance and reproducibility. One performance metric that determines energy efficiency is the subthreshold swing which is often observed to be 3-4 times larger than the ideal thermal limit. In this work, we present simulations indicating that a discrete number of variable occupancy hole trapping sites can explain the large subthreshold swing. Our simulations indicate that while three-dimensional trap distributions influence the subthreshold swing, only the traps in close proximity to the nanotubes have a significant impact. The results suggest that a density of trapping sites on the order of 0.5/nm$^2$ near the nanotubes is sufficient to significantly increase the subthreshold swing, requiring the removal or passivation of only a few sites per carbon nanotube.

Title: Quantifying Coupled Dynamics in Phase-Space from State Distribution Snapshots
Authors: Erez Aghion, Nava Leibovich
Abstract: We quantify nonlinear interactions between coupled complex processes, when the system is subject to noise and not all its components are measurable. Our method is applicable even when the system cannot be continuously monitored over time, but is rather observed only in snapshots. Having only partial information about the local topology of the network and observations of relevant interacting variables is sufficient to translate qualitative knowledge of interactions into a quantitative characterization of the coupled dynamics. This approach turns a globally intractable problem into a sequence of solvable inference problems, to quantify complex interaction networks from incomplete snapshots of their statistical state.

Title: Microscopic Fingerprint of Chiral Superconductivity
Authors: Xuefeng Wu, Xuan Hao, Zhuo Chen, Yuchang Cai, Minghao Wu, Congrun Chen, Kedong Wang, Fangfei Ming, Steven Johnston, Rui-Xing Zhang, Hanno H. Weitering
Abstract: Chiral superconductors have long been theorized to break time-reversal symmetry and support exotic topological features such as Majorana modes and spontaneous edge currents, promising ingredients for quantum technologies. Although several unconventional superconductors may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, clear microscopic evidence of chiral pairing has remained out of reach. In this work, we demonstrate direct real-space signatures of chiral superconductivity in a single atomic layer of tin on Si(111). Using quasiparticle interference imaging, we detected symmetry-locked nodal and antinodal points in the Bogoliubov quasiparticle wavefunction, tightly bound to atomic point defects in the tin lattice. These nodal features, along with their surrounding texture, form a distinct real-space pattern exhibiting a clear and exclusive hallmark of chiral superconductivity. Our findings, reinforced by analytical theory and numerical simulations, offer unambiguous evidence of chiral pairing in a two-dimensional material.

Title: Adaptive Neural Quantum States: A Recurrent Neural Network Perspective
Authors: Jake McNaughton, Mohamed Hibat-Allah
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) are powerful neural-network ansätzes that have emerged as promising tools for studying quantum many-body physics through the lens of the variational principle. These architectures are known to be systematically improvable by increasing the number of parameters. Here we demonstrate an Adaptive scheme to optimize NQSs, through the example of recurrent neural networks (RNN), using a fraction of the computation cost while reducing training fluctuations and improving the quality of variational calculations targeting ground states of prototypical models in one- and two-spatial dimensions. This Adaptive technique reduces the computational cost through training small RNNs and reusing them to initialize larger RNNs. This work opens up the possibility for optimizing graphical processing unit (GPU) resources deployed in large-scale NQS simulations.

Title: Strong enhancements to superconducting properties of 1D systems from metallic reservoirs
Authors: J. E. Ebot, Sam Mardazad, Lorenzo Pizzino, Johannes S. Hofmann, Thierry Giamarchi, Adrian Kantian
Abstract: Using a 1D bilayer system comprised of pairing and metallic layers, the present work proves the striking power of reservoir-mediated boosting of superconductivity. Employing many-body numerics on large systems at zero and finite temperature, we unravel the complex processes by which the tuning of the metal parameters can impact the effective pairing strength as well as the long-range pair-pair-coupling mediated by the metal. It is these two processes that in turn can strongly enhance superconducting susceptibility and thermal superconducting correlation length over those of the isolated system. We show that in this way, even a 1D system can come very close to achieving superconducting long-range order.

Title: Propagating Neutral Modes in an Intervalley Coherent State

Abstract: The emergence of neutral collective modes is a hallmark of correlated quantum phases but is often challenging to probe experimentally. In two-dimensional flatband systems, charge responses have been intensively investigated, yet neutral excitations remain largely unexplored. In particular, intervalley coherent state (IVC) features a neutral Goldstone mode due to spontaneously broken valley U(1) symmetry. While IVC state has been proposed as a unifying theme across graphene- and semiconductor-based systems, its defining feature - the neutral Goldstone mode - remains elusive in experiment. Here we investigate space-and-time-resolved transport of neutral modes in twisted WSe2 moiré superlattices through a novel ultrafast imaging technique. We uncover two new propagating collective modes with very different velocities, which emerge near the van Hove singularity (VHS) in both intermediate- (3.5~4 degree) and large-angle (~5 degree) twisted WSe2. The fast-propagating mode has a surprisingly large speed of ~3 km/s and is consistent with a Goldstone mode for an IVC state, while the slow-moving mode is likely a gapped amplitude mode. They can be understood as the spin-valley analogues of collective modes of a superfluid, whose propagation are imaged for the first time in a condensed matter system. Our study sets a new paradigm for probing charge-neutral modes in quantum materials and offers key insights into the interplay between charge and spin-valley physics in moiré superlattices.

Title: Rubber Friction: Theory, Mechanisms, and Challenges
Authors: B.N.J. Persson, R. Xu
Abstract: Rubber friction is of major practical importance in applications such as tires, rubber seals, and footwear. This review article focuses on the theory and experimental studies of rubber friction on substrates with random roughness. We examine both steady sliding and accelerated motion, with particular attention to the origins of the breakloose friction force and the influence of pre-slip, elasticity, and flash temperature on friction dynamics. We further discuss rolling friction for cylinders and spheres, as well as sliding friction for triangular sliders on dry and lubricated rubber surfaces. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained using different materials, geometries, and environmental conditions, highlighting the importance of accounting for multiscale roughness. Open challenges, such as the role of adhesion enhancement, energy dissipation due to crack opening, and the physical origin of the short-distance roughness cut-off, are discussed.

Title: Towards Accurate Thermal Property Predictions in Uranium Nitride using Machine Learning Interatomic Potential
Authors: Beihan Chen (1), Zilong Hua (2), Jennifer K. Watkins (2), Linu Malakkal (2), Marat Khafizov (3), David H. Hurley (2), Miaomiao Jin (1) ((1) Pennsylvania State University, (2) Idaho National Lab, (3) Ohio State University)
Abstract: We present a combined computational and experimental investigation of the thermal properties of uranium nitride (UN), focusing on the development of a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using the moment tensor potential (MTP) framework. The MLIP was trained on density functional theory (DFT) data and validated against various quantities including energies, forces, elastic constants, phonon dispersion, and defect formation energies, achieving excellent agreement with DFT calculations, prior experimental results and our thermal conductivity measurement. The potential was then employed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict key thermal properties such as melting point, thermal expansion, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. To further assess model accuracy, we fabricated a UN sample and performed new thermal conductivity measurements representative of single-crystal properties, which show strong agreement with the MLIP predictions. This work confirms the reliability and predictive capability of the developed potential for determining the thermal properties of UN.

Title: Defect Engineering the Interacting Many-body SSH Model
Authors: Lin Wang, Thomas Luu, Ulf-G. Meißner
Abstract: The ability to engineer topologically distinct materials opens the possibility of enabling novel phenomena in low-dimensional nano-systems, as well as manufacturing novel quantum devices. One of the simplest examples, the SSH model with both even and odd number of sites, demonstrates the connection between localized edge states and the topology of the system. We show that the SSH model hosts localized spin centers due to the interplay between the localized edge states and the on-site Hubbard interaction. We further show how one can engineer any number of localized spin centers within the chain by careful addition of defects. These spin centers are paired in spin-singlet or spin-triplet channels within each block separated by the defects, and together they construct a chain of spin qubits. As this system is realizable experimentally, our findings provide a novel way for manipulating and engineering spin qubits in physical systems.

Title: Observation of Magnetic Devil's Staircase-Like Behavior in Quasiperiodic Qubit Lattices
Authors: Alejandro Lopez-Bezanilla
Abstract: The devil's staircase (DS) phenomenon is a fractal response of magnetization to external fields, traditionally observed in periodic ferromagnetic systems, where the commensurability between spin arrangements, lattice parameters, and external magnetic fields governs abrupt changes in magnetization. Its occurrence in aperiodic, fractal-type systems has remained largely unexplored, despite their natural compatibility with such phenomena. Using a quantum annealing device, we uncover a wealth of abrupt magnetic transitions between spin manifolds driven by increasing external magnetic fields within a simple yet effective Ising-model framework. In contrast to periodic systems, where DS arises from long-range competing interactions, our findings reveal that short-range, purely antiferromagnetic couplings in aperiodic geometries produce equally rich ground-state magnetization patterns. We demonstrate that while magnetic textures are determined by the lattice size, their formation remains remarkably robust and independent of scale, with commensurability emerging locally. Our results challenge the prevailing view that DS behavior is limited to periodic systems and establish quasiperiodic geometries as a natural host for this phenomenon.

Title: Topological magneto-optics in the non-coplanar antiferromagnet Co_{1/3}NbS_2: Imaging and writing chiral magnetic domains
Authors: E. Kirstein, H. Park, I. Martin, J. F. Mitchell, N. Ghimire, S. A. Crooker
Abstract: Despite its tiny net magnetization, the antiferromagnetic (AFM) van der Waals material Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ exhibits a large transverse Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ even at zero applied magnetic field, which arises, as recently shown, from the topological nature of its non-coplanar ``tetrahedral'' AFM order. This triple-Q magnetic order can be regarded as the short-lengthscale limit of a magnetic skyrmion lattice, and has an intrinsic spin chirality. Here we show, using optical wavelengths spanning the ultraviolet to infrared (400-1000 nm), that magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) provides an incisive optical probe of the topological AFM order in Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$. Measurements as a continuous function of photon energy are directly compared with first-principles calculations, revealing the influence of the underlying quantum geometry on optical conductivity. Leveraging the power and flexibility of optical methods, we use scanning MCD microscopy to directly image chiral AFM domains, and demonstrate writing of chiral AFM domains.

Title: X-ray Diffraction and Electrical Transport Imaging of Superconducting Superhydride (La,Y)H10

Abstract: We report the synthesis and characterization of (La0.9Y0.1)H10 superhydrides exhibiting coexisting cubic Fm-3m and hexagonal P63/mmc clathrate phases observed over the pressure range from 168 GPa down to 136 GPa. Using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction imaging (XDI) at the upgraded Advanced Photon Source (APS-U), we spatially resolved micron-scale distributions of these phases, revealing structural inhomogeneity across the sample. Four-probe DC resistance measurements confirmed superconductivity, with two distinct transitions: an onset at 244 K associated with the cubic phase and a second near 220 K linked to the hexagonal phase. Notably, resistance profiles collected from different current and voltage permutations showed variations in transition width and onset temperature that correlated with the spatial phase distribution mapped by XDI. These findings demonstrate a direct connection between local structural domains and superconducting behavior. Yttrium substitution is found to influence both the phase behavior and superconducting properties of LaH10-type clathrate hydrides. More broadly, this study highlights the utility of spatially correlating structural and electrical transport measurements in materials exhibiting heterogeneity under pressure, including hydride superconductors.

Title: X-ray Emission Spectropolarimetry of Strongly Anisotropic Single Crystal Systems using a Rowland Circle Geometry
Authors: Jared E. Abramson, Charles A. Cardot, Josh J. Kas, John J. Rehr, Werner Kaminsky, Herwig Michor, Marta Roman, Petra Becker, Gerald T. Seidler
Abstract: Polarization dependence has historically seen extensive use in x-ray spectroscopy to determine magnetic and local geometric properties, but more broadly as a way to gain extra sensitivity to electronic structure at the level of individual magnetic orbitals. This is often done in the context of x-ray absorption through techniques like x-ray magnetic circular dichroism or x-ray linear dichroism, but it has seen little application to x-ray emission. Here we explore the information contained in the polarized emission of two 3d transition metal systems across both core-to-core (CtC) and valence-to-core emission (VtC) lines. We demonstrate how the Rowland circle geometry can be used as a spectropolarimeter, and apply it to the x-ray emission spectroscopy of spin-1/2 Cu(II) and spin-0 Ni(II) ions in LiVCuO4 and DyNiC2, respectively. From this we explore how the polarized XES interrogates of the occupied density of states at the valence level, either as a second order effect through Coulomb exchange (CtC x-ray emission) or by direct transitions (VtC x-ray emission). We find that the polarized x-ray emission can provide insights into the valence electron orbital occupation, in much the same way that is achievable with polarized absorption or angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy techniques. Finally, we highlight how the individually polarized dipole emission spectra can be extracted from a linearly independent suite of directed emission spectra, allowing for polarized measurements at high Bragg angle with lower experimental broadening.

Title: Magnetic Field Induced Nonlinear Transport in LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Interfaces
Authors: Aidan Steineman, Maxim Khodas, Maxim Dzero
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental measurements of the nonlinear longitudinal resistance of the spin-orbit coupled electron gas in the (111) LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces under external in-plane magnetic field [G. Tuvia \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 146301 (2024)], we formulate a theory of nonlinear electronic transport based on the analysis of the quantum kinetic equation for the Wigner distribution function. Specifically, we evaluate the magnetic field dependence of the second harmonic of the current density at arbitrary values of the magnetic field. The magnitude of the second harmonic increases linearly with the magnetic field at small fields. Upon further increase of the magnetic field, the second harmonic response reaches its maximum value. We find that the position of the peak and its width strongly depend on the relaxation rate due to disorder. Importantly, we discover that the direction of the nonlinear contribution to the current can be completely reversed when the magnetic field reaches a certain critical value.

Title: Quantum diffusion in the Harper model under polychromatic time-perturbation
Authors: Hiroaki S. Yamada, Kensuke S. Ikeda
Abstract: Quantum dynamics of the Harper model with self-duality exhibits localized, diffusive, and ballistic states depending on the potential strength $V$. By adding time-dependent harmonic perturbations composed of $M$ incommensurate frequencies, we show that all states of the Harper model transition to quantum diffusive states as the perturbation strength $\epsilon$ increases for $M \geq 3$. The transition schemes and diffusion behaviors are discussed in detail and the phase diagram in the $(\epsilon,V)$ parameter space is presented.

Title: Continuous and discontinuous shape transitions in the spatial distribution of self-propelling particles in power-law potential wells
Authors: Abhik Samui, Manoj Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: We study the stationary states of an active Brownian particle and run-and-tumble particle in a two dimensional power-law potential well, in the limit where translational diffusion is negligible. The potential energy of the particle is taken to have the form $U(r)\propto r^{n}$, where $n\geq 2$ and even. We derive an exact equation for the positional probability distribution $\phi({\bf r})$ in two dimensions, and solve for the same, under the assumption that the particle's orientation angle is a Gaussian variable. We show that $\phi({\bf r})$ has compact support and undergoes a phase transition-like change in shape as the active velocity increases. For active Brownian particle, our theory predicts a continuous transition in shape for $n=2$ and a discontinuous transition for $n>2$, both of which agree with simulation results. In the strongly active regime, the orientational probability distribution is unimodal near the outer boundary but becomes bimodal towards the interior, signifying orbiting motion. The unimodal-bimodal transition in the angular distribution is nearly absent for run-and-tumble particle.

Title: Prediction of Mechanical Properties and Thermodynamic Stability of Ti-N system using MTP Interatomic Potential
Authors: Pradeep Kumar Rana, Atharva Vyawahare, Rohit Batra, Satyesh Kumar Yadav
Abstract: Ti-N material system have range of compounds with different stoichiometry like Ti2N, Ti3N2, Ti6N5, Ti4N3 alongwith Ti , TiN and solid solutions of N in Ti with a maximum of 23% solubility. In this work, we develop an interatomic potential based on moment tensor potential (MTP) that could reliably predict mechanical properties and thermodynamic stability of all Ti-N system. Taking into account the structural similarity and dissimilarity of various Ti-N system to choose training dataset was crucial for development of the potential. Root mean square error (RMSE) in prediction of formation energy using MTP potential compared to one calculated using density functional theory (DFT) for training dataset is 2.1 meV/atom and for testing dataset is 6.8 meV/atom. The frequency of absolute error in formation energy peaks at a maximum value of 3.8 meV/atom for system that was part of training dataset, while it peaks at 7.6 meV/atom for systems that are not part of the training dataset. Furthermore, the distribution and variability of elastic constants across compositions are systematically evaluated, revealing trends consistent with DFT benchmarks. The developed potential was used to predict energy of new phases in Ti-N system. We show that structures with N/Ti ratios ranging from 0 to 1 can be thermodynamically stable. A maximum deviation of 10 meV/atom from the convex hull plot of formation energy 0K was observed for a few system.

Title: Spinon Singlet: Microscopic Mechanism of $d$-Wave Pairing in a Partially-Filled Stripe
Authors: Jia-Long Wang, Shi-Jie Hu, Xue-Feng Zhang
Abstract: Significant research advances have led to a consensus that the Fermi-Hubbard model and its extended variants are archetypal frameworks for elucidating the intertwined relationship between stripe orders and superconductivity in hole-doped high-$T_c$ materials. Notably, the Hubbard quantum simulator has recently achieved several remarkable breakthroughs, e.g., being successfully cooled down to the cryogenic regime and enabling the observation of stable fluctuating stripes. However, the microscopic mechanism behind $d$-wave pairing of electrons in the presence of stripes at low temperatures remains poorly understood due to the intricate interplay among the strongly correlated effects and non-negligible thermal fluctuations. Here, we conduct a close investigation of a partially-filled stripe in the representative $t$-$J$ and Fermi-Hubbard models with both numerical and analytical methods. Analogous to quantum gas microscopy, the perfect sampling technique allows us to obtain the high-confidence statistics of the Fock basis states appearing in the ground-state wavefunction. In a refreshing physical paradigm, these data demonstrate that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to spontaneously pair into a singlet state, which naturally gives rise to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Then, using the effective theory of quantum colored string, we reconstruct the wavefunction and determine the nature of spinon pairing and its connection to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Furthermore, spinon singlet pairs enable the establishment of a long-range pair-pair correlation between double stripes. Our work offers new insights into the role of stripe orders in mediating $d$-wave superconductivity and paves the way for further exploration of multi-stripe-mediated pairing mechanisms in the Fermi-Hubbard model.

Title: Antibonding and Electronic Instabilities in GdRu2X2 (X = Si, Ge, Sn): A New Pathway Toward Developing Centrosymmetric Skyrmion Materials
Authors: Dasuni N. Rathnaweera, Xudong Huai, K. Ramesh Kumar, Sumanta Tewari, Michał J. Winiarski, Richard Dronskowski, Thao T. Tran
Abstract: Chemical bonding is key to unlocking the potential of magnetic materials for future information technology. Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected nano-sized spin textures that can enable high-density low-power spin-based electronics. Despite increasing interest in the discovery of new skyrmion hosts and their characterization, the electronic origins of the skyrmion formation remain unknown. Here, we study GdRu2X2 (X = Si, Ge, Sn) as a model system to study the connection among chemical bonding, electronic instability, and the critical temperature and magnetic field at which skyrmions evolve. The nature of the electronic structure of GdRu2X2 is characterized by chemical bonding, Fermi surface analysis, and density of energy function. As X-p orbitals become more extended from Si-3p to Ge-4p and Sn-5p, improved interactions between the Gd spins and the [Ru2X2] conduction layer and increased destabilizing energy contributions are obtained. GdRu2Si2 possesses a Fermi surface nesting (FSN) vector [Q = (q, 0, 0)], whereas GdRu2Ge2 displays two inequivalent FSN vectors [Q = (q, 0, 0); QA = (q, q, 0)] and GdRu2Sn2 features multiple Q vectors. In addition, competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions in the Gd plane become more pronounced as a function of X. These results reveal some correlation among the electronic instability, the competing interaction strength, and the temperature and magnetic field conditions at which the skyrmions emerge. This work demonstrates how chemical bonding and electronic structure enable a new framework for understanding and developing skyrmions under desired conditions that would otherwise be impossible.

Title: Atomic-Scale Heterogeneity of Hydrogen in Metal Hydrides Revealed by Electron Ptychography
Authors: Pengcheng Li, Chenglin Pua, Zehao Dong, Zhengxiong Su, Tao Liu, Chao Cai, Huahai Shen, Lin Gu, Zhen Chen
Abstract: Hydrogen plays critical roles in materials science, particularly for advancing technologies in hydrogen storage and phase manipulation, while also posing challenges like hydrogen embrittlement. Understanding its behavior, vital for improving material properties, requires precise determination of atomic-scale distribution-a persistent challenge due to hydrogen's weak electron scattering and high mobility, as well as the limitations of conventional transmission electron microscopy. We demonstrate that multislice electron ptychography (MEP) overcomes these constraints through three key advances: exceptional sensitivity for hydrogen occupancy, three-dimensional quantification, and picometer-level precision in atomic positioning. Experimentally, MEP resolves heterogeneous hydrogen distributions and quantifies hydrogen-induced lattice displacements with picometer precision in multi-principal-element alloy hydrides. This work demonstrates MEP as a transformative method for directly probing hydrogen atoms in solids, unlocking fundamental understanding of hydrogen's impact on material properties.

Title: Pressure-mediated crystalline g-C3N4 with enhanced spatial charge transport for solar H2 evolution and photocathodic protection of 304 stainless steels
Authors: Xiaochun Gao, Shaoqi Hou, Dawei Su
Abstract: Conjugated polymeric g-C3N4 has emerged as a leading semiconductor for solar-to-chemical energy conversion due to its unique electronic band structure, robust physicochemical stability, and environmental benignity. However, defect engineering-while effective at enhancing visible-light absorption and charge separation-often introduces excessive dangling bonds and lattice disorder, which exacerbate carrier recombination and impair light harvesting. High crystallinity offers a complementary route to improve spatial charge transport, yet strategies that concurrently optimize crystallinity and surface defects remain underexplored. Here we report a pressure-mediated ion thermal synthesis of high-crystalline g-C3N4 (CCN-P) using a NaCl/KCl eutectic salt under elevated pressure. The molten salt facilitates in-plane and cross-plane crystal growth, while applied pressure reduces interlayer spacing and shortens photocarrier pathways. This dual modulation yields CCN-P with balanced surface defects (-CN and -NHx), an electron-trapping resistance (Rtrap) of 11.36 k{\Omega} cm2 and a photocarrier decay rate constant of 0.013 s-1. CCN-P achieves a hydrogen evolution rate of 2168.8 {\mu}mol g-1 h-1 and delivers 78.5% dark photocathodic protection of 304 stainless steel over 7500 s, outperforming bulk and conventionally crystalline g-C3N4. This straightforward pressure-ion thermal approach provides a versatile platform for tailoring crystalline frameworks and defect distributions in polymeric semiconductors for efficient solar energy conversion.

Title: Real-space second Chern number using the kernel polynomial method
Authors: Rui Chen, Bin Zhou
Abstract: We evaluate the real-space second Chern number of four-dimensional Chern insulators using the kernel polynomial method. Our calculations are performed on a four-dimensional system with $30^4$ sites, and the numerical results agree well with theoretical expectations. Moreover, we show that the method is capable of capturing the disorder effects. This is evidenced by the phase diagram obtained for disordered systems, which agrees well with predictions from the self-consistent Born approximation. Furthermore, we extend the method to six dimensions and perform an exploratory real-space calculation of the third Chern number. Although finite-size effects prevent full quantization, the numerical results show qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations. The study represents a step forward in the real-space characterization of higher-dimensional topological phases.

Abstract: Self organized polar textures can occur in ferroelectric materials across multiple length scales, from nanometer scale vortices and skyrmions, to mesoscopic stripe domains, and macroscopic twin patterns, making these phenomena central to condensed matter physics and nanotechnology. Silicon compatible ferroelectrics such as HfO2 and ZrO2 spontaneously form alternating stacks of two dimensional (2D) polar and nonpolar half unit cell layers, effectively confining dipoles to isolated, single atomic plane layers. However, the arrangement of dipoles within each polar plane is generally considered uniform. Here, by utilizing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of an ultrathin ZrO2 film in the plan view orientation, we show that within these irreducibly narrow polar layers, the dipole organization can be strikingly non-uniform, forming atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180 degree domain walls, at most a few unit cells long, alternating between head to head and tail to tail configurations. Head to head and tail to tail walls each adopt completely distinctive interfacial structures and confine the in-plane domains to a sub nm2 footprint, making them one of the smallest domains to be reported in any polar material. This work represents the first experimental observation of antipolar ferroic ordering via strongly charged domain walls, while being nested within the self organized polar nonpolar layering, revealing a novel hierarchical self-organization of polar textures at the atomic scale, and opening new pathways to atomically dense memories and domain wall nanoelectronics in silicon compatible, simple binary oxides.

Title: Stoichiometric and Non-stoichiometric Cesium Potassium Antimonide Photocathodes: Ab-initio Insights into its Properties for Photoemission
Authors: Sandip Aryal, Gaoxue Wang, Enrique R. Batista
Abstract: Alkali-metal antimonides, especially cesium-potassium-antimonide (CsK2Sb), are strong candidates for next-generation photocathodes in linear accelerators due to their low work-function, fast response, high quantum yield, and ability to operate under visible light. In this study, first-principles methods are used to examine the structural, electronic, optical, and surface properties of CsK2Sb relevant to its photoemission performance. Our results for CsK2Sb show strong absorption in the visible range consistent with experimental observations. The computed work-functions for the stable surfaces are significantly lower than the commonly used metallic photocathodes. This material exhibits electron and hole mobilities of 111.86 cm2/Vs and 3.24 cm2/Vs, respectively. Since real materials inherently contain intrinsic defects, we analyze native point defects in CsK2Sb and identified Cs and K vacancies as most likely. These defects introduce mid-gap states, modify the absorption spectrum, and may significantly influence photoemission behavior. This work provides valuable insights into optimizing CsK2Sb for high-efficiency photocathode applications.

Title: Accuracy and Limitations of Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials for Magnetic Systems: A Case Study on Fe-Cr-C
Authors: E.O. Khazieva, N.M. Chtchelkatchev, R.E. Ryltsev
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become the gold standard for atomistic simulations, yet their extension to magnetic materials remains challenging because spin fluctuations must be captured either explicitly or implicitly. We address this problem for the technologically vital Fe-Cr-C system by constructing two deep machine learning potentials in DeePMD realization: one trained on non-magnetic DFT data (DP-NM) and one on spin-polarised DFT data (DP-M). Extensive validation against experiments reveals a striking dichotomy. The dynamic, collective properties, viscosity and melting temperatures are reproduced accurately by DP-NM but are incorrectly estimated by DP-M. Static, local properties, density, and lattice parameters are captured excellently by DP-M, especially in Fe-rich alloys, whereas DP-NM fails. This behaviour is explained by general properties of paramagnetic state: at high temperature, local magnetic moments self-average in space and time, so their explicit treatment is unnecessary for transport properties but essential for equilibrium volumes. Exploiting this insight, we show that a transfer-learning protocol, pre-training on non-magnetic DFT and fine-tuning on a small set of spin-polarised data, reduces the computational cost to develop magnetic MLIPs by more than an order of magnitude. Developing general-purpose potentials that capture static and dynamic behaviors throughout the whole composition space requires proper accounting for temperature-induced spin fluctuations in DFT calculations and correctly incorporating spin degrees of freedom into classical force fields.

Title: Kibble-Zurek mechanism for dissipative discrete time crystals
Authors: Roy D. Jara Jr., Jayson G. Cosme
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) holds for open systems transitioning from a disordered phase to a discrete time crystal (DTC). Specifically, we observe the main signatures of the KZM when the system is quenched into a DTC, which are the characteristic power-law scaling with quench time of the number of spatial defects and the transition delay measured from the time at which the system crosses the critical point. We show analytically that this universal behavior can be traced back to how systems that can be mapped onto a dissipative linear parametric oscillator (DLPO) satisfy the adiabatic-impulse (AI) approximation, evinced by the divergence of the relaxation time of the DLPO near a critical point. We verify our predictions in both the classical and quantum regimes by considering two systems: the Sine-Gordon model, which is a paradigmatic system for emulating classical DTCs; and the open Dicke lattice model, an array of spin-boson systems subjected to quantum fluctuations. For both systems, the DTCs can be tuned from a ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic order by varying the driving frequency, thus allowing us to test the validity of KZM for arbitrary spatiotemporal ordering.

Title: All-Dry Transfer of Graphene Film by Van der Waals Interactions

Abstract: We report a method that uses van der Waals interactions to transfer continuous, high-quality graphene films from Ge(110) to a different substrate held by hexagonal boron nitride carriers in a clean, dry environment. The transferred films are uniform and continuous with low defect density and few charge puddles. The transfer is effective because of the weak interfacial adhesion energy between graphene and Ge. Based on the minimum strain energy required for the isolation of film, the upper limit of the interfacial adhesion energy is estimated to be 23 meV per carbon atom, which makes graphene/Ge(110) the first as-grown graphene film that has an substrate adhesion energy lower than typical van der Waals interactions between layered materials. Our results suggest that graphene on Ge can serve as an ideal material platform to be integrated with other material systems by a clean assembly process.

Title: Step-directed Epitaxy of Uni-directional Hexagonal Boron Nitride on Vicinal Ge(110)
Authors: Ju-Hyun Jung, Chao Zhao, Seong-Jun Yang, Jun-Ho Park, Woo-Ju Lee, Su-Beom Song, Jonghwan Kim, Chan-Cuk Hwang, Seung-Hwa Baek, Feng Ding, Cheol-Joo Kim
Abstract: Insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) films with precisely controlled thickness are ideal dielectric components to modulate various interfaces in electronic devices. To achieve this, high-quality hBN with controlled atomic configurations must be able to form pristine interfaces with various materials in devices. However, previously reported large-scale hBN films with uniform thickness either are polycrystalline or are not suitable for atomically clean assembly via mechanical exfoliation, limiting their applications in device technology. Here, we report the large-scale growth of monolayer single crystalline hBN films on Ge(110) substrates by using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Vicinal Ge(110) substrates are used for the step-directed epitaxial growth of hBN, where Ge atomic steps act as the hBN nucleation sites, guiding the uni-directional alignments of multiple hBN domains. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the optimum hydrogen passivations on both hBN edges and Ge surfaces enable the epitaxial coupling between hBN and the Ge step edges and the single crystallinity of the final hBN films. Using epitaxially grown monolayer hBN films, we fabricate a few hBN films with controlled stacking orders and pristine interfaces through a layer-by-layer assembly process. These films function as high-quality dielectrics to enhance carrier transport in graphene and MoS<sub>2</sub> channels.

Title: Phases of a Bose-Einstein condensate of microwave-shielded dipolar molecules
Authors: Chiara J. Polterauer, Robert E. Zillich
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules can be achieved by shielding loss channels with microwave fields. The microwave coupling can be approximated by effective dipole-dipole interactions with a short-range repulsion. We study properties and stability of these molecular Bose gases with a many-body variational method, the hypernetted-chain Euler-Lagrange method for a wide range of densities and repulsion strengths of the microwave shield. We find a homogeneous gas-like phase which, however, is unstable at low density against density waves: at a critical density, which depends on the repulsion strength, the dipolar fluid undergoes a phase transition to a layer phase. Thus, if the molecular condensate is expanded adiabatically by decreasing the confinement strength, it will spontaneously form layers at the critical density. These quasi-two-dimensional layers can be self-bound, hence form two-dimensional liquids. By varying the microwave shield, the predicted equilibrium densities span more than an order of magnitude.

Title: A Riemann-Hilbert Approach to Slavnov Overlaps in the Lieb-Liniger model
Authors: Eldad Bettelheim
Abstract: We provide a method to compute Slavnov overlaps in the Lieb-Liniger model using the steepest descent method of the Riemann-Hilbert problem. To do so, we employ the Matsuo-Kostov Representation of the Slavnov overlaps to write an integral equation for the respective resolvent, and then represent this equation as a Riemann-Hilbert problem. To demonstrate the validity and applicability of the method by computing the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in the $c\to\infty$ limit, corresponding to free-fermion.

Title: Multifractality and statistical localization in the sparse Barrat-Mézard trap model
Authors: Diego Tapias, Peter Sollich
Abstract: We study within a paradigmatic model for glassy dynamics, the Barrat-Mézard trap model, the effect of a nontrivial network structure in the connectivity among traps. Sparseness of this network has recently been shown to lead to divergences in the bulk of the spectrum of the associated master operator [1, 2]. We analyse here specifically the properties of the relaxation modes that contribute to these spectral divergences. We characterize the statistics of the corresponding wavefunctions and demonstrate that they are localized with multifractal properties. The localization patterns are unrelated to the spatial (network) topology, however, and instead fall within the recently introduced class of statistical localization phenomena [3]. To rationalize these results we develop an effective model that successfully explains both the spectral divergences and the power law tails in the wavefunction entries, and provides a clear physical picture of why the localization is statistical rather than spatial.

Title: Highly efficient coherent amplification of zero-field spin waves in YIG nano-waveguides
Authors: K. O. Nikolaev, S. R. Lake, B. Das Mohapatra, G. Schmidt, S. O. Demokritov, V. E. Demidov
Abstract: Transmission and processing of information at the nanoscale using spin waves and their quanta - magnons, offers numerous advantages and opportunities that make it a promising next-generation technology for integrated electronics. The main challenges that still need to be addressed to ensure high competitiveness of magnonic devices include finding ways to efficiently amplify spin waves in nanostructures and developing nanocircuits that can operate without the need for an external bias magnetic field. Here we demonstrate how these two challenges can be solved using nano-waveguides fabricated from a low-loss magnetic insulator. We show that by using local parametric pumping with a power of only a few milliwatts, one can achieve coherent amplification of spin-wave pulses by more than two orders of magnitude at zero bias magnetic field. Our results provide a simple solution to problems that have long prevented the implementation of efficient integrated magnonic circuits.

Title: Sensing magnonic quantum superpositions using a bosonic mode as the probe
Authors: Bashab Dey, Sonu Verma, Mathias Weiler, Akashdeep Kamra
Abstract: Sensing quantum superpositions of a magnonic mode has been accomplished using a superconducting qubit by realizing an effective dispersive interaction between the two systems. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that a seemingly classical bosonic mode can be utilized as a probe for sensing quantum superpositions of a magnon mode, while outperforming a qubit in various regards as the sensor. Considering another magnon mode in an antiferromagnet as the probe mode, we delineate the required dispersive coupling emerging directly from antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. When a phonon is used as the probe mode, we derive the effective dispersive coupling emerging from the lowest-order nonlinear magnon-phonon interactions. Our two considered examples provide the general design principles for identifying and utilizing a bosonic probe mode for sensing quantum superpositions in a physical platform of interest.

Title: Entanglement across scales: Quantics tensor trains as a natural framework for renormalization
Authors: Stefan Rohshap, Jheng-Wei Li, Alena Lorenz, Serap Hasil, Karsten Held, Anna Kauch, Markus Wallerberger
Abstract: Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively, the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the information exchange between different length scales, has received far less attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping, where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.

Title: Magnetoelectric coupling and its impact on the multicaloric effect
Authors: Kentaro Ino, Keisuke Matsuura, Tetsuya Nomoto, Takashi Kurumaji, Yoshinori Tokura, Fumitaka Kagawa
Abstract: The multicaloric effect, which represents the reversible entropy change that occurs when both external magnetic and electric fields are applied, is an interesting phenomenon characteristic to multiferroics. Targeting the multicaloric effect in the typical multiferroic (Fe$_{0.95}$Zn$_{0.05}$)$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$, we experimentally evaluate the isothermal entropy change due to a magnetoelectric cross-correlation. A pronounced cross-correlation-derived isothermal entropy change is found at the magnetic ordering temperature. By exploring the literature, we suggest that a magnetic phase transition may tend to involve a considerably larger cross-correlation-derived entropy change than that derived from the linear magnetoelectric effect.

Title: The Josephson effect in Fibonacci superconductors
Authors: Ignacio Sardinero, Jorge Cayao, Keiji Yada, Yukio Tanaka, Pablo Burset
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the Josephson effect between two proximized Fibonacci quasicrystals. A quasiperiodic modulation of the chemical potential on a superconducting substrate induces topological gaps and edge modes with energies above the superconducting gap. We reveal that these edge modes develop superconducting correlations which significantly impact the Josephson current, and we term them Fibonacci-Andreev bound states. Notably, the contribution from these edge modes can be controlled by the Fibonacci sequence arrangement, known as phason angle, and can dominate the Josephson effect over the conventional subgap Andreev bound states in short junctions. The interplay between the Josephson effect and nontrivial edge modes in quasiperiodic systems presents new opportunities for exploring exotic superconducting phenomena in quasicrystals.

Title: $1/f^{3/2}$ Power Spectrum at the Phonon Bottleneck
Authors: Steven T. Bramwell
Abstract: The common observation of a `$1/f^\alpha$' power spectrum with $\alpha<2$ constitutes one of the enduring mysteries of condensed matter physics. Here it is shown that a $1/f^{\alpha}$ power spectrum, with $\alpha = 3/2$, can arise when an ensemble of two--level systems is coupled to a heat bath by means of a system of Bosonic quasiparticles. The model considered is the classic model of Faughnan and Strandberg of the phonon bottleneck, and the anomalous relaxation is associated with an approximate non-equilibrium steady state of the phonons maintained by slow spin relaxation. It is shown that a frequency-dependent susceptibility can be defined in the steady state and that the prediction $\alpha=3/2$, or the equivalent stretched exponential relaxation with exponent $\beta = 2-\alpha = 1/2$, is consistent with existing experimental data. These results give an insight into the origins of anomalous relaxation in condensed matter and the practical behaviour of two-level systems.

Title: Phase transitions in voting simulated by an intelligent Ising model
Authors: Guanyu Xu, Jiahang Chen, Xin Zhou, Yanting Wang
Abstract: Voting is an important social activity for expressing public opinions. By conceptually considering a group of voting agents to be intelligent matter, the impact of real-time information on voting results is quantitatively studied by an intelligent Ising model, which is formed by adding nonlinear instantaneous feedback of the overall magnetization to the conventional Ising model. In the new model, the interaction strength becomes a variable depending on the total magnetization rather than a constant, which mimics the scenario that the decision of an individual during vote influenced by the dynamically changing polling result during the election process. Our analytical derivations along with Mote Carlo simulations reveal that, with a positive feedback, the intelligent Ising model exhibits phase transitions at any finite temperatures, a feature lacked in the conventional one-dimensional Ising model. In all dimensions, by varying the feedback strength, the system changes from going through a second-order phase transition to going through a first-order phase transition with increasing temperature, and the two types of phase transitions are connected by a tricritical point. This study on the one hand demonstrates that the intelligent matter with a nonlinear adaptive interaction can exhibit qualitatively different phase behaviors from conventional matter, and on the other hand shows that, during voting, even unbiased feedback may possibly induce spontaneous symmetry breaking, leading to a biased outcome where one side of the vote becomes favored.

Title: Machine Learning Band Gap Predictions: Linking Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW and LDA-Derived Partial Density of States
Authors: Shota Tankano, Takao Kotani, Masao Obata, Kazunori Sato, Harutaka Saito, Tatsuki Oda
Abstract: Accurately calculating band gaps for given crystal structures is highly desirable. However, conventional first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) within the local density approximation (LDA) fail to predict band gaps accurately. To address this issue, the quasi-particle self-consistent GW (QSGW) method is often employed as it is one of the most reliable theoretical approaches for predicting band gaps. Despite its accuracy, QSGW requires significant computational resources. To overcome this limitation, we propose combining QSGW with machine learning. In this study, we applied QSGW to 1,516 materials from the Materials Project [this https URL] and used machine learning to predict QSGW band gaps as a function of the partial density of states (PDOS) in LDA. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms linear regression approaches with linearly-independent descriptor generation [this https URL]. This model is a prototype for predicting material properties based on PDOS.

Title: Stabilization of the collinear plateau phase by thermal fluctuations in the disordered triangular lattice antiferromagnet Rb$_{(1-x)}$K$_{x}$Fe(MoO$_4$)$_2$
Authors: V.N. Glazkov, I.A. Krastilevskiy
Abstract: The triangular lattice antiferromagnet RbFe(MoO$_4$)$_2$ orders antiferromagnetically in a planar 120$^\circ$-structure below $T_\textrm{N}\approx 4$ K. A striking feature of RbFe(MoO$_4$)$_2$ magnetic phase diagram is the presence of collinear ``1/3-plateau'' magnetic phase, which is stabilized by thermal and quantum fluctuations at magnetization $M\approx \frac{1}{3} M_\textrm{sat}$. Static disorder caused by impurities is predicted to act against the effect of fluctuations and to suppress collinear plateau phase (Maryasin and Zhitomirsky, PRL 111, 247201 (2013)). Balance between ``dynamic'' thermal and quantum fluctuations and ``static'' impurity-induced disorder is temperature-sensitive, which allows thermal fluctuations to take over the effect of static disorder and leads to the revival of the fluctuation-stabilized ``1/3-plateau'' phase on heating. Here we present experimental results directly confirming this prediction and demonstrating re-establishment of the plateau-like phase in the diluted Rb$_{(1-x)}$K$_{x}$Fe(MoO$_4$)$_2$ sample at moderate dilution level $x=15$\% on heating as the effect of thermal fluctuations increases.

Title: Incommensurate magnetic order arising from frustrated interchain interactions in the spin-1/2 chain compound AgCuVO$_4$
Authors: A. Hromov, A. Zorko, M. Gomilšek, I. Puente Orench, L. Keller, T. Shiroka, A. Prokofiev, M. Pregelj
Abstract: Quantum spin chains with competing interactions offer a platform where low dimensionality and frustration--both acting to suppress magnetic order--intersect. We studied magnetic ordering in the spin-1/2 chain compound AgCuVO$_4$ using muon spin spectroscopy and neutron diffraction. Long-range magnetic order emerges at $T_N = 2.0(1)$ K, which is $\sim$1/200 of the dominant intrachain coupling $J$ and $\sim$1/15 of the interchain interactions. The collinear incommensurate amplitude-modulated magnetic structure features a reduced ordered moment of 0.13(2) $\mu_\mathrm{B}$, confined to the $ab$ plane and modulated along the $c$ axis--perpendicular to the spin chains--indicating frustrated interchain couplings. The low $T_N$, small moment, and incommensurate order highlight strong frustration, positioning AgCuVO$_4$ as a model system for exploring frustration in quantum spin chains.

Title: Micromechanics of compressive and tensile forces in partially-bonded granular materials
Authors: Abrar Naseer, Karen E. Daniels, Tejas G. Murthy
Abstract: In granular media, the presence of even small amounts of interparticle cohesion manifests as an increase in the bulk strength and stiffness, effects that are typically associated with an increase in the average number of constraints per particle. By performing an ensemble of isotropic compression experiments, all starting from the same initial particle configuration but with varying fraction of bonded particles, we use photoelastic force measurements to identify the causes of this phenomenon at the particle-scale and meso-scale. As a function of the percentage of bonded particles, we measure a small decrease in the critical packing fraction at which jamming occurs. Above jamming, the local pressure increases predominantly for the bonded particles, measured relative to the unbonded case, through approximately equal contributions of both tensile and compressive forces. Histograms of the magnitude of the interparticle forces become broader for systems with more bonded particles. We measure both pressure and coordination number as a function of distance from a bonded dimer, both of which are locally enhanced for nearest neighbors, indicating that dimers appear to act as areas of concentrated force and connectivity that improve rigidity.

Title: Dirac points annihilation and its obstruction characterized by Euler number and quaternionic charges in kagome lattice
Authors: M. Finck, D. Solnyshkov, J. Dubois, G. Malpuech
Abstract: We investigate the topological phenomenon of Dirac point annihilation and its obstruction in three-band, real symmetric Hamiltonians with time-reversal symmetry, and their relation to the Euler number, a well-known topological invariant. For this purpose, we study the example of the kagome lattice using a simple tight-binding model. By tuning the parameters of the lattice continuously, we illustrate situations where two Dirac points are able to annihilate, and others, where this annihilation is topologically obstructed. For a system with no gaps between the three bands, like in the kagome lattice, the Euler number of two bands is ill-defined on the whole Brillouin zone, which requires the introduction of the so-called ``patch" Euler number on a subregion without additional degeneracies coming from the third band. A non-zero patch Euler number means that the annihilation of the Dirac points is impossible. We also illustrate another point of view, using homotopy theory, associating the Dirac points with quaternionic charges. We prove that the non-abelian braiding of the Dirac points in k-space conjugates their quaternionic charge and explains the possible obstruction to the annihilation of Dirac points. Finally, we show that the proposed deformation of the kagome lattice can be achieved in realistic photonic systems.

Title: Shape-dependent direction reversal in anisotropic catalytic microswimmers
Authors: Solenn Riedel, Mengshi Wei, Daniela J. Kraft
Abstract: The propulsion direction of active particles is a key feature in self-propelled systems and depends on the propulsion mechanism and environmental conditions. Here, using 3D micro-printed catalytically active particles, we experimentally show that the propulsion direction can change with increasing fuel concentration when the active particle possesses an anisotropic shape. We find that discs, tori, and bent rods reverse their direction of motion with increasing hydrogen peroxide concentration--moving with their inert side forward at low concentrations and with their catalytic side forward at high concentrations. In contrast, spheres and straight rods do not exhibit this reversal. We observe that direction reversal is independent of the base material composition of the swimmer and its size, and only occurs for anisotropic particles where, due to their elongated shape, the location of the solute concentration maximum is unstable and can be shifted by substrate-induced confinements. Our measurements suggest that in addition a change in the platinum-catalyzed reaction of hydrogen peroxide occurs, to which particles with elongated shapes that induce sufficient confinement are more sensitive.

Title: Eliminating leading and subleading corrections to scaling in the three-dimensional XY universality class
Authors: Martin Hasenbusch
Abstract: We study the $(q+1)$-state clock model on the simple cubic lattice by using Monte Carlo simulations. In addition to the nearest neighbor coupling we consider a next-to-next-to-nearest neighbor coupling. For a certain range of the parameters, the phase transition of the model shares the XY universality class. Leading corrections to scaling are studied by using finite size scaling of dimensionless quantities, such as the Binder cumulant $U_4$. The spatial unisotropy, which causes subleading corrections, is studied by computing the exponential correlation length $\xi_{exp}$ in the high temperature phase for different directions. In the case of the $q$-state clock model it turns out that by tuning the ratio of the two coupling constants, we can eliminate either leading or subleading corrections to scaling. These points on the critical line are close to each other. Hence in the improved model, where leading corrections to scaling vanish, also subleading corrections are small. By using a finite size scaling analysis of our high statistics data we obtain $\eta=0.03816(2)$ and $y_t =1/\nu=1.48872(5)$ as estimates of the critical exponents.

Title: Controlling Topological Defects in Polar Fluids via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Abhinav Singh, Petros Koumoutsakos
Abstract: Topological defects in active polar fluids exhibit complex dynamics driven by internally generated stresses, reflecting the deep interplay between topology, flow, and non-equilibrium hydrodynamics. Feedback control offers a powerful means to guide such systems, enabling transitions between dynamic states. We investigated closed-loop steering of integer-charged defects in a confined active fluid by modulating the spatial profile of activity. Using a continuum hydrodynamic model, we show that localized control of active stress induces flow fields that can reposition and direct defects along prescribed trajectories by exploiting non-linear couplings in the system. A reinforcement learning framework is used to discover effective control strategies that produce robust defect transport across both trained and novel trajectories. The results highlight how AI agents can learn the underlying dynamics and spatially structure activity to manipulate topological excitations, offering insights into the controllability of active matter and the design of adaptive, self-organized materials.

Title: Fermi liquid and isotropic superconductivity of Hund scenario for bilayer nickelates
Authors: Jiangfan Wang, Yi-feng Yang
Abstract: Recent experiments on bulk and thin film bilayer nickelate high-$T_c$ superconductors urge for clarification of their pairing mechanism. Debates exist on whether the hybridization or the Hund's coupling between the nickel $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals plays a primary role in driving the superconductivity. Here, we study the Hund scenario and make comparisons with the hybridization scenario using the same dynamic Schwinger boson approach. Our calculations reveal several key features of the Hund-driven superconductivity, including an isotropic $s$-wave gap, a lower maximum $T_c$, and Fermi liquid normal states, that differ from the hybridization-driven mechanism. We attribute these differences to their distinct low-energy dynamics. Comparison with recent experiments suggests that the Hund scenario alone is not enough to explain the bilayer nickelate superconductivity in both bulk and thin films.

Title: Stability and Symmetry-Assured Crystal Structure Generation for Inverse Design of Photocatalysts in Water Splitting
Authors: Zhilong Song, Chongyi Ling, Qiang Li, Qionghua Zhou, Jinlan Wang
Abstract: Generative models are revolutionizing materials discovery by enabling inverse design-direct generation of structures from desired properties. However, existing approaches often struggle to ensure inherent stability and symmetry while precisely generating structures with target compositions, space groups, and lattices without fine-tuning. Here, we present SSAGEN (Stability and Symmetry-Assured GENerative framework), which overcomes these limitations by decoupling structure generation into two distinct stages: crystal information (lattice, composition, and space group) generation and coordinate optimization. SSAGEN first generates diverse yet physically plausible crystal information, then derives stable and metastable atomic positions through universal machine learning potentials, combined global and local optimization with symmetry and Wyckoff position constraints, and dynamically refined search spaces. Compared to prior generative models such as CDVAE, SSAGEN improves the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of generated structures by 148% and 180%, respectively, while inherently satisfying target compositions, space groups, and lattices. Applied to photocatalytic water splitting (PWS), SSAGEN generates 200,000 structures-81.2% novel-with 3,318 meeting all stability and band gap criteria. Density functional theory (DFT) validation confirms 95.6% structures satisfy PWS requirements, with 24 optimal candidates identified through comprehensive screening based on electronic structure, thermodynamic, kinetic, and aqueous stability criteria. SSAGEN not only precisely generates materials with desired crystal information but also ensures inherent stability and symmetry, establishing a new paradigm for targeted inverse design of functional materials.

Title: Human-AI Synergy in Adaptive Active Learning for Continuous Lithium Carbonate Crystallization Optimization
Authors: Shayan S. Mousavi Masouleh, Corey A. Sanz, Ryan P. Jansonius, Cara Cronin, Jason E. Hein, Jason Hattrick-Simpers
Abstract: As demand for high-purity lithium surges with the growth of the electric vehicle (EV) industry, cost-effective extraction from lower-grade North American sources like the Smackover Formation is critical. These resources, unlike high-purity South American brines, require innovative purification techniques to be economically viable. Continuous crystallization is a promising method for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is challenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the continuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise with data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium extraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's ability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's tolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a few hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm. This breakthrough makes the exploitation of low-grade, impurity-rich lithium resources feasible, potentially reducing the need for extensive pre-refinement processes. By leveraging artificial intelligence, we have refined operational parameters and demonstrated that lower-grade materials can be used without sacrificing product quality. This advancement is a significant step towards economically harnessing North America's vast lithium reserves, such as those in the Smackover Formation, and enhancing the sustainability of the global lithium supply chain.

Title: Quantum Droplets of Light in Semiconductor Microcavities
Authors: Matteo Caldara, Olivier Bleu, Francesca Maria Marchetti, Jesper Levinsen, Meera M. Parish
Abstract: Quantum droplets are dilute self-bound configurations of bosons that result from the balance between a mean-field attraction and a repulsion induced by quantum fluctuations. Such droplets have been successfully realized in cold atomic gases and represent a signature of their quantum nature. Here, we predict the existence of a similar droplet phase in a solid-state system, involving polaritons formed from the strong coupling between excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) and photons in a semiconductor microcavity. We consider a spin mixture of exciton-polaritons near a biexciton Feshbach resonance, which allows one to tune the interspecies interactions to be attractive and comparable in magnitude to the intraspecies repulsion. We find that self-bound quantum droplets are achievable for realistic parameters in atomically thin semiconductors, and that they can be detected via their excitation spectrum and spatial profile. This exotic phase could potentially lead to polariton condensation at lower thresholds and it opens an alternative avenue to achieve the long-sought quantum polaritonic regime.

Title: Atomically clean free-standing two-dimensional materials through heating in ultra-high vacuum
Authors: Philipp Irschik, David Lamprecht, Shrirang Chokappa, Clemens Mangler, Carsten Speckmann, Thuy An Bui, Manuel Längle, Lado Filipovic, Jani Kotakoski
Abstract: Surface contamination not only influences but in some cases even dominates the measured properties of two-dimensional materials. Although different cleaning methods are often used for contamination removal, commonly used spectroscopic cleanliness assessment methods can leave the level of achieved cleanliness ambiguous. Despite two decades of research on 2D materials, the true cleanliness of the used samples is often left open to interpretation. In this work, free-standing monolayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride are annealed at different temperatures in a custom-built ultra-high vacuum heating chamber, connected to a scanning transmission electron microscope via a vacuum transfer line, enabling atomically resolved cleanliness characterization as a function of annealing temperature, while eliminating the introduction of airborne contamination during sample transport. While annealing at 200 °C already reduces contamination significantly, it is not until 400 °C or higher, where over 90% of the free-standing monolayer areas are atomically clean. At this point, further contamination removal is mainly limited by defects in the material and metal contamination introduced during the sample transfer or growth. The achieved large, atomically clean areas can then be used for further nanoscale engineering steps or device processing, facilitating interaction with the material rather than contamination.

Title: Time-energy tradeoff in stochastic resetting using optimal control
Authors: Rémi Goerlich, Kristian Stølevik Olsen, Hartmut Löwen, Yael Roichman
Abstract: Stochastic resetting is a driving mechanism that is known to minimize the first passage time to reach a target, at the cost of energy expenditure. The choice of the physical implementation of each resetting event determines the tradeoff between the acceleration of the search process and its energetic cost. Here, we present an optimal transport protocol that balances the duration and the energetic cost of each resetting event. This protocol drives a harmonically trapped Brownian particle between two equilibrium states within a finite time and with minimal energetic cost. An explicit comparison with other types of finite-time protocols further shows its specific thermodynamic properties. Its cost is both a lower bound on the cost of unoptimized shortcut protocols and an upper bound on the cost of optimal protocols which do not ensure final equilibrium. When applying the optimal transport protocol to implement stochastic resetting, a single lower time-energy bound is reached: this protocol allows to reach the best tradeoff between energetic cost and search time.

Title: Measurement and Qualitative Explanation of Decay Lengths of Attractive and Repulsive Forces between Natural and Artificial Atoms
Authors: Marco Weiss, Fabian Stilp, Max Reinhart, Franz J. Giessibl
Abstract: Artificial atoms, such as quantum corrals, offer an excellent platform to study fundamental interactions between localized quantum states and nanoscale probes. We performed atomic force microscopy measurements inside square quantum corrals on Cu(111) using CO- and metal-terminated tips. Using chemically unreactive CO-terminated tips repulsive Pauli forces can be probed, while metallic tips are attracted to the localized quantum states due to chemical bonding. We found distinct exponential decay constants of 46 pm for the repulsive and 66 pm for the attractive forces. Attractive and repulsive interactions between two natural atoms show significantly shorter decay lengths. While natural atoms feature states with a broad range of decay lengths, including very short ones from deeply bound states, quantum corrals are lacking such deeply bound and highly localized states, resulting in longer decay lengths. These results offer a new route to understand and design atomic-scale interactions in low-dimensional quantum structures and devices.

Title: The gauge theory dual of the bilayer XY model with second order Josephson coupling
Authors: Pye Ton How, Sungkit Yip
Abstract: We formulate a duality transformation for a bilayer XY model where the layers are coupled by second order Josephson effect, which favors inter-layer phase difference of either $0$ or $\pi$. The model may represent a bilayer superconductor or a spin-1 ferromagnetic Bose gas in the easy-plane limit. The second order Josephson term is mapped to a U(1) gauge field, known to be trivially confining in two dimensions, and we argue that a Coulomb-gas analysis is not applicable to the dual theory. Instead, we appeal to the vast knowledge of gauge theory and infer that the only phase transition out of low-temperature ordered phase is an Ising transition driven by condensation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ domain wall loops. The domain wall loops can be seen as a surviving vestige of single-layer vortex-anti-vortex pair, heavily deformed by the second order Josephson coupling. A theoretical or computational method that concentrates on point defects would most likely miss out on these excitations and reach erroneous results. Our dual theory offers a clear, intuitive picture of how the second order Josephson coupling induces confinement of vortices and drastically changes the physics.

Title: From weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the frustrated quantum spin-Peierls chain
Authors: Pyeongjae Park, Bo Xiao, Karolina Górnicka, Andrew F. May, Jiaqiang Yan, Ryoichi Kajimoto, Mitsutaka Nakamura, Matthew B. Stone, Gábor B. Halász, Andrew D. Christianson
Abstract: Fractionalized quasiparticles and their confinement into emergent bound states lie at the heart of modern quantum magnetism. While the evolution into magnonic bound states has been well characterized, experimental insight into the analogous transition to triplons remains limited. Here, using high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and state-of-the-art spin dynamics simulations, we uncover the transformation from weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3. Quantitative comparisons between the measured spectra and tensor network simulations reveal substantial next-nearest-neighbor frustration and weak external dimerization, placing the system deep within the spontaneously dimerized regime and near the exactly solvable Majumdar-Ghosh point. We further show an energy- and temperature-dependent evolution between two contrasting quasiparticle regimes: deconfined spinons with markedly suppressed interactions by frustration, and coherent triplonic bound states with no observable spinon degrees of freedom. Remarkably, triplon character persists into the two-particle regime, forming a structured two-triplon continuum with a spectral feature associated with a van Hove singularity at its lower boundary. These findings challenge the conventional view that robust triplons require strong external dimerization and demonstrate how the interplay between frustration and dimerization can reshape fractionalization and confinement.

Title: Solute Segregation Activates Unconventional Grain Boundary Disconnections

Abstract: Disconnections, now recognized as key mediators of grain boundary (GB) kinetics in polycrystals, have traditionally been associated with thermal or mechanical activation. Here, using atomistic simulations across multiple binary alloys (Al-Ni, Al-Fe, etc.), we reveal a distinct disconnection formation mechanism solely activated by interstitial solute segregation. This process exhibits a zero-nucleation energy barrier, contrasting sharply with conventional disconnection nucleation. We identify two segregation-induced disconnection types: (i) annihilable disconnections that promote GB migration and annihilate with continued segregation, and (ii) permanent disconnections with stable dipoles that resist shear, inducing GB amorphization and sliding rather than conventional shear-coupled motion. The permanent disconnections generate localized stress fields that further drive solute accumulation and, at higher concentrations, facilitate precipitation. These disconnections, unprecedented in pure systems, follow unique nucleation pathways as confirmed by dichromatic pattern analysis and persist across diverse crystal structures. This work establishes solute segregation as a route for barrier-free disconnection formation, fundamentally altering our understanding of GB kinetics in alloys.

Title: Equivariant machine learning of Electric Field Gradients -- Predicting the quadrupolar coupling constant in the MAPbI$_3$ phase transition
Authors: Bernhard Schmiedmayer, J.W. Wolffs (Jop), Gilles A. de Wijs, Arno P.M. Kentgens, Jonathan Lahnsteiner, Georg Kresse
Abstract: We present a strategy combining machine learning and first-principles calculations to achieve highly accurate nuclear quadrupolar coupling constant predictions. Our approach employs two distinct machine-learning frameworks: a machine-learned force field to generate molecular dynamics trajectories and a second model for electric field gradients that preserves rotational and translational symmetries. By incorporating thermostat-driven molecular dynamics sampling, we enable the prediction of quadrupolar coupling constants in highly disordered materials at finite temperatures. We validate our method by predicting the tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition temperature of the organic-inorganic halide perovskite MAPbI$_3$, obtaining results that closely match experimental data.

Title: Gradient-based grand canonical optimization enabled by graph neural networks with fractional atomic existence
Authors: Mads-Peter Verner Christiansen, Bjørk Hammer
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials have become an indispensable tool for materials science, enabling the study of larger systems and longer timescales. State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence. Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and document its capabilities for a Cu(110) surface oxide.

Title: Interplay of non-Hermitian skin effect and electronic correlations in the non-Hermitian Hubbard model via Real-space dynamical mean field theory
Authors: Chakradhar Rangi, Juana Moreno, Ka-Ming Tam
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems, characterized by their ability to model open systems with gain and loss, have unveiled striking phenomena such as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where eigenstates localize at boundaries under open boundary conditions. While extensively studied in non-interacting systems, the interplay between NHSE and strong electron correlations remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the non-Hermitian Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping, employing real-space dynamical mean-field theory (R-DMFT), a novel extension to such non-Hermitian correlated models-to capture both local correlations and spatial inhomogeneities. By analyzing the end-to-end Green's function as probes of directional amplification, we demonstrate that strong correlations can suppress the skin effect, leading to a crossover from boundary-dominated to correlation-driven dynamics. Our systematic study reveals that correlations dominate at small to intermediate strength of asymmetric hopping, inducing exponential decay in the end-to-end Green's function, but higher strength of asymmetric hopping can restore amplification even at strong interaction. These results illuminate the tunable interplay between correlations and non-Hermitian physics, suggesting avenues for engineering non-reciprocal transport in correlated open quantum systems.

Title: Correspondence principle, dissipation, and Ginibre ensemble
Authors: David Villaseñor, Hua Yan, Matic Orel, Marko Robnik
Abstract: The correspondence between quantum and classical behavior has been essential since the advent of quantum mechanics. This principle serves as a cornerstone for understanding quantum chaos, which has garnered increased attention due to its strong impact in various theoretical and experimental fields. When dissipation is considered, quantum chaos takes concepts from isolated quantum chaos to link classical chaotic motion with spectral correlations of Ginibre ensembles. This correspondence was first identified in periodically kicked systems with damping, but it has been shown to break down in dissipative atom-photon systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. In this contribution, we revisit the original kicked model and perform a systematic exploration across a broad parameter space, reaching a genuine semiclassical limit. Our results demonstrate that the correspondence principle, as defined through this spectral connection, fails even in this prototypical system. These findings provide conclusive evidence that Ginibre spectral correlations are neither a robust nor a universal diagnostic of dissipative quantum chaos.

Title: Average-computation benchmarking for local expectation values in digital quantum devices
Authors: Flavio Baccari, Pavel Kos, Georgios Styliaris
Abstract: As quantum devices progress towards a quantum advantage regime, they become harder to benchmark. A particularly relevant challenge is to assess the quality of the whole computation, beyond testing the performance of each single operation. Here we introduce a scheme for this task that combines the target computation with variants of it, which, when averaged, allow for classically solvable correlation functions. Importantly, the variants exactly preserve the circuit architecture and depth, without simplifying the gates into a classically-simulable set. The method is based on replacing each gate by an ensemble of similar gates, which when averaged together form space-time channels [P. Kos and G. Styliaris, Quantum 7, 1020 (2023)]. We introduce explicit constructions for ensembles producing such channels, all applicable to arbitrary brickwork circuits, and provide a general recipe to find new ones through semidefinite programming. The resulting average computation retains important information about the original circuit and is able to detect noise beyond a Clifford benchmarking regime. Moreover, we provide evidence that estimating average-computation expectation values requires running only a limited number of different circuit realizations.

Title: Chaotic signatures in free field theory
Authors: Dmitry S. Ageev, Vasilii V. Pushkarev
Abstract: We consider free scalar relativistic field theory in finite volume taken out-of-equilibrium and show how the chaotic behavior emerges in such a quantum system for particular quench protocols. Namely, we show that for the operator local quench, correlation functions exhibit statistical properties quite close to that of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. Moreover, we show that the spectral form factor for the excited state after the local quench reveals a dip-ramp-plateau structure which also supports our conjecture. Finally, we show that the spectral form factor computed directly from the spectrum clearly demonstrates this structure as well.

Title: Fully quantum description of the four-wave mixing contribution to correlated Stokes-anti-Stokes scattering
Authors: Raul Corrêa, Marcelo F. Santos, Carlos H. Monken, Ado Jorio
Abstract: The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes-anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs, making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that the correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation, corresponding to a four-wave mixing phenomenon. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.

Title: Digital Twin Simulations Toolbox of the Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond
Authors: Lucas Tsunaki, Anmol Singh, Sergei Trofimov, Boris Naydenov
Abstract: Color centers defects in solids, and particularly the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, are crucial physical platforms for quantum technology applications. Therefore, a precise and rigorous numerical modeling of the NV system is indispensable for the continued advancement of the field. Within this context, this work develops a Python software for simulating the NV spin dynamics in pulsed sequences under general experimental conditions, i.e. a digital twin. The library accounts for electromagnetic pulses and other environmental inputs, which are used to solve the system's time-evolution dynamics, resulting in a physical output in the form of a quantum mechanical observable given by the fluorescence. The simulations framework is based on a non-perturbative time-dependent Hamiltonian model, solved in the laboratory frame. Whereby eliminating oversimplifications such as the assumption of instantaneous $\delta$-pulses and rotating wave approximations, our simulations reveal subtle dynamics from the realistic pulse constraints that impact quantum systems. Three use-case examples illustrate the use of the software and validate it by comparing the simulation results with well-established experimental works, relevant to the fields of quantum computing (two-qubit conditional logic gates), sensing (noise resilient dynamical decoupling sequences between NV and couples spins) and networks (teleportation of a quantum state between entangled NVs). Overall, this digital twin delivers a robust and detailed numerical modeling of the NV spin dynamics, with simple and accessible usability, for an extensive application range.

Title: Programmable Exploration of Magnetic States in Lieb-Kagome Interpolated Lattices
Authors: Alejandro Lopez-Bezanilla, Pavel A. Dub, Avadh Saxena
Abstract: We investigate a hybrid modeling framework in which a quantum annealer is used to simulate magnetic interactions in molecular qubit lattices inspired by experimentally realizable systems. Using phthalocyanine assemblies as a structurally constrained prototype, we model a continuous deformation from a Lieb to a kagome lattice, revealing frustration-driven disorder and magnetic field-induced reordering in the spin structure. The annealer provides access to observables such as the static structure factor and magnetization over a wide parameter space, enabling the characterization of magnetic arrangements beyond the reach of current molecular architectures. This surrogate modeling approach supports a feedback loop between experiment and programmable quantum hardware, offering a pathway to explore and iteratively design tunable magnetic states in synthetic quantum materials. The synthetic design, structural characterization, and quantum simulation framework established here defines a modular and scalable paradigm for probing the limits of engineered quantum matter across chemistry, condensed matter, and quantum information science.

Title: Liquid crystal based tailoring of strong coupling in \ch{WS2} metasurfaces: towards reconfigurable quantum photonics
Authors: Anu Koviloor Manian, Jayasri Dontabhaktuni
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions in 2D materials have garnered significant interest for their potential in nonlinear optics and quantum photonics. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), with their robust excitonic responses, serve as promising materials for exploring these interactions. Importantly, tailoring such strong coupling giving rise to tunable quantum and non-linear emissions are under explored. In this study, we propose a novel approach that employs liquid crystals (LCs) as a tunable medium to modulate the strong coupling between TMDC excitons and photonic modes and hence gives rise to tunable quantum emissions. LCs offer high birefringence and anisotropic optical properties, which can be dynamically tuned using external stimuli such as electric fields or temperature variations. By embedding TMDCs within an LC environment and coupling them to photonic quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC), we demonstrate precise control over the exciton-photon interactions. The orientation of the LCs, governed by applied external fields, directly influences the coupling strength, enabling real-time modulation of exciton-polariton states and Rabi-splitting. Our system exhibits Rabi splitting energy of 182.5 MeV in air, and 139, 153.7, and 131 meV under different LC orientations. Additionally second order autocorrelation function calculated at zero delay yields \( g^{(2)}(0) = 0.89 \), demonstrating photon anti-bunching, confirming the quantum nature of emission. Our findings establish a versatile platform where TMDCs and LCs synergistically enable electrically controllable strong coupling, offering a scalable and responsive architecture for next-generation quantum photonic devices.

Title: Cosmic-ray transport in inhomogeneous media
Authors: Robert J. Ewart, Patrick Reichherzer, Shuzhe Ren, Stephen Majeski, Francesco Mori, Michael L. Nastac, Archie F. A. Bott, Matthew W. Kunz, Alexander A. Schekochihin
Abstract: A theory of cosmic-ray transport in multi-phase diffusive media is developed, with the specific application to cases in which the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient has large spatial fluctuations that may be inherently multi-scale. We demonstrate that the resulting transport of cosmic rays is diffusive in the long-time limit, with an average diffusion coefficient equal to the harmonic mean of the spatially varying diffusion coefficient. Thus, cosmic-ray transport is dominated by areas of low diffusion even if these areas occupy a relatively small, but not infinitesimal, fraction of the volume. On intermediate time scales, the cosmic rays experience transient effective sub-diffusion, as a result of low-diffusion regions interrupting long flights through high-diffusion regions. In the simplified case of a two-phase medium, we show that the extent and extremity of the sub-diffusivity of cosmic-ray transport is controlled by the spectral exponent of the distribution of patch sizes of each of the phases. We finally show that, despite strongly influencing the confinement times, the multi-phase medium is only capable of altering the energy dependence of cosmic-ray transport when there is a moderate (but not excessive) level of perpendicular diffusion across magnetic-field lines.

Title: Electrically driven first-order phase transition of a 2D ionic crystal at the electrode/electrolyte interface
Authors: Federica Angiolari, Alessandro Coretti, Mathieu Salanne, Sara Bonella
Abstract: Liquid electrolytes adsorbed at the surface of metallic electrodes display a multitude of structures that can largely differ from the parent bulk system, both in terms of composition and local organization. In particular, the existence of disorder-order or order-order transitions has been increasingly reported in experimental and simulation studies, and the electrode potential identified as the corresponding driving force. The microscopic mechanisms and the stages of the process are, however, poorly understood, and the free energy variation during the transition remain insufficiently characterized. To fill this gap, we investigate the crystallization of the adsorbed layer in a prototypical molten salt-metal interface. We demonstrate that the transition from the disordered to ordered structures proceeds in two stages. Pre-ordering effects are observed across a wide range of potentials, resulting in the formation of a poly-crystalline structure on the electrode surface, before an abrupt ordering transition finally occurs. The pre-ordering displays signature of a continuous transition. On the other hand, finite-size effects analysis proves the first-order character of the transition towards the mono-crystalline state. Upon increasing the system size, a shift in the onset applied voltage is observed, accompanied by a dramatic increase in the free energy barrier. The latter reflects in the interfacial capacitance, which displays a peak that sharpens with increasing system size.

Title: Photon condensation from thermal sources and the limits of heat engines
Authors: Luisa Toledo Tude, Emily Haughton, Paul R. Eastham
Abstract: The trapping and cooling of photon gases in microcavities has been used to create Bose-Einstein condensates. We investigate the conditions required for condensation in dye-filled microcavities, with photon populations created either by driving a transition of the dye or by coupling to an external thermal photon reservoir such as sunlight. We show that the threshold pump temperature, above which condensation appears, is determined by the second law of thermodynamics. The minimum achievable threshold is that of a reversible three-level heat engine, which we show arises in the dye-pumped case, and for the external pumping of a two-level cavity. For a many-level cavity condensation occurs at a similar but higher temperature. The increase is attributed to irreversible heat transfers and the associated entropy production.

Title: Pulse-based optimization of quantum many-body states with Rydberg atoms in optical tweezer arrays
Authors: Kazuma Nagao, Sergi Julià-Farré, Joseph Vovrosh, Alexandre Dauphin, Seiji Yunoki
Abstract: We explore a pulse-based variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for Rydberg atoms in optical tweezer arrays and evaluate its performance on prototypical quantum spin models. We numerically demonstrate that the ground states of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and the mixed-field Ising model can be accurately prepared using an adaptive update algorithm that randomly segments pulse sequences, for systems of up to ten qubits. Furthermore, we propose and validate a hybrid scheme that integrates this pulse-level analog quantum algorithm with a variational quantum gate approach, where digital quantum gates are approximated by optimized analog pulses. This enables efficient measurement of the cost function for target many-body Hamiltonians.

Title: Thermodynamics in the Sine-Gordon model: the NLIE approach
Authors: Arpad Hegedus
Abstract: In this paper we derive Klümper-Batchelor-Pearce-Destri-de Vega type nonlinear integral equations for describing the thermodynamics in the sine-Gordon model, when a chemical potential coupled to the topological charge is also present in the theory. The equations are valid at any value of the coupling constant and are particularly useful for computing the expectation values of local operators and some currents as functions of the temperature and the chemical potential. The equations are also extended to the case, when an extra term corresponding to the momentum conservation, is added to the thermodynamic potential. The benefits of this description are twofold. On the one hand, it can serve as an appropriate testing ground for other promising theoretical methods, like the method of random surfaces. On the other hand, the efficient computation of vertex operator expectation values, allows one to provide useful theoretical data, for the experimentally measurable coherence factors of a tunnel-coupled cold atomic condensate system.

Title: Convergence of the KMP model to the KPZ equation
Authors: Guillaume Barraquand, Francesco Casini
Abstract: We prove that the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) process converges to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, as time $t$ goes to infinity, in a properly scaled observation window shifted by $t^{3/4}$. Our proof is based on identifying the KMP process with a stochastic flow of kernels describing transition probabilities in a certain model of random walk in space-time random environment. This allows to apply a recent result of arXiv:2401.06073 proving convergence of the density field of random walks in random environment to the KPZ equation in a suitably general sense.

Title: Hybrid tensor network and neural network quantum states for quantum chemistry
Authors: Zibo Wu, Bohan Zhang, Wei-Hai Fang, Zhendong Li
Abstract: Neural network quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful and flexible framework for addressing quantum many-body problems. While successful for model Hamiltonians, their application to molecular systems remains challenging for several reasons. In this work, we introduce three innovations to overcome some of the key limitations. (1) We propose two novel ansätzet hat hybridize tensor network and neural network states for addressing initialization challenges and enhancing the expressivity of tensor networks. First, we develop a bounded-degree graph recurrent neural network (BDG-RNN) ansatz that leverages graph-based updates, enabling applications to molecular electronic structure problems. Second, we introduce restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) inspired correlators to further enhance expressivity and improve accuracy, without dramatically modifying the underlying variational Monte Carlo (VMC) optimization framework. (2) We introduce a semi-stochastic algorithm for local energy evaluation, which significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. Combining these advances, we demonstrate that our approaches can achieve chemical accuracy in challenging systems, including the one-dimensional hydrogen chain H50, the iron-sulfur cluster [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]^{2-}, and a three-dimensional $3 \times 3 \times 2$ hydrogen cluster H18. These methods are implemented in an open-source package - PyNQS (this https URL) to advance NQS methodologies for quantum chemistry.

Title: Efficient integration of self-assembled organic monolayer tunnel barriers in large area pinhole-free magnetic tunnel junctions
Authors: Maryam S. Dehaghani, Sophie Guézo Aguinet, Arnaud Le Pottier, Soraya Ababou-Girard, Rozenn Bernard, Sylvain Tricot, Philippe Schieffer, Bruno Lépine, Francine Solal, Pascal Turban
Abstract: Magneto-transport properties in hybrid magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) integrating self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as tunnel barriers are critically influenced by spinterface effects, which arise from the electronic properties at ferromagnet (FM)/SAM interfaces. Understanding the mechanisms governing spinterface formation in well-controlled model systems is essential for the rational design of efficient molecular spintronic devices. However, the fabrication of FM/SAM/FM systems remains a significant challenge due to the difficulty in preventing electrical shorts through the SAM tunnel barrier during top FM electrode deposition. In this study, we address these challenges by developing model hybrid MTJs incorporating alkanethiol SAM tunnel barriers grafted under ultra-high vacuum conditions onto single-crystalline Fe(001) bottom electrodes. A soft-landing deposition method is used for the deposition of a top Co FM electrode. The deposition process and the electronic properties of the FM/SAM interfaces are first studied by spatially integrated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM) and spectroscopy are used to investigate the lateral homogeneity of the organic barrier. Optimal soft-landing deposition conditions allows the preparation of homogeneous Co/SAM interfaces with no evidence of metal diffusion through the SAM at the nanoscale. These observations are further confirmed at the micron-scale by the high-yield patterning of large area (5*5um2) MTJs presenting fingerprints of electron tunneling through the SAM. These findings provide critical insights into the fabrication and optimization of molecular spintronic devices, paving the way for advancements in hybrid MTJ technology.

Title: Tensor Networks for Liquids in Heterogeneous Systems
Authors: Zachary A. Johnson, Luciano G. Silvestri, Pierson Guthrey, Michael S. Murillo
Abstract: Many-body correlations in strongly coupled liquids and plasmas are critical for many applications in nanofluids, biology, and fusion-related plasma physics, but their description in fully heterogeneous environments remains challenging due to the high-dimensional equations involved. Recently, tensor network decompositions have emerged as powerful tools for tackling such equations by reducing memory usage and computational complexity. In this paper, we solve for equilibrium density and density-density correlation functions of liquids in confined heterogeneous environments using tensor network methods. We demonstrate that these functions admit high compression when their lengthscale dependence is encoded via quantized tensor trains or when their spatial-coordinate dependence is represented in standard tensor-train format, but not with respect to their dependence on distinct particle coordinates.

Title: Nonlinear Terahertz Polaritonics in a Quantum Paraelectric
Authors: Chao Shen, Carla Verdi, Serafim Babkin, Maksym Serbyn, Zhanybek Alpichshev
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) frequency range holds immense potential for high-speed data processing and signal manipulation. However, a fundamental challenge remains: the efficient and tunable control of THz electromagnetic fields. One promising approach is polaritonic engineering, which leverages hybrid light-matter excitations to manipulate THz fields at sub-wavelength scales. Here, we introduce quantum paraelectric materials as a powerful new platform for THz phonon-polaritonics, leveraging the pronounced nonlinearities of incipient ferroelectrics. These nonlinearities enable strong self- and cross-coupling between polaritons, facilitating all-optical, reconfigurable THz signal control. Using a novel space- and time-resolved imaging technique, we directly observe the ballistic propagation of bulk phonon-polaritons in SrTiO$_3$, and uncover soliton-like, dispersion-free transport in its low-temperature, quantum-fluctuation-dominated phase. Our results establish quantum paraelectric solids as a versatile and highly tunable medium for next-generation THz photonics and ultrafast information processing.

Title: Paused in translation: A model for the transcript length-dependent impact of ribosome-targeting antibiotics
Authors: Johannes Keisers, Norbert Kern, Luca Ciandrini
Abstract: Ribosome-targeting antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol, stall elongating ribosomes during protein synthesis, disrupting mRNA translation. These antibiotic-induced pauses occur stochastically, alter collective ribosome dynamics and transiently block protein production on the affected transcript. Existing models of ribosome traffic often rely on idealized assumptions, such as infinitely long mRNAs and simplified pausing dynamics, overlooking key biological constraints. Here, we develop a Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) that incorporates stochastic particle pausing, using experimentally determined pausing and unpausing rates to model the effects of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. We introduce a Single-Cluster approximation, which is analytically treatable, tailored to capture the biologically relevant regime of rare and long antibiotic-induced pauses. This biologically constrained model reveals three key insights: (i) the inhibition of antibiotic-induced translation strongly depends on transcript length, with longer transcripts being disproportionately affected; (ii) reducing ribosome initiation rates significantly mitigates antibiotic vulnerability; and (iii) inhibition of translation is governed more by collective ribosome dynamics than by single-ribosome properties. Our analytical predictions match Gillespie simulations, align quantitatively with experimental observations, and yield testable hypotheses for future experiments. These findings may have broader implications for the mechanistic modeling of other biological transport processes (e.g., RNAP dynamics), and more generally for the community studying traffic models.

Title: Falling through the cracks: energy storage along segmented brittle crack fronts
Authors: Xinyue Wei, John M. Kolinski
Abstract: During brittle crack propagation, a smooth crack front curve frequently becomes disjoint, generating a stepped crack and a material ligament that unites the newly formed crack fronts. These universal features fundamentally alter the singular field structure and stability of propagating cracks; however, a quantitative analysis of their mechanics is lacking. Here, we perform in-situ 3D measurements to resolve the deformation field around stepped cracks, and crucially, within the ligament feature. The 3D kinematic data are obtained by scanning a thin laser sheet through the brittle hydrogel samples, while recording the scattered intensity from the embedded tracer particles. We find that the ligament concentrates the strain energy density, and moreover, the apparent fracture energy increases proportionally to the strain energy within the ligament.

Title: Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval
Authors: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
Abstract: The contrast transfer function (CTF) is widely used to evaluate phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), including center-of-mass imaging, parallax imaging, direct ptychography, and iterative ptychography. However, the CTF reflects only the maximum usable signal, neglecting the effects of finite electron fluence and the Poisson-limited nature of detection. As a result, it can significantly overestimate practical performance, especially in low-dose regimes. Here, we employ the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR), as a dose-aware statistical framework to evaluate the recoverable signal as a function of spatial frequency. Using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, we show that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, with close-form analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative ptychography exhibits a surprising dose dependence: at low fluence, its SSNR converges to that of direct ptychography; at high fluence, it saturates at a value consistent with the maximum detective quantum efficiency predicted by recent quantum Fisher information bounds. The results highlight the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and motivate SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods.

Title: Theoretical correction methods for optical tweezers: Acquisition of potentials of mean forces between colloidal particles in a bulk and on a surface
Authors: Ken-ichi Amano, Rikako Suzuki, Madoka Takasu
Abstract: It is known that line optical tweezers (LOT) can measure potential of mean force (PMF) between colloidal particles in the bulk. However, PMF obtained with LOT is empirically modified before showing the result of the final form in order to correct the potential rise at long distances. In the present letter, we derive theoretical correction methods for acquisition of PMF by using statistical mechanics. Using the new methods, PMF can be obtained without the empirical fitting equation. Through the new methods, external potential acting on the trapped two colloidal particles induced by LOT can also be obtained. As an additional study, we explain two methods for obtaining PMF between colloidal particles on a substrate surface, in which a normal single optical tweezers with a fixed focal point is used, and for obtaining PMF between colloidal particles trapped by dual-beam optical tweezers in the bulk. These methods can also obtain the external potential acting on the trapped two colloidal particles.

Title: Characterizing the Many Body Localization Crossover as a Metal-Insulator Transition: Localization length from Polarization and Quantum Metric
Authors: W. N. Faugno, Tomoki Ozawa
Abstract: Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL regime geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary, and the localization parameter as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. First, we demonstrate that the quantum metric can be used to characterize disordered insulating states by applying this theoretical framework to excited states of the 1D Anderson insulator. There we observe that the MBQM and localization parameter are related in finite realizations despite the states being gapless in the thermodynamic limit. Then, we consider a disordered 1D Bose-Hubbard model and find that we can characterize the ergodic-MBL crossover by comparing the MBQM and localization parameter. We find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL regime that characterizes the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured by extracting the quantum metric. Our analysis provides complementary insight into the MBL regime focusing on its insulating properties and providing a localization length whose definition is consistent across a range of insulating phases.

Title: Coherent all-optical control of the germanium vacancy in diamond
Authors: C. Adambukulam, J. A. Scott, S. Q. Lim, I. Aharonovich, A. Morello, A. Laucht
Abstract: The germanium vacancy in diamond (GeV) is a promising candidate for color center based quantum networking. Yet, like for other group-IV vacancy defects in diamond, achieving fast, high-fidelity qubit operations using traditional magnetic resonance techniques is experimentally challenging due to a weak magnetic dipole and susceptibility to thermally induced decoherence. Here, we perform all-optical control of the GeV and realize Rabi frequencies exceeding $\sim 20$~MHz. We do so by driving the two $\Lambda$-systems of the GeV simultaneously and apply this to probe the spin coherence ($T_2^*=224\pm14$~ns, $T_2^{\rm H}=11.9\pm0.3$~$\mu$s). Our control scheme is applicable to other color centers and particularly, other group-IV defects for which, the scheme may be optimized to improve all-optical control in these systems.

Title: Giant plateau-like topological Hall effect controlled by tailoring the magnetic exchange stiffness in a kagome magnet

Abstract: The ferrimagnet TbMn6Sn6 has attracted vast attention, because its pristine Mn kagome lattice with strong spin-orbit coupling and out-of-plane Tb-Mn exchange supports quantum-limit Chern topological magnetism which can be described by the simple spinless Haldane model. We unveil herein that engineering the kagome lattice through partial substitution of Mn with nonmagnetic Cr induces a striking structural reorganization-Cr preferentially concentrates within a single Mn layer per unit cell, reducing the crystal symmetry from the D6h point group to the C2. This tailored structure configuration gives rise to a plateau-like topological Hall effect (THE), achieving a record-breaking resistivity of 19.1 ohm cm among bulk systems. Complementary magnetic force microscopy measurements unveil a magnetic domain transition near 1 T at 180 K, aligning with the field-dependent phase diagram of the THE. Our direct visualization of the magnetic domain structure underscores the critical role of broken kagome lattice symmetry in generating distinct exchange stiffness between the two Mn layers. These findings establish a new paradigm for exploring exotic states in kagome topological magnets and provide a proof-of-principle strategy for unraveling the interplay between magnetism and emergent topological properties in kagome systems.

Title: T2MAT (text-to-materials): A universal agent for generating material structures with goal properties from a single sentence
Authors: Zhilong Song, Shuaihua Lu, Qionghua Zhou, Jinlan Wang
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC)-content autonomously produced by AI systems without human intervention-has significantly boosted efficiency across various fields. However, AIGC in material science faces challenges in efficiently discovering novel materials that surpass existing databases, while simultaneously addressing the invariance and stability of crystal structures. To address these challenges, we develop T2MAT (text-to-material), a comprehensive agent processing from a user-input sentence to inverse design material structures with goal properties beyond the existing database via globally exploring chemical space, followed by an entirely automated workflow of first-principles validation. Furthermore, we propose CGTNet (Crystal Graph Transformer NETwork), a graph neural network model that captures long-range interactions, to enhance the accuracy and data utilization efficiency of property prediction and thereby strengthen the reliability of inverse design. Through these contributions, T2MAT minimizes the dependency on human expertise and significantly improves the efficiency of discovering novel, high-performance functional materials, offering a robust way toward more autonomous materials design.

Title: Field-induced magnon decays in dipolar quantum magnets
Authors: Andrew D. Kim, Ahmed Khalifa, Shubhayu Chatterjee
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous disintegration of magnons in two-dimensional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets dominated by long-range dipolar interactions. Analyzing kinematic constraints, we show that the unusual dispersion of dipolar ferromagnets in a uniform magnetic field precludes magnon-decay at all fields, in sharp contrast to short-range exchange-driven magnets. However, in a staggered magnetic field, magnons can decay in both dipolar ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Remarkably, such decays do not require a minimum threshold field, and happen over a nearly fixed fraction of the Brillouin Zone in the XY limit, highlighting the significant role played by dipolar interactions. In addition, topological transitions in the decay surfaces lead to singularities in the magnon spectrum. Regularizing such singular behavior via a self-consistent approach, we make predictions for dynamical spin correlations accessible to near-term quantum simulators and sensors.

Title: Dynamical Dipolar Condensate Finite Temperature Stochastic Gross--Pitaevskii--Boltzmann Model
Authors: Nick P. Proukakis, Gerasimos Rigopoulos, Alex Soto
Abstract: We formulate a generalized self-consistent stochastic quantum kinetic theory for finite-temperature ultracold Bose gases interacting via a generic long-range interaction, applicable to a broad range of systems, by means of Keldysh non-equilibrium field theory: such model is explicitly cast in the context of dipolar atomic gases, and is also shown to encompass established stochastic and kinetic treatments for ultracold atomic gases with local interactions as special cases. The condensate and low-lying modes are collectively described by a stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation with two collisional terms and their corresponding stochastic noise terms, with thermal particles dynamically modelled through a self-consistently coupled Quantum Boltzmann equation and dipolar interactions included by means of a coupled Poisson-like equation. Additional use of Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis generating the Lee-Huang-Yang correction term relevant in the $T=0$ quantum-fluctuation-dominated regime, allows us to postulate the extension of such model offering a plausible scheme for interpolating between quantum-dominated and thermal-dominated fluctuation regimes, the consistency of which remains to be tested against experimental observations.

Title: Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality in superfluid vortex reconnections
Authors: Piotr Z. Stasiak, Yiming Xing, Yousef Alihosseini, Carlo F. Barenghi, Andrew Baggaley, Wei Guo, Luca Galantucci, Giorgio Krstulovic
Abstract: The minimum separation between reconnecting vortices in fluids and superfluids obeys a universal scaling law with respect to time. The pre-reconnection and the post-reconnection prefactors of this scaling law are different, a property related to irreversibility and to energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms. In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and post-reconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behaviour independent of the small-scale regularising dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.

Title: Rough or crumpled: Strong coupling phases of a generalized Kardar-Parisi-Zhang surface
Authors: Debayan Jana, Abhik Basu
Abstract: We study a generalized Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation [Jana et al., Phys. Rev. E 109, L032104 (2024)] that sets the paradigm for universality in roughening of growing nonequilibrium surfaces without any conservation laws but with competing local and nonlocal nonlinear effects. This equation in two dimensions exhibits two distinct strong coupling regimes: a rough phase and a crumpled phase, in addition to a weak coupling phase. The conformation fluctuations of such a rough surface are given by nonuniversal scaling exponents, with orientational long-range order and positional short-range order, whereas the crumpled phase has positional and orientational short-range order.

Title: Magnetic Ni-N-Ni Centers in N-substituted NiO
Authors: Simon Godin, Ilya S. Elfimov, Fengmiao Li, Bruce A. Davidson, Ronny Sutarto, Jonathan D. Denlinger, Liu Hao Tjeng, George A. Sawatzky, Ke Zou
Abstract: To explore how anion substitution modifies the existing magnetism in strongly correlated oxides, we investigate local electronic states and magnetic ordering in nickel oxide (NiO) induced by substituting oxygen (O) with nitrogen (N). Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and modifies the magnetic moment of a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons exceeds the Ni-O-Ni superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni centers consisting of five spins, without perturbing the antiferromagnetic NiO lattice. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. This type of magnetic design may enable future advances in quantum technologies based on strongly correlated materials, such as quantum sensors and spin-based qubits.

Title: Microscopic Origin of Reduced Magnetic Order in a Frustrated Metal
Authors: X. Boraley, O. Stockert, J. Lass, R. Sibille, Ø. S. Fjellvåg, S. H. Moody, A. M. Läuchli, V. Fritsch, D. G. Mazzone
Abstract: Although magnetic frustration in metals provides a promising avenue for novel quantum phenomena, their microscopic interpretation is often challenging. Here we use the face-centered cubic intermetallic HoInCu$_4$ as model material to show that Hamiltonians neglecting the charge degree of freedom are appropriate for frustrated metals possessing low density of states at the Fermi surface. Through neutron scattering techniques we determine matching magnetic exchange interactions in the paramagnetic and field-polarized states using an effective spin-1 Heisenberg Hamiltonian, for which we identify antiferromagnetic nearest and next-nearest neighbour interactions $J_1$ and $J_2$ that are close to the critical ratio $J_2$/$J_1$ = 1/2. The study further provides evidence that spin-wave theory fails to predict the low-energy spin dynamics in the antiferromagnetic zero-field state, which is dominated by overdamped magnetic excitations. We conclude that the low-energy fluctuations arise from quantum fluctuations, accounting for the missing moment of the strongly renormalized magnetic long-range order.

Title: Disordered ground state in the three-dimensional face-centred frustrated spin-$\frac{5}{2}$ system MnSn(OH)$_\text{6}$
Authors: Kaushick K. Parui, Anton A. Kulbakov, Ellen Häußler, Nikolai S. Pavlovskii, Aswathi Mannathanath Chakkingal, Maxim Avdeev, Roman Gumeniuk, Sergey Granovsky, Alexander Mistonov, Sergei A. Zvyagin, Thomas Doert, Dmytro S. Inosov, Darren C. Peets
Abstract: Frustrated magnetism in face-centred cubic (fcc) magnetic sublattices remains underexplored but holds considerable potential for exotic magnetic behaviour. Here we report on the crystal structure, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the $A$-site-vacant double hydroxide perovskite MnSn(OH)$_6$. Despite dominant antiferromagnetic interactions among Mn$^{2+}$ moments, evidenced by a negative Curie-Weiss temperature, the lack of a sharp thermodynamic transition down to 350$\,$mK implies the absence of long-range magnetic order. However, a broad hump in the specific heat at 1.6$\,$K suggests short-range correlations. Neutron diffraction at low temperatures confirms the presence of three-dimensional antiferromagnetic correlations, manifested as diffuse magnetic scattering with a correlation length $\xi = 24.66\,$Å and magnetic propagation vectors $\mathbf{k}=(\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{1}{2})$ and $(0\,0.625\,0)$ at 20$\,$mK.

Title: LLM-Feynman: Leveraging Large Language Models for Universal Scientific Formula and Theory Discovery
Authors: Zhilong Song, Qionghua Zhou, Chunjin Ren, Chongyi Ling, Minggang Ju, Jinlan Wang
Abstract: Distilling underlying principles from data has historically driven scientific breakthroughs. However, conventional data-driven machine learning often produces complex models that lack interpretability and generalization due to insufficient domain expertise. Here, we present LLM-Feynman, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) alongside systematic optimization to derive concise, interpretable formulas from data and domain knowledge. Our method integrates automated feature engineering, LLM-guided symbolic regression with self-evaluation, and Monte Carlo tree search to enhance formula discovery and clarity. The embedding of domain knowledge simplifies the formula, while self-evaluation based on this knowledge further minimizes prediction errors, surpassing conventional symbolic regression in accuracy and interpretability. Our LLM-Feynman successfully rediscovered over 90% of fundamental physical formulas and demonstrated its efficacy in key materials science applications, including classification of two-dimensional material and perovskite synthesizability and determination of the Green's function and screened Coulomb interaction bandgaps, and prediction of ionic conductivity in lithium solid-state electrolytes. By transcending mere data fitting through the integration of deep domain knowledge, this LLM-Feynman offers a transformative paradigm for the automated discovery of generalizable scientific formulas and theories across disciplines.

Title: Recurrent neural network analysis of single trajectories switching between anomalous diffusion states
Authors: Alvaro Lanza, Xiang Qu, Stefano Bo
Abstract: Diffusive dynamics abound in nature and have been especially studied in physical, biological, and financial systems. These dynamics are characterised by a linear growth of the mean squared displacement (MSD) with time. Often, the conditions that give rise to simple diffusion are violated, and many systems, such as biomolecules inside cells, microswimmers, or particles in turbulent flows, undergo anomalous diffusion, featuring an MSD that grows following a power law with an exponent $\alpha$. Precisely determining this exponent and the generalised diffusion coefficient provides valuable information on the systems under consideration, but it is a very challenging task when only a few short trajectories are available, which is common in non-equilibrium and living systems. Estimating the exponent becomes overwhelmingly difficult when the diffusive dynamics switches between different behaviours, characterised by different exponents $\alpha$ or diffusion coefficients $K$. We develop a method based on recurrent neural networks that successfully estimates the anomalous diffusion exponents and generalised diffusion coefficients of individual trajectories that switch between multiple diffusive states. Our method returns the $\alpha$ and $K$ as a function of time and identifies the times at which the dynamics switches between different behaviours. We showcase the method's capabilities on the dataset of the 2024 Anomalous Diffusion Challenge.

Title: Quasi-$Φ_0$-periodic supercurrent at quantum Hall transitions
Authors: Ivan Villani, Matteo Carrega, Alessandro Crippa, Elia Strambini, Francesco Giazotto, Vaidotas Miseikis, Camilla Coletti, Fabio Beltram, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Stefan Heun, Sergio Pezzini
Abstract: The combination of superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effect is regarded as a key milestone in advancing topological quantum computation in solid-state systems. Recent quantum interference studies suggest that QH edge states can effectively mediate a supercurrent across high-quality graphene weak links. In this work we report the observation of a supercurrent associated with transitions between adjacent QH plateaus, where transport paths develop within the compressible two-dimensional bulk. We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate $\Phi_0=h/2e$ periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.

Title: Most two-dimensional bosonic topological orders forbid sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo: Nonpositive Gauss sum as an indicator
Authors: Donghae Seo, Minyoung You, Hee-Cheol Kim, Gil Young Cho
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo is a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body physics, yet its efficacy is often curtailed by the notorious sign problem. In this Letter, we introduce a novel criterion for the "intrinsic" sign problem in two-dimensional bosonic topological orders, which cannot be resolved by local basis transformations or adiabatic deformations of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we find that the positivity of higher Gauss sums is a necessary condition for a two-dimensional bosonic topological order to be realized by a stoquastic Hamiltonian, and hence sign-problem-free. Equivalently, a nonpositive higher Gauss sum for a given topological order indicates the presence of an intrinsic sign problem. This condition not only aligns with prior findings but significantly broadens their scope. Using this new criterion, we examine the Gauss sums of all 405 bosonic topological orders classified up to rank 12, and strikingly find that 398 of them exhibit intrinsic sign problems. We also uncover intriguing links between the intrinsic sign problem, gappability of boundary theories, and time-reversal symmetry, suggesting that sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo may fundamentally rely on both time-reversal symmetry and gapped boundaries. These results highlight the deep connection between the intrinsic sign problem and fundamental properties of topological phases, offering valuable insights into their classical simulability.

Title: Performance in solving the Hermitian and pseudo-Hermitian Bethe-Salpeter equation with the Yambo code
Authors: Petru Milev, Blanca Mellado-Pinto, Muralidhar Nalabothula, Ali Esquembre Kucukalic, Fernando Alvarruiz, Enrique Ramos, Alejandro Molina-Sanchez, Ludger Wirtz, Jose E. Roman, Davide Sangalli
Abstract: We analyze the performance of two strategies in solving the structured eigenvalue problem deriving from the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) in condensed matter physics. The BSE matrix is constructed with the \texttt{Yambo} code, and the two strategies are implemented by interfacing \texttt{Yambo} with the ScaLAPACK and ELPA libraries for direct diagonalization, and with the SLEPc library for the iterative approach. We consider both the Hermitian (Tamm-Dancoff approximation) and pseudo-Hermitian forms, addressing dense matrices of three different sizes. A description of the implementation is also provided, with details for the pseudo-Hermitian case. Timing and memory utilization are analyzed on both CPU and GPU clusters. Our results demonstrate that it is now feasible to handle dense BSE matrices of the order of 10$^5$.

Title: Dichotomy theorem separating complete integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains
Authors: Naoto Shiraishi, Mizuki Yamaguchi
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.

Title: Wavefunctions and oscillator strengths of Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells
Authors: Leon Kühner, Patric Rommel, Jörg Main, Stefan Scheel, Pavel A. Belov
Abstract: We investigate the eigenstates, that is, the wavefunctions of Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells and derive expressions relating them to the oscillator strengths of different exciton states. Using the B-spline expansion, we compute the wavefunctions in coordinate space and estimate the oscillator strengths. The symmetry properties of the states and the non-separability of the wavefunctions are illustrated. Wavefunctions associated with resonances above the scattering threshold, in particular those of bound states in the continuum as well as their partner states, are also given.

Title: Curiosity Driven Exploration to Optimize Structure-Property Learning in Microscopy
Authors: Aditya Vatsavai, Ganesh Narasimha, Yongtao Liu, Jawad Chowdhury, Jan-Chi Yang, Hiroshi Funakubo, Maxim Ziatdinov, Rama Vasudevan
Abstract: Rapidly determining structure-property correlations in materials is an important challenge in better understanding fundamental mechanisms and greatly assists in materials design. In microscopy, imaging data provides a direct measurement of the local structure, while spectroscopic measurements provide relevant functional property information. Deep kernel active learning approaches have been utilized to rapidly map local structure to functional properties in microscopy experiments, but are computationally expensive for multi-dimensional and correlated output spaces. Here, we present an alternative lightweight curiosity algorithm which actively samples regions with unexplored structure-property relations, utilizing a deep-learning based surrogate model for error prediction. We show that the algorithm outperforms random sampling for predicting properties from structures, and provides a convenient tool for efficient mapping of structure-property relationships in materials science.

Title: A High-Quality Thermoelectric Material Database with Self-Consistent ZT Filtering
Authors: Byungki Ryu, Ji Hui Son, Sungjin Park, Jaywan Chung, Hye-Jin Lim, SuJi Park, Yujeong Do, SuDong Park
Abstract: This study presents a curated thermoelectric material database, teMatDb, constructed by digitizing literature-reported data. It includes temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties (TEPs), Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and figure of merit (ZT), along with metadata on materials and their corresponding publications. A self-consistent ZT (Sc-ZT) filter set was developed to measure ZT errors by comparing reported ZT's from figures with ZT's recalculated from digitized TEPs. Using this Sc-ZT protocol, we generated tMatDb272, comprising 14,717 temperature-property pairs from 272 high-quality TEP sets across 262 publications. The method identifies various types of ZT errors, such as resolution error, publication bias, ZT overestimation, interpolation and extrapolation error, and digitization noise, and excludes inconsistent samples from the dataset. teMatDb272 and the Sc-ZT filtering framework offer a robust dataset for data-driven and machine-learning-based materials design, device modeling, and future thermoelectric research.

Title: Spin current compensation from competing magnon modes in ferrimagnets
Authors: Adam B. Cahaya
Abstract: We investigate thermal spin pumping in gadolinium iron garnet (GdIG), focusing on the mode-resolved dynamics of antiferromagnetic magnons and their impact on spin and heat transport. Antiferromagnets support both right-handed and left-handed magnon modes, which we treat as positive and negative frequency branches, analogous to electrons and holes in semiconductors. Using a two-sublattice model with a minimal exchange interaction scheme, we derive the temperature-dependent spin-wave spectrum and evaluate the associated thermal spin pumping coefficients. Our analysis reveals that the competition between left- and right-handed modes gives rise to a compensation temperature, where the net thermally generated spin current vanishes. Importantly, we show that this compensation point does not necessarily coincide with the crossing of magnon dispersion branches. While previous research considers a detailed microscopic model including all magnetic sublattices and exchange couplings, our approach demonstrates that key features of mode-resolved spin transport can be captured by a simplified and analytically transparent model. These findings advance the understanding of spin-caloritronic phenomena in ferrimagnets and offer new perspectives for the design of chiral magnon-based spintronic devices.

Title: Self-ion implantation and structural relaxation in amorphous silicon
Authors: J.M. Gibson, Robe Elliman, T. Susi, C. Mangler
Abstract: Self-ion implantation amorphization is an established approach to study the structure and properties of amorphous silicon (a-Si). Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM) has consistently observed Medium-Range Order (MRO) in this system that is not consistent with the Continuous Random Network (CRN) model. Using this technique we find that the degree of MRO first increases on thermal annealing and then decreases before finally recrystallizing. We discuss this new result in the light of previous experimental studies and recent theoretical observations on the favorability of the paracrystalline (PC) model over the CRN in a-Si. At ion doses far above the minimum required to amorphize, a high defect density is found in the PC phase, which anneals out at 500oC. The PC structure after 500oC annealing is independent of the initial implantation conditions and appears to represent a metastable and highly-ordered structure. Higher-temperature annealing causes a reduction in the degree of MRO and the structure approaches but does not reach a fully continuous random network before eventually crystallizing above 600oC. The effect of high dose implantation is to increase the defect density in the as-implanted state and the annealing of these defects is likely responsible for the large characteristic heat evolution at low temperature.

Title: Weyl semimetal engineering by symmetry control in NiTe$_2$
Authors: Marcos G. O. Junior, Augusto L. Araújo, Emmanuel V. C. Lopes, Tome M. Schmidt
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the emergence of Weyl points in an inversion symmetry-breaking 1T-NiTe$_2$ system. Through first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory combined with tight-binding methods, we find three distinct sets of Weyl crossings under an appropriate symmetry breaking. The first set, composed of four Weyl points, emerges from the Dirac semimetal. Surprisingly, the other two sets result in additional twenty-four Weyl crossings, depending on the weight of the symmetry breaking. We investigate the topological characteristics of the Weyl semimetals by computing the Weyl chirality, Berry curvature, and the evolution of Wannier charge centers. Additionally, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been shown by computing the Fermi arcs. Our results provide a way for creating and manipulating distinct sets of Weyl points with appropriate external control, which can be valuable for applications in Weyltronics.

Title: Finite time path field theory and a new type of universal quantum spin chain quench behavior
Authors: Domagoj Kuić, Alemka Knapp, Diana Šaponja-Milutinović
Abstract: We discuss different quench protocols for Ising and XY spin chains in a transverse magnetic field. With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a starting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden quenches. Using finite time path field theory (FTPFT) perturbative methods, we show that the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with non-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time, apart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for. As the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing the discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation expansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements on functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time $t=0$ are as follows: (1) their Fourier transform $f(p)$ is a function that is analytic everywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at $p=0$ and possibly others with $\Im (p) < 0$; and (2) $f(p)/p$ converges to zero at infinity in the lower complex semiplane. A prototypical function of this class is $\tanh(\eta t)$, to which the perturbation strength is proportional after the switching at time $t=0$. In the limit of large $\eta$, such a perturbation approaches the case of a sudden quench. It is shown that, because of this new type of universal behavior of Loschmidt echo (LE) that emerges in an exponentially short time scale, our previous results for the sudden local magnetic field quench of Ising and XY chains, obtained by the resummation of the perturbative expansion, extend in the long-time limit to all non-sudden quench protocols in this class, with non-substantial modifications systematically taken into account. We also show that analogous universal behavior exists in disorder quenches, and ultimately global ones.

Title: Equilibrium distribution of the liquid phase in an unsaturated granular material
Authors: Loredana Lazar, Cécile Clavaud, Axelle Amon
Abstract: In an unsaturated granular material, the spatial distribution of the liquid phase results from the competition between gravity and capillary forces. We show that, in the funicular regime, it can be described by a Boltzmann law, with static disorder playing the role of thermal agitation. We propose an approach based on a Langevin equation to derive this distribution, and compare our predictions with conductivity measurements giving the local water content as a function of height in a wet granular medium. We show that experimental data obtained with samples of different polydispersities collapse on a single master curve consistent with our model.

Title: Dynamic annihilation pathways of magnetic skyrmions
Authors: Matthew Copus, Ezio Iacocca
Abstract: The investigation of magnetic solitons often relies on numerical modeling to determine key features such as stability, annihilation, nucleation, and motion. However, as soliton sizes approach atomic length scales, the accuracy of these predictions become increasingly sensitive to the details of the numerical model. Here, we study the annihilation of two-dimensional magnetic skyrmions using a pseudospectral approach and compare its performance to that of conventional micromagnetic simulations. A central distinction between the models lies in their treatment of the exchange interaction, which governs the magnon dispersion relation and plays a crucial role to balance the uniaxial anisotropy to stabilise skyrmions. We demonstrate that both the choice of model and spatial discretisation significantly influence the skyrmion dynamics and the magnetic field required for annihilation. The pseudospectral model provides a consistent description across length scales and captures complex behaviours such as skyrmion breathing on its path to annihilation. Our results have direct implications in the state-of-the-art modeling of skyrmions and other two-dimensional textures and will impact the modeling of three-dimensional textures such as hopfions. More broadly, our approach will contribute to the development seamless multiscale model and optimization machine learning approaches for material discovery.

Title: Light-induced ultrafast magnetization dynamics in van der Waals antiferromagnetic CrSBr
Authors: Ali Kefayati, Yafei Ren
Abstract: The magnetization dynamics driven by the femtosecond laser pulse of antiferromagnet van der Waals semiconductor CrSBr is studied within time-dependent density functional theory. We investigate the effect of laser fluence as well as the excitation frequency on the ultrafast dynamics of spins. In low fluence, the local magnetic moment of Cr increases when the laser frequency is below the band gap, whereas it decreases when the laser frequency is above the band gap. In high fluence, we find strong demagnetization independent of excitation frequency. We find that the ultrafast demagnetization in CrSBr is dominated by intralayer and interlayer optical intersite spin transfer, and spin flip via the spin-orbit coupling plays a minor role. Our results reveal hole excitation in the low-fluence regime and electron excitation in the high-fluence regime. Further, we investigate the effect of the external static magnetic field on the dynamics. We demonstrate even and odd high harmonic generation in the local magnetic moments and electric current, respectively. The external magnetic field results in an out-of-plane charge current via the inverse spin Hall effect as well as odd harmonics in the local magnetic moment dynamics as a result of breaking the time-reversal symmetry.

Title: Andreev molecules at distance
Authors: Erik S. Samuelsen, Yuli V. Nazarov
Abstract: Andreev molecule states arise from hybridization of Andreev bound states in different Josephson Junctions. Extensive theoretical and experimental research concentrates on direct coherent electron coupling between the junctions: this implies the distance between the junctions is of the order of superconducting coherence length, that is, short. We propose and discuss the possibility to create Andreev molecules at long (in principle, arbitrary long) distance between the junctions. In this case, the hybridized states are excited quasi-particle singlets and the coupling is provided by an embedding electric circuit. To achieve a strong hybridization, one aligns the energies of the Andreev bound states with associated phase differences. In fact, a recent experiment realizes such setup. With circuit theory we derive the hybridization level splitting and estimate the scale of the effect. Since the phenomenon encompasses excited states, we derive and solve the associated Lindblad equation under condition of persistent resonant excitation. By analyzing the resulting dissipative dynamics we identify relevant regimes where the hybridization and resonant excitation peaks are most pronounced. The low-frequency mutual inductance of the Josephson junctions is an important signature of the molecular state and associated non-local Josephson effect. We demonstrate the peak structures for both mutual and self-inductance, and compute them in various frequency regimes. In an interesting common case the embedding circuit includes an oscillator, which can be used both to enhance hybridization and for state readout with two-tone spectroscopy. We derive and solve Lindblad equations for the conditions of two-tone spectroscopy to demonstrate the the readout of molecular states.

Title: Hydrogen modes in KDP under pressure from ab initio calculation and inelastic neutron scattering
Authors: V. A. Abalmasov, A. S. Ivanov, R. A. Sadykov, A. V. Belushkin
Abstract: The nature of the phonon triplet in the region of OH-stretching modes in hydrogen-bonded materials is often explained by the interplay of OH-stretching modes and combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes. In order to elucidate the both contributions in KDP, we compare the pressure dependence of the OH-bending and stretching modes from ab initio calculation and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. The ab initio calculation predicts a hardening of OH-bending modes and a softening of OH-stretching modes with pressure. At the same time, INS measurements in the region of OH-stretching modes indicate a hardening of the phonon triplet together with the bending modes. This means that this triplet in INS measurements is mainly due to combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes, while the intensity of OH-stretching modes appears to be relatively low. This conclusion may also apply to other hydrogen-bonded materials.

Title: Error Mitigation Thresholds in Noisy Random Quantum Circuits
Authors: Pradeep Niroula, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Michael J. Gullans
Abstract: Extracting useful information from noisy near-term quantum simulations requires error mitigation strategies. A broad class of these strategies rely on precise characterization of the noise source. We study the robustness of probabilistic error cancellation and tensor network error mitigation when the noise is imperfectly characterized. We adapt an Imry-Ma argument to predict the existence of a threshold in the robustness of these error mitigation methods for random spatially local circuits in spatial dimensions $D \geq 2$: noise characterization disorder below the threshold rate allows for error mitigation up to times that scale with the number of qubits. For one-dimensional circuits, by contrast, mitigation fails at an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time for any imperfection in the characterization of disorder. As a result, error mitigation is only a practical method for sufficiently well-characterized noise. We discuss further implications for tests of quantum computational advantage, fault-tolerant probes of measurement-induced phase transitions, and quantum algorithms in near-term devices.

Title: Equilibration of Non-interacting Photons and Quantum Signatures of Chaos
Authors: V. M. Bastidas, H. L. Nourse, A. Sakurai, A. Hayashi, S. Nishio, Kae Nemoto, W. J. Munro
Abstract: Equilibration plays a fundamental role in our understanding of statistical mechanics and the long-time dynamics of many-body systems. In quantum systems, the route to equilibration is intimately related to level repulsion and quantum signatures of chaos that are encoded in their unitary evolution. Chaotic quantum systems exhibit the level statistics characteristic of ensembles of random matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that single-particle chaos leads to equilibration of many non-interacting photons. We show that the underlying mechanisms for equilibration are operator spreading and quantum interference. More specifically, we demonstrate that the unitary dynamics of a general Floquet system implemented using single-mode phase shifters and multiport beamsplitters leads to equilibration of photons. We propose a realistic photonic implementation of the multiparticle kicked rotor, which is a Floquet system that we use as a concrete example of our general approach.

Title: Quantum chaos in PT symmetric quantum systems
Authors: Kshitij Sharma, Himanshu Sahu, Subroto Mukerjee
Abstract: In this study, we explore the interplay between $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and quantum chaos in a non-Hermitian dynamical system. We consider an extension of the standard diagnostics of quantum chaos, namely the complex level spacing ratio and out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), to study the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum kicked rotor model. The kicked rotor has long been regarded as a paradigmatic dynamic system to study classical and quantum chaos. By introducing non-Hermiticity in the quantum kicked rotor, we uncover new phases and transitions that are absent in the Hermitian system. From the study of the complex level spacing ratio, we locate three regimes -- one which is integrable and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, another which is chaotic with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and a third which is chaotic but with broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. We find that the complex level spacing ratio can distinguish between all three phases. Since calculations of the OTOC can be related to those of the classical Lyapunov exponent in the semi-classical limit, we investigate its nature in these regimes and at the phase boundaries. In the phases with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the OTOC exhibits behaviour akin to what is observed in the Hermitian system in both the integrable and chaotic regimes. Moreover, in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phase, the OTOC demonstrates additional exponential growth stemming from the complex nature of the eigenvalue spectrum at later times. We derive the analytical form of the late-time behaviour of the OTOC. By defining a normalized OTOC to mitigate the effects caused by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking, we show that the OTOC exhibits singular behaviour at the transition from the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric chaotic phase to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken, chaotic phase.

Title: Quantum Electrometer for Time-Resolved Material Science at the Atomic Lattice Scale
Authors: Gregor Pieplow, Cem Güney Torun, Charlotta Gurr, Joseph H. D. Munns, Franziska Marie Herrmann, Andreas Thies, Tommaso Pregnolato, Tim Schröder
Abstract: The detection of individual charges plays a crucial role in fundamental material science and the advancement of classical and quantum high-performance technologies that operate with low noise. However, resolving charges at the lattice scale in a time-resolved manner has not been achieved so far. Here, we present the development of an electrometer with 60 ns acquisition steps, leveraging on the spectroscopy of an optically-active spin defect embedded in a solid-state material with a non-linear Stark response. By applying our approach to diamond, a widely used platform for quantum technology applications, we can distinguish the distinct charge traps at the lattice scale, quantify their impact on transport dynamics and noise generation, analyze relevant material properties, and develop strategies for material optimization.

Title: Trade-off between diagonal and off-diagonal elements in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
Authors: Zhiqiang Huang
Abstract: To bypass the reliance on local observables in verifying the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), we introduce an observable-independent measure of distinguishability based on the variance of a rescaled local operator. We establish a universal trade-off relation between the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of this measure, rigorously connecting it to eigenstate typicality and spatially averaged observables. This trade-off reveals that exponential growth in the number of off-diagonal terms enforces their suppression, indirectly constraining diagonal deviations. Numerical simulations on a one-dimensional Ising spin chain with tunable transverse and longitudinal fields demonstrate stark contrasts between integrable and non-integrable regimes: While off-diagonal elements are universally suppressed with system size, diagonal suppression fails in integrable systems due to the absence of chaotic dynamics. Our results unify subsystem ETH, weak ETH, and macroscopic observables under a single framework, offering new insights into thermalization mechanisms.

Title: Stabilizer entropy in non-integrable quantum evolutions
Authors: Jovan Odavić, Michele Viscardi, Alioscia Hamma
Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and the anti-flatness of the entanglement spectrum after a quantum quench in a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.

Title: The moments of the spectral form factor in SYK
Authors: Andrea Legramandi, Neil Talwar
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems the spectral form factor exhibits a universal linear ramp and plateau structure with superimposed erratic oscillations. The mean signal and the statistics of the noise can be probed by the moments of the spectral form factor, also known as higher-point spectral form factors. We identify saddle points in the SYK model that describe the moments during the ramp region. Perturbative corrections around the saddle point indicate that SYK mimics random matrix statistics for the low order moments, while large deviations for the high order moments arise from fluctuations near the edge of the spectrum. The leading correction scales inversely with the number of random parameters in the SYK Hamiltonian and is amplified in a sparsified version of the SYK model, which we study numerically, even in regimes where a linear ramp persists. Finally, we study the $q=2$ SYK model, whose spectral form factor exhibits an exponential ramp with increased noise. These findings reveal how deviations from random matrix universality arise in disordered systems and motivate their interpretation from a bulk gravitational perspective.

Title: SVM/SVR Kernels as Quantum Propagators
Authors: Nan-Hong Kuo, Renata Wong
Abstract: We establish a mathematical equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's functions, which has remained largely unexplored. We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may also fail to perform optimally. We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing customized kernels that align with Green's functions. Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.

Title: A versatile experimental method to measure the traction forces at interfaces
Authors: Yingwei Hou, Tao Liu
Abstract: Measurement of surface forces, including cohesive forces and contact forces, is critical for understanding and controlling interactions at interfaces to optimize the interfacial performance of applications. The objective of this paper is to introduce a general in-situ method that enables the measurement of 3D micron-scale displacements and corresponding force distribution at interfaces in dry or wet environment. Stereo digital image correlation was used to measure the 3D-displacement of a soft and deformable substrate. The efficiency and accuracy of the technique were evaluated by applying compression to the substrate using a steel ball, with the measured 3D displacements aligning closely with finite element analysis simulations. To further assess the method's applicability, the wet adhesion between mussel plaques and substrate was tested under aqueous conditions. The interfacial displacements and forces at different stages during the test were measured. The application of the technique can be extended for varied circumstances regarding force range and substrate materials based on Winkler Spring model.

Title: Quantifying interdisciplinary synergy in higher STEM education
Authors: Gahyoun Gim, Jinhyuk Yun, Sang Hoon Lee
Abstract: We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula at the university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.

Title: Reshaping MOFs text mining with a dynamic multi-agents framework of large language model
Authors: Zuhong Lin, Daoyuan Ren, Kai Ran, Jing Sun, Songlin Yu, Xuefeng Bai, Xiaotiang Huang, Haiyang He, Pengxu Pan, Xiaohang Zhang, Ying Fang, Tianying Wang, Minli Wu, Zhanglin Li, Xiaochuan Zhang, Haipu Li, Jingjing Yao
Abstract: Accurately identifying synthesis conditions for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) remains a critical bottleneck in materials research, as translating literature-derived knowledge into actionable insights is hindered by the unstructured and heterogeneous nature of scientific texts. Here we present MOFh6, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to extract, structure, and apply synthesis knowledge from diverse input formats, including raw literature and crystal codes. Built on gpt-4o-mini and fine-tuned with up to few-shot expert-annotated data, MOFh6 achieves 99% accuracy in synthesis data parsing and resolves 94.1% of complex co-reference abbreviations. It processes a single full-text document in 9.6 seconds and localizes structured synthesis descriptions within 36 seconds, with the cost per 100 papers reduced to USD 4.24, a 76% saving over existing systems. By addressing long-standing limitations in cross-paragraph semantic fusion and terminology standardization, MOFh6 reshapes the LLM-based paradigm for MOF synthesis research, transforming static retrieval into an integrated and dynamic knowledge acquisition process. This shift bridges the gap between scientific literature and actionable synthesis design, providing a scalable framework for accelerating materials discovery.

Title: The Yang-Baxter integrability of the critical Ising chain
Authors: Akash Sinha, Tinu Justin, Pramod Padmanabhan, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.

Title: Universal cooling of quantum systems via randomized measurements
Authors: Josias Langbehn, George Mouloudakis, Emma King, Raphaël Menu, Igor Gornyi, Giovanna Morigi, Yuval Gefen, Christiane P. Koch
Abstract: Designing cooling protocols is believed to require knowledge of the system spectrum. In contrast, cooling in nature occurs whenever the system is coupled to a cold bath. How does nature know how to cool? A natural cold bath can be mimicked with a reservoir of "meter" qubits that are initialized in their ground state. We show that a quantum system can be cooled without knowledge of system details when system-meter interactions and meter splittings are chosen randomly. For sufficiently small interaction strengths and long interaction times, the protocol ensures that resonant energy-exchange processes, leading to cooling, dominate over heating. Effectively, the dynamics is then captured by the rotating-wave approximation, which we identify as the basic mechanism for robust and scalable cooling of complex quantum systems through generic, structure-independent protocols. This offers a versatile universal framework for controlling quantum matter far from equilibrium, in particular, for quantum computing and simulation.

Title: Optimal observables for (non-)equilibrium quantum metrology from the master equation
Authors: Víctor López-Pardo, Alexander Rothkopf
Abstract: We demonstrate how observables with optimal sensitivity to environmental properties can be constructed explicitly from the master equation of an open-quantum system. Our approach does not rely on the explicit solution of the master equation. This makes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD), the operator of optimal sensitivity and key quantity in quantum metrology, available to a large class of systems of interest, both in and out-of-equilibrium. We validate our approach by reproducing the SLD for temperature in quantum Brownian motion and demonstrate its versatility by constructing the optimal observable for the non-equilibrium relaxation rate.

Title: Balanced multi-species spin glasses
Authors: Erik Bates, Youngtak Sohn
Abstract: We identify a special class of multi-species spin glass models: ones in which the species proportions serve to ''balance'' out the interaction strengths. For this class, we prove a free energy lower bound that does not require any convexity assumption, and applies to both Ising and spherical models. The lower bound is the free energy of a single-species model whose $p$-spin inverse-temperature parameter is exactly the variance of the $p$-spin component of the multi-species Hamiltonian. For the Ising case, this generalizes an inequality recently found by Issa in the context of vector spin models. We further demonstrate that this lower bound is actually an equality in many cases, including: at high temperatures for all models, at all temperatures for convex models, and at zero temperature for pure bipartite spherical models. When translated to a statement about the injective norm of a nonsymmetric Gaussian tensor, our lower bound matches an upper bound recently established by Dartois and McKenna.

Title: Improving Multislice Electron Ptychography with a Generative Prior
Authors: Christian K. Belardi, Chia-Hao Lee, Yingheng Wang, Justin Lovelace, Kilian Q. Weinberger, David A. Muller, Carla P. Gomes
Abstract: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is an inverse imaging technique that computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods.

Title: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Inverse Design of Metasurfaces for Tailored Narrow Band Absorption
Authors: Sreeraj Rajan Warrier, Jayasri Dontabhaktuni
Abstract: The inverse design of metasurfaces poses a considerable challenge because of the intricate interdependencies that exist between structural characteristics and electromagnetic responses. Traditional optimization methods require significant computational resources and frequently do not produce the most effective solutions. This study presents a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning approach known as Latent Style-based Quantum GAN (LaSt-QGAN). This method integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to enhance the optimization of metasurface designs aimed at achieving narrow-band absorption and unidirectionality. The proposed method results in a reduction of training time by 10X and a decrease in data requirements by 40X when compared to traditional GAN-based approaches. The produced metasurface designs demonstrate a high fidelity in relation to the target absorption spectra compared to the classical GAN based methods. Additionally, the integration of a material look-up table facilitates manufacturability by allowing for the substitution of predicted material properties with viable alternatives, all while preserving performance accuracy. Moreover the model is able to generate Q-factor upto the order of $10^4$, while the training dataset has Q-factor upto the order of $10^3$.
