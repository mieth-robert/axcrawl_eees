Title: Vestigial $d$-wave charge-$4e$ Superconductivity from Bidirectional Pair Density Waves
Authors: Ethan Huecker, Yuxuan Wang
Abstract: We analyze the leading vestigial instability due to the melting of a bidirectional pair-density-wave state in two dimensions. In a previous work by one of the authors, it was found that the interplay between pair-density-wave fluctuations with ordering momenta along the $x$ and $y$ directions can provide a strong attractive interaction for charge-$4e$ superconductivity in the $d$-wave channel. In this work, we go beyond the artificial large-$M$ mean-field theory previously adopted and compute the phase diagram by incorporating phase fluctuations of the pair-density-wave order parameters. By investigating the relevance of various topological defects, we show that the interaction in the $d$-wave channel, together with the strong anisotropy of phase fluctuations around the pair-density-wave ordering momenta, favors a vestigial charge-$4e$ superconducting order at intermediate temperatures. By contrast, a competing charge-density-wave vestigial order does not develop, due to the suppression of its stiffness.

Title: Effects of intertube dipole-dipole interactions in nearly integrable one-dimensional $^{162}$Dy gases
Authors: Yicheng Zhang, Kangning Yang, Benjamin L. Lev, Marcos Rigol
Abstract: We study the effects of the intertube dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) in recent experiments with arrays of nearly integrable one-dimensional (1D) dipolar Bose gases of $^{162}$Dy atoms. An earlier theoretical modeling ignored those interactions, which we include here via a modification of the 1D confining potentials. We investigate the effects of the intertube DDI both during the state preparation and during the measurements of the rapidity distributions. We explore how the strength of the contact interactions and the magnetic field angles modify the intertube DDI corrections. We find that those corrections slightly change both the properties of the equilibrium state and the rapidity measurements. Remarkably, however, the changes nearly cancel each other, resulting in measured rapidity distributions that are very close to those predicted in the absence of the intertube DDI.

Title: Scalable accuracy gains from postselection in quantum error correcting codes
Authors: Hongkun Chen, Daohong Xu, Grace M. Sommers, David A. Huse, Jeff D. Thompson, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: Decoding stabilizer codes such as the surface and toric codes involves evaluating free-energy differences in a disordered statistical mechanics model, in which the randomness comes from the observed pattern of error syndromes. We study the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed syndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical failures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes. Therefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome patterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate can be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \geq 2$ in general; in the specific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find numerically that $b = 3.1(1)$. Our arguments apply to general topological stabilizer codes, and can be extended to more general settings as long as the decoding failure probability obeys a large deviation principle.

Title: Superfluid weight in disordered flat-band superconductors as a competition between localization functionals
Authors: Kryštof Kolář, Tero T. Heikkilä, Päivi Törmä
Abstract: According to Anderson's theorem, the gap of a time-reversal symmetric weak-coupling superconductor is unaffected by non-magnetic disorder. However, the superfluid weight (stiffness) is reduced in the disordered limit by a factor of $\Delta \tau$, a product of the scattering time $\tau$ and the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$. Here we show that the opposite holds true in flat-band superconductors. While non-magnetic disorder does reduce the order parameter, we find that its direct effect on superfluid weight is mostly negligible. We show analytically that the effect of disorder is to lowest order given in terms of the difference between the intraband and interband parts of the localization functional of impurity wavefunctions, finding it to be typically vanishing.

Title: Spin-spiral instability of the Nagaoka ferromagnet in the crossover between square and triangular lattices
Authors: Darren Pereira, Erich J. Mueller
Abstract: We study the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model in the crossover between square and triangular lattices near half-filling. As was recognized by Nagaoka in the 1960s, on the square lattice the presence of a single hole leads to ferromagnetic spin ordering. On the triangular lattice, geometric frustration instead leads to a spin-singlet ground state, which can be associated with a 120-degree spiral order. On lattices which interpolate between square and triangular, there is a phase transition at which the ferromagnetic order becomes unstable to a spin spiral. We model this instability, finding the exact critical point.

Title: TeMFpy: a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states into tensor networks
Authors: Simon H. Hille, Attila Szabó
Abstract: We introduce TeMFpy, a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states to finite or infinite matrix product state (MPS) form. TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.

Title: Boundary criticality in two-dimensional correlated topological superconductors
Authors: Yang Ge, Huan Jiang, Hong Yao, Shao-Kai Jian
Abstract: The presence of a boundary enriches the nature of quantum phase transitions. However, the boundary critical phenomena in topological superconductors remain underexplored so far. Here, we investigate the boundary criticality in a two-dimensional correlated time-reversal-invariant topological superconductor tuned through a quantum phase transition into a trivial time-reversal-breaking superconductor. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we chart the quantum phase diagram and reveal the boundary criticalities encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. Additionally, using renormalization group analysis, we compute the boundary critical exponent up to two loops. Remarkably, the simulations and two-loop renormalization group calculations consistently demonstrate that the presence of the boundary Majorana fermion at the special transition gives rise to a new type of boundary Gross-Neveu-Yukawa fixed point. We conclude with a discussion of possible experimental realizations in iron-based superconductors.

Title: Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in vanadium Kagome metals
Authors: Alex Friedlan, Hae-Young Kee
Abstract: The family of layered Kagome metals $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$ has recently attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, as suggested by their response to magnetic fields. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic phase that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Starting from a nine-band tight-binding model and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, we find nematic order to emerge in a narrow region of phase space within mean-field theory. The nematic state is a superposition of charge-bond order along one Kagome bond and loop-current order on the other two, preserving one of the three mirror planes. To understand this behaviour, we examine an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Within the effective model, nematic order is stabilized by the coupling between the complex phases of the three bond order parameters. As a consequence, the nematic phase develops an elongated Fermi surface distinct from those of competing phases.

Title: Variational and field-theoretical approach to exciton-exciton interactions and biexcitons in semiconductors
Authors: Peter A. Noordman, Lucas Maisel Licerán, Henk T. C. Stoof
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general description of their interactions is complicated due to their composite nature, which leads to exchange between the identical fermions of different excitons. In this work we employ a variational approach to study interactions between Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This potential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the particles. When particularized to hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, it becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the Heitler-London potential to arbitrary masses. Including corrections due to excited states results in a van der Waals potential at large distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a many-body theory for a gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in the field representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal exchange processes arise in the field-theoretical treatment, and show that the diagrams corresponding to the interactions between excitons align with our variational calculation when evaluated on shell. Our methods and results lay the groundwork for a generalized theory of exciton-exciton interactions and their application to the study of biexciton spectra and correlated excitonic matter.

Title: Semiconductor Meta-Graphene and Valleytronics
Authors: Praveen Pai, Aron W. Cummings, Alexander Cerjan, Wei Pan, Fan Zhang, Catalin D. Spataru
Abstract: Nano-patterned semiconductor interfaces offer a versatile platform for creating quantum metamaterials and exploring novel electronic phenomena. In this study, we illustrate this concept using artificial graphene--a metamaterial featuring distinctive properties including Dirac and saddle points. We demonstrate that introducing additional nano-patterning can open a Dirac band gap, giving rise to what we term artificial hexagonal boron nitride (AhBN). The calculated valley Chern number of AhBN indicates the presence of topological valley Hall states confined to Dirac-gap domain walls. A key question is whether these one-dimensional edge states are topologically protected against disorder, given their vulnerability to Anderson localization. To this end, we perform band structure and electronic transport simulations under experimentally relevant disorder, including charge puddles and geometric imperfections. Our results reveal the resilience of the domain wall states against typical experimental disorder, particularly while the AhBN band gap remains open. The localization length along the domain wall can reach several microns--several times longer than the bulk electron mean free path--even though the number of bulk transport channels is greater. To enhance the effectiveness of the low-dissipation domain wall channel, we propose ribbon geometries with a large length-to-width ratio. These findings underscore both the potential and challenges of AhBN for low-energy, power-efficient microelectronic applications.

Title: Topological Protection in a Landau Flat Band at $ν=7/11$, a Candidate Filling Factor for Unconventional Correlations
Authors: Waseem Hussain, Haoyun Huang, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Kenneth W. West, Kirk. W. Baldwin, Gábor A. Csáthy
Abstract: Strong interactions in Landau flat bands are known to stabilize correlated states that do not form in other types of flat bands. We report hallmarks of topological protection at the Landau level filling factor v=7/11 in a two-dimensional electron system. The $\nu=7/11$ filling factor is the particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=4/11$, a filling factor intensely studied for the possibility of realizing unconventional electronic correlations. Our data establishes a new instance for an unusual fractional quantum Hall state and opens up possibilities for the study of unconventional correlations in an enlarged parameter space. We report and discuss transport signatures developing at other filling factors of interest $\nu= 11/17$, $5/8$, and $8/13$, which however in our sample do not exhibit topological protection.

Title: Tunable electronic energy level alignment and exciton diversity in organic-inorganic van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Aurélie Champagne, Olugbenga Adeniran, Jonah B. Haber, Antonios M. Alvertis, Zhen-Fei Liu, Jeffrey B. Neaton
Abstract: van der Waals stacking of two-dimensional (2D) materials offers a powerful platform for engineering material interfaces with tailored electronic and optical properties. While most van der Waals multilayers have featured inorganic monolayers, incorporating molecular monolayers introduces new degrees of tunability and functionality. Here, we investigate hybrid bilayers composed of atomically thin perylene-based molecular crystals interfaced with monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically MoS2 and WS2. Using ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach, we predict emergent properties beyond those of the isolated constituent systems. Notably, we find substantial renormalization of monolayer molecular crystal band gap due to TMD-induced polarization. Furthermore, by varying the TMD monolayer, we demonstrate tuning of the energy level alignment of the bilayer and subsequent control over a diversity of lowest-energy excitons, which include strongly bound hybrid excitons and long-lived charge-transfer excitons. These findings establish organic-inorganic van der Waals heterostructures as a promising class of materials for tunable optoelectronic devices and quantum excitonic phenomena, expanding the design space for low-dimensional systems.

Title: Switchable spin-photon coupling with hole spins in single-quantum dots
Authors: Carlos Sagaseta, María José Calderón, José Carlos Abadillo-Uriel
Abstract: Spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots offer a gate-tunable platform for quantum information processing. While two-qubit interactions are typically realized through exchange coupling between neighboring spins, coupling spin qubits to photons via hybrid spin-cQED devices enables long-range interactions and integration with other cQED platforms. Here, we investigate hole spin-photon coupling in compact single quantum dot setups. By incorporating ubiquitous strain inhomogeneities to our theory, we identify three main spin-photon coupling channels: a vector-potential-spin-orbit geometric mechanism--dominant for vertical magnetic fields--, an inhomogeneous Rashba term generalizing previous spin-orbit field models, and strain-induced $g$-tensor terms--most relevant for in-plane fields. Comparing Si, unstrained (relaxed) Ge, and biaxially strained Ge wells, we find that Si and unstrained Ge provide optimal coupling strengths (tens of MHz) thanks to their reduced heavy-hole, light-hole splitting. We demonstrate efficient switching of the spin-photon coupling while preserving sweet spot operation. Finally, we evaluate quantum state transfer and two-qubit gate protocols, achieving $>99\%$ fidelity for state transfer and $>90\%$ for two-qubit gates with realistic coherence times, establishing single-dot hole spins as a viable platform for compact spin-cQED architectures and highlighting unstrained Ge as a promising candidate for spin-photon interactions.

Title: Fermi surface and Berry phase analysis for Dirac nodal line semimetals: cautionary tale to SrGa$_2$ and BaGa$_2$
Authors: Yuxiang Gao, Yichen Zhang, Shiming Lei, Neil Harrison, Mun Keat Chan, Jonathan D. Denlinger, Sergey Gorovikov, Sanu Mishra, Yan Sun, Ming Yi, Emilia Morosan
Abstract: A Berry phase of odd multiples of $\pi$ inferred from quantum oscillations (QOs) has often been treated as evidence for nontrivial reciprocal space topology. However, disentangling the Berry phase values from the Zeeman effect and the orbital magnetic moment is often challenging. In centrosymmetric compounds, the case is simpler as the orbital magnetic moment contribution is negligible. Although the Zeeman effect can be significant, it is usually overlooked in most studies of QOs in centrosymmetric compounds. Here, we present a detailed study on the non-magnetic centrosymmetric $\mathrm{SrGa_2}$ and $\mathrm{BaGa_2}$, which are predicted to be Dirac nodal line semimetals (DNLSs) based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Evidence of the nontrivial topology is found in magnetotransport measurements. The Fermi surface topology and band structure are carefully studied through a combination of angle-dependent QOs, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and DFT calculations, where the nodal line is observed in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Strong de Haas-van Alphen fundamental oscillations associated with higher harmonics are observed in both compounds, which are well-fitted by the Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) formula. However, even with the inclusion of higher harmonics in the fitting, we found that the Berry phases cannot be unambiguously determined when the Zeeman effect is included. We revisit the LK formula and analyze the phenomena and outcomes that were associated with the Zeeman effect in previous studies. Our experimental results confirm that $\mathrm{SrGa_2}$ and $\mathrm{BaGa_2}$ are Dirac nodal line semimetals. Additionally, we highlight the often overlooked role of spin-damping terms in Berry phase analysis.

Title: Thermodynamics of proton insertion across the perovskite-brownmillerite transition in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ
Authors: Armand J. Lannerd, Nathan J. Szymanski, Christopher J. Bartel
Abstract: La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$CoO3-$\delta$ is a promising off-stoichiometric metal oxide that undergoes a topotactic perovskite ($\delta$ = 0) to brownmillerite ($\delta$ = 0.5) transition under electrochemical and thermochemical stimuli, with concomitant variations in its electrical, magnetic, thermal, and optical properties. Recent studies on thin-film cycling in electrochemical devices show incomplete reversibility of this transition, with significant acid-etching serving as a degradation mechanism. While earlier investigations examined the protonation of brownmillerite SrCoO2.5, the thermodynamics of protonation across the perovskite-to-brownmillerite transition remain poorly understood. In this work, we combine density functional theory calculations with predictions from universal machine-learning interatomic potentials to elucidate the energetics and implications of protonation across the transition for La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$. These calculations reveal negative hydrogen insertion energies and strong competition with oxygen vacancy formation across the transition for a wide range of conditions. The extent of protonation is primarily limited by the availability of Co 3d states to accommodate reduction by inserted hydrogen. Although hydrogen insertion is often thermodynamically favorable within a defect picture, a convex hull analysis of the resulting HyLa0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$ phases reveals them to be unstable against decomposition into hydroxides among other products. This instability increases with hydrogen content and provides a thermodynamic basis for the acid-etching observed during electrochemical cycling. This work advances the fundamental understanding of protonation in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$ and contextualizes experimental observations of related materials in the presence of moisture or H2.

Title: Cation vacancies mediate thermochemical water splitting with iron aluminates
Authors: Nathan J. Szymanski, Kent J. Warren, Alan W. Weimer, Christopher J. Bartel
Abstract: Solar thermochemical water splitting enables hydrogen production by cycling metal oxides between reduced and oxidized states, typically through an oxygen vacancy mechanism. However, recent experimental work suggests that cation vacancies have a greater influence on the redox behavior of iron aluminate spinels used in water splitting. This remains debated, as calculations predict that such cation vacancies are thermodynamically unfavorable. In the current work, we show that Fe vacancies in (Fe$\zeta$Al1-$\zeta$)3O4 become accessible only when facilitated by inversion between Fe and Al. This antisite disorder lowers the formation energy of octahedral Fe vacancies in Al-rich spinels ($\zeta$ = 1/3) from over 3 eV to just 0.62 eV when one third of the cation sites are inverted, allowing high Fe vacancy concentrations under oxidizing conditions. This mechanism supports high H2 yields up to 361 $\mu$mol/g, consistent with experimental observations. Our findings support the notion that solar thermochemical water splitting can occur through a cation vacancy mechanism. They also clarify how site inversion, vacancy energetics, and defect interactions each contribute to redox performance, offering general design principles for identifying and optimizing materials that operate through cation vacancy cycling.

Title: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials Enable Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Doped MoS2
Authors: Abrar Faiyad, Ashlie Martini
Abstract: We present the first computational framework for molecular dynamics simulation of MoS2 doped with 25 elements spanning metals, non-metals, and transition metals using Meta's Universal Model for Atoms machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP). Benchmarking against density functional theory calculations demonstrates the accuracy of the MLIP for simulating doped-MoS2 systems and highlights opportunities for improvement. Using the MLIP, we perform heating-cooling simulations of doped-MoS2 supercells. The simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides an open-source computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance. The MLIP bridges the accuracy-efficiency gap between first-principles methods and empirical potentials, and the framework offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale materials discovery in two-dimensional doped material systems.

Title: Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States
Authors: Hui-Huang Chen
Abstract: We present an exact solution for a quantum quench in an integrable system that reveals a new, coherent pathway to thermalization. In chaotic systems, thermalization is understood via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which implies that a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state should exhibit trivial dynamics. In contrast, integrable systems are expected to retain memory of their initial conditions in a non-thermal generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We show that a quench from a TPQ state in the integrable spin-1/2 XX chain defies both expectations. The system thermalizes to a canonical Gibbs ensemble, yet the entanglement dynamics are highly non-trivial, exhibiting a "double plateau" structure. We solve this process exactly using techniques in two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories (CFT), an exact numerical method based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. We prove that the non-trivial dynamics are the macroscopic signature of the coherent dephasing of the initial state's anomalous pairing correlations.

Abstract: Measurement of a charge qubit via point contacts with complex internal structures is considered. In this context, a fully formalized derivation of the many-body wave function method is presented, together with the corresponding master equations for point contacts possessing an arbitrary number of internal states. The focus is placed on the current noise power spectrum and its dependence on the qubit dynamics and the point contact parameters.

Title: Investigation of the Effect of Thermal-Induced Atomic Motion on the Conductance of Copper Thin Films
Authors: Sihe Chen, Kevin Batzinger, Manuel Smeu
Abstract: Decrease in the size of integrated circuits (IC) and metal interconnects raise resistivity due the amplification of electron scattering effects, which decreases the efficiency of chiplets. While previous studies have investigated the electron scattering due to a roughened surface, the effect of thermal induced atomic motion on the roughened surface remains unclear. To address this gap, we investigated electron transport in pristine and roughened Cu thin films by performing \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories over 20~ps at temperatures of 218~K, 300~K, and 540~K on Cu thin film models, and then calculating the electron transport properties of the resulting snapshots at 100-fs intervals for the last 10~ps using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism in combination with density functional theory (NEGF-DFT). As expected, higher temperatures induce larger atomic displacement from their equilibrium positions and increase atomic layer separation. We also find that increase in temperature results in increased resistance (lower conductance) for the pristine film, but less so for the roughened thin film where the surface roughness itself is the main source of resistance. This study provides insights into how pristine and roughened Cu thin films behave under thermal conditions, helping researchers design better treatments to mitigate thermal effects in ICs and their metal interconnects.

Title: Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy of quantum wire-like dislocation states in ZnS
Authors: Alexander Blackston, Alexandra Fonseca Montenegro, Sevim Polat Genlik, Maryam Ghazisaeidi, Roberto C. Myers
Abstract: Recent \textit{ab initio} calculations predict 1D dispersive electronic bands confined to the atomic scale cores of dislocations in the wide bandgap (3.84 eV) semiconductor ZnS. We test these predictions by correlating sub-bandgap optical transitions with the density of dislocations formed during strain relaxation in epitaxial ZnS grown on GaP. The densities for four predicted partial dislocations are quantified using scanning electron microscopy-based electron channeling contrast imaging. Room-temperature ellipsometry reveals absorption peaks that scale with dislocation density and align with theoretical predictions. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectra show deep emission peaks matching dislocation 1D band-to-band transitions. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy reveals six distinct emission lines with contrasting excitation dependence. Four peaks (2.78, 2.41, 2.20, 1.88 eV), assigned to dislocations, exhibit only modest suppression ($\leq$5$\times$) when excited below the ZnS bandgap, while two other peaks (3.11, 1.53~eV) are strongly quenched ($>$10$\times$). These findings support the existence of efficient, 1D band-to-band radiative transitions within quantum wire-like dislocation core states in ZnS, distinct from typical non-radiative deep-level defects in wide-gap semiconductors.

Title: Quantum oscillations and anisotropic magnetoresistance in the quasi-two-dimensional Dirac nodal line superconductor $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$
Authors: Yuxiang Gao, Kevin Allen, Rose Albu Mustaf, Yichen Zhang, Sanu Mishra, Christopher Lane, Marta Zonno, Sergey Gorovikov, Jian-Xin Zhu, Ming Yi, Emilia Morosan
Abstract: Recent interest in quantum materials has focused on systems exhibiting both superconductivity and non-trivial band topology as material candidates to realize topological or unconventional superconducting states. So far, superconductivity in most topological materials has been identified as type II. In this work, we present magnetotransport studies on the quasi-two-dimensional type I superconductor $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$. Combined ab initio DFT calculations and quantum oscillation measurements confirm that $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$ is a Dirac nodal line semimetal in the normal state. The complex Fermi surface morphology is evidenced by the non-monotonic angular dependence of both the quantum oscillation amplitude and the magnetoresistance. Our results establish $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$ as a candidate material platform for exploring the interplay between band topology and superconductivity.

Title: Imaging Nanoscale Carrier, Thermal, and Structural Dynamics with Time-Resolved and Ultrafast Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy
Authors: Wonseok Lee, Levi D. Palmer, Thomas E. Gage, Scott K. Cushing
Abstract: Time-resolved and ultrafast electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is an emerging technique for measuring photoexcited carriers, lattice dynamics, and near-fields across femtosecond to microsecond timescales. When performed in either a specialized scanning transmission electron microscope or ultrafast electron microscope (UEM), time-resolved and ultrafast EELS can directly image charge carriers, lattice vibrations, and heat dissipation following photoexcitation or applied bias. Yet recent advances in theoretical calculations and electron optics are often required to realize the full potential of ultrafast EEL spectrum imaging. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the recent progress in the theory and instrumentation of time-resolved and ultrafast EELS. We begin with an introduction to the technique, followed by a physical description of the loss function. We outline approaches for calculating and interpreting ground-state and transient EEL spectra spanning low-loss plasmons to core-level excitations analogous to X-ray absorption. We then survey the current state of time-resolved and ultrafast EELS techniques beyond photon-induced near-field electron microscopy, highlighting abilities to image carrier and thermal dynamics. Finally, we examine future directions enabled by emerging technologies, including electron beam monochromation, in situ and operando cells, laser-free UEM, and high-speed direct electron detectors. These advances position time-resolved and ultrafast EELS as a critical tool for uncovering nanoscale dynamic processes in quantum materials and solar energy conversion devices.

Title: The roles of elasticity and dimension in liquid-gel phase separation
Authors: Shichen Wang, Peter D. Olmsted
Abstract: We compare six elastic models for polymer networks in the context of phase separation within a gel, including a new model that combines the finite extensible Arruda-Boyce model and the slip tube model for entangled chains. We study incompressible uniaxial stretch and compression, and three volume-changing constrained-dimension deformations, in which the material can only deform in the designated dimensions(s) while the constrained direction(s) remain(s) the same. Each model responds differently to large deformations, and our proposed model successfully describes both strain softening and strain hardening, which are both present in well-entangled elastomers. When considering phase separation, we show that the commonly-used neo-Hookean model fails to admit a common tangent construction for phase coexistence for 3D deformations. This can be resolved by using a model with finite extension, such as the Arruda-Boyce model. In constrained-dimension deformations, where the gel's volume is allowed to change, for elastic models in which phase coexistence is possible, the critical temperatures increases and the critical concentration decreases with increasing deformation dimensions. This strong dependence of the phase diagram on spatial dimension and geometry distinguishes phase separation elastic media from conventional phase separation.

Title: Unveiling the physical attributes of CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 compounds: A first-principles study for next-generation photovoltaics
Authors: Md Hasan Shahriar Rifat, Tanvir Khan, Md Arafat Hossain Shourov, Md Sahat Bin Sayed, Md Saiful Islam
Abstract: The electronic and optical properties of CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 were studied using first-principles DFT calculations. Band gaps were calculated using the GGA-PBESol functional. Both materials show promise for photovoltaic applications because of their large, near-unity absorption efficiencies (10^4 cm^-1) in the visible region. They exhibit low exciton binding energies (18.85-26.81 meV), large Bohr radii (23-34.3 Angstrom), and moderate exciton temperatures (218-311 K), which are favorable for photovoltaic applications. Their performance as solar cells was simulated using the SCAPS-1D tool for thin-film devices with Pt/CdS/CdGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti and Pt/CdS/ZnGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti structures. We investigated the effects of layer thickness, donor and acceptor concentrations (shallow donors/acceptors), and defect density on device performance. The ideal absorber thickness for XGa2Te4 (X = Cd, Zn) was found to be 1000-1800 nm, and the CdS buffer layer around 150 nm. To obtain an efficiency above 20%, the defect density in the CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 absorber layers should be kept below 1.772 x 10^13 cm^-3. The best simulations show efficiencies of 18.46% and 17.35% for CdGa2Te4- and ZnGa2Te4-based solar cells, respectively.

Title: Surface Excess Energy Governs the Non-Monotonic Behavior of Active Diffusivity with Activity
Authors: A. Arango-Restrepo, J.M. Rubi
Abstract: Self-propulsion of particles is typically explained by phoretic mechanisms driven by externally imposed chemical, electric, or thermal gradients. In contrast, chemical reactions can enhance particle diffusion even in the absence of such external gradients. We refer to this increase as active diffusivity, often attributed to self-diffusiophoresis or self-electrophoresis, although these mechanisms alone do not fully account for experimental observations. Here, we investigate active diffusivity in catalytic Janus particles immersed in reactive media without imposed gradients. We show that interfacial reactions generate excess surface energy and sustained interfacial stresses that supplement thermal energy, enabling diffusion beyond the classical thermal limit. We consistently quantify this contribution using both dissipative and non-dissipative approaches, assuming that the aqueous bath remains near equilibrium. Our framework reproduces experimentally observed trends in diffusivity versus activity, including the non-monotonic behaviors reported in some systems, and agrees with data for nanometric Janus particles catalyzing charged substrates as well as vesicles with membrane-embedded enzymes driven by ATP hydrolysis. These results demonstrate that chemical reactions can induce and sustain surface-tension gradients and surface excess energy, providing design principles for tuning mobility in synthetic active matter.

Title: Cryogenic growth of aluminum: structural morphology, optical properties, superconductivity and microwave dielectric loss
Authors: Wilson J. Yánez-Parreño, Teun A. J. van Schijndel, Anthony P. McFadden, Kaixuan Ji, Susheng Tan, Yu Wu, Sergey Frolov, Stefan Zollner, Raymond W. Simmonds, Christopher J. Palmstrøm
Abstract: We explore the molecular beam epitaxy synthesis of superconducting aluminum thin films grown on c-plane sapphire substrates at cryogenic temperatures of 6 K and compare their behavior with films synthesized at room temperature. We demonstrate that cryogenic growth increases structural disorder, producing crystalline grains that modify the optical, electrical, and superconducting properties of aluminum. We observe that cryogenic deposition changes the color of aluminum from fully reflective to yellow and correlate the pseudo-dielectric function and reflectance with structural changes in the film. We find that smaller grain sizes enhance the superconductivity of aluminum, increasing its critical temperature and critical field. We then estimate the superconducting gap and coherence length of Cooper pairs in aluminum in the presence of disorder. Finally, we fabricate superconducting microwave resonators on these films and find that, independently of the growth temperature, the system is dominated by two-level system loss with similar quality factors in the high and low power regimes. We further measure a higher kinetic inductance in the cryogenically grown films.

Title: Full counting statistics of electron-photon hybrid systems: Joint statistics and fluctuation symmetry
Authors: Tianyi Xiao, Junjie Liu
Abstract: Electron-photon hybrid systems serve as ideal light-matter interfaces with broad applications in quantum technologies. These systems are typically operated dynamically under nonequilibrium conditions, giving rise to coupled electronic and photonic currents. Understanding the joint fluctuation behavior of these currents is essential for assessing the performance of light-matter interfaces that rely on electron-photon correlations. Here, we investigate the full counting statistics of coupled electronic and photonic currents in an experimentally feasible hybrid system composed of a double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity. We employ the framework of quantum Lindblad master equation which is augmented with both electronic and photonic counting fields to derive their joint cumulant generating function--a treatment that differs significantly from existing studies, which typically focus on either electron or photon statistics separately. We reveal that the ratio between photonic and electronic currents, as well as their variances, can deviate from an expected quadratic scaling law in the large electron-photon coupling regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that conventional modelings of photonic dissipation channels in quantum master equations must be modified to ensure that the joint cumulant generating function satisfies the fluctuation symmetry enforced by the fluctuation theorem. Our results advance the understanding of joint fluctuation behaviors in electron-photon hybrid systems and may inform the design of efficient quantum light-matter interfaces.

Title: Spin Symmetry Criteria for Odd-parity Magnets
Authors: Xun-Jiang Luo, Jin-Xin Hu, K. T. Law
Abstract: Inspired by the discovery of altermagnets, which exhibit even-parity nonrelativistic spin splitting, odd-parity magnets (OPMs) have been proposed and emerged as a novel research frontier. In this study, we perform a comprehensive spin group symmetry analysis to establish symmetry criteria for the emergence of OPMs. We identify eight distinct symmetry-driven cases that support OPMs, enabling their realization in collinear, coplanar, and noncoplanar magnetic orders. These OPMs are categorized into three types based on their spin textures for Bloch states: collinear (type-I), coplanar (type-II), and noncoplanar (type-III). For type-I OPMs, we further delineate additional symmetry requirements for $p$-wave and $f$-wave spin splitting. We identify 48 candidate materials in the Magndata database that satisfy these symmetry criteria. Additionally, we construct two theoretical models to validate the effectiveness of the established symmetry criteria. Finally, we show that OPMs can exhibit an intrinsic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and construct a theoretical model to realize this phase.

Title: Memory behavior of a randomly driven model glass
Authors: Roni Chatterjee, Smarajit Karmakar, Muhittin Mungan, Damien Vandembroucq
Abstract: We investigate by atomistic simulations the memory behavior a model glass subjected to random driving protocols. The training consists of a random walk of forward and/or backward shearing sequences bounded by a maximal shear strain of absolute value {\gamma}T . We show that such a stochastic training protocol is able to record the training amplitude. Different read-out protocols are also tested and are shown to be able to retrieve the training amplitude. We then emphasize the ten- sorial character of the memory encoded in the glass sample and then characterize the anisotropic mechanical behavior of the trained samples.

Title: Probing orbital currents through inverse orbital Hall and Rashba effects
Authors: E. Santos, J. L. Costa, R.L. Rodriguez-Suarez, J. B. S. Mendes, A. Azevedo
Abstract: We report a comprehensive experimental investigation of orbital-to-charge conversion in metallic and semiconductor materials, emphasizing the fundamental roles of the inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE) and the inverse orbital Rashba effect. Using spin pumping driven by ferromagnetic resonance (SP-FMR) and the spin Seebeck effect (SSE), we demonstrate efficient orbital current generation and detection in YIG/Pt/NM structures, where NM is either a metal or a semiconductor. A central finding is the dominance of orbital contributions over spin-related effects, even in systems with weak spin-orbit coupling. In particular, a large enhancement of the SP-FMR and SSE signals is observed in the presence of naturally oxidized Cu in different heterostructures. Furthermore, we identify positive and negative IOHE signals in Ti and Ge, respectively, and extract orbital diffusion lengths in both systems using a diffusive model. Our results confirm the presence of orbital transport and offer valuable insights that may guide the further development of orbitronics.

Title: Co-evaporated Formamidinium tin triiodide with suppressed p-type self-doping
Authors: Junhyoung Park, Andrea Olivati, Mirko Prato, Min Kim, Annamaria Petrozza
Abstract: Co-evaporation of formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) precursors, without any additives or reducing agents, leads to the growth of a highly crystalline thin film which shows a bandgap around 1.31 eV, closely matching the theoretical value predicted from the ideal single crystal structure of FASnI3. The polycrystalline thin film presents a lower tendency of Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation and highly reduced tendency to self-doping, demonstrating, overall, an improved resistance to defects formation. These findings suggest solvent-free co-evaporation processes as a promising route for high quality Sn-based perovskite polycrystalline thin films.

Title: Engineering Magnetic States and Magnetoresistance in Bisegmented Co-Ni Jellyfish Nanowires via Interplay of Shape and Magnetocrystalline Anisotropies
Authors: M.I. Sobirov, K.A. Rogachev, M.A. Bazrov, Zh. Zh. Namsaraev, I.M. Sapovskii, T.R. Rakhmatullaev, N.V. Ilin, A.O Lembikov, S.M. Pisarev, A.V. Ognev, A.S. Samardak, A.Yu. Samardak
Abstract: Expanding the spectrum of 3D magnetic nanostructures requires mastering the interplay between different anisotropy contributions. Here, we fabricate bisegmented jellyfish nanowires with tailored arrangements of Co (strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy) and Ni (dominant shape anisotropy) segments. We uncover a unique magnetic duality: Co segments can be tuned to exhibit either a flux-closing multidomain state or a shape-anisotropy-dominated vortex configuration, directly governed by their geometry. This local domain structure, imaged by MFM and simulated micromagnetically, dictates the global magnetic response-suppressing magnetostatic interactions in arrays and enabling the programming of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in single nanowires. Our work provides a blueprint for designing functional magnetic nanomaterials where magnetoresistive properties are engineered through strategic anisotropy control.

Title: From High-Entropy Ceramics (HECs) to Compositionally Complex Ceramics (CCCs) and Beyond
Authors: Jian Luo
Abstract: Over the past decade, the field of high-entropy ceramics (HECs) has rapidly expanded to encompass a wide range of oxides, borides, silicides, and other ceramic solid solutions. In 2020, we proposed extending the concept of HECs to compositionally complex ceramics (CCCs), in which non-equimolar compositions and the presence of long- or short-range order reduce entropy while offering new opportunities to tailor and enhance properties, often beyond those of higher-entropy counterparts. Here, fundamental questions arise: Is the entropy in HECs truly high? Should maximizing entropy always be our goal? This perspective article revisits key concepts and terminologies and highlights emerging directions, including dual-phase CCCs, ultrahigh-entropy phases, and novel processing routes such as ultrafast reactive sintering. We propose that exploring compositional complexity across vast non-equimolar spaces, together with correlated disorder (coupled short-range chemical and structural orders), offers a more effective strategy for designing ceramics with superior performance than simply maximizing entropy.

Title: Valley-dependent topological interface states in biased armchair nanoribbons in gapless graphene
Authors: Zheng-Han Huang, Jing-Yuan Lai, Yu-Shu G. Wu
Abstract: We investigate an electrical bias-controlled, topological kind discontinuity in valley polarization, in a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of gapless graphene, where the discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. In particular, using an efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation, we explicitly obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions of discontinuity-induced, interface-confined electron eigenstates, in a reference configuration. Moreover, implications of the confinement for electron transport are explored. A configurational variation is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. Such states are shown to result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of the quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is also illustrated with respect to configurational fluctuations, demonstrating their potential detectability in realistic devices and suggesting transport spectroscopy as a practical probe of valley-dependent topological interface physics in graphene nanoribbons.

Title: Liquid-gas analog multicriticality in a frustrated Ising bilayer
Authors: Yuchen Fan
Abstract: We report the discovery of a multicritical point that extends the liquid-gas paradigm to systems with competing symmetry-breaking orders. Using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of a frustrated bilayer Ising antiferromagnet with tunable couplings, we map out a rich finite-temperature phase diagram hosting three ordered phases separated by both continuous and first-order transitions. By tuning the couplings, a tricritical line and a critical end-point line converge into a single multicritical line. At all points along the multicritical line, symmetry-distinct phases exhibit identical leading critical behavior -- consistent with the tricritical Ising universality class -- while the subleading exponent exhibits a sharp shift from $y_g = 0.8$ to $y_g = 1$. This shift reflects an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry akin to that of the liquid-gas critical point, but realized here at a genuine multicritical point involving simultaneous microscopic symmetry breaking. Our results establish a universality scenario in which emergent symmetry preserves the leading class but reorganizes subleading scaling, providing a general mechanism for symmetry-enforced multicriticality.

Title: Signatures of superconducting Higgs mode in irradiated Josephson junctions
Authors: Aritra Lahiri, Juan Carlos Cuevas, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: The Higgs mode, originally proposed in the context of superconductivity, corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter. Recent THz-domain optical studies have found signatures consistent with the Higgs mode, but its unambiguous detection is still challenging. We predict that the existence of the Higgs mode can be unambiguously revealed by standard measurements of the transport characteristics in microwave-irradiated asymmetric and transparent Josephson junctions. One signature of the Higgs mode in a Josephson junction is the microwave-induced enhancement of the second harmonic of the equilibrium current-phase relation (at zero DC bias voltage), whose sign differs from its expected value in the absence of the Higgs mode. As the radiation frequency is varied, this enhancement exhibits resonant behavior when the microwave frequency is tuned across the Higgs mass. The second signature that we propose is the enhancement of the second harmonic of the AC Josephson current at finite DC voltage bias, which can be probed in a customary analysis of the Shapiro steps in a microwave-irradiated junction.

Title: Giant and robust Josephson diode effect in multiband topological nanowires
Authors: Bao-Zong Wang, Zi-Kai Li, Zhong-Da Li, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: We theoretically predict the giant and robust Josephson diode effect in quasi-one-dimensional topological Majorana nanowires in the regime with multiple subbands, which is expected to be relevant for the real experiment. In the multiband regime, the Majorana bound states and conventional Andreev bound states can naturally coexist, and respectively contribute to the fractional and conventional parts in the Josephson effect, with the former/latter having 4$\pi$/2$\pi$-periodicity. We show that the interplay between the two types of bound modes can produce a robust and giant diode effect in the deep topological phase regime. Notably, we unveil a novel spin parity exchange mechanism, occurring only in the multiband regime, which leads to a robust high efficiency plateau of the giant diode effect. This effect is a nontrivial consequence of the balanced Fermi moment shifts of the multiple subbands in tuning the external magnetic field. Our finding highlights the subband engineering as a powerful tool to optimize the Josephson diode effect realistically and provides a new feasible signature to identify topological phase regime in superconducting nanowires.

Title: Measurement of the Quantum Capacitance Between Two Metallic Electrodes
Authors: T. de Ara, B. Olivera, C. Sabater, C. Untiedt
Abstract: Two factors contribute to the electrical capacitance between two electrodes: a classical contribution, stemming from the electric field, and a quantum contribution, governed by the Pauli exclusion principle, which increases the difficulty of adding charge to the electrodes. In metals, the high electronic Density of States (DOS) at the Fermi energy allows the quantum contribution to be neglected, and a classical description of the electrical capacitance between two metallic electrodes is normally used. Here, we study the evolution of the capacitance as two metallic electrodes (Pt or Au) are approached to the limit when quantum corrections are needed, before contact formation. At small distances, we observe that the classical increase in capacitance turns into saturation as the electrodes are approached, reaching the quantum capacitance limit. Finally, a capacitance leakage due to quantum tunneling is observed. Since the quantum capacitance depends on the electronic DOS on the surface of the electrodes, we use it to probe the DOS change induced by molecular adsorption (Toluene) on the metallic surface.

Title: Dynamics of Choline Chloride based Deep Eutectic Solvents: Neutron Scattering Study
Authors: Rinesh T., H. Srinivasan, V.K. Sharma, S. Mitra
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the microscopic diffusion dynamics of choline chloride (ChCl) based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) to elucidate the influence of hydrogen bond donor (HBD) identity on the mobility of cholinium ions. The DES systems examined include ethaline, glyceline, and reline, comprising ChCl mixed with ethylene glycol, glycerol, and urea, respectively, in a 1:2 molar ratio. Quasielastic neutron scattering experiments was used to probe the self-diffusion of cholinium ions at molecular length and time scales. The dynamics were modelled as a combination of jump diffusion of the molecular center of mass and localized translation within transient hydrogen-bond cages. Among the three systems, ethaline consistently exhibited the highest cholinium self-diffusion coefficients across all investigated temperatures, attributed to shorter residence times and more frequent molecular jumps. In contrast, reline displayed longer residence times with significantly larger jump length, leading to a temperature-dependent dynamical crossover: While reline and glyceline exhibited comparable diffusivities at low temperatures, reline surpassed glyceline above 330 K. These findings highlight the crucial role of HBD identity in modulating microscopic diffusion and provide valuable molecular-level insights for the rational design of DESs for targeted applications.

Title: Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Integrable Spin Systems
Authors: Tanay Pathak
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis(ETH) is a standard tool to understand the thermalization properties of an isolated quantum system. Its generalization to higher order correlations of matrix elements of local operators, dubbed the full ETH, predicts the decomposition of higher-order correlation function into thermal free cumulants. In this work, we numerically test these predictions of full ETH using exact diagonalization of two spin models: the Ising and the XXZ Heisenberg models. The differences from the behavior of full ETH prediction in chaotic systems are highlighted and contrasted along the way. We also show that although in these integrable spin models the dynamics of the four-time correlators, specifically the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), is encoded in the fourth order free cumulant, it exhibits late-time dynamics that is different from nonintegrable systems.

Title: Confinement-Controlled Morphology and Stability of One-Dimensional CrI3 Nanotubes
Authors: Ihsan Caha, Aqrab ul Ahmad, Francis Leonard Deepak
Abstract: Integrating monolayers derived from 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials into next-generation technological applications remains a significant challenge due to their structural and magnetic instability issues. Template-assisted encapsulation is a potential route for the growth of stable 2D monolayers aimed at designing novel 1D heterostructures, opening new avenues for studying low-dimensional quantum effects and spin-related phenomena. In this study, we explored the diameter-dependent encapsulation of 2D CrI3 crystals using multi-walled carbon nanotubes as nanoscale host templates. Advanced microscopic analysis revealed distinct structural transitions, ranging from internal nanorod encapsulation to external shell formation, directly influenced by the host nanotube diameter. Furthermore, statistical analysis of structural morphologies indicates that CrI3 nanorods preferentially form within MWCNTs with inner diameters up to 5 nm, while single-walled CrI3 nanotubes are stabilized in CNTs with diameters up to 8 nm. For host CNTs exceeding 10 nm in diameter, CrI3 predominantly forms surface coatings rather than confined one-dimensional structures. In situ electron beam irradiation demonstrates the superior structural stability of single-walled CrI3 confined within MWCNTs, while externally coated CrI3 undergoes decomposition into metallic Cr clusters. Prolonged irradiation induces a morphological transformation of CrI3 nanotubes into nanorods. These insights lay the groundwork for engineering robust, tunable 1D magnetic heterostructures of CrI3 for spintronic and data storage applications.

Title: Hidden phonon-assisted charge density wave transition in BaFe2Al9 revealed by ultrafast optical spectroscopy
Authors: Lei Wang, Mingwei Ma, Jiangxu Li, Liucheng Chen, Bingru Lu, Xiang Li, Feng Jin, Elbert E. M. Chia, Jianlin Luo, Rongyan Chen, Peitao Liu, Fang Hong, Xinbo Wang
Abstract: The interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom is fundamental to charge density wave (CDW) formation, yet the microscopic origin often remains elusive. Here, we investigate the transient optical response of the intermetallic compound BaFe2Al9 using polarization-resolved ultrafast optical spectroscopy. We identify a discontinuous sign reversal in the transient reflectivity at Tc ~ 110 K, providing unambiguous evidence for the first-order transition. The anisotropic quasiparticle relaxation establishes the three-dimensional nature of the ordered state. Below Tc, a single coherent 1.6 THz oscillation appears abruptly and remains confined to the CDW phase. This mode exhibits weak temperature dependence with negligible softening and is absent in Raman spectra. First-principles calculations imply that it is a precursor phonon at the CDW wave vector with strong electron-phonon coupling. Our results indicate that the CDW in BaFe2Al9 arises from intertwined electronic and lattice instabilities, assisted by a displacive mechanism mediated by a hidden strongly coupled phonon, distinct from conventional amplitude-mode softening scenarios.

Abstract: The influence of the reactive DC sputtering parameters on the superconducting properties of NbReN ultrathin films was investigated. A detailed study of the current-voltage characteristics of the plasma was performed to optimize the superconducting critical temperature, Tc. The thickness dependence of Tc for the films deposited under different conditions was analyzed down to the ultrathin limit. Optimized films were used to fabricate superconducting nanowire single photon detectors which, at T=3.5 K, show saturated internal detection efficiency (IDE) up to a wavelength of 1301 nm and 95% IDE at 1548 nm with recovery times and timing jitter of about 8 ns and 28 ps, respectively.

Title: From Lasers to Photon Bose--Einstein Condensates: A Unified Description via an Open-Dissipative Bose--Einstein Distribution
Authors: Joshua Krauß, Enrico Stein, Axel Pelster
Abstract: Photon condensation was first experimentally realized in 2010 within a dye-filled microcavity at room temperature. Since then, interest in the field has increased significantly, as a photon Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) represents a prototypical driven-dissipative system. Here, we investigate how its inherent open nature influences the condensation process both quantitatively and qualitatively. To this end, we consider a mean-field model, which can be derived microscopically from a Lindblad master equation. The underlying rate equations depend on various external parameters such as emission and absorption rates of the dye molecules as well as the cavity photon loss rate. In steady state, we obtain an open-dissipative Bose-Einstein distribution for the mode occupations. The chemical potential of this distribution depends on the occupations of the dye molecules in both their ground and excited state and must therefore be determined this http URL find that the resulting photon distribution is strongly influenced by the driven-dissipative parameters. Based on this result, we identify the main differences between a photonic BEC, an atomic BEC, and a laser.

Title: High- and medium-entropy nitride coatings from the Cr-Hf-Mo-Ta-W-N system: properties and high-temperature stability
Authors: Pavel Souček, Stanislava Debnárová, Šárka Zuzjaková, Shuyao Lin, Matej Fekete, Zsolt Czigány, Katalin Balázsi, Lukáš Vrána, Tatiana Pitoňáková, Ondřej Jašek, Petr Zeman, Nikola Koutná
Abstract: High- and medium-entropy nitride coatings from the Cr-Hf-Mo-Ta-W-N system were studied using ab initio calculations and experiments to clarify the role of entropy and individual elements in phase stability, microstructure, and high-temperature behaviour. Formation energy calculations indicated that nitrogen vacancies stabilise the cubic (fcc) phase, with hafnium and tantalum acting as strong stabilisers, while tungsten destabilises the lattice. Coatings were deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering at approx. 50C (AT) and approx. 580C (HT). All exhibited columnar fcc structures; high-temperature deposition produced denser coatings, lower nitrogen content, and larger crystallites, resulting in higher hardness and elastic modulus. Thermal stability was tested up to 1200C on Si and oxidation at 1400C on sapphire. AT coatings failed early, while most HT coatings endured. Nitrogen loss less than 10 at.% at 1000C was critical for survival. TEM revealed tungsten segregation and HfO2 formation, while fcc nitride remained dominant. Ta enrichment proved essential for superior thermal and oxidation stability.

Title: Retardance of lab grown diamond substrates as a function of thickness: momentum-drift random walk model
Authors: Thanh Tran, Phuong Vo, Thomas Sheppard, Timothy Grotjohn, Paul Quayle
Abstract: This work studies the correlation between mean retardance and thickness of diamond substrates grown homoepitaxially via microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance and thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to the growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the square root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to the growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an approximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not from differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer correlation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation coefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond crystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a two-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the diamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples. By optimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match experimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth direction, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients. Furthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that retardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base retardances in both orientations. These findings establish a quantitative framework for interpreting birefringence in diamond substrates, with implications for material selection and development in thermal management, quantum sensing, high-power electronics, and optical applications.

Title: Autonomous interpretation of atomistic scattering data
Authors: Andy S. Anker, John L. A. Gardner, Louise A. M. Rosset, Andrew L. Goodwin, Volker L. Deringer
Abstract: Materials with bespoke properties have long been identified by computational searches, and their experimental realisation is now coming within reach through autonomous laboratories. Scattering experiments are central to verifying the atomic structures of autonomously synthesised materials. Yet, interpreting these measurements typically requires user expertise and manual processing, or machine learning (ML) models trained on predefined datasets, limiting fully autonomous materials discovery. Here, we introduce a differentiable optimisation framework that treats scattering calculations, energetics, and chemical constraints as a unified refinement problem. Capability demonstrations across molecules, crystal structures, nanoparticles, and amorphous matter show that this data-driven approach resolves structural degeneracies with multi-modal inputs - suggesting its usefulness for informing, and ultimately guiding, the operation of autonomous laboratories.

Title: Analytic expressions for estimation of the critical properties of inhomogeneous Ising models
Authors: Vladislav Egorov (1), Stepan Osipov (2) ((1) Research Center "Kurchatov Institute" - Scientific Research Institute of System Analysis, Moscow, Russian Federation, (2) Cherepovets State University, Cherepovets, Russian Federation)
Abstract: In many applications of spin models, the fast estimation of their critical temperatures and other physical properties is of great importance. In this work, we present the analytical expressions estimating the critical properties of inhomogeneous Ising models with ferromagnetic interactions. The expressions were obtained within the framework of the m-vicinity method. The accuracy of the critical temperature estimations was evaluated through comparison with Monte Carlo simulations. Special attention was given to the case when the model consists of two interacting interpenetrating homogeneous sublattices, and relationships for the compositional dependence of the critical temperature were derived.

Title: Effect of crystallographic texture on dealloying kinetics and composition of nanoporous gold surface
Authors: Ezgi Hatipoğlu, Ayman A. El-Zoka, Yujun Zhao, Stanislav Mráz, Jochen M. Schneider, Baptiste Gault, Aparna Saksena
Abstract: Nanoporous metals allow for tailoring composition and surface-to-volume ratio, both aspects critical for applications in catalysis. Here, Ag70Au30 (2 at. %) films with a face-centered cubic structure were deposited at 400°C, either {111}-textured or randomly oriented. Upon chemical dealloying, atom probe tomography of the nanoporous structure reveals that the textured film retains a up to 2.7 times higher Ag concentration within the ligaments compared to the randomly oriented film that exhibits ligament coarsening, indicating faster dealloying kinetics. Our study highlights the potential of microstructure engineering in tailoring the properties of nanoporous metals for possible future catalytic and electrochemical applications.

Title: Metastability of the Topological Magnetic Orders in the Chiral Antiferromagnet EuPtSi
Authors: Simon Rousseau, Gabriel Seyfarth, Georg Knebel, Dai Aoki, Yoshichika Ōnuki, Alexandre Pourret
Abstract: We report resistivity and Hall effect measurements in the chiral antiferromagnet EuPtSi. Depending on the magnetic field orientation with respect to the crystallographic axes, EuPtSi presents different topological magnetic phases below the Néel temperature $T_N=4.05$K. In particular, for a field $H \parallel $ [111], it exhibits the well known skyrmion lattice A-phase inside the conical phase between $T=0.45$K and $T_N$ in the field range from 0.8T to 1.4T. Remarkably, the skyrmion lattice state in EuPtSi, composed of nanoscale skyrmions, can be extended down to very low temperature (lower than 0.1K) through field-cooling regardless of the cooling rate and of the magnetic history. Similarly the metastability of the A'- and B-phases ($H \parallel $ [100]) at low temperature is evidenced by our measurements. These results suggest that EuPtSi is a peculiar example where the competition between the topological stability and the thermal agitation can lead to metastable quantum skyrmion state.

Title: Commensurate-incommensurate Mott transition without magnetic field: emergence of nematic Luttinger liquid in XXZ chain
Authors: Julien Fitouchi, Natalia Chepiga
Abstract: We investigate the zero-magnetization phase diagram of a spin-1/2 chain with competing ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor exchange couplings in the strongly interacting regime. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we discover two successive commensurate-incommensurate transitions of the non-conformal Pokrovsky-Talapov universality class, occurring (even) at zero magnetic field. The first transition marks the condensation of bound pairs of magnons into a critical phase with central charge $c=2$, emerging from a gapped period-4 phase. At the second transition, an incommensurate quadrupolar (or nematic) Luttinger liquid forms out of a gapped phase separation state, via the pairwise condensation of domain walls. We argue that both transitions involve the same underlying incommensurate nematic Luttinger liquid, and that the $c=2$ phase can be understood as a coexistence of a conventional (single-magnon type) and quadrupolar (two-magnon type) Luttinger liquids. Our results demonstrate that frustration alone is sufficient to drive continuous commensurate-incommensurate transitions of Mott type and stabilise incommensurate quasi-long-range order without doping.

Title: Magnon-Magnon Interaction Induced by Dynamic Coupling in a Hybrid Magnonic Crystal
Authors: Rawnak Sultana, Mojtaba Taghipour Kaffash, Gianluca Gubbiotti, Yi Ji, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch, Federico Montoncello
Abstract: We report a combined experimental and numerical investigation of spin-wave dynamics in a hybrid magnonic crystal consisting of a CoFeB artificial spin ice (ASI) of stadium-shaped nanoelements patterned atop a continuous NiFe film, separated by a 5 nm Al2O3 spacer. Using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, we probe the frequency dependence of thermal spin waves as functions of applied magnetic field and wavevector, revealing the decisive role of interlayer dipolar coupling in the magnetization dynamics. Micromagnetic simulations complement the experiments, showing a strong interplay between ASI edge modes and backward volume modes in the NiFe film. The contrast in saturation magnetization between CoFeB and NiFe enhances this coupling, leading to a pronounced hybridization manifested as a triplet of peaks in the spectra - predicted by simulations and observed experimentally. This magnon-magnon coupling persists over a wide magnetic field range, shaping both the spin-wave dispersion and frequency-field response throughout the hysteresis loop. Our findings establish how ASI geometry can selectively enhance specific spin-wave wavelengths in the underlying film, identifying them as preferential channels for magnonic signal transport and manipulation.

Title: Spin wave theory for the triaxial magnetic anisotropy 2D van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr
Authors: Sergio M. Rezende, Byron Freelon, Roberto L. Rodríguez-Suárez
Abstract: The magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials have been attracting increasing attention in recent years due to their unique behavior and possible applications in new devices. One material of great interest is the 2D van der Waals (vdW) crystal CrSBr, that exhibits antiferromagnetic (AF) order at low temperatures due to an interlayer AF exchange interaction. Here we present a full quantum spin-wave theory for CrSBr considering three intralayer and one interlayer exchange interactions, and triaxial magnetic anisotropy. The fits of the theoretical results to antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) measurements and inelastic neutron scattering data yield reliable values for the seven interaction parameters that can be used to calculate other properties of this interesting material.

Title: Unveiling the entropic role of hydration water in SOD1 partitioning within FUS condensate
Authors: Luis Enrique Coronas, Stepan Timr, Fabio Sterpone, Giancarlo Franzese
Abstract: Biological processes like the sequestration of Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) into biomolecular condensates such as FUS and stress granules are essential to understanding disease mechanisms, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our study demonstrates that the hydration environment is crucial in these processes. Using the advanced CVF water model, which captures hydrogen-bond networks at the molecular level, we show how water greatly impacts SOD1's behavior, residency times, and transition rates between different associative states. Importantly, when water is included to hydrate an implicit solvent model (OPEP), we gain a new perspective on the free energy landscape of the system, leading to a conclusion that clarifies that suggested by OPEP alone. While the OPEP model indicated that Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) crowders reduce SOD1's partition coefficient (PC) mainly due to nonspecific interactions with BSA, our enhanced explicit-water approach reveals that the hydration entropy behavior in BSA drives the observed decrease in PC. This highlights that explicitly modeling water is essential for accurately understanding protein-crowder interactions and their biological relevance, emphasizing water's role in cellular phase separation and disease-related processes.

Title: Phase Behavior of Thermo-Responsive Nanoplatelets
Authors: Imane Boucenna, Florent Carn, Ahmed Mourchid
Abstract: Nanoplatelets open up a wide range of possibilities for building materials with novel properties linked to their shape anisotropy. A challenge consists of controlling dynamically the order of positioning and orientation in three dimensions by assembly to exploit the collective properties at the macroscale. While most studies to date have focused on hard platelets that cannot be stimulated by an external trigger, in the present work we tackle the case of core/shell platelets, composed of a mineral core (laponite) coated with a soft polymeric shell (PEO100-PPO65-PEO100 copolymer) whose swelling can be triggered by temperature variation. We identified unambiguously the signature associated with the different phases obtained as a function temperature and concentration by combining local (X-ray scattering, electron microscopy) and global (rheology, optical birefringence) methods of analysis. In this way, we obtained two main results. The first shows that the deposition of a soft layer onto laponite surface enables a phase transition from isotropic liquid towards liquid suspensions of random stacks which is not observed for bare laponite suspensions in the studied weight concentration range (\Phi < 14 wt.). The second result shows that an increase of nanoplatelet effective volume fraction triggered by temperature (swelling of the polymer shell) induces a phase transition from liquid suspensions of random stacks towards birefringent gels of nematic stacks. Both results agree with numerically predicted phase sequences expected by variation in particle density under similar charge screening conditions, taking into account the contribution of the copolymer layer to the particle volume fraction. We believe that these results pave the way for the control of nanoplatelet self-assembly by external action.

Title: Colorimetry and Tribology of Ultrapure Copper Surface Micromodification
Authors: Aleksandra Szczupak, Grzegorz Cios, Benedykt R. Jany
Abstract: Controlling optical and tribological properties of metal surfaces, like color and wear rate, without altering their chemical composition is a highly desirable process across numerous fields of science and industry. It represents a cost-effective alternative to traditional chemical methods, particularly for copper, one of the most important metals widely used where high electrical and thermal conductivity, alongside resistance to corrosion, are required. We investigated the control of copper surface texture through a controlled micromodification process, utilizing constant force and velocity with abrasive silicon carbide sandpaper on ultrapure copper pellets exhibiting elongated crystallographic grains, and its impact on optical properties. Systematically varying grit size and rubbing direction, both along and across the grains, resulted in tunable microgroove morphology, demonstrating a marked difference in wear rate between single-grain and multi-grain abrasion. Furthermore, modification along copper grain boundaries yielded a change in the wear rate by a factor of two, related to single-grain and multi-grain abrasion regime changes, enabling precise control over material performance via tuned abrasion conditions. Colorimetric analysis via C-Microscopy revealed a strong, statistically significant relationship between abrasive parameters, microgroove geometry (inclination angle, depth, and size), and optical spectral signatures, which were then parametrized to achieve targeted control. This research demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to color and reflectance modification via microgroove engineering, offering a pathway to customized material properties by uniquely coupling contact mechanics, surface morphology, and colorimetry at the microscale level.

Title: Identifying chiral topological order in microscopic spin models by modular commutator
Authors: Avijit Maity, Aman Kumar, Vikram Tripathi
Abstract: The chiral central charge $c_-$ is a key topological invariant of the edge characterizing the bulk two-dimensional chiral topological order, but its direct evaluation in microscopic spin models has long been a challenge, especially for non-abelian topological order. Building on the recently developed modular commutator formalism, we numerically obtain $c_-$ directly from single ground-state wave functions of two-dimensional interacting spin models that have chiral topological order. This provides a geometry-independent and bulk diagnostic of chirality. We study two nonintegrable systems -- the Zeeman-Kitaev honeycomb model and the kagome antiferromagnet -- both subjected to scalar spin chirality perturbations. We find that the modular commutator yields results consistent with the expected topological quantum field theories. We also compute the topological entanglement entropy which provides an independent diagnostic of the topological orders. Our work establishes modular commutators as a powerful numerical probe of chiral topological order in strongly correlated quantum magnets.

Title: Encoding a topological gauge theory on a ring-shaped Raman-coupled Bose gas
Authors: Claudio Iacovelli, Josep Cabedo, Leticia Tarruell, Alessio Celi
Abstract: Topological gauge theories constitute a framework for understanding strongly correlated quantum matter in terms of weakly interacting composite degrees of freedom. Their topological properties become evident when these theories are realized on a space of non-trivial topology. Here, we propose a scheme to realize a one-dimensional topological gauge theory, the chiral BF theory, on a ring geometry. We obtain such a theory by dimensionally reducing Chern-Simons theory on a disk to the so-called chiral BF theory defined on the ring. Then, we encode the theory into a Hamiltonian with a coupling between angular momentum and density, and we propose and numerically benchmark its realization in an optically-dressed Bose gas confined in a ring-shaped trap. There, the topological properties of the underlying theory manifest themselves through a magnetic flux variable that is density-dependent. We quantify such density-dependent magnetic flux in terms of the ground-state angular momentum and the chiral properties of the system through a Bogoliubov analysis. Our proposal enables the observation of the interplay between the topology of the theory and that of the space.

Title: Phase-induced switching of ferromagnetic insulators in Josephson spin valves
Authors: A. A. Mazanik, C.-H. Huang, Miguel A. Cazalilla, F. S. Bergeret
Abstract: We study the Josephson effect in junctions composed of two ferromagnetic insulator/diffusive superconductor bilayers separated by an insulating barrier. By computing the free energy of the system, we identify two distinct contributions: (i) The work performed by a current source to create a supercurrent through the junction, and (ii) an antiferromagnetic coupling between ferromagnetic insulators, mediated by the superconducting condensate across the insulating barrier. The competition between these contributions allows for switching between parallel and antiparallel configurations of the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic insulators. We explicitly show that the switching occurs at finite temperatures and for superconducting phase differences satisfying $\pi/2 < \phi < 3\pi/2$. Importantly, this effect can be realized in ferromagnetic insulators with sufficiently large easy-plane anisotropy energy. Using realistic junction parameters, we demonstrate that the switching can be controlled by phase bias and triggered by half-flux-quantum voltage pulses or external magnetic field pulses on the microsecond timescale. These results provide a route towards controllable Josephson-based superconducting memory devices based on EuS/Al heterostructures.

Title: Origin of trapped intralayer Wannier and charge-transfer excitons in moiré materials
Authors: Indrajit Maity, Johannes Lischner, Arash A. Mostofi, Ángel Rubio
Abstract: Moiré materials offer a versatile platform for engineering excitons with unprecedented control, promising next-generation optoelectronic applications. While continuum models are widely used to study moiré excitons due to their computational efficiency, they often disagree with ab initio many-body approaches, as seen for intralayer excitons in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. Here, we resolve these discrepancies using an atomistic, quantum-mechanical framework based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation with localized Wannier functions as the basis for the electronic structure. We show that inclusion of dielectric screening due to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation is essential to reproduce the full set of experimentally observed features of moiré intralayer excitons. Our analysis reveals a competition between Wannier and charge transfer characters, driven by variations between direct and indirect band gaps at high symmetry stacking regions due to atomic relaxations and environmentally tunable electron-hole interactions. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that the lowest-energy bright excitons are Wannier-like in WS2/WSe2 heterobilayers but charge-transfer-like in twisted WSe2 homobilayers, despite having comparable moiré lengths when encapsulated in hBN. In the absence of hBN encapsulation, the lowest-energy bright exciton in twisted WSe$_2$ becomes Wannier-like. These results establish atomistic modeling as a powerful and efficient approach for designing and controlling excitonic phenomena in moiré materials.

Title: Hydrodynamic Mechanism of Colloidal Propulsion through Momentum Exchange
Authors: Javier Diaz, Ignacio Pagonabarraga, Carles Calero
Abstract: Propulsion of colloidal particles due to momentum transfer from localized surface reactions is investigated by solving the exact unsteady Stokes equation. We model the effect of surface reactions as either a {\it force dipole} acting on the fluid or a {\it pair force} acting on both the colloid and the fluid. Our analysis reveals that after a single reaction event the colloid's velocity initially decays as $\sim t^{-1/2}$, followed by a long-time tail decay $\sim t^{-5/2}$. This behavior is distinct from the $\sim t^{-3/2}$ decay seen for simple impulsively forced particles, a result of the force-free nature of the reaction mechanism. The velocity and transient dynamics are strongly controlled by the distance of the reaction from the colloid surface. For a colloid subject to periodic reactions, the theory predicts a steady-state velocity that is comparable to experimental results and previous simulations, suggesting that direct momentum transfer is a relevant mechanism for self-propulsion in systems like Janus particles. Finally, our study shows that fluid compressibility is not required for momentum transfer to produce colloidal propulsion.

Title: Bridging the Synthesizability Gap in Perovskites by Combining Computations, Literature Data, and PU Learning
Authors: Rushik Desai, Junyeong Ahn, Alejandro Strachan, Arun Mannodi-Kanakkithodi
Abstract: Among emerging energy materials, halide and chalcogenide perovskites have garnered significant attention over the last decade owing to the abundance of their constituent species, low manufacturing costs, and their highly tunable composition-structure-property space. Navigating the vast perovskite compositional landscape is possible using density functional theory (DFT) computations, but they are not easily extended to predictions of the synthesizability of new materials and their properties. As a result, only a limited number of compositions identified to have desirable optoelectronic properties from these calculations have been realized experimentally. One way to bridge this gap is by learning from the experimental literature about how the perovskite composition-structure space relates to their likelihood of laboratory synthesis. Here, we present our efforts in combining high-throughput DFT data with experimental labels collected from the literature to train classifier models employing various materials descriptors to forecast the synthesizability of any given perovskite compound. Our framework utilizes the positive and unlabeled (PU) learning strategy and makes probabilistic estimates of the synthesis likelihood based on DFT- computed energies and the prior existence of similar synthesized compounds. Our data and models can be readily accessed via a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR) nanoHUB tool.

Title: Frieze charge-stripes in a correlated kagome superconductor CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Siyu Cheng, Keyu Zeng, Yi Liu, Christopher Candelora, Ziqiang Wang, Guang-Han Cao, Ilija Zeljkovic
Abstract: Kagome metals have developed into a vibrant playground for materials physics, where geometric frustration, electronic correlations and band topology come together to create a variety of exotic phenomena. Recently synthesized CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ has provided a rare opportunity to explore unconventional superconductivity in a strongly correlated kagome system with hints of frustrated magnetism and quantum criticality. Using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we reveal a cascade of density wave transitions with different symmetries in bulk single crystals of CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$. In particular, we discover a new electronic state $-$ a unidirectional density wave that breaks all mirror symmetries akin to a chiral density wave, but in contrast retains a mirror-glide symmetry. We term this state a frieze charge-stripe order phase, because its symmetry properties agree with one of the fundamental frieze symmetry groups. A combination of high-resolution imaging, Fourier analysis and theoretical simulations uncovers the crucial role of sublattice degrees of freedom in forming this phase, with internal chiral textures of opposite handedness. Our experiments reveal that superconductivity in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ develops from a new type of a unidirectional density wave, and set the foundation for exploring electronic states with frieze symmetry groups in quantum materials.

Title: Reliable End-to-End Material Information Extraction from the Literature with Source-Tracked Multi-Stage Large Language Models
Authors: Xin Wang, Anshu Raj, Matthew Luebbe, Haiming Wen, Shuozhi Xu, Kun Lu
Abstract: Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets, yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature. Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing, microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level (independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1 scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0% (feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49 to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes, enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.

Title: Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates
Authors: Zijian Liang, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.

Title: Ab initio study of the neutron and Fermi polarons on the lattice
Authors: Ryan Curry, Jasmine Kozar, Alexandros Gezerlis
Abstract: We have used the auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) many-body approach on the lattice to study the equation of state for a fermionic impurity interacting with a background sea of spin-polarized fermions. The impurity, or polaron, is an interesting system in both cold atomic and nuclear physics. Our approach is general, and we are able to straightforwardly study the polaron across these regimes. We first study the Fermi polaron at unitarity and for a wide range of scattering lengths, comparing against previous theoretical and experimental studies. We then explore the neutron polaron which has been shown to be an important constraint for nuclear physics. We have also employed the recently developed parametric matrix model to emulate AFQMC solutions to the two-body problem on the lattice, to accelerate the tuning of our lattice Hamiltonian parameters directly to two-body energies in a periodic box, following Lscher's formula. Our lattice Quantum Monte Carlo results for the polaron in both a cold atomic and nuclear physics context can serve as stringent benchmarks for future theoretical and experimental research.

Abstract: Higher-order interactions that nonlinearly couple more than two nodes are ubiquitous in networked systems. Here we provide an overview of the rapidly growing field of dynamical systems with higher-order interactions, and of the techniques which can be used to describe and analyze them. We focus in particular on new phenomena that emerge when nonpairwise interactions are considered. We conclude by discussing open questions and promising future directions on the collective dynamics of higher-order networks.

Title: SHarmonic: A fast and accurate implementation of spherical harmonics for electronic-structure calculations
Authors: Xavier Andrade, Jacopo Simoni, Yuan Ping, Tadashi Ogitsu, Alfredo A. Correa
Abstract: The authors present SHarmonic, a new implementation of the spherical harmonics targeted for electronic-structure calculations. Their approach is to use explicit formulas for the harmonics written in terms of normalized Cartesian coordinates. This approach results in a code that is as precise as other implementations while being at least one order of magnitude more computationally efficient. The library can run on graphics processing units (GPUs) as well, achieving an additional order of magnitude in execution speed. This new implementation is simple to use and is provided under an open source license, it can be readily used by other codes to avoid the error-prone and cumbersome implementation of the spherical harmonics.

Title: Computing frustration and near-monotonicity in deep neural networks
Authors: Joel Wendin, Erik G. Larsson, Claudio Altafini
Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider, we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models. From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural balance) means that the function representing the network behaves near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form of implicit regularization.

Title: Cored product codes for quantum self-correction in three dimensions
Authors: Brenden Roberts, Jin Ming Koh, Yi Tan, Norman Y. Yao
Abstract: The existence of self-correcting quantum memories in three dimensions is a long-standing open question at the interface between quantum computing and many-body physics. We take the perspective that large contributions to the entropy arising from fine-tuned spatial symmetries, including the assumption of an underlying regular lattice, are responsible for fundamental challenges to realizing self-correction. Accordingly, we introduce a class of disordered quantum codes, which we call "cored product codes". These codes are derived from classical factors via the hypergraph product but undergo a coring procedure which allows them to be embedded in a lower number of spatial dimensions while preserving code properties. As a specific example, we focus on a fractal code based on the aperiodic pinwheel tiling as the classical factor and perform finite temperature numerical simulations on the resulting three-dimensional quantum memory. We provide evidence that, below a critical temperature, the memory lifetime increases with system size for codes up to 60000 qubits.

Authors: Tobias Johnson, Jacob Richey
Abstract: We consider the activated random walk particle system, a model of self-organized criticality, on $\mathbb{Z}$ with i.i.d.-Bernoulli initial configuration. We show that at subcritical density, the system's odometer function, which counts the number of actions taken at each site, has a stretched exponential tail. It follows that the expected odometer at each site is finite.

Title: Field Free Spin-Orbit Torque Controlled Synapse and Stochastic Neuron Devices for Spintronic Boltzmann Neural Networks
Authors: Aijaz H. Lone, Meng Tang, Camelia Florica, Bin He, Jingkai Xu, Xixiang Zhang, Gianluca Setti
Abstract: Spintronics offers a promising approach to energy efficient neuromorphic computing by integrating the functionalities of synapses and neurons within a single platform. A major challenge, however, is achieving field-free spin orbit torque SOT control over both synaptic and neuronal devices using an industry-adopted spintronic materials stack. In this study, we present field-free SOT spintronic synapses utilizing a CoFeB ferromagnetic thin film system, where asymmetrical device design and specifically added lateral notches in the CoFeB thin film facilitate effective domain wall DW nucleation, movement, and pinning and depinning. This method yields multiple analog, nonvolatile resistance states with enhanced linearity and symmetry, resulting in programmable and stable synaptic weights. We provide a systematic measurement approach to improve the linearity and symmetry of the synapses. Additionally, we demonstrate nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions MTJs that function as SOT-driven stochastic neurons, exhibiting current-tunable, Boltzmann-like probabilistic switching behavior, which provides an intrinsic in-hardware Gibbs sampling capability. By integrating these synapses and neurons into a Boltzmann machine complemented by a classifier layer, we achieve recognition accuracies greater than 98 percent on the MNIST dataset and 86 percent on Fashion MNIST. This work establishes a framework for field free synaptic and neuronal devices, setting the stage for practical, materials-compatible, and all spintronic neuromorphic computing hardware.

Title: Recovery of the second law in fully quantum thermodynamics
Authors: Naoto Shiraishi, Ryuji Takagi
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics investigates how robust the second law of thermodynamics serves as the unique fundamental law in the small quantum world. To tackle this problem, the quantum coherence constitutes a major difficulty of investigations, which provides severe constraints hindering the recovery of a single thermodynamic potential. Here we solve this long-standing problem of quantum information theory by revealing that the state convertibility under thermal operations is fully characterized by the second law of thermodynamics. Specifically, we prove that whether a quantum state with quantum coherence is convertible to another by a thermal operation with a correlated catalyst is completely determined by the free energy ordering. Unlike previous attempts, our setting does not resort to any additional external coherent assist, providing a faithful operational characterization of thermodynamic state transformation.

Title: Emergence of metastability on the hyperbolic lattice: Effects of boundary conditions
Authors: Vanessa Jacquier, Wioletta M. Ruszel
Abstract: We investigate the Ising model on finite subgraphs of the hyperbolic lattice under minus boundary conditions and in the presence of a positive external field $h$. Interpreting the boundary as frozen or cold wall conditions, we show that, for small values of $h$, the system exhibits metastable behaviour. Our result is very surprising, since non-amenable graphs, such as hyperbolic lattices, feature exponentially growing boundaries, which typically destabilize local energy minima. In particular, we identify the unique metastable state and characterize the exit time from it. Furthermore, we establish asymptotic results for the distribution of the first hitting time and provide estimates for the spectral gap. Finally, we analyze the energy landscape and describe the nucleation mechanism for values of $h$ outside the metastable regime.

Abstract: Using the recent six loop renormalization group functions for Lee-Yang and percolation theory constructed by Schnetz from a scalar cubic Lagrangian, we deduce the $\epsilon$ expansion of the critical exponents for both cases. Estimates for the exponents in three, four and five dimensions are extracted using two-sided Padé approximants and shown to be compatible with values from other approaches.

Title: All-optical bubble trap for ultracold atoms in microgravity

Abstract: In this paper, we present an all-optical method to produce shell-shaped traps for ultracold atoms in microgravity. Our scheme exploits optical double dressing of the ground state to create a short range strongly repulsive central potential barrier. Combined with a long range attractive central potential, this barrier forms the shell trap. We demonstrate that a pure spherical bubble, reaching the quasi 2D regime for standard atom numbers, could be formed from two crossed beams with a parabolic profile. An analytical study shows that the relevant characteristics of the trap depend on the ratio of the ground and excited state polarisabilities and the lifetime of the excited state. As a benchmark, we provide quantitative analysis of a realistic configuration for rubidium ensembles, leading to a 250 Hz transverse confinement for a 35 $\mu$m radius bubble and a trap residual scattering rate of less than 10 s$^{-1}$.

Title: Hayden--Preskill Model via Local Quenches
Authors: Weibo Mao, Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We model the Hayden--Preskill (HP) information recovery protocol in 2d CFTs via local joining quenches. Euclidean path integrals with slits prepare the HP subsystems: the message $M$, its reference $N$, the Page-time black hole $B$, the early radiation $E$, and the late radiation $R$; the remaining black hole after emitting $R$ is denoted as $B'$. The single-slit geometry provides an analytically tractable toy model, while the bounded-slit geometry more closely captures the HP setup. In the free Dirac fermion 2d CFT, the mutual information $I(N\!:\!B')$ shows quasi-particle dynamics with partial or full revivals, whereas that in holographic 2d CFTs, which are expected to be maximally chaotic, exhibit sharp transitions: in the bounded-slit case, when the size of the late radiation becomes comparable to that of the reference $N$, $I(N\!:\!B')$ does vanish at late time, otherwise it remains finite. This contrast between free CFTs and holographic CFTs gives a clear characterization of the HP recovery threshold.

Title: Hybrid quantum-classical analog simulation of two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard models with neutral atoms

Abstract: We experimentally study the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model using a Rydberg-based quantum processing unit in the analog mode. Our approach avoids encoding directly the original fermions into qubits and instead relies on reformulating the original model onto a system of fermions coupled to spins and then decoupling them in a self-consistent manner. We then introduce the auxiliary spin solver: this hybrid quantum-classical algorithm handles a free-fermion problem, which can be solved efficiently with a few classical resources, and an interacting spin problem, which can be naturally encoded in the analog quantum computer. This algorithm can be used to study both the equilibrium Mott transition as well as non-equilibrium properties of the original Fermi-Hubbard model, highlighting the potential of quantum-classical hybrid approaches to study strongly correlated matter.

Title: How many more is different?
Authors: Jacob Calvert, Andréa W. Richa, Dana Randall
Abstract: From the formation of ice in small clusters of water molecules to the mass raids of army ant colonies, the emergent behavior of collectives depends critically on their size. At the same time, common wisdom holds that such behaviors are robust to the loss of individuals. This tension points to the need for a more systematic study of how number influences collective behavior. We initiate this study by focusing on collective behaviors that change abruptly at certain critical numbers of individuals. We show that a subtle modification of standard bifurcation analysis identifies such critical numbers, including those associated with discreteness- and noise-induced transitions. By treating them as instances of the same phenomenon, we show that critical numbers across physical scales and scientific domains commonly arise from competing feedbacks that scale differently with number. We then use this idea to find overlooked critical numbers in past studies of collective behavior and explore the implications for their conclusions. In particular, we highlight how deterministic approximations of stochastic models can fail near critical numbers. We close by distinguishing these qualitative changes from density-dependent phase transitions and by discussing how our approach could generalize to broader classes of collective behaviors.

Title: Fermionic versus Spin Baths in non-Interacting Transport Models
Authors: Muhammad Zia, Moritz Cygorek, Erik M. Gauger, Brendon W. Lovett
Abstract: We investigate how fermionic anticommutation shapes transport in a noninteracting resonant-level model where a single central site is coupled to an environment. To this end, we compare a fermionic reservoir with a bath of spin-half modes using exact diagonalization and a perturbative expansion of the master equation to identify the differences. Notably, we find different reduced dynamics for the spin and fermionic baths even though the particles remain noninteracting and both models enforce local Pauli blocking. These differences originate from higher-order terms in the system-bath coupling, where fermionic anticommutation introduces exchange signs in higher-order correlations. By contrast, all second-order contributions, set solely by two-point correlators, coincide. Deviations are largest for small to intermediate bath sizes, fading in the effectively Markovian regime where higher-order corrections are negligible. These results identify when spin baths can be a substitute for fermionic reservoirs and vice versa.

Title: Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches
Authors: Rohit Goswami (1), Hannes Jónsson (1) ((1) Science Institute and Faculty of Physical Sciences, University of Iceland, Reykjavík, Iceland)
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.

Title: Universal super-resolution framework for imaging of quantum dots
Authors: Dominik Vašinka, Jaewon Lee, Charlie Stalker, Victor Mitryakhin, Ivan Solovev, Sven Stephan, Sven Höfling, Falk Eilenberger, Seth Ariel Tongay, Christian Schneider, Miroslav Ježek, Ana Predojević
Abstract: We present a universal deep-learning method that reconstructs super-resolved images of quantum emitters from a single camera frame measurement. Trained on physics-based synthetic data spanning diverse point-spread functions, aberrations, and noise, the network generalizes across experimental conditions without system-specific retraining. We validate the approach on low- and high-density In(Ga)As quantum dots and strain-induced dots in 2D monolayer WSe$_2$, resolving overlapping emitters even under low signal-to-noise and inhomogeneous backgrounds. By eliminating calibration and iterative acquisitions, this single-shot strategy enables rapid, robust super-resolution for nanoscale characterization and quantum photonic device fabrication.

Title: The Physics of Data and Tasks: Theories of Locality and Compositionality in Deep Learning
Authors: Alessandro Favero
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning representations.

Title: Connections between Richardson-Gaudin States, Perfect-Pairing, and Pair Coupled-Cluster Theory
Authors: Paul A. Johnson, Charles-Émile Fecteau, Samuel Nadeau, Mauricio Rodríguez-Mayorga, Pierre-François Loos
Abstract: Slater determinants underpin most electronic structure methods, but orbital-based approaches often struggle to describe strong correlation efficiently. Geminal-based theories, by contrast, naturally capture static correlation in bond-breaking and multireference problems, though at the expense of implementation complexity and limited treatment of dynamic effects. In this work, we examine the interplay between orbital and geminal frameworks, focusing on perfect-pairing (PP) wavefunctions and their relation to pair coupled-cluster doubles (pCCD) and Richardson-Gaudin (RG) states. We show that PP arises as an eigenvector of a simplified reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) Hamiltonian expressed in bonding/antibonding orbital pairs, with the complementary eigenvectors enabling a systematic treatment of weak correlation. Second-order Epstein-Nesbet perturbation theory on top of PP is found to yield energies nearly equivalent to pCCD. These results clarify the role of pair-based ansätze and open avenues for hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of orbital- and geminal-based methods.

Title: Thermodynamic Performance Limits for Score-Based Diffusion Models
Authors: Nathan X. Kodama, Michael Hinczewski
Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates - system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects generative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through stochastic thermodynamics.

Title: Derivation of Bose-Einstein statistics from the uncertainty principle
Authors: Paul Tangney
Abstract: The microstate of any degree of freedom of any classical dynamical system can be represented by a point in its two dimensional phase space. Since infinitely precise measurements are impossible, a measurement can, at best, constrain the location of this point to a region of phase space whose area is finite. This paper explores the implications of assuming that this finite area is bounded from below. I prove that if the same lower bound applied to every degree of freedom of a sufficiently cold classical dynamical system, the distribution of the system's energy among its degrees of freedom would be a Bose-Einstein distribution.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of disorder in the form of impurity scattering on a generalized version of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals where the frequency detuning between the two orthogonally polarized beams is nonzero. Considering a minimal model with two Weyl nodes at different energies, we employ the self-consistent Born approximation to unravel the dependence of the associated two-point retarded Green's function on the strength of intra- and internode scattering, frequency detuning, and energy difference between the two Weyl nodes. In the case of intranode scattering only, the second-order current density acquires Drudelike features, which we elucidate further by introducing an effective scattering strength. The Drude-like theory can even describe the second-order response in the presence of strong internode scattering, provided the latter has a linear interdependence with the intranode scattering. By properly adjusting the frequency detuning, we also find the real part of the two-point retarded Green's function to be reminiscent of a "quantized CPGE"-like form, although the imaginary part of the latter function is in general finite, and the second-order current density oscillates with time due to the finite frequency this http URL finally conclude with an outlook on possible experimental consequences.

Title: CMOS-Compatible Electrostatic SWAP Gate in Silicon Quantum Dots: Justification of Tight-Binding Model and Going Beyond
Authors: Krzysztof Pomorski, Eryk Halubek
Abstract: We present a generalized electrostatic SWAP gate realized in a chain of two double quantum dots operated in the single-electron regime. Using a minimalist tight-binding model, we derive analytical results and corroborate them with numerical simulations. We exploit the charge anticorrelation arising from Coulomb repulsion and quantify the resulting entanglement generation. We contrast classical and quantum descriptions and show how device geometry and coupling strengths govern entanglement dynamics and gate performance. The results are relevant to cryogenic, CMOS-compatible quantum technologies and suggest a route toward large-scale semiconductor implementations of quantum logic. Finally, we outline a systematic procedure for translating classical electrostatic logic gates into single-electron quantum gates.

Title: A formula for the generation of shaking induced insulator-conductor transition in atomtronic transistors
Authors: Wenxi Lai, Yu-Quan Ma, Yi-Wen Wei
Abstract: Mott insulator of atomic transport can be realized in driven optical lattices by choosing particular ratio of driving frequency and amplitude, which has been studied as Floquet engineering with time-independent effective Hamiltonian approach. Here, we give general conditions of frequency-amplitude radio for realization of the driving induced insulator-conductor transition in a double-well open system, using instantaneous eigenstates approach. As we proved here, the instantaneous eigenstates approach is applicable in more wide parameter range compared with the time-independent effective Hamiltonian approach. Analysis from the results of quantum master equation shows that the insulator effect is originated from coherent localization of atom wave packets in optical wells.

Title: Electricity at the macroscale and its microscopic origins
Authors: Paul Tangney
Abstract: I define the fields that describe electrical macrostructure, and their rates of change, in terms of the microscopic charge density, electric field, electric potential, and their rates of change. To deduce these definitions, I lay some new foundations of a theory of how observable macroscopic fields are related to spatial averages of their microscopic counterparts. I find that the relationships between macroscopic fields are identical in form to the relationships between their microscopic counterparts, meaning that the $\vec{P}$ and ${\vec{D}}$ fields do not appear in them. Without invoking quantum mechanics, I derive the expressions for polarization current established by the Modern Theory of Polarization. I prove that the bulk-average electric potential, or mean inner potential, vanishes in a macroscopically-uniform charge-neutral material, and I show that when a crystal lattice lacks inversion symmetry, it does not imply the existence of macroscopic $\vec{E}$ or $\vec{P}$ fields in the crystal's bulk. I point out that symmetry is scale-dependent. Therefore, if anisotropy of the microstructure does not manifest as anisotropy of the macrostructure, it cannot be the origin of a macroscopic vector field. The macroscopic charge density vanishes in a material's bulk. Therefore, regardless of the microstructure, a macroscopic $\vec{E}$ field cannot emanate from the bulk. I find that all relationships between observable macroscopic fields can be expressed mathematically without introducing the polarization ($\vec{P}$) and electric displacement ($\vec{D}$) fields, neither of which is observable. I also show that most `quantum mechanical' aspects of the existing microscopic theory of electricity in materials are compatible with, or required features of, a statistical theory of classical particles whose charges and masses are comparable to those of electrons and nuclei.

Title: Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities
Authors: Hang Su, Yuan Yao, Akira Furusaki
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional "spin" systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.

Title: Geometric expansion of fluctuations and average shadows
Authors: Clément Berthière, Benoit Estienne, Jean-Marie Stéphan, William Witczak-Krempa
Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.

Title: Topologically Driven Spin-Orbit Torque in Dirac Matter
Authors: Joaquín Medina Dueñas, José H. García, Stephan Roche
Abstract: We unveil novel spin-orbit torque mechanisms driven by topological edge states in magnetic graphene-based devices. Within the energy gap, a damping-like torque plateau emerges within the quantum anomalous Hall phase upon breaking particle-hole symmetry, while for energies at the spin-split Dirac points located within the bands, a large damping-like torque develops as a result of a vanishing Fermi contour. Such torques are tunable by the degree of spin-pseudospin entanglement dictated by proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling terms.

Title: Visualization of spin-orbit entangled 4f electrons in crystalline materials
Authors: Shunsuke Kitou, Kentaro Ueda, Yuiga Nakamura, Kunihisa Sugimoto, Yusuke Nomura, Ryotaro Arita, Yoshinori Tokura, Taka-hisa Arima
Abstract: Lanthanide 4f electrons are strongly influenced by spin-orbit coupling, resulting in well-defined J multiplets, which are further split by the crystalline electric field in condensed matter. While the anisotropy of 4f electrons is closely linked to material properties, direct experimental observation of the 4f electron distribution in real space remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an approach for visualizing the anisotropic distribution of lanthanide 4f electrons in pyrochlore oxides by combining high-photon-energy X-ray diffraction and valence electron density (VED) analysis based on the core differential Fourier synthesis (CDFS) method. The observed VED distributions around the lanthanide site reveal the parameters of the ground-state wavefunction, which roughly agree with point-charge calculations for the trigonal crystal electric field under the LS coupling scheme. This CDFS-based VED observation method not only provides insights into the anisotropic nature of 4f electrons but also opens a pathway for studying the 4f states in a wide range of crystalline materials.

Title: Catalog of cubic, symmetry-protected, non-Fermi liquid, Kondo-type exchange models for doublet impurities
Authors: Anna I. Toth, Andrew D. Huxley
Abstract: To identify what types of non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior are most likely to occur in cubic metals due to doublet impurities, we derive every cubic symmetry-allowed, NFL, Kondo-type exchange coupling that does not need accidental degeneracy for its realization. We find three distinct types of NFL behavior: two-channel Kondo (2CK) behavior for a non-Kramers doublet impurity coupled to local $\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons; topological Kondo physics for a Kramers doublet impurity and $\Gamma_4$ or $\Gamma_5$ conduction electrons; and lastly, spin-half impurity spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ conduction electron Kondo behavior for a Kramers doublet impurity and $\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons. The first two critical behaviors are not straightforward to realize. In the first case, 2CK physics is not guaranteed, since cubic symmetry does not prevent an effective spatial anisotropy from exceeding the 2CK coupling, which restores a Fermi liquid behavior. In the second case, the topological Kondo interaction is guaranteed to dominate, however, the spin degeneracy of the conduction electrons needs to be lifted e.g. by a magnetic field$-$so that they can be represented by $\Gamma_4$ or $\Gamma_5$ triplets$-$which then also lifts the degeneracy of the Kramers doublet. We find that the spin-half impurity spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ conduction electron, NFL, Kondo behavior has the greatest chance of existing in diluted, cubic compounds. We compute the thermodynamics of the topological Kondo model using the numerical renormalization group, and discuss the thermodynamics of the spin-half impurity spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ conduction electron Kondo model. We also identify candidate materials where the corresponding NFL behaviors could be observed.

Title: Actuation of Cell Sheets in 3D
Authors: Kirsten Endresen, Aniruddh Murali, Birte Geerds, Daniel J.G. Pearce, Francesca Serra
Abstract: The alignment of fibers and cells in living tissues affect their mechanical properties and functionality. In this context, one can draw an analogy between tissues and nematic liquid crystal elastomers. We explore this analogy by growing fibroblasts on 2D-patterned substrates and observing the contraction of cell sheets upon detachment from the substrates. When fibroblast sheets detach, they undergo an anisotropic contraction, with maximum contraction along the nematic director, like nematic elastomers do during phase transition. We quantify this anisotropy using substrates patterned with stripes to induce alignment, finding that cell sheets resemble nematic elastomers with negative Poisson ratio. Then, we apply design principles used for programming curvature in nematic elastomers to actuate 3D structures in the detached fibroblast layers, demonstrating an application of these principles and we support the results with simulations. This proof of concept shows the ability to control the 3D shape through 2D patterning in cell layers, leading to promising avenues to program tissues.

Title: 3D pattern formation of a protein-membrane suspension
Authors: Amélie Chardac, Michael M. Norton, Jonathan Touboul, Guillaume Duclos
Abstract: Many essential cellular processes, including cell division and the establishment of cell polarity during embryogenesis, are regulated by pattern-forming proteins. These proteins often need to bind to a substrate, such as the cell membrane, onto which they interact and form two-dimensional (2D) patterns. It is unclear how the membrane's continuity and dimensionality impact pattern formation. Here, we address this gap using the MinDE system, a prototypical example of pattern-forming membrane proteins. We show that when the lipid substrate is fragmented into submicrometer-sized diffusive liposomes, ATP-driven protein-protein interactions generate three-dimensional (3D) spatially extended patterns, despite the complete loss of membrane continuity. Remarkably, these 3D patterns emerge at scales four orders of magnitude larger than the individual liposomes. By systematically varying protein concentration, liposome size, and density, we observed and characterized a variety of 3D dynamical patterns not seen on continuous 2D membranes, including traveling waves, dynamical spirals, and a coexistence phase. Simulations and linear stability analysis of a coarse-grained model revealed that the physical properties of the dispersed membrane effectively rescale both the protein-membrane binding rates and diffusion, two key parameters governing pattern formation and wavelength selection. These findings highlight the robustness of Min's pattern-forming ability, suggesting that protein-membrane suspensions could serve as an adaptable template for studying out-of-equilibrium self-organization in 3D, beyond in vivo contexts.

Title: Algebraic Exact Solution for Driven Landau Levels in Two-dimensional Electron Gases
Authors: Li-kun Shi
Abstract: Controlling quantum systems with time-dependent fields opens avenues for engineering novel states of matter and exploring non-equilibrium phenomena. Landau levels in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs), with their discrete energy spectrum and characteristic cyclotron dynamics, provide an important platform for realizing and studying such driven quantum systems. While exact solutions for driven Landau levels exist, they have been limited to specific gauges or representations. In this work, we present an algebraic, gauge- and representation-independent exact solution for driven Landau levels in 2DEGs subject to arbitrary time-dependent electromagnetic fields. Our approach, based on a time-dependent unitary transformation via the displacement operator, provides clear physical insights into the driven quantum dynamics. We apply this method to derive the exact Floquet states and quasienergies for periodically driven Landau levels, and we extend our analysis to the resonant driving regime, where the Floquet picture breaks down and the electron wavefunction exhibits unbounded spatial spreading. Furthermore, we calculate the instantaneous energy absorption rate, revealing distinct absorption behaviors between coherent states and Fock or thermal states, stemming from quantum interference effects.

Title: MatLLMSearch: Crystal Structure Discovery with Evolution-Guided Large Language Models
Authors: Jingru Gan, Peichen Zhong, Yuanqi Du, Yanqiao Zhu, Chenru Duan, Haorui Wang, Daniel Schwalbe-Koda, Carla P. Gomes, Kristin A. Persson, Wei Wang
Abstract: Crystal structure generation is fundamental to materials science, enabling the discovery of novel materials with desired properties. While existing approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) through extensive fine-tuning on materials databases, we show that pre-trained LLMs can inherently generate novel and stable crystal structures without additional fine-tuning. Our framework employs LLMs as intelligent proposal agents within an evolutionary pipeline that guides them to perform implicit crossover and mutation operations while maintaining chemical validity. We demonstrate that MatLLMSearch achieves a 78.38% metastable rate validated by machine learning interatomic potentials and 31.7% DFT-verified stability, outperforming specialized models such as CrystalTextLLM. Beyond crystal structure generation, we further demonstrate that our framework adapts to diverse materials design tasks, including crystal structure prediction and multi-objective optimization of properties such as deformation energy and bulk modulus, all without fine-tuning. These results establish our framework as a versatile and effective framework for consistent high-quality materials discovery, offering training-free generation of novel stable structures with reduced overhead and broader accessibility.

Title: Multipolar Fermi Surface Deformations in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ Probed by Resistivity and Sound Attenuation: A Window into Electron Viscosity and the Collision Operator
Authors: Davis Thuillier, Sayak Ghosh, B. J. Ramshaw, Thomas Scaffidi
Abstract: Recent developments in electron hydrodynamics have demonstrated the importance of considering the full structure of the electron-electron scattering operator, which encodes a sequence of lifetimes, one for each component of the Fermi surface deformation in a multipolar expansion. In this context, the dipolar lifetime is measured by resistivity, whereas the quadrupolar component probes the viscosity and can be measured in the bulk via sound attenuation. We introduce a framework to extract the collision operator of an arbitrary metal by combining resistivity and sound attenuation measurements with a realistic calculation of the scattering operator that includes multiband and Umklapp effects. The collision operator allows for the prediction of a plethora of properties, including the non-local conductivity, and can be used to predict hydrodynamic behavior for bulk metals. As a first application, we apply this framework to Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in a temperature range where electron-electron scattering is dominant. We find quantitative agreement between our model and the temperature dependence of both the resistivity and the sound attenuation, we find the quadrupolar (B1g) relaxation rate to be 30% higher than the dipolar one due to the presence of hot spots on the $\gamma$ band, and we predict a strongly anisotropic viscosity arising from the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands.

Title: Robustness of Vacancy-Bound Non-Abelian Anyons in the Kitaev Model in a Magnetic Field
Authors: Bo Xiao, Gonzalo Alvarez, Gábor B. Halász
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model, such anyons of the QSL state can be bound to nonmagnetic spin vacancies and endowed with non-Abelian statistics by an infinitesimal magnetic field. Here, we investigate how this approach for stabilizing non-Abelian anyons extends to a finite magnetic field represented by a proper Zeeman term. Through large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute the vacancy-anyon binding energy as a function of magnetic field for both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev models. We find that anyon binding remains robust within the entire QSL phase for the FM Kitaev model but breaks down already inside this phase for the AFM Kitaev model. To compute a binding energy several orders of magnitude below the magnetic energy scale, we introduce both a refined definition and an extrapolation scheme based on carefully tailored perturbations.

Title: Understanding phonon selection and interference in momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy
Authors: Thomas W. Pfeifer, Harrison A. Walker, Henry T. Aller, Samuel Graham, Sokrates Pantelides, Jordan A. Hachtel, Patrick E. Hopkins, Eric R. Hoglund
Abstract: As momentum-resolved Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (q-EELS) becomes more widely used for phonon measurements, better understanding of the intricacies of the acquired signal is necessary. Selection rules limit the allowed scattering, which may prohibit the appearance of specific phonon branches for certain measurements. Simultaneous sampling of the lattice across all basis indices also warrants a coherent treatment of phonons, which yields a larger repeating unit in reciprocal space. We thus introduce the concept of the ``interferometric Brillouin zone'', which is closely related to the Dynamic Structure Factor. Both effects determine where phonon modes may be observed. Through a rigorous understanding of both, we introduce a new efficient method for simulating scattering experiments via Spectral Energy Density (SED) and/or Lattice Dynamics (LD) calculations and results are compared to established q-EELS simulation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the use of scattering selection rules on well-studied systems and explore the acquisition of a polarization-selective vibrational density of states.

Title: Real-time edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices
Authors: Tian-Hua Yang, Chen Fang
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic forms of the Green's function at the open edges of general non-Hermitian band systems in all dimensions in the long-time limit, using a modified saddle-point approximation and the analytic continuation of the momentum. The edge dynamics is determined by the "dominant saddle point", a complex momentum, which, contrary to previous conjectures, may lie outside the generalized Brillouin zone. From this result, we obtain the effective edge Hamiltonians that evidently, as demonstrated by extensive numerical simulations, characterize the dynamics on the edges, and can be probed in real-time experiments or spectroscopies.

Title: Competition between shape anisotropy and deformation in the ordering and close packing properties of quasi-one-dimensional hard superellipse fluids
Authors: Sakineh Mizani, Martin Oettel, Péter Gurin, Szabolcs Varga
Abstract: We investigate the orientational ordering and close-packing behavior of a quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) system of hard superellipses, where the centers of the particles are confined to a line, but they can rotate freely within a two-dimensional plane. The particle shape is tuned between an ellipse and a rectangle by varying the deformation parameter (n). The elongation of the particle is changed using the aspect ratio (k). The pressure ratio between freely rotating and parallel hard superellipses, which displays a single peak, serves as an effective marker for the continuous structural change from quasi-isotropic to nematic ordering. Our findings reveal a competition between the parameters k and n, with k promoting nematic alignment and n favoring tetratic ordering. Notably, in the close-packing regime, the packing properties become independent of k, as the relevant exponents depend solely on n. Furthermore, certain combinations of these exponents exhibit universality, remaining invariant with respect to particle shape

Abstract: Temperature plays a crucial role in metastable phenomena, not only by contributing to determine the state (phase) of a system, but also ruling the decay probability to more stable states. Such a situation is encountered in many different physical systems, ranging from chemical reactions to magnetic structures. The characteristic decay timescale is not always straightforward to estimate since it depends on the microscopic details of the system. A paradigmatic example in quantum field theories is the decay of the false vacuum, manifested via the nucleation of bubbles. In this paper, we measure the temperature dependence of the timescale for the false vacuum decay mechanism in an ultracold atomic quantum spin mixture which exhibits ferromagnetic properties. Our results show that the false vacuum decay rate scales with temperature as predicted by the finite-temperature extension of the instanton theory, and confirm atomic systems as an ideal platform where to study out-of-equilibrium field theories.

Title: Nonlinear spin and orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects induced by a femtosecond laser pulse: Simulations for Au(001)
Authors: Oliver Busch, Franziska Ziolkowski, Börge Göbel, Ingrid Mertig, Jürgen Henk
Abstract: Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling gives rise to distinctive surface and interface phenomena, such as spin-momentum locking and spin splitting. In nonequilibrium settings, one of the key manifestations is the (Rashba-)Edelstein effect, where an electric current generates a net spin or orbital polarization perpendicular to the current direction. While the steady-state behavior of these effects is well studied, their dynamics on ultrafast timescales remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of the ultrafast spin and orbital Edelstein effects on an Au(001) surface, triggered by excitation with a femtosecond laser pulse. These effects are intrinsic and inherently nonlinear. Using a real-space tight-binding model combined with time evolution governed by the von Neumann equation, we simulate the electron dynamics in response to the pulse. Our results reveal pronounced differences between the spin and orbital responses, offering detailed insights into their distinct temporal profiles and magnitudes. We further explore the associated charge, spin, and orbital currents, including the emergence of laser-induced spin and orbital Hall effects. Finally, we quantify the angular momentum transfer mediated by the light-matter interaction. These findings shed light on the intricate ultrafast dynamics driven by spin-orbit coupling and offer guidance for the design of next-generation spintronic and orbitronic devices.

Title: Electronic origin of reorganization energy in interfacial electron transfer
Authors: Sonal Maroo, Leonardo Coello Escalante, Yizhe Wang, Matthew P. Erodici, Jonathon N. Nessralla, Ayana Tabo, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Ke Xu, David T. Limmer, D. Kwabena Bediako
Abstract: Electron transfer (ET) reactions underpin energy conversion and chemical transformations in both biological and abiological systems. The efficiency of any ET process relies on achieving a desired ET rate within an optimal driving force range. Marcus theory provides a microscopic framework for understanding the activation free energy, and thus the rate, of ET in terms of a key parameter: the reorganization energy. For electrified solid-liquid interfaces, it has long been conventionally understood that only factors in the electrolyte phase are responsible for determining the reorganization energy and the electronic density of states (DOS) of the electrode serves only to dictate the number of thermally accessible channels for ET. Here we show instead that the electrode DOS plays a central role in governing the reorganization energy, far outweighing its conventionally assumed role. Using atomically layered heterostructures, we tune the DOS of graphene and measure outer-sphere ET kinetics. We find the ensuing variation in ET rate arises from strong modulation in a reorganization energy associated with image potential localization in the electrode. This work redefines the traditional paradigm of heterogeneous ET kinetics, revealing a deeper role of the electrode electronic structure in interfacial reactivity.

Title: Order-by-disorder in magnets with frustrated spin interactions -- classical and large-$S$ limits via the spin functional integral
Authors: Peng Rao, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: We investigate spin systems with extensive degeneracies in the classical ground states due to anisotropic frustrated spin interactions, where the degeneracy is not protected by symmetry. Using spin functional integration, we study the lifting of the degeneracies by fluctuations called order-by-disorder (ObD), and the associated gap in the spin-wave spectrum. It is shown that ObD corresponds to gradient-dependent anisotropic interactions of the pseudo-Goldstone modes, which vanish for a classical uniform spin configuration. Fluctuations generate a gradient-independent effective potential which determines the ground state and the pseudo-Goldstone gap. Furthermore, we recover previous predictions for the pseudo-Goldstone gap in type-I and II ObD with two-spin interactions in the large spin-$S$ limit or the classical small temperature limit, by computing the gap explicitly for the type-II cubic compass model and the type-I square compass model. We show that these two limits correspond to the one-loop approximation for the effective potential. We also discuss other types of order by disorder due to $m$-spin interactions where $m>2$.

Title: Electron correlations in kagome metals $AV_3Sb_5$ (A= K, Rb, Cs)
Authors: Feihu Liu, Changxu Liu, Maolin Zeng, Qiyi Zhao
Abstract: The investigation of electronic order-quantum phase interplay in kagome lattices commonly employs the extended Kagome-Hubbard model, where the critical parameters comprise on-site $(U)$ and intersite $(V)$ Coulomb interactions. In prototypical kagome metals \ch{AV3Sb5} (A = K, Rb, Cs), the geometrically frustrated quasi-2D architecture induces pressure-dependent complexity in vanadium d-electron correlations, necessitating systematic theoretical scrutiny. Utilizing the $d-dp$ model within constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), we quantified $U$, $V$, and Hund's coupling $J$ under hydrostatic pressure (0-9 GPa). While \ch{KV3Sb5} and \ch{RbV3Sb5} exhibit pressure-insensitive interaction parameters, \ch{CsV3Sb5} manifests anomalous discontinuities in $U$ and $V$ near $0.2$ GPa, suggesting a first-order electronic phase transition. This work establishes cRPA-derived interaction landscapes as critical predictors for pressure-tunable quantum phenomena in correlated kagome systems, offers a new insight into the understanding of the interplay between the CDW transition and the double superconductivity dome in \ch{CsV3Sb5} at low pressure.

Title: Generalized Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport
Authors: Guan-Hua Huang, Hui Tang, Shizhong Zhang, Zhongbo Yan, Zhigang Wu
Abstract: In spin-orbit-coupled systems the charge and spin transport are generally coupled to each other, namely a charge current will induce a spin current and vice versa. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry $T$, the cross-coupling transport coefficients describing how one process affects the other are constrained by the famous Onsager reciprocal relations. In this paper, we generalize the Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport to systems that break the time-reversal symmetry but preserve a combined symmetry of $T$ and some other symmetry operation $O$. We show that the symmetry or antisymmetry of the cross-coupling transport coefficients remains in place provided that the operator $O$ meets certain conditions. Among many candidate systems where our generalized Onsager relations apply, we focus on a conceptually simple and experimentally realized model in cold atomic systems for explicit demonstration and use these relations to predict highly non-trivial transport phenomena that can be readily verified experimentally.

Title: The free propagator of strongly anisotropic systems with free surfaces
Authors: M.A. Shpot
Abstract: A brief overview of fluctuation-induced forces in statistical systems with film geometry at the critical point and the calculation of Casimir amplitudes, which characterize these forces quantitatively, is presented. Particular attention is paid to the special features of strongly anisotropic $m$-axis systems at the Lifshitz point, specifically, in the case of a "$perpendicular$" orientation of surfaces with free boundary conditions. Beyond the simplest one-loop approximation, calculations of Casimir amplitudes are impossible without knowledge of the Gaussian propagator, which corresponds to the lines of Feynman diagrams in the perturbation theory. We present an explicit expression for such a propagator in the case of an anisotropic system confined by parallel surfaces $perpendicular$ to one of the anisotropy axes. Using this propagator, we reproduce the one-loop result derived earlier in an essentially different way. The knowledge of the propagator provides the possibility of higher-order calculations in perturbation theory.

Title: Kondo-Peierls transition with nonsymmorphic zone boundary gap formation
Authors: Kazumasa Hattori, Hiroaki Kusunose
Abstract: We study nonsymmorphic space group symmetry breakings in correlated electron systems. Under nonsymmorphic symmetry, it is well known that there are degeneracies in the electronic Bloch states at the Brillouin zone boundaries. When the system undergoes a phase transition into an ordered phase with breaking the nonsymmorphic symmetry, the degeneracy is lifted. This happens even when the order parameter is uniform. We point out that this general feature leads to various {\it uniform} Peierls transition in nonsymmorphic systems. In particular, we show that such mechanism of the Peierls gap formation can be realized accompanying with uniform anisotropic Kondo singlet formations. This explains the hidden electric order observed in CeCoSi.

Title: Nodal-line semimetals and their variance
Authors: Po-Yao Chang
Abstract: Topological nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) are a new family of topological materials characterized by electronic band crossings that form lines in the Brillouin zone. These NLSMs host exotic nodal-line structures and exhibit distinct features such as drumhead surface states and unique electromagnetic responses. This review classifies various NLSM types based on their nodal structures and protecting symmetries, highlighting that these nodal-line structures can form links, knots, and chains. We discuss their characteristic electromagnetic responses, including Landau level spectroscopy, optical conductivity, and permittivity. Furthermore, the strong correlation effects in these NLSMs modify their semimetallic phases and lead to novel quantum phases where magnetism and superconductivity intertwine.

Title: Decoupling thermoelectric coefficients of multilayer graphene by nanomeshing
Authors: Mehrdad Rahimi, Nunzia Lubertino, Roberto Bellelli, Linsai Chen, François Mallet, Philippe Lafarge, Clément Barraud, PAscal Marti, Julien Chaste, Danièle Fournier, Maria Luisa Della Rocca
Abstract: Nanostructuring materials at small scales enables control over their physical properties, revealing behaviors not observed at larger dimensions. This strategy is particularly effective in two-dimensional (2D) materials, where surface effects dominate, and has been applied in the thermoelectric field. Here, we use multilayer graphene (4-6 nm thick) as a test platform to study the effect of nanomeshing on its thermoelectric properties. The nanomesh consists of a hexagonal array of holes, with a measured diameter and neck-width of ~360 nm and ~160 nm, respectively. The multilayer graphene is integrated into field-effect transistor-like devices supported by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), allowing simultaneous electric and thermoelectric measurements, with nanomeshing applied to only part of the material. We use modulated thermoreflectance to investigate thermal transport in equivalent nanomeshed and pristine graphene flakes, extracting key parameters that affect thermoelectric performance. The nanomesh geometry suppresses thermal transport without significantly impacting charge transport, highlighting the different scattering lengths of phonons and electrons while enhancing the thermopower response. We observe a twofold improvement in the device power factor, PF = S^2 sigma (with S the Seebeck coefficient and sigma the electrical conductivity), at room temperature, along with a nearly threefold reduction in thermal conductivity k. The results show that nanomeshing can significantly improve the thermoelectric performance of multilayer graphene, paving the way for novel energy conversion strategies using 2D materials.

Title: Scalable tensor network algorithm for quantum impurity problems
Authors: Zhijie Sun, Ruofan Chen, Zhenyu Li, Chu Guo
Abstract: The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method has shown great potential as a general-purpose quantum impurity solver, as its numerical errors can be well-controlled and it is flexible to be applied on both the imaginary- and real-time axis. However, a major limitation of it is that its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve large-scale quantum impurity problems.

Title: Abrupt transitions in the optimization of diffusion with distributed resetting
Authors: Pedro Julián-Salgado, Leonardo Dagdug, Denis Boyer
Abstract: Brownian diffusion subject to stochastic resetting to a fixed position has been widely studied for applications to random search processes. In an unbounded domain, the mean first-passage time at a target site can be minimized for a convenient choice of the resetting rate. Here we study this optimization problem in one dimension when resetting occurs to random positions, chosen from a probability density function with compact support that does not include the target. Depending on the shape of this distribution, the optimal resetting rate either varies smoothly with the mean distance to the target, as in single-site resetting, or exhibits a discontinuity caused by the presence of a second local minimum in the mean first-passage time. These two regimes are separated by a critical line containing a singular point that we characterize through a Ginzburg-Landau theory. To quantify how useful is a given resetting point for the search, we calculate the probability density function of the last resetting position before absorption. The discontinuous transition separates two markedly different optimal strategies: one with a small resetting rate where the last path before absorption starts from a rather distant but likely position, while the other strategy has a large resetting rate, favoring last paths starting from not-so-likely points but which are closer to the target.

Title: Emergent interactions lead to collective frustration in robotic matter
Authors: Onurcan Bektas, Adolfo Alsina, Steffen Rulands
Abstract: Current artificial intelligence systems show near-human-level capabilities when deployed in isolation. Systems of a few collaborating intelligent agents are being engineered to perform tasks collectively. This raises the question of whether robotic matter, where many learning and intelligent agents interact, shows emergence of collective behaviour. And if so, which kind of phenomena would such systems exhibit? Here, we study a paradigmatic model for robotic matter: a stochastic many-particle system in which each particle is endowed with a deep neural network that predicts its transitions based on the particles' environments. For a one-dimensional model, we show that robotic matter exhibits complex emergent phenomena, including transitions between long-lived learning regimes, the emergence of particle species, and frustration. We also find a density-dependent phase transition with signatures of criticality. Using active matter theory, we show that this phase transition is a consequence of self-organisation mediated by emergent inter-particle interactions. Our simple model captures key features of more complex forms of robotic systems.

Title: Role of nanoparticle shape on the critical size for quasi-uniform ordering: from spheres to cubes through superballs
Authors: Iago López-Vázquez, David Serantes, Òscar Iglesias
Abstract: The equilibrium states of single-domain magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) result from a subtle interplay between size, geometry, and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. In this work, we present a micromagnetic study of shape-controlled magnetite NPs using the superball geometry, which provides a continuous interpolation between spheres and cubes. By isolating the influence of shape, we analyze the transition from quasi-uniform (single-domain) to vortex-like states as particle size increases, revealing critical sizes that depend on the superball exponent p. Our simulations show that faceted geometries promote the stabilization of vortex states at larger sizes, with marked distortions in the vortex core structure. The inclusion of cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, representative of magnetite, further lowers the critical size and introduces preferential alignment along the [111] easy axes. For isotropic shapes, the critical size for this transition increases with p, ranging from ~49 nm for spheres to ~56 nm for cubes, in agreement with experimental trends. In contrast, the presence of slight particle elongation increases the critical size and induces another preferential alignment direction. These results demonstrate that even small deviations from sphericity or aspect ratio significantly alter the magnetic ordering and stability of equilibrium magnetic states.

Title: Extreme anharmonicity and thermal contraction of 1D wires
Authors: Chiara Cignarella, Lorenzo Bastonero, Lorenzo Monacelli, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: Ultrathin nanowires could play a central role in next-generation downscaled electronics. Here, we explore some of the most promising candidates identified from previous high-throughput screening: CuC$_2$, TaSe$_3$, and AuSe$_2$, to gain insight into the thermodynamic and anharmonic behaviors of nanowires that could be exfoliated from weakly-bonded three-dimensional materials. We analyze thermal stability, linear thermal expansion, and anharmonic heat capacity using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. Notably, our work unveils exotic features common among all the 1D wires: a colossal record negative thermal expansion and very large deviations from the Dulong-Petit law due to strong anharmonicity.

Title: When Surface Dynamics Fakes Symmetry -- Oxygen on Rh(100) Revisited
Authors: Lutz Hammer, Tilman Kißlinger, Margareta Wagner, Reinhard B. Neder, Michael Schmid, Ulrike Diebold, M. Alexander Schneider
Abstract: Heating a long-range ordered adsorbate phase beyond its stability temperature does not necessarily result in a disordered phase, it can also break up into heavily fluctuating ordered domains. Temporal and/or spatial averaging over these fluctuations may give the impression of both a wrong periodicity and a false local symmetry. This can happen even below liquid-nitrogen temperature, so that the true nature of the phase might remain undetected. We demonstrate this scenario at the catalytically active Rh(100) surface covered by 1/2 monolayer of oxygen, using quantitative low energy electron diffraction (LEED), variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). Using the example of CO adsorption, we show that local symmetry can have a decisive influence on the binding energy and thus the chemical reactivity.

Title: FreeBird.jl: An Extensible Toolbox for Simulating Interfacial Phase Equilibria
Authors: Ray Yang, Junchi Chen, Douglas Thibodeaux, Robert B. Wexler
Abstract: We present FreeBird, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and multiple dispatch, FreeBird provides a modular interface that allows seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, FreeBird offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena.

Title: Intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect in the strained bilayer graphene
Authors: Ying-Li Wu, Jia-Liang Wan, Xiao-Qin Yu
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the nonlinear valley Nernst effect (NVNE) as the second-order response of temperature gradient through the semiclassical framework of electron dynamics. Our study shows that an intrinsic nonlinear pure valley current can be generated vertically to the applied temperature in the materials with both inversion and time-reversal symmetries. This intrinsic NVNE has a quantum origin from the quantum metric and shows independence from the relaxation time. We find that the local largest symmetry near the valleys for the nonvanishing intrinsic NVNE is a single mirror symmetry in two-dimensional systems. We theoretically investigate the intrinsic NVNE in the uniaxially strained gapless bilayer graphene and find the intrinsic NVNE can emerge when applying the temperature gradient vertically to the direction of strain. Interestingly, a transition from the compressive strain to the tensile one results in the sign reversal of the intrinsic NVNE.

Title: Duality between dissipation-coherence trade-off and thermodynamic speed limit based on thermodynamic uncertainty relation for stochastic limit cycles
Authors: Ryuna Nagayama, Sosuke Ito
Abstract: We derive two fundamental trade-offs for general stochastic limit cycles in the weak-noise limit. The first is the dissipation-coherence trade-off, which was numerically conjectured and partially proved by Santolin and Falasco [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 057101 (2025)]. This trade-off bounds the entropy production required for one oscillatory period using the number of oscillations that occur before steady-state correlations are disrupted. The second is the thermodynamic speed limit, which bounds the entropy production with the Euclidean length of the limit cycle. These trade-offs are obtained by substituting mutually dual observables, derived from the stability of the limit cycle, into the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. This fact allows us to regard the dissipation-coherence trade-off as the dual of the thermodynamic speed limit. We numerically demonstrate these trade-offs using the noisy Rössler model. We also apply the trade-offs to stochastic chemical systems, where the diffusion coefficient matrix may contain zero eigenvalues.

Title: Coupling induced emergent topology in a two-leg fermionic ladder
Authors: Rajashri Parida, Biswajit Paul, Soumya Ranjan Padhi, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: We investigate the ground state properties of spinless fermions on a two leg ladder, by allowing the nearest-neighbour hopping dimerization in one leg and uniform hopping in the other. In the non-interacting limit, we find that, at half-filling, the system exhibits robust topological behavior if the inter-leg hopping is allowed. Though depending on the dimerization pattern, the dimerized leg can be either topological or trivial in nature, here we show that by connecting such a leg to a uniform leg through inter-chain coupling, the overall system becomes topological irrespective of the dimerization pattern in the dimerized leg. As a result, a topological phase transition occurs as a function of the inter-leg hopping. When the inter-leg interaction is turned on, the topological phase survives, and we obtain an interaction induced topological phase transition. Finally, we reveal that when uniform interactions are included on all the bonds of the ladder, the topological phase transitions to a symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) phase.

Title: Topological Textures in Zr-Substituted Barium Titanate
Authors: Florian Mayer
Abstract: Topological polarization textures in ferroelectrics offer pathways to dense memory, neuromorphic computing, and controlled probes of topology in solids. In rhombohedral barium titanate, theory has identified stable antiskyrmions of topological charge -2 that fractionalize into six -1/3 hotspots, termed topological quarks. Here we extend this landscape to Zr-substituted barium titanate (BZT) using a first-principles parameterized effective Hamiltonian framework. In an ordered 12.5% composition, the chemically doubled periodicity enforces an alternation along [111]: one half hosts the -2 antiskyrmion (six -1/3 quarks), the other a +4 skyrmion (six +2/3 quarks). The two share the same six-vortex skeleton but differ by an integer +1 per vortex in the plane-integrated topological (slice) charge. In random BZT, nanodomains remain inducible and cryogenically stable, yet quenched disorder pins and distorts the vortices, producing a heterogeneous, skyrmion-glass-like state with fluctuations of the topological charge along the nanodomain axis. Thermal stability maps show that pure barium titanate retains -2 textures up to ~100 K, whereas in BZT the critical temperature is nonmonotonic, with a minimum near 6-8% Zr, reflecting competition between ferroelectric softening and disorder pinning. Importantly, the 12.5% ordered arrangement remains rhombohedral above 300 K, enabling field-stabilized nanodomains at 293 K. Under a local [111] bias, the ordered system carries +4 slice charge, while the random composition fragments under the same conditions. These results establish BZT as a platform for chemically programmed, fractionalized ferroelectric topology from cryogenic to room temperature and suggest routes to multistate, reconfigurable devices.

Title: Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties
Authors: Zhandos A. Moldabekov, Sebastian Schwalbe, Uwe Hernandez Acosta, Thomas Gawne, Jan Vorberger, Michele Pavanello, Tobias Dornheim
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based noise attenuation technique to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus potentially saving millions of CPU hours for modeling a single XRTS measurement of matter under extreme conditions.

Title: Measuring the measurement problem: controlling decoherence with measurement duration in molecular MCB junctions
Authors: C.J. Muller
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the measurement duration on quantum coherence in molecular mechanically controlled break junctions operating in a tetrahydrofuran (THF) partially wet phase. These systems represent a distinct class of enclosed open quantum systems with unusually long decoherence times at ambient conditions, on the order of 1-20 ms. By tuning the integration time of the current measurement in current-voltage (IV) characteristics, relative to the decoherence time, we observe a transition from quantum interference patterns, manifested as structured bands of data points, to classical behavior characterized by a single averaged response. This demonstrates that the duration of a measurement acts as a controllable parameter for probing quantum behavior in molecular junctions, offering new insights into decoherence dynamics in quantum mechanics.

Title: Interplay of order and disorder in two-dimensional critical systems with mixed boundary conditions
Authors: E.Eisenriegler
Abstract: In spin systems such as the Ising model, the local order and disorder can be characterized by the order-parameter and energy density profiles $\langle \sigma ({\bf r}_1) \rangle$ and $\langle \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle$, respectively. Does increasing the order at ${\bf r}_1$ always decrease the disorder at ${\bf r}_2$? Does increasing the disorder at ${\bf r}_2$ always decrease the order at ${\bf r}_1$? The answer to these questions is contained in the cumulant response function $\langle\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle^{(\rm cum)}$. This correlation function vanishes in the unbounded bulk but not in systems with fixed-spin boundary conditions. Using the universal operator-product expansion of $\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2)$ and exact results for the Ising model, we analyze $\langle\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle^{(\rm cum)}$ in two-dimensional critical systems defined on the $x-y$ plane with mixed $+$ and $-$ boundary conditions. Particularly interesting behavior is found when either of the operators $\sigma$ or $\epsilon$ is located on a ``zero line" in the $x-y$ plane, along which $\langle\sigma ({\bf r})\rangle$ vanishes. Results for half-plane, triangular, and rectangular geometries are presented.

Title: Classification of Weyl point trajectories in multi-terminal Josephson junctions
Authors: Kento Takemura, Tomohiro Yokoyama
Abstract: Topological protection is an attractive signature in both fundamental and applied researches because it provides an exotic and robust state. Multi-terminal Josephson junctions have recently been studied extensively owing to the emergence of topologically protected Weyl points without the need for topological materials. In this study, we examine the dynamic properties of Weyl points in multi-terminal Josephson junctions. The junctions are modulated by external parameters, such as electric gate voltage, magnetic flux, bias voltage. The Weyl points are manipulated and draw trajectories accompanied by pair creation and annihilation. The trajectories form both closed loops and open lines. We classify these trajectories using the Chern number and the phase diagram.

Title: AtomWorld: A Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models on Crystalline Materials
Authors: Taoyuze Lv, Alexander Chen, Fengyu Xie, Chu Wu, Jeffrey Meng, Dongzhan Zhou, Bram Hoex, Zhicheng Zhong, Tong Xie
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.

Title: Finite temperature dopant-induced spin reorganization explored via tensor networks in the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model
Authors: Yintai Zhang, Aritra Sinha, Marek M. Rams, Jacek Dziarmaga
Abstract: Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.

Title: Quantum memory at nonzero temperature in a thermodynamically trivial system
Authors: Yifan Hong, Jinkang Guo, Andrew Lucas
Abstract: Passive error correction protects logical information forever in the thermodynamic limit by updating the system based only on local information and few-body interactions. A paradigmatic example is the classical two-dimensional Ising model: a Metropolis-style Gibbs sampler retains the sign of the initial magnetization (a logical bit) for thermodynamically long times in the low-temperature phase. Known models of passive quantum error correction similarly exhibit thermodynamic phase transitions to a low-temperature phase wherein logical qubits are protected by thermally stable topological order. Here, in contrast, we show that certain families of constant-rate classical and quantum low-density parity check codes have no thermodynamic phase transitions at nonzero temperature, but nonetheless exhibit ergodicity-breaking dynamical transitions: below a critical nonzero temperature, the mixing time of local Gibbs sampling diverges in the thermodynamic limit. Slow Gibbs sampling of such codes enables fault-tolerant passive quantum error correction using finite-depth circuits. This strategy is well suited to measurement-free quantum error correction and may present a desirable experimental alternative to conventional quantum error correction based on syndrome measurements and active feedback.

Title: Coherent expansion of the motional state of a massive nanoparticle beyond its linear dimensions
Authors: R. Muffato, T.S. Georgescu, M. Carlesso, M. Paternostro, H. Ulbricht
Abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts that massive particles exhibit wave-like behavior. Matterwave interferometry has been able to validate such predictions through ground-breaking experiments involving microscopic systems like atoms and molecules. The wavefunction of such systems coherently extends over a distance much larger than their size, an achievement that is incredibly challenging for massive and more complex objects. Yet, reaching similar level of coherent diffusion will enable tests of fundamental physics at the genuinely macroscopic scale, as well as the development of quantum sensing apparata of great sensitivity. We report on experimentally achieving an unprecedented degree of position diffusion in a massive levitated optomechanical system through frequency modulation of the trapping potential. By starting with a pre-cooled state of motion and employing a train of sudden pulses yet of mild modulation depth, we surpass previously attained values of position diffusion in this class of systems to reach diffusion lengths that exceed the physical dimensions of the trapped nanoparticle.

Title: Gauging a superposition of fermionic Gaussian projected entangled pair states to get lattice gauge theory eigenstates
Authors: Gertian Roose, Erez Zohar
Abstract: Gauged fermionic projected entangled pair states (GFPEPS) and their Gaussian counterpart (GGFPEPS) are a novel type of lattice gauge theory Ansatz state that combine ideas from the Monte Carlo and tensor network communities. In particular, computation of observables for such states boils down to a Monte Carlo integration over possible gauge field configurations that have probabilities dictated by a fermionic tensor network contraction that accounts for the matter in that background configuration. Crucially, this probability distribution is positive definite and real so that there is no sign problem. When the underlying PEPS is Gaussian, tensor network contraction can be done efficiently, and in this scenario the Ansatz has been tested well numerically. In this work we propose to gauge superpositions of Gaussian PEPS and demonstrate that one can still efficiently compute observables when few Gaussians are in the superposition. As we will argue, the latter is exactly the case for bound states on top of the strongly interacting LGT vacuum, which makes this Ansatz particularly suitable for that scenario. As a corollary, we will provide an exact representation of the LGT ground state as a gauged PEPS.

Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.

Title: Towards Code States via Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuits: Application to Tetra-Digit Topological Error-Correcting Codes
Authors: Yu-Tao Hu, Meng-Yuan Li, Peng Ye
Abstract: Demonstrating how long-range entangled states are born from product states has gained much attention, which is not only important for quantum technology but also provides an unconventional tool in characterizing and classifying exotic phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a unified and efficient framework of quantum circuits (i.e., a series of local unitary transformations), termed the \emph{Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuit} (SEESQC) to construct long-range entangled states (i.e., code states) in code space of topological error-correcting codes. Specifically, we apply SEESQC to construct code states of Tetra-Digit models -- a broad class of long-range entangled stabilizer codes indexed by a four-digit parameter. These models are not rare but encompass Toric Codes across arbitrary dimensions and subsume the X-cube fracton code as special cases. Featuring a hierarchical structure of generalized entanglement renormalization group, many Tetra-Digit models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes, and exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability, and exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale exponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. In this work, we begin with graphical and algebraic demonstration of quantum circuits for computational basis states, before generalizing to broader cases. Central to this framework is a key ingredient termed the \emph{seed-entangler} acting on a small number of qubits termed \textit{seeds}, enabling a systematic scheme to achieve arbitrary code states. Remarkably, the number of available seeds equals the number of logical qubits for the constructed examples, which leaves plenty of room for future investigation in theoretical physics, mathematics and quantum information science. Beyond the critical limitation of prior state-engineering methodologies, ...

Title: Hierarchic superradiant phases in anisotropic Dicke model
Authors: D. K. He, Z. Song
Abstract: We revisit the phase diagram of an anisotropic Dicke model by revealing the non-analyticity induced by underlying exceptional points (EPs). We find that, from a dynamical perspective, the conventional superradiant phase can be further separated into three regions, in which the systems are characterized by different effective Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the Loschmidt echo to characterize different quantum phases by analyzing the quench dynamics of a trivial initial state. Numerical simulations for finite systems confirm our predictions about the existence of hierarchic superradiant phases.

We show that it behaves universally for a broad class of conformal field theories including the O(2) Wilson-Fisher fixed-point, by using the effective field theory at large global charge. The result establishes one of the first concrete computations of entanglement quantities in strongly-coupled field theories.

Title: Optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation enhanced by non-Gaussian distillation
Authors: Zi-Xu Lu, Xuan Zuo, Zhi-Yuan Fan, Jie Li
Abstract: The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.

Title: Constrained free energy minimization for the design of thermal states and stabilizer thermodynamic systems
Authors: Michele Minervini, Madison Chin, Jacob Kupperman, Nana Liu, Ivy Luo, Meghan Ly, Soorya Rethinasamy, Kathie Wang, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently, [Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total x, y, and z magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code. Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical qubits.

Title: Exact Solution for Two $δ$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $δ$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States
Authors: Maxim Olshanii, Mathias Albert, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo, Patrizia Vignolo, Steven G. Jackson
Abstract: In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.

Title: Real-Time String Dynamics in a $2+1$D Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory: String Breaking, Glueball Formation, Baryon Blockade, and Tension Reduction
Authors: Giovanni Cataldi, Simone Orlando, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: Understanding flux string dynamics can provide insight into quark confinement and hadronization. First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time string dynamics of a $2\!+\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter. In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a \textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.

Title: Detection of long-range coherence in driven hot atomic vapors by spin noise spectroscopy
Authors: Rupak Bag, Sayari Majumder, Saptarishi Chaudhuri, Dibyendu Roy
Abstract: We study intriguing dynamical features of hot Rubidium atoms driven by two light fields. The fields resonantly drive multiple Zeeman states within two hyperfine levels, yielding a cascaded-$\Lambda$ like structure in the frequency space. A non-Hermitian Floquet tight-binding lattice with imaginary hopping between the nearest states effectively describes the coherence dynamics between Zeeman states within the ground hyperfine manifold. By performing spin noise spectroscopy, we observe higher harmonic peaks in the noise spectrum that capture multi-photon transitions in the ground manifold. Moreover, the peak amplitudes reveal an exponential decay of long-range coherence with increasing separation between the ground states.

Title: Thermal field theory correlators in the large-$N$ limit and the spectral duality relation

Abstract: In Ref.~\cite{Grozdanov:2024wgo}, we derived a spectral duality relation applicable to the spectra of 3$d$ conformal field theories (CFTs) and their holographically dual 4$d$ black holes. In this work, we further elaborate on the properties of this duality relation and argue that the same relation can be applied to certain pairs of thermal correlator spectra in large-$N$ quantum field theories in any number of spacetime dimensions, provided the correlators are meromorphic functions with only simple poles and satisfy the thermal product formula. We discuss a rich set of properties that such retarded two-point functions must exhibit. We then show that the spectral duality relation and its implications apply to pairs of correlators in double-trace deformed CFTs and, more generally, to correlators in theories related by the Legendre transform. We illustrate, through several examples, how the spectrum of one correlator can be reconstructed from that of its dual correlation function. Notably, this includes cases relating the thermal spectra of scalar primary operators at ultraviolet and infrared fixed points, as well as current operators in a CFT$_3$ and its particle-vortex dual.

Title: Birth of a gap: Critical phenomena in 2D Coulomb gas
Authors: Matthias Allard, Sampad Lahiry
Abstract: We investigate a family of radially symmetric Coulomb gas systems at inverse temperature $\beta = 2$. The family is characterised by the property that the density of the equilibrium measure vanishes on a ring at radius $r_*$, which lies strictly inside the droplet. The large $n$ expansion of the logarithm of the partition function is obtained up to a novel $n^{1/4}$ term. We perform a double scaling limit of the correlation kernel at the $n^{1/4}$ scale and obtain a new limiting kernel in the bulk, which differs from the well-known Ginibre kernel.

Title: ChromRec: Self-Assembly of Nucleosomes Driven by Directional Recognition
Authors: Hesam Arabzadeh, Dmitri Kireev
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.
