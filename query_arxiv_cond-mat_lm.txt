Title: Topological Origin of Andreev Flatland in UTe$_2$: Implication for Josephson STM Measurements
Authors: Jushin Tei, Takeshi Mizushima, Satoshi Fujimoto
Abstract: We propose the surface of topological superconductors as a platform for realizing two-dimensional flat bands, where electron interactions play a crucial role. The surface flat bands originate from topological features supported by two key mechanisms: (1) a trivial Chern number prevents the zero-energy states from merging into the continuum of the bulk spectrum, thereby ensuring their confinement within the superconducting gap; and (2) weak spin conservation allows the gap function to exhibit phase winding. As a consequence, the surface exhibits a remarkably high density of states at nearly zero energy. Such surface states are likely to be realized in the candidate topological superconductor UTe$_2$. Our results provide important insights into the interpretation of recent Josephson STM experiments on UTe$_2$.

Title: Universal Kerr effect in A-type antiferromagnets
Authors: V. Sunko, S. Ahsanullah, V. Jain, S. Weber, S. Kumaran, J.-Q. Yan, J. Orenstein, D. Ovchinnikov
Abstract: Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful probe of broken time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$), typically used to study ferromagnets. While MOKE has been observed in some antiferromagnets (AFMs) with vanishing magnetization, it is often associated with structures whose symmetry is lower than basic collinear, bipartite order. In contrast, theory predicts a mechanism for MOKE intrinsic to all AFMs of A-type, i.e. layered AFMs in which ferromagnetic layers are antiferromagnetically aligned. Here we report the first experimental confirmation of this mechanism. We achieve this by measuring the imaginary component of MOKE as a function of photon energy in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, an A-type AFM where $\mathcal{T}$ is preserved in combination with a translation. By comparing the experimental results with model calculations, we demonstrate that observable MOKE should be expected in all collinear A-type AFMs with out-of-plane spin order, thus enabling optical detection of AFM domains and expanding the scope of MOKE to few-layer AFMs.

Title: Gapfull and gapless $1$D Topological Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit Coupled Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Daniel Skliannyi, Yuval Oreg, Ady Stern
Abstract: We propose a way to generate a one-dimensional topological superconductor from a monolayer of a transition metal dichalcogenide coupled to a Bernal-stacked bilayer of graphene under a displacement field. With proper gating, this structure may be tuned to form three parallel pads of superconductors creating two planar Josephson junctions in series, in which normal regions separate the superconductors. Two characteristics of the system which are essential for our discussion are spin orbit coupling induced by the transition metal dichalcogenides and the variation of the Fermi velocities along the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that these two characteristics lead to one-dimensional topological superconductivity occupying large parts in the parameter space defined by the two phase differences across the two junctions and the relative angle between the junctions and the lattice. An angle-shaped device in which this angle varies in space, combined with proper phase tuning, can lead to the formation of domain walls between topological and trivial phases, supporting a zero-energy Majorana mode, within the bulk of carefully designed devices. We derive the spectrum of the Andreev bound states and show that Ising spin-orbit coupling leaves the topological superconductor gapless, and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling opens a gap in its spectrum. Our analysis shows that the transition to a gapped topological state is a result of the band inversion of Andreev states.

Title: Universal giant spin Hall effect in moire metal
Authors: Ning Mao, Cheng Xu, Ting Bao, Nikolai Peshcherenko, Claudia Felser, Yang Zhang
Abstract: While moiré phenomena have been extensively studied in low-carrier-density systems such as graphene and semiconductors, their implications for metallic systems with large Fermi surfaces remain largely unexplored. Using GPU-accelerated large-scale ab-initio quantum transport simulations, we investigate spin transport in two distinct platforms: twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (semiconductor, from lightly to heavily doping) and NbX$_2$ ($X$ = S, Se; metals). In twisted MoTe$_2$, the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) evolves from $4\tfrac{e}{4\pi}$ at $5.09^\circ$ to $10\tfrac{e}{4\pi}$ at $1.89^\circ$, driven by the emergence of multiple isolated Chern bands. Remarkably, in heavily doped metallic regimes--without isolated Chern bands--we observe a universal amplification of the spin Hall effect from Fermi surface reconstruction under long-wavelength potential, with the peak SHC tripling from $6\tfrac{e}{4\pi}$ at $5.09^\circ$ to $17\tfrac{e}{4\pi}$ at $3.89^\circ$. For prototypical moiré metals like twisted NbX$_2$, we identify a record SHC of $-17\tfrac{e}{4\pi}$ (-5200 $(\hbar / e)S/cm$ in 3D units), surpassing all known bulk materials. These results establish moiré engineering as a powerful strategy for enhancing spin-dependent transport, and advancing ab-initio methodologies to bridge atomic-scale precision with device-scale predictions in transport simulations.

Title: DFT based insights into elastic, thermophysical, electronic and optical properties of topological insulators XTe5 (X = Zr, Hf)
Authors: Syed Shovon Mahbub Mahin, Suptajoy Barua, B. Rahman Rano, Ishtiaque M. Syed, S. H. Naqib
Abstract: Transition metal penta-tellurides, ZrTe5 and HfTe5 have been recently drawn a lot of attention due to their fascinating physical properties and for being prominent materials showing topological phase transitions. In this study, we investigated mechanical, thermophysical and optoelectronic properties of these materials which remained almost unexplored till now. We also studied electronic properties and compared those with previous studies. We used Density Functional Theory (DFT) based calculations to study all of these properties. This study suggests that the materials are mechanically stable, possess high mechanical and bonding anisotropy and are brittle in nature. Our study also suggests that the compounds are soft in nature and they contain a mixture of covalent and metallic bonding. Investigation of thermophysical properties, namely, Grüneisen parameter and Debye temperature indicates weak bonding strength in these compounds. Analysis of melting temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, heat capacity, radiation factor, acoustic impedance, and minimum thermal conductivity suggests their possible application in acoustic and thermoelectric devices. Examination of their optical characteristics reveals that they have a considerable reflectivity from the infrared to the ultraviolet region. The refractive indices of these materials are high at low energy so they are potential candidates for reflective coating of solar radiation. There have been debates over exact topological natures of these compounds, whether they are semi-metals or insulators. Our study of electronic band structure and density of states reveal that spin-orbit interaction is responsible for enhancing energy gaps and promoting insulating characteristics in these compounds.

Title: Synthetic Horizons and Thermalization in an Atomic Chain and its Relation to Quantum Hall Systems
Authors: Ali G. Moghaddam, Viktor Könye, Lotte Mertens, Jasper van Wezel, Jeroen van den Brink
Abstract: We investigate the sine model, a one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian featuring hoppings with a sinusoidal dependence on position, and demonstrate the formation of synthetic horizons where electronic wave packets exhibit exponential slowdown. Interestingly, employing the exact transformation between this model and the Harper equation, which describes the eigenstates of a square lattice tight-binding model subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field, we find that analogous semi-classical horizons can emerge in a quantum Hall setup at half-filling for specific values of the magnetic flux. Furthermore, by applying sudden quenches to the sine model's hopping profile, we observe the emergence of thermal states characterized by an Unruh temperature. Our numerical calculations of this temperature reveal a non-universal behavior, suggesting the involvement of physical mechanisms beyond a simple low-energy description.

Title: Nanosecond Ferroelectric Switching of Intralayer Excitons in Bilayer 3R-MoS2 through Coulomb Engineering
Authors: Jing Liang, Yuan Xie, Dongyang Yang, Shangyi Guo, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jerry I. Dadap, David Jones, Ziliang Ye
Abstract: High-speed, non-volatile tunability is critical for advancing reconfigurable photonic devices used in neuromorphic information processing, sensing, and communication. Despite significant progress in developing phase change and ferroelectric materials, achieving highly efficient, reversible, rapid switching of optical properties has remained a challenge. Recently, sliding ferroelectricity has been discovered in 2D semiconductors, which also host strong excitonic effects. Here, we demonstrate that these materials enable nanosecond ferroelectric switching in the complex refractive index, largely impacting their linear optical responses. The maximum index modulation reaches about 4, resulting in a relative reflectance change exceeding 85%. Both on and off switching occurs within 2.5 nanoseconds, with switching energy at femtojoule levels. The switching mechanism is driven by tuning the excitonic peak splitting of a rhombohedral molybdenum disulfide bilayer in an engineered Coulomb screening environment. This new switching mechanism establishes a new direction for developing high-speed, non-volatile optical memories and highly efficient, compact reconfigurable photonic devices. Additionally, the demonstrated imaging technique offers a rapid method to characterize domains and domain walls in 2D semiconductors with rhombohedral stacking.

Title: Topological properties of curved spacetime Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model
Authors: Priyanuj Rajbongshi, Ranjan Modak
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional topologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat space-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse the direction before reaching the horizon. A semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories also supports these results.

Title: High-throughput screening of 2D materials identifies p-type monolayer WS$_2$ as potential ultra-high mobility semiconductor
Authors: Viet-Anh Ha, Feliciano Giustino
Abstract: 2D semiconductors offer a promising pathway to replace silicon in next-generation electronics. Among their many advantages, 2D materials possess atomically-sharp surfaces and enable scaling the channel thickness down to the monolayer limit. However, these materials exhibit comparatively lower charge carrier mobility and higher contact resistance than 3D semiconductors, making it challenging to realize high-performance devices at scale. In this work, we search for high-mobility 2D materials by combining a high-throughput screening strategy with state-of-the-art calculations based on the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. Our analysis singles out a known transition metal dichalcogenide, monolayer WS$_2$, as the most promising 2D semiconductor, with the potential to reach ultra-high room-temperature hole mobilities in excess of 1300 cm$^2$/Vs should Ohmic contacts and low defect densities be achieved. Our work also highlights the importance of performing full-blown ab initio transport calculations to achieve predictive accuracy, including spin-orbital couplings, quasiparticle corrections, dipole and quadrupole long-range electron-phonon interactions, as well as scattering by point defects and extended defects.

Title: Normal state quantum geometry, non-locality and superconductivity
Authors: Florian Simon
Abstract: We investigate aspects of the relation between the quantum geometry of the normal state (NS) and the superconducting phase, through the lens of non-locality. By relating band theory to quantum estimation theory, we derive a direct momentum-dependent relation between quantum geometry and the quantum fluctuations of the position operator. We then investigate two effects of the NS quantum geometry on superconductivity. On the one hand, we present a physical interpretation of the conventional and geometric contributions to the superfluid weight in terms of two different movements of the normal state charge carriers forming the Cooper pairs. The first contribution stems from their center-of-mass motion while the second stems from their zero-point motion, thereby explaining its persistence in flat-band systems. On the other hand, we phenomenologically derive an emergent Darwin term driven by the NS quantum metric. We show its form in one and two-body problems, derive the effective pairing potential in $s$-wave superconductors, and explicit its form in the case of two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. We thus show that the NS quantum metric screens the pairing interaction and weakens superconductivity, which could be tested experimentally by doping a superconductor. Our work reveals the ambivalent relationship between non-interacting quantum geometry and superconductivity, and possibly in other correlated phases.

Title: Strain-Induced Enhancement of Spin Pumping in Pt/YIG Bilayers
Authors: Lara M. Solis, Santiago J. Carreira, Javier Gómez, Alejandro Butera, María Abellán, Carlos García, Fernando Bonetto, Paolo Vavassori, Javier Briático, Laura B. Steren, Myriam H. Aguirre
Abstract: Enhancing spin-to-charge (S$\rightarrow$C) conversion efficiency remains a key challenge in spintronic materials research. In this work we investigate the effect of substrate-induced strains onto the S$\rightarrow$C efficiency. On one hand, we analyze strains-induced magnetic anisotropies in yttrium iron garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG) by comparing the magnetic and structural properties of YIG films grown on Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (GGG) and (CaGd)$_3$(MgZrGa)$_5$O$_{12}$ (SGGG) substrates. Differences in lattice mismatch - YIG//GGG ($\eta = -0.06 \%$) and YIG//SGGG ($\eta = -0.83 \%$) - lead to out-of-plane tensile strains in the first case and unexpected compressive strain in the latter. On the other hand, we study the spin injection efficiency on Pt/YIG bilayers evaluated by the Inverse Spin Hall Effect (ISHE). We find that the resulting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in YIG//SGGG, while not dominant over shape anisotropy, correlates with enhanced ISHE signals as observed in Spin Pumping Ferromagnetic Resonance (SP-FMR) and Spin Seebeck effect (SSE) experiments. Strain engineering proves effective in enhancing spin-to-charge conversion, providing insight into the design of efficient spintronic devices.

Title: Hydrodynamic fields in fluctuating environment: the emergent phononic and tachyonic-like excitations
Authors: I. P. de Freitas, F. Sobrero, A. M. S. Macedo, N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: Using functional methods, we investigate in a low-temperature liquid, the sound quanta defined by the quantized hydrodynamic fields, under the effects of high-energy processes on the atomic/molecular scale. To obtain in the molecular level the excitation spectra of liquids, we assume that the quantum fields are coupled to an additive delta-correlated in space and time quantum noise field. The hydrodynamic fields are defined in a fluctuating environment. After defining the generating functional of connected correlation fuctions in the presence of the noise field, we perform a functional integral over all noise field configurations. This is done using a formal object inspired by the distributional zeta-function method, named configurational zeta-function. We obtain a new generating functional written in terms of an analytically tractable functional series. Each term of the series describes in the liquid the emergent non-interacting elementary excitations with the usual gapless phonon-like dispersion relation and additional excitations with dispersion relations with gaps in pseudo-momenta space, i.e., tachyonic-like excitations. Furthermore, the Fourier representation of the two-point correlation functions of the model with the contribution coming from all phononic and tachyonic-like fields is presented. Finally, our analysis reveals that the emergent tachyonic-like and phononic excitations yield a distinctive thermodynamic signature - a quadratic temperature dependence of specific heat ($C_V \propto T^2$) at low temperatures, providing a theoretical foundation for experiments in confined and supercooled liquids.

Title: Nonlinearity-induced corner states in a kagome lattice
Authors: K Prabith, Georgios Theocharis, Rajesh Chaunsali
Abstract: Nonlinearity provides a powerful mechanism for controlling energy localization in structured dynamical systems. In this study, we investigate the emergence of nonlinearity-induced energy localization at the corners of a kagome lattice model featuring onsite cubic nonlinearity. Employing quench dynamics simulations and nonlinear continuation methods, we analyze the temporal and spectral characteristics of localized states under strong nonlinearity. Our results demonstrate the formation of stable, localized corner states, strikingly, even within the parameter regime corresponding to the topologically trivial phase of the underlying linear system, which normally lacks such boundary modes. Furthermore, we identify distinct families of nonlinearity-induced corner states residing within the semi-infinite spectral gap above the bulk bands in both the trivial and nontrivial phases. Stability analysis and nonlinear continuation reveal they are intrinsic nonlinear solutions, fundamentally distinct from perturbations of linear topological or bulk states. These findings elucidate a robust mechanism for generating localized states via nonlinearity, independent of linear topological protection, and provide answers to fundamental questions about the nature of nonlinear topological phenomena. The ability to create tunable, localized states in various spectral regions offers potential applications in energy harvesting, wave manipulation, and advanced signal processing.

Title: Nontrivial entanglement passively mediated by a quenched magnetic impurity
Authors: Adelina A. Orlandini, Germán G. Blesio, Claudio J. Gazza, Luis O. Manuel
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of a Kondo system undergoing a transition to a state with a quenched magnetic impurity, using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. We focus on a two-channel spin-1 Kondo impurity with single-ion anisotropy, where a quantum phase transition occurs between two topologically distinct local Fermi liquids. In the fully screened Kondo phase, realized at lower anisotropies, the entangled region surrounding the magnetic impurity mimics the Kondo screening cloud, although its length does not follow the conventional behavior. In contrast, beyond the transition, the system enters a non-Landau Fermi liquid phase with a markedly different entanglement structure: as the impurity is quenched and disentangled from the rest of the system due to the breakdown of the Kondo effect, the two conduction channels coupled only through the impurity develop a significant degree of entanglement with one another. Our findings demonstrate that a quenched magnetic impurity can passively and efficiently mediate entanglement between spatially separated conduction bands.

Title: Accelerated discovery of cost-effective photoabsorber materials for near-infrared (λ=1600 nm) photodetector applications
Authors: Wayne Zhao (1, 2, 3), Ruo Xi Yang (2), Aaron D. Kaplan (2), Kristin A. Persson (1, 2, 3) ((1) University of California Berkeley, (2) Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (3) Liquid Sunlight Alliance)
Abstract: Current infrared sensing devices are based on costly materials with relatively few viable alternatives known. To identify promising candidate materials for infrared photodetection, we have developed a high-throughput screening methodology based on high-accuracy r$^2$SCAN and HSE calculations in density functional theory. Using this method, we identify ten already synthesized materials between the inverse perovskite family, barium silver pnictide family, the alkaline pnictide family, and ZnSnAs$_2$ as top candidates. Among these, ZnSnAs$_2$ emerges as the most promising candidate due to its experimentally verified band gap of 0.74 eV at 0 K, and its cost-effective synthesis through Bridgman growth. BaAgP also shows potential with an HSE-calculated band gap of 0.64 eV, although further experimental validation is required. Lastly, we discover an additional material, Ca$_3$BiP, which has not been previously synthesized, but exhibits a promising optical spectra and a band gap of 0.56 eV. The method applied in this work is sufficiently general to screen wider bandgap materials in high-throughput and now extended to narrow-band gap materials.

Title: PhaseT3M: 3D Imaging at 1.6 Å Resolution via Electron Cryo-Tomography with Nonlinear Phase Retrieval
Authors: Juhyeok Lee, Samuel W. Song, Min Gee Cho, Georgios Varnavides, Stephanie M. Ribet, Colin Ophus, Mary C. Scott, Michael L. Whittaker
Abstract: Electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) enables 3D imaging of complex, radiation-sensitive structures with molecular detail. However, image contrast from the interference of scattered electrons is nonlinear with atomic density and multiple scattering further complicates interpretation. These effects degrade resolution, particularly in conventional reconstruction algorithms, which assume linearity. Particle averaging can reduce such issues but is unsuitable for heterogeneous or dynamic samples ubiquitous in biology, chemistry, and materials sciences. Here, we develop a phase retrieval-based cryo-ET method, PhaseT3M. We experimentally demonstrate its application to a ~7 nm Co3O4 nanoparticle on ~30 nm carbon substrate, achieving a maximum resolution of 1.6 Å, surpassing conventional limits using standard cryo-TEM equipment. PhaseT3M uses a multislice model for multiple scattering and Bayesian optimization for alignment and computational aberration correction, with a positivity constraint to recover 'missing wedge' information. Applied directly to biological particles, it enhances resolution and reduces artifacts, establishing a new standard for routine 3D imaging of complex, radiation-sensitive materials.

Title: Terahertz field effect in a two-dimensional semiconductor MoS2
Authors: Tomoki Hiraoka, Sandra Nestler, Wentao Zhang, Simon Rossel, Hassan A. Hafez, Savio Fabretti, Heike Schloerb, Andy Thomas, Dmitry Turchinovich
Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their atomic-scale thickness and tunable electronic, optical, and mechanical properties, open many promising pathways to significantly advance modern electronics. The field effect caused by a strong electric field, typically of MV/cm level, applied perpendicular to the material layers, is a highly effective method for controlling these properties. Field effect allows the regulation of the electron flow in transistor channels, improves the photodetector efficiency and spectral range, and facilitates the exploration of novel exotic quantum phenomena in 2D materials. However, existing approaches to induce the field effect in 2D materials utilize circuit-based electrical gating methods fundamentally limited to microwave response rates. Device-compatible ultrafast, sub-picosecond control needed for modern technology and basic science applications still remains a challenge. In this study, we demonstrate such an ultrafast field effect in atomically thin MoS2, an archetypal 2D semiconductor, embedded in a hybrid 3D-2D terahertz nanoantenna structure. This nanoantenna efficiently converts an incident terahertz electric field into the vertical ultrafast gating field in MoS2 while simultaneously enhancing it to the required MV/cm level. We observe the terahertz field effect optically as coherent terahertz-induced Stark shift of characteristic exciton resonances in MoS2. Our results enable novel developments in technology and the fundamental science of 2D materials, where the terahertz field effect is crucial.

Title: Potentiometric detection of spin polarization expected at the surface of FeTe0.6Se0.4 in the effective p-wave superconducting state
Authors: K. Ohnishi (1), R. Ohshima (1), T. Nishijima (1), S. Kawabata (1), S. Kasahara (2,3), Y. Kasahara (3), Y. Ando (1,4), Y. Yanase (3), Y. Matsuda (3), M. Shiraishi (1) ((1) Dep. Electronic Science and Engineering, Kyoto Univ., (2) Okayama Univ., (3) Dep. Physics, Kyoto Univ., (4) PRESTO-JST)
Abstract: Nowadays, the quest for non-Abelian anyons is attracting tremendous attention. In particular, a Majorana quasiparticle has attracted great interest since the non-Abelian anyon is a key particle for topological quantum computation. Much effort has been paid for the quest of the Majorana state in solids, and some candidate material platforms are reported. Among various materials that can host the Majorana state, chiral p-wave superconductor is one of the suitable materials and the iron-based layered superconductor FeTeSe is one of the promising material platforms because its surface can host effective p-wave superconducting state that is analogous to chiral p-wave superconducting state thanks to its topological surface state. Given that a chiral p-wave superconductor possesses spin polarization, detecting the spin polarization can be evidence for the chiral p-wave trait, which results in the existence of Majorana excitation. Here, we show successful detection of the spin polarization at the surface of FeTe0.6Se0.4 in its superconducting state, where the spin polarization is detected via a potentiometric method. Amplitudes of the spin signal exhibit characteristic dependence for temperature and bias current, suggesting detection of spin polarization of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Our achievement opens a new avenue to explore topological superconductivity for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Title: Exact steady states and fragmentation-induced relaxation in the no-passing asymmetric simple exclusion process
Authors: Urei Miura
Abstract: We introduce a multi-species generalization of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with a ``no-passing" constraint, forbidding overtaking, on a one-dimensional open chain. This no-passing rule fragments the Hilbert space into an exponential number of disjoint sectors labeled by the particle sequence, leading to relaxation dynamics that depend sensitively on the initial ordering. We construct exact matrix-product steady states in every particle sequence sector and derive closed-form expressions for the particle-number distribution and two-point particle correlation functions. In the two-species case, we identify a parameter regime where some sectors relax in finite time while others exhibit metastable relaxation dynamics, revealing the coexistence of fast and slow dynamics and strong particle sequence sector dependence. Our results uncover a novel mechanism for non-equilibrium metastability arising from Hilbert space fragmentation in exclusion processes.

Title: Electronic structure of compressively strained thin film La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in the bulk nickelates under high pressure is a major advance in physics. The recent observation of superconductivity at ambient pressure in compressively strained bilayer nickelate thin films has now enabled direct characterization of the superconducting phase through angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Here we present an in-situ ARPES study of compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ films grown by oxide molecular beam epitaxy, and the ozone treated counterparts with an onset T$_c$ of 40 K, supplemented with results from pulsed laser deposition films with similar T$_c$. We resolve a systematic strain-driven electronic band shift with respect to that of bulk crystals, in qualitative agreement with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, the strongly renormalized flat 3$d_{z2}$ band shifts a factor of 5-10 smaller than anticipated by DFT. Furthermore, it stays ~70 meV below the Fermi level, contradicting the expectation that superconductivity results from the high density of states of this band at the Fermi level. We also observed a non-trivial k$_z$ dispersion of the cuprate-like 3$d_{x2-y2}$ band. Combined with results from both X-ray diffraction and DFT, we suggest that the strained films are under ~5 GPa effective pressure, considerably larger than the naïve expectation from the DFT relaxed structure. Finally, the ~70 meV energy position is intriguingly close to the collective mode coupling more prominently seen in thin films, in the energy range of both oxygen related phonons and the maximum of the spin excitation spectrum.

Title: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Size Effects for Critical Resolved Shear Stress in Nickel Superalloys
Authors: Divyeskumar A. Mistry, Amuthan A. Ramabathiran
Abstract: We present in this work a molecular dynamics study of a size effect relating to the volume fraction of gamma-prime precipitate of edge dislocation motion in a simple model of Nickel superalloys. We model the superalloy as periodically spaced cubic gamma-prime precipitates inside a uniform gamma matrix. We then analyze the motion of paired edge dislocations in the gamma phase when subject to an external shear stress for various volume fractions of the gamma-prime precipitate for a wide range of temperatures, from 300 K to 700 K. While the variation of dislocation velocity is not significant, the critical resolved shear stress is found to exhibit a power law dependence on the volume fraction of the gamma-prime precipitate with two distinct regimes which have similar exponent but markedly different prefactors; we also observe that this two-regime behavior remains true across a wide range of temperatures. We present a detailed analysis of this behavior and reduce it to a linear dependence of the critical resolved shear stress on the length of the gamma-prime precipitate along the direction of dislocation motion. We further identify the critical length scale underlying the transition between the two observed regimes as the total core width of the paired dislocations in a pure gamma-prime system, which includes in addition to the complex stacking fault separating the partials of the paired dislocations the width of the anti-phase boundary that is formed between the super-dislocations. The results presented in this work provides new details on the strengthening effect of gamma-prime precipitates in nickel superalloys and also has important implications for larger scale dislocation dynamics studies for nickel superalloys.

Title: Superconductivity and Electron Correlations in Kagome Metal LuOs3B2
Authors: Yusen Xiao, Qingchen Duan, Tao Jia, Yajing Cui, Shaohua Liu, Zhiwei Wen, Liangwen Ji, Ruidan Zhong, Yongliang Chen, Yong Zhao
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of the physical properties of LuOs3B2, characterized by an ideal Os-based kagome lattice. Resistivity and magnetization measurements confirm the emergence of type-II bulk superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc=4.63 K. The specific heat jump and the calculated electron-phonon coupling parameter support a moderately coupled superconducting state. Electron correlation effects are supported by the enhanced Wilson ratios. First-principles calculations reveal hallmark features of kagome band structure, including Dirac points, van Hove singularities, and quasi-flat bands, primarily derived from the Os d orbitals. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling opens a gap at the Dirac points, significantly altering the electronic properties. Furthermore, the superconductivity and electronic properties of isomorphic compounds are discussed. This work provides a thorough exploration of the superconducting and normal states of LuOs3B2, deepening the understanding of kagome superconductors.

Title: Spin-dependent Transport Studies of Fe/MoxCr1-xS2/Fe Magnetic Tunnel Junction
Authors: Aloka Ranjan Sahoo, Sharat Chandra
Abstract: Using Density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, spin-dependent electron transport in Fe/MoxCr1-xS2/Fe magnetic tunnel junction is studied. Spin-transport for different thicknesses (1, 3, 5, and 7 layers) of the spacer MoS2 and for two different surface orientations of the Fe electrode, the Fe(001) and Fe(111) surface and the effect of substitutional doping of magnetic impurity Cr on the spin-transport of the junctions is investigated. The electronic structure of the heterostructure shows presence of metal induced states in the semiconducting MoS2 at the Fe/MoS2 interface and the effect of the interface is limited to the first two layers of MoS2 from the interface. The I-V characteristics of the junctions for the monolayer and three-layer MoS2 spacer show linear behaviour due to the metallic nature of the junction. The tunneling nature of the junction is observed for the thicker junctions with five-layer and seven-layer spacers. With the introduction of magnetic impurity, we have shown that spin-polarisation in the spacer is improved, thus increasing the spin-polarised current. The Cr-defect states are observed below the conduction band and the Cr-doped devices are stable up to a bias of 0.5V. The close packed Fe(111) surface is better electrode material for tunneling of electrons through the junction compared to the Fe(001) surface due to lower surface energy and reduced transmission.

Title: Mumott -- a Python package for the analysis of multi-modal tensor tomography data
Authors: Leonard C. Nielsen, Mads Carlsen, Sici Wang, Arthur Baroni, Torne Tänzer, Marianne Liebi, Paul Erhart
Abstract: Small and wide angle x-ray scattering tensor tomography are powerful methods for studying anisotropic nanostructures in a volume-resolved manner, and are becoming increasingly available to users of synchrotron facilities. The analysis of such experiments requires, however, advanced procedures and algorithms, which creates a barrier for the wider adoption of these techniques. Here, in response to this challenge, we introduce the mumott package. It is written in Python with computationally demanding tasks handled via just-in-time compilation using both CPU and GPU resources. The package is being developed with a focus on usability and extensibility, while achieving a high computational efficiency. Following a short introduction to the common workflow, we review key features, outline the underlying object-oriented framework, and demonstrate the computational performance. By developing the mumott package and making it generally available, we hope to lower the threshold for the adoption of tensor tomography and to make these techniques accessible to a larger research community.

Title: Sum rules for x-ray circular and linear dichroism based on complete magnetic multipole basis
Authors: Y. Yamasaki, Y. Ishii, N. Sasabe
Abstract: X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) are powerful spectroscopic techniques for probing magnetic properties in solids. In this study, we revisit the XMCD and XMLD sum rules within a complete magnetic multipole basis that incorporates both spinless and spinful multipoles. We demonstrate that these multipoles can be clearly distinguished and individually detected through the sum-rule formalism. Within this framework, the anisotropic magnetic dipole term is naturally derived in XMCD, offering a microscopic origin for ferromagnetic-like behavior in antiferromagnets. Furthermore, we derive the sum rules for out-of-plane and in-plane XMLD regarding electric quadrupole contributions defined based on the complete multipole basis. Our theoretical approach provides a unified, symmetry-consistent framework for analyzing dichroic signals in various magnetic materials. These findings deepen the understanding of XMCD and XMLD and open pathways to exploring complex magnetic structures and spin-orbit coupling effects in emergent magnetic materials.

Title: A strategy for the enhancement of barocaloric performance in plastic crystal solid solutions
Authors: Frederic Rendell-Bhatti, Melony Dilshad, Celine Beck, Markus Appel, Alba Prats, Eamonn T. Connolly, Claire Wilson, Lewis Giannelli, Pol Lloveras, Xavier Moya, David Boldrin, Donald A. MacLaren
Abstract: The drive for solid-state heating and cooling technologies is fuelled by their potential for enhanced sustainability and environmental impact compared to traditional vapour compression devices. The recent discovery of colossal barocaloric (BC) effects in the plastic crystal (PC) neopentyl glycol (NPG) has highlighted PCs as promising candidates for future solid-state thermal management. However, achieving optimal operational temperatures, low-pressure requirements, and substantial entropy changes in a single material remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to address these constraints by forming a ternary solid solution of neopentyl PCs: NPG, pentaglycerine (PG) and pentaerythritol (PE). Notably, by including only a small quantity (2%) of the third component, we observe a seven-fold increase in reversible isothermal entropy change (|{\Delta}Sit,rev| = 13.4 J kg-1 K-1) and twenty-fold increase in operational temperature span ({\Delta}Tspan = 18 K) at pressures of 1 kbar, compared to pure NPG. The origin of these enhancements is revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering and synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction. We find a reduction in the activation energies of the rotational modes associated with the main entropic component of the BC effect, linked to a weakening of the intermolecular hydrogen bond network. This is proposed to improve the phase transition reversibility and operational temperature span by facilitating a broadened first-order phase transition, characterised by a significant phase co-existence region. These findings suggest an effective strategy for practicable molecular BCs, which is to design solid solutions that exploit the large compositional phase space of multi-component molecular systems.

Title: Microscopic theory of the inverse Faraday effect in a multiorbital model: Role of orbital magnetic moment and electric dipole
Authors: Kosuke Tazuke, Takahiro Morimoto, Sota Kitamura
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), a phenomenon where circularly-polarized light induces a magnetic moment, in a multiorbital metallic system. We demonstrate that the total magnetic moment can be decomposed into several contributions in multiorbital tight-binding models. In particular, we reveal that the electric dipole moment of Wannier orbitals also contributes to the orbital magnetic moment, which is not included in the conventional expression for the orbital magnetic moment in lattice systems. To account for all possible contributions, we adopt an $s$-$p$ tight-binding system as a minimal model for the IFE. Using an analytical approach based on the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we clarify the physical origins of these contributions. Additionally, we quantitatively evaluate each contribution on an equal footing through a numerical approach based on the Floquet formalism. Our results reveal that the orbital magnetic moment exhibits a significantly larger response compared to the spin magnetic moment, with all contributions to the orbital magnetic moment being comparable in magnitude. These findings highlight the essential role of orbital degrees of freedom in the IFE.

Title: Breaking scaling relations with inverse catalysts: a machine learning exploration of trends in $\mathrm{CO_2}$ hydrogenation energy barriers
Authors: Luuk H. E. Kempen, Marius Juul Nielsen, Mie Andersen
Abstract: The conversion of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ into useful products such as methanol is a key strategy for abating climate change and our dependence on fossil fuels. Developing new catalysts for this process is costly and time-consuming and can thus benefit from computational exploration of possible active sites. However, this is complicated by the complexity of the materials and reaction networks. Here, we present a workflow for exploring transition states of elementary reaction steps at inverse catalysts, which is based on the training of a neural network-based machine learning interatomic potential. We focus on the crucial formate intermediate and its formation over nanoclusters of indium oxide supported on Cu(111). The speedup compared to an approach purely based on density functional theory allows us to probe a wide variety of active sites found at nanoclusters of different sizes and stoichiometries. Analysis of the obtained set of transition state geometries reveals different structure--activity trends at the edge or interior of the nanoclusters. Furthermore, the identified geometries allow for the breaking of linear scaling relations, which could be a key underlying reason for the excellent catalytic performance of inverse catalysts observed in experiments.

Title: Non-equilibrium dynamics of disordered fractal spring network with active forces
Authors: Debjyoti Majumdar, Sadhana Singh, Rony Granek
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of active bead-spring critical percolation clusters under the action of monopolar and dipolar forces. Previously, Langevin dynamics simulations of Rouse-type dynamics were performed on a deterministic fractal -- the Sierpinski gasket -- and combined with analytical theory [Chaos {\bf 34}, 113107 (2024)]. To study disordered fractals, we use here the critical (bond) percolation infinite cluster of square and triangular lattices, where beads (occupying nodes) are connected by harmonic springs. Two types of active stochastic forces, modeled as random telegraph processes, are considered: force monopoles, acting on individual nodes in random directions, and force dipoles, where extensile or contractile forces act between pairs of nodes, forming dipole links. A dynamical steady state is reached where the network is dynamically swelled for force monopoles. The time-averaged mean square displacement (MSD) shows sub-diffusive behavior at intermediate times longer than the force correlation time, whose anomalous exponent is solely controlled by the spectral dimension $(d_s)$ of the fractal network yielding MSD $\sim t^{\nu}$, with $\nu=1-\frac{d_s}{2}$, similar to the thermal system and in accord with the general analytic theory. In contrast, dipolar forces require a diverging time to reach a steady state, depending on the fraction of dipoles, and lead to network shrinkage. Within a quasi-steady-state assumption, we find a saturation behavior at the same temporal regime. Thereafter, a second ballistic-like rise is observed for networks with a low fraction of dipole forces, followed by a linear, diffusive increase. The second ballistic rise is, however, absent in networks fully occupied with force dipoles. These two behaviors are argued to result from local rotations of nodes, which are either persistent or fluctuating.

Title: Exciton Basis Description of Ultrafast Triplet Separation in Pentacene-(Tetracene)2-Pentacene Intramolecular Singlet Fission Chromophore
Authors: Arifa Nazir, Alok Shukla, Sumit Mazumdar
Abstract: Precise understanding of the electronic structures of optically dark triplet-triplet multiexcitons that are the intermediate states in singlet fission (SF) continues to be a challenge. This is particularly true for intramolecular singlet fission (iSF) chromophores, that are oligomers of large monomer molecules. We have performed quantum many-body calculations of the complete set of excited states relevant to iSF in Pentacene-(Tetracene)2-Pentacene oligomers, consisting of two terminal pentacene monomers linked by two tetracene monomers. Our computations use an exciton basis that gives physical pictorial descriptions of all eigenstates, and are performed over an active space of twenty-eight monomer molecular orbitals, including configuration interaction with all relevant quadruple excitations within the active space, thereby ensuring very high precision. We discuss the many-electron structures of the optical predominantly intramonomer spin-singlets, intermonomer charge-transfer excitations, and most importantly, the complete set of low energy covalent triplet-triplet multiexcitons. We are able to explain the weak binding energy of the pentacene-tetracene triplet-triplet eigenstate that is generated following photoexcitation. We explain the increase in lifetime with increasing numbers of tetracene monomers of the transient absorption associated with contiguous pentacene-tetracene triplet-triplet in this family of oligomers. We are consequently able to give a pictorial description of the triplet separation following generation of the initial triplet-triplet, leading to a state with individual triplets occupying only the two pentacene monomers. We expect many applications of our theoretical approach to triplet separation.

Title: Brownian motion and generalized Lifson-Jackson formula in quasi-periodic systems
Authors: Sang Yang, Juyuan Sun, Guangcan Guo, Ming Gong
Abstract: Brownian motion in periodic potentials has been widely investigated in statistical physics and related interdisciplinary fields. In the overdamped regime, it has been well-known that the diffusion constant $D^*$ is given by the Lifson-Jackson (LJ) formula. With a tilted potential, this model can exhibit giant diffusion. In this work, we start from the basic argument that since any quasi-periodic potential can be approximated accurately using a periodic potential, this formula and the associated physics should also apply to the quasi-periodic potential after some proper redefinition. We derive $D^*$ from the Smoluchowski equation using the fact that its asymptotic solution is a product of a Boltzmann weight and a Gaussian envelope function. Then we analytically calculate $D^*$ in terms of Bessel functions. Finally, we study the giant diffusion with quasi-periodic potentials, generalize the corresponding formula to the condition with tilted potential under the same argument, and calculate $D^*$ analytically. This work generalizes the Brownian motion from periodic potentials to the much broader quasi-periodic potentials, which should have applications in interdisciplinary fields in physics, chemistry, engineering, and life sciences.

Title: Generation of Phonons with Angular Momentum During Ultrafast Demagnetization
Authors: M. S. Mrudul, Markus Weißenhofer, Peter M. Oppeneer
Abstract: A major question in the field of femtosecond laser-induced demagnetization is whereto the angular momentum lost by the electrons is transferred. Recent ultrafast electron diffraction measurements [Tauchert \textit{et al.}, Nature {\bf 602}, 73 (2022)] suggest that this angular momentum is transferred to the rotational motion of atoms on a sub-picosecond timescale, but a theory confirmation of this proposition has yet to be given. Here we investigate the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics during ultrafast demagnetization of L1$_0$ FePt, using Ehrenfest nuclear dynamics simulations combined with the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) framework. We demonstrate that atomic rotations appear, i.e., the generation of phonons carrying finite angular momentum following ultrafast demagnetization. We further show that both ultrafast demagnetization and the generation of phonons with angular momentum arise from symmetry constraints imposed by the spin-orbit coupling, thus providing insight in spin-phonon interaction at ultrafast timescales.

Title: Temperature switchable self-propulsion activity of liquid crystalline microdroplets
Authors: Manoj Kumar, Siddharth Sane, Aniruddh Murali, Shashi Thutupalli
Abstract: We report on a switchable emulsion droplet microswimmer by utilizing a temperature-dependent transition of the droplet phase. The droplets, made from a liquid crystalline (LC) smectic phase material ($T =$ 25 $^{\circ}$C), self-propel only in their nematic and isotropic phases at elevated temperatures ($T\ge$ 33.5 $^{\circ}$C). This transition between motile and non-motile states is fully reversible - in the motile state, the droplets exhibit persistent motion and directional memory over multiple heating-cooling cycles. Further, we distinguish the state of rest from the state of motion by characterizing the chemical and hydrodynamic fields of the droplets. Next, we map the motility behaviour of the droplets across varying surfactant concentrations and temperatures, observing that swimming occurs only at sufficiently high surfactant concentrations above and temperatures above the smectic-nematic phase transition temperature $\textit{i.e.}$ $T\ge$ 33.5 $^{\circ}$C. Our work envisions the potential of LC emulsion droplets as switchable microswimmers.

Title: Nanomechanics and Pore Structure of Sodium and Potassium Geopolymer Gels: Experiments, Molecular Dynamics and Coarse-Grained Simulations
Authors: Enrico Masoero, Eduardo Duque-Redondo, Haklae Lee, Yunzhi Xu, Francesca Lolli, Elie Kamseu, Ange-Therese Akono
Abstract: The link between composition, microstructure and mechanics of NASH and KASH gels is elusive, even in pure metakaolin-based geopolymes. This article exploits molecular mechanics, coarse-grained nanomechanics and micromechanics, to interpret new experimental results from microscopy, porosimetry and nanoindentation. KASH displays a finer nanogranular structure than NASH (3 vs 30 nm particle diameters, 5 vs 50 nm average pore diameters), higher skeletal density (2.3 vs 2.02 g/cm$^3$), nanoindentation moduli (9.21 vs 7.5 GPa) and hardness (0.56 vs 0.37 GPa) despite a higher total porosity (0.48-0.53 vs 0.38). This suggests a stiffer and stronger solid skeleton for KASH, confirmed through predictive molecular dynamics simulations on recent and new models of NASH and KASH. The atomistic simulations inform mechanical interactions for new, coarse-grained, particle-based models of NASH and KASH. The resulting simulations predict the nanoindentation result that KASH is stiffer than equally porous NASH and the impact of formation eigenstresses on elastic moduli.

Title: Modulated honeycomb lattices and their magnetic properties
Authors: Akihisa Koga, Toranosuke Matsubara
Abstract: We propose a family of modulated honeycomb lattices, a class of quasiperiodic tilings characterized by the metallic mean. These lattices consist of six distinct hexagonal prototiles with two edge lengths, $\ell$ and $s$, and can be regarded as a continuous deformation of the honeycomb lattice. The structural properties are examined through their substitution rules. To study the electronic properties, we construct a tight-binding model on the tilings, introducing two types of hopping integrals, $t_L$ and $t_S$, corresponding to the two edge lengths, $\ell$ and $s$, respectively. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian on these quasiperiodic tilings, we compute the corresponding density of states (DOS). Our analysis reveals that the introduction of quasiperiodicity in the distribution of hopping integrals induces a spiky structure in the DOS at higher energies, while the linear DOS at low energies ($E\sim 0$) remains robust. This contrasts with the smooth DOS in the disordered tight-binding model, where two types of hopping integrals are randomly distributed according to a given ratio. Furthermore, we study the magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on modulated honeycomb lattices by means of real-space Hartree approximations. A magnetic phase transition occurs at a finite interaction strength due to the absence of the noninteracting DOS at the Fermi level. When $t_L\sim t_S$, the phase transition point is primarily governed by the linear DOS. However, far from the condition $t_L=t_S$, the quasiperiodic structure plays a significant role in reducing the critical interaction strength, which is in contrast to the disordered system. Using perpendicular space analysis, we demonstrate that sublattice asymmetry inherent in the quasiperiodic tilings emerges in the magnetic profile, providing insights into the interplay between quasiperiodicity and electronic correlations.

Title: Phase stabilization of In2Se3 by disordered Ni intercalation and its enhanced thermoelectrical performance
Authors: Zengguang Shi, Yukun Xiao, Mian Li, Jianfeng Cai, Yanmei Chen, Jun Jiang, Xiaoping Ouyang, Zhifang Chai, Qing Huang
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials have gained significant attention owing to their distinctive structure and unique properties. The weak interlayer bonding in vdW layered materials enables guest atom intercalation, allowing precise tuning of their physical and chemical properties. In this work, a ternary compound, NixIn2Se3 (x = 0-0.3), with Ni randomly occupying the interlayers of In2Se3, was synthesized via an intercalation route driven by electron injection. The intercalated Ni atoms act as anchor points within the interlayer of In2Se3, which effectively suppresses the phase transition of In2Se3 at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the disordered Ni intercalation significantly enhanced the electrical conductivity of In2Se3 through electron injection, while reducing the thermal conductivity due to the interlayer phonon scattering, leading to an improved thermoelectric performance. For instance, the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of Ni0.3In2Se3 increased by 86% (in-plane) and 222% (out-of-plane) compared to In2Se3 at 500 oC. These findings not only provide an effective strategy to enhance the performance of layered thermoelectric materials, but also demonstrate the potential of intercalation chemistry for expanding the application scope of van der Waals (vdW) layered materials.

Title: Fluctuated lattice-driven charge density wave far above the condensation temperature in kagome superconductor KV3Sb5
Authors: Haoran Liu, Shaofeng Duan, Xiangqi Liu, Zhihua Liu, Shichong Wang, Lingxiao Gu, Jiongyu Huang, Wenxuan Yang, Jianzhe Liu, Dong Qian, Yanfeng Guo, Wentao Zhang
Abstract: The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, Fc, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of Tc = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at Fc were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at Tc. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near Tc, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.

Title: Finite-strain constitutive model for shape memory alloys formulated in the logarithmic strain space

Abstract: This work presents a finite-strain version of an established three-dimensional constitutive model for polycrystalline shape memory alloys (SMA) that is able to account for the large deformations and rotations that SMA components may undergo. The model is constructed by applying the logarithmic strain space approach to the original small-strain model, which was formulated within the Generalized Standard Materials framework and features a refined dissipation (rate) function. Additionally, the free energy function is augmented to be more versatile in capturing the transformation kinetics. The model is implemented into finite element software. To demonstrate the model performance and validate the implementation, material parameters are fitted to the experimental data of two SMA, and two computational simulations of SMA components are conducted. The applied approach is highly flexible from the perspective of the future incorporation of other phenomena, e.g., irreversibility associated with plasticity, into the model.

Title: Density of states and non-smooth Lyapunov exponent in the localized phase
Authors: Hai-Tao Hu, Ming Gong, Guangcan Guo, Zijing Lin
Abstract: Localization of wave functions in the disordered models can be characterized by the Lyapunov exponent, which is zero in the extended phase and nonzero in the localized phase. Previous studies have shown that this exponent is a smooth function of eigenenergy in the same phase, thus its non-smoothness can serve as strong evidence to determine the phase transition from the extended phase to the localized phase. However, logically, there is no fundamental reason that prohibits this Lyapunov exponent from being non-smooth in the localized phase. In this work, we show that if the localization centers are inhomogeneous in the whole chain and if the system possesses (at least) two different localization modes, the Lyapunov exponent can become non-smooth in the localized phase at the boundaries between the different localization modes. We demonstrate these results using several slowly varying models and show that the singularities of density of states are essential to these non-smoothness, according to the Thouless formula. These results can be generalized to higher-dimensional models, suggesting the possible delicate structures in the localized phase, which can revise our understanding of localization hence greatly advance our comprehension of Anderson localization.

Abstract: Strong electronic correlation can lead to insulating behavior and to the opening of large optical gaps, even in materials with partly filled valence shells. Although the non-equilibrium optical response encodes both local (quasi atomic) and collective (long range) responses, optical spectroscopy is usually more sensitive to the latter. Resonant x-ray techniques are better suited to investigate the quasi-atomic properties of correlated solids. Using time-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), here we study the ultrafast non-equilibrium processes in NiO following photo-excitation by ultraviolet photons with energy exceeding the optical gap. We observe the creation of charge-transfer excitons that decay with a time constant of about 2\,ps, while itinerant photo-doping persists for tens of picoseconds. Following our discovery, which establishes time-resolved high-resolution RIXS as a powerful tool for the study of transient phenomena in condensed matter, the possible presence of charge-transfer excitons will need to be considered when interpreting optical pump-probe experiments on correlated quantum materials.

Title: Impact of unidirectional magnetoresistance on spin-orbit torque analysis
Authors: Tamás Prok, Jan Hidding, Szabolcs Csonka, Péter Makk, Marcos H. D. Guimarães, Endre Tóvári
Abstract: The second-harmonic Hall technique is a widely used, sensitive method for studying the spin-orbit torques generated by charge current. It exploits the dependence of the Hall resistance on the magnetization direction, although thermal phenomena also contribute. Historically, deviations from the expected magnetic field dependence have usually been neglected. Based on our studies on permalloy/platinum bilayers, we show that a unidirectional magnetoresistance - known to appear in the second-harmonic longitudinal resistance - also appears in the Hall data, and that describing the results in a wide field range with these contributions is essential to accurately estimate the torques.

Title: Emergent topological phases and coexistence of gapless and spectral-localized Floquet quantum spin Hall states via electron-phonon interaction
Authors: Srijata Lahiri, Kuntal Bhattacharyya, Saurabh Basu
Abstract: In this work, a thorough exploration has been carried out to unravel the role of electron-phonon interaction (EPI) in a Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator subjected to a time-periodic step drive. It is observed that upon inclusion of the EPI, the system demonstrates emergent Floquet QSH (FQSH) phases and several topological phase transitions therein, mediated solely by the interaction strength. Quite intriguingly, the emergence of topological zero ($\pi$) modes in the bulk that remains otherwise gapless in the vicinity of the $\pi$ (zero) energy sector is observed, thus serving as a prime candidate of robust topology in gapless systems. With other invariants being found to be deficient in characterizing such coexistent phases, a spectral localizer (SL) is employed, which distinctly ascertains the nature of the (zero or $\pi$) edge modes. Following the SL prescription, a real-space Chern marker computed by us further provides support to such \textit{gapless} Floquet topological scenario. Our results can be realized in advanced optical setups that may underscore the importance of EPI-induced Floquet features.

Title: Emergent Kagome lattice and non-Abelian lattice gauge field of biexcitons in t-MoTe$_2$
Authors: Haochen Wang, Wang Yao
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge fields, characterized by their non-commutative symmetry groups, shape physical laws from the Standard Model to emergent topological matter for quantum computation. Here we find that moiré exciton dimers (biexcitons) in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ are governed by a genuine non-Abelian lattice gauge field. These dipolar-bound exciton dimers, formed on bonds of the honeycomb moiré superlattice, exhibit three quadrupole configurations organized into a Kagome lattice geometry, on which the valley-flip biexciton hoppings through electron-hole Coulomb exchange act as link variables of the non-Abelian lattice gauge theory. The emergence of gauge structure here is a new possibility for composite particles, where the moiré electronic structure and interactions between the electron and hole constituents jointly enforce the underlying geometric constraint. The quadrupole nature of biexciton further makes possible local gate controls to isolate designated pathways from the extended lattice for exploiting consequences of non-commutative gauge structure including the genuine non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect. This also provides a new approach for quantum manipulation of excitonic valley qubit. We show path interference on a simplest loop can deterministically transform the computational basis states into Bell states.

Title: Effect of pressure on the transport properties and thermoelectric performance of Dirac semimetal ZrTe5

Abstract: In this study, we have investigated and compared the effect of hydrostatic pressure up to ~20 kbar on the transport properties of ZrTe5 single crystals grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT) and flux methods. With the application of pressure, the electrical resistivity Rho(T) and thermopower S(T) of both crystals were found to increase in the whole temperature range unlike the other known thermoelectric materials, such as Bi2Te3, SnSe etc. This observation is supported by the complementary first-principles band structure calculation as the application of pressure widens the direct bandgap at {\Gamma} point. Moreover, the analysis of the pressure dependent magneto-transport and Shubnikov de-Hass oscillation results revealed an increase in carrier concentration and effective mass along with the reduction of mobility as pressure rises. Furthermore, with the application of pressure, the flux-grown ZrTe5 crystals display a transition from unipolar to bipolar charge transport as evidenced by the emergence of resistivity peak at T* under high pressure, unlike the CVT-grown ZrTe5 crystals where the bipolar charge transport near its characteristic resistivity peak (Tp) remains unaffected.

Title: Electronic Paddlewheels Impact the Dynamics of Superionic Conduction in AgI
Authors: Harender S. Dhattarwal, Richard C. Remsing
Abstract: Solid-state ion conductors hold promise as next generation battery materials. To realize their full potential, an understanding of atomic-scale ion conduction mechanisms is needed, including ionic and electronic degrees of freedom. Molecular simulations can create such an understanding, however, including a description of electronic structure necessitates computationally expensive methods that limit their application to small scales. We examine an alternative approach, in which neural network models are used to efficiently sample ionic configurations and dynamics at ab initio accuracy. Then, these configurations are used to determine electronic properties in a post-processing step. We demonstrate this approach by modeling the superionic phase of AgI, in which cation diffusion is coupled to rotational motion of local electron density on the surrounding iodide ions, termed electronic paddlewheels. The neural network potential can capture the many-body effects of electronic paddlewheels on ionic dynamics, but classical force field models cannot. Through an analysis rooted the generalized Langevin equation framework, we find that electronic paddlewheels have a significant impact on the time-dependent friction experienced by a mobile cation. Our approach will enable investigations of electronic fluctuations in materials on large length and time scales, and ultimately the control of ion dynamics through electronic paddlewheels.

Title: Room-temperature magnetoelectric coupling in strontium titanate
Authors: Zhen Yang, Cheng Ma, Mengqin Wang, Yuzhou He, Yuansha Chen, Fengxia Hu, Ye Yuan, Shuai Xu, Chen Ge, Er-jia Guo, Can Wang, Xiulai Xu, Guozhen Yang, Qinghua Zhang, Kui-juan Jin
Abstract: Magnetoelectric (ME) multiferroics enable efficient interconversion of electrical and magnetic signals, offering pathways toward substantial reduction of power consumption in next-generation computing and information technologies. However, despite decades of research, the persistence of ME coupling at room-temperature, an indispensable feature for practical applications, remains exceedingly rare in single-phase materials, due to symmetry constraints imposed by magnetic point groups and competing electronic requirements for ferroelectricity and magnetism. Here we report the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism at 780 K and a strong ME coupling with a converse ME coupling coefficient up to 498 ps/m at room-temperature in strontium titanate by dedicated vacancy engineering. The asymmetric distribution of oxygen vacancies surrounding titanium vacancies enables atomic displacement of titanium and charge injection, providing joint origin for ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, as confirmed by atomic-scale structural analysis and first-principles calculations. The mechanism of ME coupling is offered as the hopping of oxygen vacancies under electric fields, which leads to the rearrangement of electronic configuration. Our work opens an avenue for designing multiferroics, overcoming the long-standing scarcity of room-temperature single-phase multiferroics.

Title: Random walks on random networks of cliques: Inferring the network structure
Authors: Albano Nannini, Damián Zanette
Abstract: We study the properties of discrete-time random walks on networks formed by randomly interconnected cliques, namely, random networks of cliques. Our purpose is to derive the parameters that define the network structure -- specifically, the distribution of clique size and the abundance of inter-clique links -- from the observation of selected statistical features along the random walk. To this end, we apply a Bayesian approach based on recording the times spent by the walker inside successively visited cliques. The procedure is illustrated with some numerical examples of diverse complexity, where the relevant structural parameters are successfully recovered.

Title: Tunable Inter-Edge Interactions in a Bilayer Graphene Quantum Hall Antidot
Authors: Mario Di Luca, Emily Hajigeorgiou, Zekang Zhou, Tengyan Feng, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ferdinand Kuemmeth, Mitali Banerjee
Abstract: Electronic interferometers in the quantum Hall regime are one of the best tools to study the statistical properties of localized quasiparticles in the topologically protected bulk. However, since their behavior is probed via chiral edge modes, bulk-to-edge and inter-edge interactions are two important effects that affect the observations. Moreover, almost all kinds of interferometers heavily rely on a pair of high-quality quantum point contacts where the presence of impurities significantly modifies the behavior of such constrictions, which in turn can alter the outcome of the measurements. Antidots, potential hills in the quantum Hall regime, are particularly valuable in this context, as they overcome the geometric limitations of conventional geometries and act as controlled impurities within a quantum point contact. Furthermore, antidots allow for quasiparticle charge detection through simple conductance measurements, replacing the need for complex techniques such as shot noise. Here, we use a gate-defined bilayer graphene antidot, operated in the Coulomb-dominated regime. By varying the antidot potential, we can tune inter-edge interactions, enabling a crossover from a single-dot to a double-dot behavior. In the latter, strong coupling between the two edge states leads to edge-state pairing, resulting in a measured doubling of the tunneling charge. We find that in certain regimes, the inter-edge coupling completely dominates over other energy scales of the system, overshadowing the interference effects these devices are mainly designed to probe. These results highlight the significant role of inter-edge interactions and establish antidots as a versatile platform for exploring quantum Hall interferometry.

Abstract: Within the framework of 3d-4f molecular magnets, the most thoroughly investigated architecture is that of butterfly-shaped coordination clusters as it provides an ideal testbed to study fundamental magnetic interactions. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a series of isostructural V$^{\rm III}_2$Ln$^{\rm III}_2$ butterfly complexes, where Ln = Y (1Y), Tb (2Tb), Dy (3Dy), Ho (4Ho), Er (5Er), Tm (6Tm), Yb (7Yb), which extends the previous study on isostructural butterflies with Cr$^{\rm III}$, Mn$^{\rm III}$ and Fe$^{\rm III}$. In zero external field, compounds 2Tb, 3Dy and 4Ho show clear maxima in the out-of-phase component of the ac susceptibility whereas small magnetic fields are needed to suppress quantum tunneling in 6Tm. Combined high-field electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetisation measurements unambiguously reveal an easy-plane anisotropy of the V$^{\rm III}$ ion and antiferromagnetic Ising-like 3d-4f exchange couplings. The strength of $J_{\rm 3d-4f}$ is shown to decrease upon variation of the 4f ion from Tb to Ho, while increasing antiferromagnetic interaction can be observed from Ho to Tm. The exact inverse chemical trend is found for the relative angle between the 3d and 4f main anisotropy axes, which highlights the important role of the lanthanide 4f electron distribution anisotropy for 3d-4f exchange.

Title: Geometry of T1 transitions in epithelia
Authors: Pierre A. Haas
Abstract: The flows of tissues of epithelial cells often involve T1 transitions. These neighbour exchanges are irreversible rearrangements crossing an energy barrier. Here, by an exact geometric construction, I determine this energy barrier for general, isolated T1 transitions dominated by line tensions. I show how deviations from regular cell packing reduce this energy barrier, but find that line tension fluctuations increase it on average. By another exact construction, I show how nonlinear tensions in vertex models of epithelial tissues also resist T1 transitions. My results thus form the basis for coarse-grained descriptions of cell neighbour exchanges in continuum models of epithelia.

Title: Strain Effect on Rashba Splitting and Phonon Scattering to Improve Thermoelectric Performance of 2D Heterobilayer MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$
Authors: Vuong Van Thanh, Nguyen Tuan Hung
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit coupling significantly modifies the electronic band structure in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterobilayers, which may enhance their thermoelectric (TE) properties. In this study, we use first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory to explore the strain effect on the TE performance of the 2D vdW heterobilayer MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$. A strong Rashba spin-splitting is observed in the valence band, resulting in an increase in the Seebeck coefficient for p-type. The lattice thermal conductivity of MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$ is remarkably low about of 0.6 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at $T = 300$ K due to large anharmonic scattering. Furthermore, biaxial strain enhances the power factor (PF) by introducing band convergence. At a strain of 2\%, the optimal PF for the n-type material reaches 170 $\mu$W/cmK$^{2}$, indicating approximately 84.78\% increase compared to the unstrained state (92 $\mu$W/cmK$^{2}$). Given the low lattice thermal conductivity, the optimized figure of merit $ZT$ achieves up to 0.88 at 900 K for n-type. Our findings indicate that MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$ is a highly promising candidate for 2D heterobilayer TE materials, owing to its strong Rashba splitting and significant anharmonicity.

Title: Crack Face Contact Modeling is Essential to Predict Crack-Parallel Stresses
Authors: Maryam Hakimzadeh, Noel Walkington, Carlos Mora-Corral, George Gazonas, Kaushik Dayal
Abstract: Phase-field fracture models provide a powerful approach to modeling fracture, potentially enabling the unguided prediction of crack growth in complex patterns. To ensure that only tensile stresses and not compressive stresses drive crack growth, several models have been proposed that aim to distinguish between compressive and tensile loads. However, these models have a critical shortcoming: they do not account for the crack direction, and hence they cannot distinguish between crack-normal tensile stresses that drive crack growth and crack-parallel stresses that do not. In this study, we apply a phase-field fracture model, developed in our earlier work, that uses the crack direction to distinguish crack-parallel stresses from crack-normal stresses. This provides a transparent energetic formulation that drives cracks to grow in when crack faces open or slide past each other, while the cracks respond like the intact solid when the crack faces contact under normal compressive loads. We compare our approach against two widely used approaches, Spectral splitting and the Volumetric-Deviatoric splitting, and find that these predict unphysical crack growth and unphysical stress concentrations under loading conditions in which these should not occur. Specifically, we show that the splitting models predict spurious crack growth and stress concentration under pure crack-parallel normal stresses. However, our formulation, which resolves the crack-parallel stresses from the crack-normal stresses, predicts these correctly.

Title: Phase locking of ring-shaped exciton-polariton condensates to coherent optical drive
Authors: A.N. Osipov, S.V. Koniakhin, O.I. Utesov, I.S. Aronson, A.V. Yulin
Abstract: The effect of an additional quasi-resonant drive on the dynamics of the ring-shaped incoherently pumped polariton condensates carrying angular momentum (vorticity) is studied theoretically. Numerical simulations of the 2D and 1D Gross-Pitaevskii equations show that the difference of the topological charges(vorticities) $\Delta n$ of the condensate and the quasi-resonant coherent drive plays a crucial role in the synchronization dynamics. It is shown that in an axially symmetric system, synchronization can only occur if $|\Delta n| = 0$, whereas in the other cases the phase of the condensate cannot be locked to the phase of the coherent drive. To explain this effect observed in the numerical simulations a perturbation theory is developed. The theory shows that the phase slip between the condensate and the coherent drive can be understood in terms of the motion of 2$\pi$ kinks. It is shown that the breaking of the axial symmetry can stop the motion of the kinks, allowing the phase locking of the condensate to the coherent drive.

Title: Rotating effects on the Hall conductivity in a quantum dot
Authors: Carlos Magno O. Pereira, Luís Fernando C. Pereira, Denise Assafrão, Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the quantized Hall conductivity in a two-dimensional quantum system under rotating effects, a uniform magnetic field, and an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux tube. By varying the angular velocity and the AB flux, we analyze their impact on the formation, shifting, and structure of quantized Hall plateaus. Our results reveal that rotation modifies the energy spectrum, leading to slight shifts in the plateau positions and variations in their widths. Additionally, we identify Aharonov-Bohm-type oscillations in $\sigma_{\text{Hall}}$, which become more pronounced for lower values of the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, indicating enhanced quantum interference effects in the low-field regime. These oscillations are further modulated by $\Omega$, affecting their periodicity and amplitude. The interplay between the confinement frequency $\omega_0$, the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, and the rotational effects plays a crucial role in determining the overall behavior of $\sigma_{\text{Hall}}$. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between rotation, magnetic field, and quantum interference effects, which are relevant for experimental investigations of quantum Hall systems in rotating systems.

Title: Polarity from the Bottom Up: A Computational Framework for Predicting Spontaneous Polar Order
Authors: Jordan Hobbs, Calum J. Gibb, Richard J. Mandle
Abstract: So-called polar liquid crystals possess spontaneous long-range mutual orientation of their electric dipole moments, conferring bulk polarity to fluid phases of matter. The combination of polarity and fluidity leads to complex phase behaviour, and rich new physics, yet the limited understanding around how specific molecular features generate long-range polar ordering in a fluid is a hindrance to development of new materials. In this work, we introduce a computational framework that probes the bimolecular potential energy landscape of candidate molecules, enabling us to dissect the role of directional intermolecular interactions in establishing polar order. In closely related families of materials we find conflicting preferences for (anti)parallel ordering which can be accounted for by specific interactions between molecules. Thus, our results allow us to argue that the presence (or absence) of polar order is a product of specific molecular features and strong directional intermolecular interactions rather than being simply a product of dipole-dipole forces. The design principles established can be leveraged to developing new polar liquid crystalline materials.

Title: Braiding of Majorana Zero Modes in Vortex Cores
Authors: Maxwell Buss, Jasmin Bedow, Prashant Gupta, Dirk K. Morr
Abstract: We demonstrate the successful simulation of $\sqrt{Z}$-, $\sqrt{X}$- and $X$-quantum gates using Majorana zero modes (MZMs) that emerge in magnetic vortices located in topological superconductors. We compute the transition probabilities and geometric phase differences accounting for the full many-body dynamics and show that qubit states can be read out by fusing the vortex core MZMs and measuring the resulting charge density. We visualize the gate processes using the time- and energy-dependent non-equilibrium local density of states. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of employing vortex core MZMs for the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computing.

Title: Wavefunctions and oscillator strengths of Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells
Authors: Leon Kühner, Patric Rommel, Jörg Main, Stefan Scheel, Pavel A. Belov
Abstract: We investigate the eigenstates, that is, the wavefunctions of Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells and derive expressions relating them to the oscillator strengths of different exciton states. Using the B-spline expansion, we compute the wavefunctions in coordinate space and estimate the oscillator strengths. The symmetry properties of the states and the non-separability of the wavefunctions are illustrated. Wavefunctions associated with resonances above the scattering threshold, in particular those of bound states in the continuum as well as their partner states, are also given.

Title: Pulsed Magnetophononics in Gapped Quantum Magnets
Authors: B. Demazure, M. Krebs, G. S. Uhrig, B. Normand
Abstract: One route to the control of quantum magnetism at ultrafast timescales is magnetophononics, the modulation of magnetic interactions by coherently driven lattice excitations. Theoretical studies of a gapped quantum magnet subject to continuous, single-frequency driving of one strongly coupled phonon mode find intriguing phenomena including mutually repelling phonon-bitriplon excitations and global renormalization of the spin excitation spectrum. Because experiments are performed with ultrashort pulses that contain a wide range of driving frequencies, we investigate phonon-bitriplon physics under pulsed laser driving. We use the equations of motion to compute the transient response of the driven and dissipative spin-phonon system, which we characterize using the phonon displacement, phonon number, and triplon occupations. In the Fourier transforms of each quantity we discover a low-frequency energetic oscillation between the lattice and spin sectors, which is an intrinsically nonequilibrium collective mode, and demonstrate its origin as a beating between mutually repelling composite excitations. We introduce a phonon-bitriplon approximation that captures all the physics of hybridization, collective mode formation, and difference-frequency excitation, and show that sum-frequency phenomena also leave clear signatures in the repsonse. We model the appearance of such magnetophononic phenomena in the strongly-coupled spin-chain compound CuGeO$_3$, whose overlapping phonon and spin excitation spectra are well characterized, to deduce the criteria for their possible observation in quantum magnetic materials.

Title: Energetics of the nucleation and glide of disconnection modes in symmetric tilt grain boundaries
Authors: Himanshu Joshi, Ian Chesser, Brandon Runnels, Nikhil Chandra Admal
Abstract: GBs evolve by the nucleation and glide of disconnections, which are dislocations with a step character. In this work, motivated by recent success in predicting GB properties such as the shear coupling factor and mobility from the intrinsic properties of disconnections, we develop a systematic method to calculate the energy barriers for the nucleation and glide of individual disconnection modes under arbitrary driving forces. This method combines tools from bicrystallography to enumerate disconnection modes and the NEB method to calculate their energetics, yielding minimum energy paths and atomistic mechanisms for the nucleation and glide of each disconnection mode. We apply the method to accurately predict shear coupling factors of [001] symmetric tilt grain boundaries in Cu. Particular attention is paid to the boundaries where the classical disconnection nucleation model produces incorrect nucleation barriers. We demonstrate that the method can accurately compute the energy barriers and predict the shear coupling factors for low temperature regime.

Title: Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance
Authors: Malte Henkel
Abstract: A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.

Title: Practical approaches for crystal structure predictions with inpainting generation and universal interatomic potentials
Authors: Peichen Zhong, Xinzhe Dai, Bowen Deng, Gerbrand Ceder, Kristin A. Persson
Abstract: We present Crystal Host-Guided Generation (CHGGen), a diffusion-based framework for crystal structure prediction. Unconditional generation with diffusion models demonstrates limited efficacy in identifying symmetric crystals as the unit cell size increases. CHGGen addresses this limitation through conditional generation with the inpainting method, which optimizes a fraction of atomic positions within a predefined and symmetrized host structure. We demonstrate the method on the ZnS-P$_2$S$_5$ and Li-Si chemical systems, where the inpainting method generates a higher fraction of symmetric structures than unconditional generation. The practical significance of CHGGen extends to enabling the structural modification of crystal structures, particularly for systems with partial occupancy, surface absorption and defects. The inpainting method also allows for seamless integration with other generative models, providing a versatile framework for accelerating materials discovery.

Title: Spectrometer-Free Electron Spectromicroscopy
Authors: F. Javier García de Abajo, Cruz I. Velasco
Abstract: We introduce an approach for performing spectrally resolved electron microscopy without the need for an electron spectrometer. The method involves an electron beam prepared as a coherent superposition of multiple paths, one of which passes near a laser-irradiated specimen. These paths are subsequently recombined, and their interference is measured as a function of laser frequency and beam position. Electron--light scattering introduces inelastic components into the interacting path, thereby disturbing the interference pattern. We implement this concept using two masks placed at conjugate image planes. The masks are complementary and act in tandem to fully suppress electron transmission in the absence of a specimen. However, electron interaction with an illuminated specimen perturbs the imaging condition, enabling electron transmission through the system. For a fixed external light intensity, the transmitted electron current is proportional to the strength of the local optical response in the material. The proposed technique does not require monochromatic electron beams, dramatically simplifying the design of spectrally resolved electron microscopes.

Title: Observation of Double Hysteresis in CoFe$_2$O$_4$/MnFe$_2$O$_4$ Core/Shell Nanoparticles and Its Contribution to AC Heat Induction
Authors: Jie Wang, Hyungsub Kim, Ji-wook Kim, HyeongJoo Seo, Satoshi Ota, Chun-Yeol You, Yasushi Takemura, Seongtae Bae
Abstract: Magnetic core/shell nanoparticles are promising candidates for magnetic hyperthermia due to its high AC magnetic heat induction (specific loss power (SLP)). It's widely accepted that magnetic exchange-coupling between core and shell plays the crucial role in enhancing SLP of magnetic core/shell nanoparticles. However, the physical contribution of exchange coupling to SLP has not been systematically investigated, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, magnetic hard/soft CoFe$_2$O$_4$/MnFe$_2$O$_4 and inverted soft/hard MnFe$_2$O$_4$/CoFe$_2$O$_4$ core/shell nanoparticles were synthesized, systematically varying the number of shell layers, to investigate the physical contribution of internal bias coupling at the core/shell interface to AC heat induction (SLP). Our results show that a unique magnetic property, double-hysteresis loop, was present and clearly observed, which was never reported in previous core/shell research literature. According to the experimentally and theoretically analyzed results, the double-hysteresis behavior in core/shell nanoparticles was caused by the difference in magnetic anisotropy between core and shell materials, separated by a non-magnetic interface. The enhanced SLP and maximum temperature rise (TAC,max) of core/shell nanoparticles are attributed to the optimized magnetic anisotropy, AC magnetic softness and double hysteresis behavior due to the internal bias coupling. These results demonstrate that the rational design capabilities to separately control the magnetic anisotropy, AC/DC magnetic properties by varying the volume ration between core and shell and by switching hard or soft phase materials between core and shell are effective modalities to enhance the AC heat induction of core/shell nanoparticles for magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia.

Title: Boundary Witten effect in multi-axion insulators
Authors: Giandomenico Palumbo
Abstract: We explore novel topological responses and axion-like phenomena in three-dimensional insulating systems with spacetime-dependent mass terms encoding domain walls. Via a dimensional-reduction approach, we derive a new axion-electromagnetic coupling term involving three axion fields. This term yields a topological current in the bulk and, under specific conditions of the axions, real-space topological defects such as magnetic-like monopoles and hopfions. Moreover, once one the axions acquires a constant value, a nontrivial boundary theory realizes a (2+1)-dimensional analog of the Witten effect, which shows that point-like vortices on the gapped boundary of the system acquire half-integer electric charge. Our findings reveal rich topological structures emerging from multi-axion theories, suggesting new avenues in the study of topological phases and defects.

Title: Ultradense Sphere Packings Derived From Disordered Stealthy Hyperuniform Ground States
Authors: Jaeuk Kim, Salvatore Torquato
Abstract: Disordered stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) packings are an emerging class of exotic amorphous two-phase materials endowed with novel physical properties. Such packings of identical spheres have been created from SHU point patterns via a modified collective-coordinate optimization scheme that includes a soft-core repulsion, besides the standard `stealthy' pair potential. Using the distributions of minimum pair distances and nearest-neighbor distances, we find that when the stealthiness parameter $\chi$ is lower than 0.5, the maximal values of $\phi$, denoted by $\phi_{\max}$, decrease to zero on average as the particle number $N$ increases if there are no soft-core repulsions. By contrast, the inclusion of soft-core repulsions results in very large $\phi_{\max}$ independent of $N$, reaching up to $\phi_{\max}=1.0, 0.86, 0.63$ in the zero-$\chi$ limit and decreasing to $\phi_{\max}=1.0, 0.67, 0.47$ at $\chi=0.45$ for $d=1,2,3$, respectively. We obtain explicit formulas for $\phi_{\max}$ as functions of $\chi$ and $N$ for a given $d$. For $d=2,3$, our soft-core SHU packings for small $\chi$ become configurationally very close to the jammed hard-particle packings created by fast compression algorithms, as measured by the pair statistics. As $\chi$ increases beyond $0.20$, the packings form fewer contacts and linear polymer-like chains. The resulting structure factors $S(k)$ and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ reveal that soft-core repulsions significantly alter the short- and intermediate-range correlations in the SHU ground states. We also compute the spectral density $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(k)$, which can be used to estimate various physical properties (e.g., electromagnetic properties, fluid permeability, and mean survival time) of SHU two-phase dispersions. Our results offer a new route for discovering novel disordered hyperuniform two-phase materials with unprecedentedly high density.

Title: A Scalable Methodology for Reinstating the Superhydrophilicity of Ambient-Contaminant Compromised Surfaces
Authors: Ilias Papailias, Arani Mukhopadhyay, Anish Pal, Shahriar Namvar, Constantine M. Megaridis
Abstract: The degradation of the hemi-wicking property of superhydrophilic high-energy surfaces due to contaminant adsorption from the ambient atmosphere is well documented. This degradation compromises the performance of such surfaces, thus affecting their efficacy in real-world applications where hemi-wicking is critical. In this work, the role of surface micro/nanostructure morphology of laser-textured metallic surfaces on superhydrophilicity degradation is studied. We explore intrinsic contact angle variations of superhydrophilic surfaces via adsorption of organics from the surroundings, which brings about the associated changes in surface chemistry. Furthermore, we explore condensation from humid air as a scalable and environment friendly methodology that can reinstate surface superhydrophilicity to a considerable extent (64% recovery of intrinsic wettability after three hours of condensation) due to the efficient removal of physisorbed contaminants from the surface texture features. The present results strengthen the argument that contact-line movement at fine scales can be used for de-pinning and removal of adsorbed organic molecules from contaminated surfaces.

Title: Robust Mixed-State Cluster States and Spurious Topological Entanglement Negativity
Authors: Seunghun Lee, Eun-Gook Moon
Abstract: We investigate 1D and 2D cluster states under local decoherence to assess the robustness of their mixed-state subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) order. By exactly computing fidelity correlators via dimensional reduction of effective statistical mechanics models, we pinpoint the critical error rate for strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of strong subsystem symmetry. Without resorting to the replica trick, we demonstrate that mixed-state SSPT order remains remarkably robust up to the maximal decoherence rate when noise respects strong subsystem symmetry. Furthermore, we propose that the mixed-state SSPT order can be detected by a constant correction to the area-law scaling of entanglement negativity, termed spurious topological entanglement negativity. This also highlights that topological entanglement negativity, a widely used diagnostic for mixed-state topological order, is generally not invariant under finite-depth quantum channels.

Title: Unifying Measurement Schemes in 2-D Terahertz Spectroscopy
Authors: Albert Liu
Abstract: Two distinct measurement schemes have emerged for the new technique of two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS), complicating the literature. Here, we argue that the 'conventional' measurement scheme derived from nuclear magnetic resonance and its optical-frequency analogues should be favored over the 'alternative' measurement scheme implemented in the majority of 2DTS literature. It is shown that the conventional scheme avoids issues such as overlapping nonlinearities and facilitates physical interpretation of spectra, in contrast to the alternative scheme.

Title: Self-organized fractal architectures driven by motility-dependent chemotactic feedback
Authors: Subhashree Subhrasmita Khuntia, Debasish Chaudhuri, Abhishek Chaudhuri
Abstract: Complex spatial patterns in biological systems often arise through self-organization without a central coordination, guided by local interactions and chemical signaling. In this study, we explore how motility-dependent chemical deposition and concentration-sensitive feedback can give rise to fractal-like networks, using a minimal agent-based model. Agents deposit chemicals only while moving, and their future motion is biased by local chemical gradients. This interaction generates a rich variety of self-organized structures resembling those seen in processes like early vasculogenesis and epithelial cell dispersal. We identify a diverse phase diagram governed by the rates of chemical deposition and decay, revealing transitions from uniform distributions to sparse and dense networks, and ultimately to full phase separation. At low chemical decay rates, agents form stable, system-spanning networks; further reduction leads to re-entry into a uniform state. A continuum model capturing the co-evolution of agent density and chemical fields confirms these transitions and reveals how linear stability criteria determine the observed phases. At low chemical concentrations, diffusion dominates and promotes fractal growth, while higher concentrations favor nucleation and compact clustering. These findings unify a range of biological phenomena - such as chemotaxis, tissue remodeling, and self-generated gradient navigation - within a simple, physically grounded framework. Our results also offer insights into designing artificial systems with emergent collective behavior, including robotic swarms or synthetic active matter.

Title: Impact of a tunneling particle on the quantum state of a barrier: two-particle wave-packet model
Authors: Roman Michelko, Peter Bokes
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of two distinguishable particles with unequal masses and a mutual short-range interaction with the aim of quantifying the impact of a tunneling ``projectile'' particle on the quantum mechanical state of the ``barrier'' particle. We find that the states of the barrier particle after the tunneling or reflection of the projectile are displaced by a finite distance that is given by the derivative of the phase of the transmission or reflection amplitudes multiplied by factors dependent on particles' masses, respectively. We demonstrate these results on a numerical example with a resonant interaction between a projectile and barrier. Our work demonstrates physical implication of the concept of phase time delay in the form of finite displacements of particles that are, in principle, experimentally measurable.

Title: Spatially-Controlled Planar Czochralski Growth of Low-Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics

Abstract: Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) for non-volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar Czochralski growth, a novel method for programming the quasi-monocrystalline growth of low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure uniform crystalline properties across large areas is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.

Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are the key element of many devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ characterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is essential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature techniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time consuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we show that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements, with proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the JJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial defect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage characteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can be distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by studying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able concept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From these studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields junctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full wafers, with a spread of less then 3$\,$%. The analysis also revealed a variation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a stoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we estimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 - 5000$\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density increased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching process applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to formation of interfacial trap state

Title: Hawking-Rényi black hole thermodynamics, Kiselev solution, and cosmic censorship
Authors: Viktor G. Czinner, Hideo Iguchi
Abstract: Explicit example, where the Hawking temperature of a black hole horizon is compatible with the black hole's Rényi entropy thermodynamic description, is constructed. It is shown that for every static, spherically symmetric, vacuum black hole space-time, a corresponding black hole solution can be derived, where the Hawking temperature is identical with the Rényi temperature, i.e. the one obtained from the Rényi entropy of the black hole via the 1st law of thermodynamics. In order to have this Hawking-Rényi type thermodynamic property, the black holes must be surrounded by an anisotropic fluid in the form of a Kiselev metric, where the properties of the fluid are uniquely determined by the mass of the black hole, $M$, and the Rényi parameter, {\lambda}. In the simplest Schwarzschild scenario, the system is found to be thermodynamically unstable, and the 3rd law of thermodynamics seems to play the role of a cosmic censor via placing an upper bound on the black hole's mass, by which preventing the black hole from loosing its horizon(s).

Title: Quantum sensing with spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes
Authors: Roberto Rizzato, Andrea Alberdi Hidalgo, Linyan Nie, Elena Blundo, Nick R. von Grafenstein, Jonathan J. Finley, Dominik B. Bucher
Abstract: Spin defects in semiconductors are widely investigated for various applications in quantum sensing. Conventional host materials such as diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide bulk or low-dimensional platforms for optically addressable spin systems, but often lack the structural properties needed for chemical sensing. Here, we introduce a new class of quantum sensors based on naturally occurring spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which combine high surface area with omnidirectional spin control, key features for enhanced sensing performance. First, we present strong evidence that these defects are carbon-related, akin to recently identified centers in hBN, and demonstrate coherent spin control over ensembles embedded within dense, microscale BNNTs networks. Using dynamical decoupling, we enhance spin coherence times by a factor exceeding 300x and implement high-resolution detection of radiofrequency signals. By integrating the BNNT mesh sensor into a microfluidic platform we demonstrate chemical sensing of paramagnetic ions in solution, with detectable concentrations reaching levels nearly 1000 times lower than previously demonstrated using comparable hBN-based systems. This highly porous and flexible architecture positions BNNTs as a powerful new host material for quantum sensing.

Title: Boundary anomalous dimensions from BCFT: O($N$)-symmetric $ϕ^{2n}$ theories with a boundary and higher-derivative generalizations
Authors: Yongwei Guo, Wenliang Li
Abstract: We investigate the $\phi^{2n}$ deformations of the O($N$)-symmetric (generalized) free theories with a flat boundary, where $n\geqslant 2$ is an integer. The generalized free theories refer to the $\Box^k$ free scalar theories with a higher-derivative kinetic term, which is related to the multicritical generalizations of the Lifshitz type. We assume that the (generalized) free theories and the deformed theories have boundary conformal symmetry and O($N$) global symmetry. The leading anomalous dimensions of some boundary operators are derived from the bulk multiplet recombination and analyticity constraints. We find that the $\epsilon^{1/2}$ expansion in the $\phi^6$-tricritical version of the special transition extends to other multicritical cases with larger odd integer $n$, and most of the higher derivative cases involve a noninteger power expansion in $\epsilon$. Using the analytic bootstrap, we further verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with boundary crossing symmetry.

Title: Turbulence in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Julian Amette Estrada, Marc E. Brachet, Pablo D. Mininni
Abstract: Since the idea of quantum turbulence was first proposed by Feynman, and later realized in experiments of superfluid helium and Bose-Einstein condensates, much emphasis has been put in finding signatures that distinguish quantum turbulence from its classical counterpart. Here we show that quantum turbulence in rotating condensates is fundamentally different from the classical case. While rotating quantum turbulence develops a negative temperature state with self-organization of the kinetic energy in quantized vortices, it also displays an anisotropic dissipation mechanism and a different, non-Kolmogorovian, scaling of the energy at small scales. This scaling is compatible with Vinen turbulence and is also found in recent simulations of condensates with multicharged vortices. An elementary explanation for the scaling is presented in terms of disorder in the vortices positions.

Title: Superconductivity in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Under Pressure
Authors: Chen Lu, Zhiming Pan, Fan Yang, Congjun Wu
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity (SC) in the trilayer nickelate compound La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has generated significant interest. In this work, we propose a trilayer two $E_g$-orbital $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model to investigate the microscopic origin of SC in this system. In the strong-coupling regime, each layer is governed by a $t$-$J_{\parallel}$ model with intra-layer antiferromagnetic exchange $J_{\parallel}$, while electrons are allowed to hop between layers, interacting via inter-layer exchange $J_{\perp}$. The inner-layer $3d_{z^2}$-orbital electrons tends to form bonding states with those in the neighboring layers, leading to redistribution of the electron densities. The numerical simulation results indicate that SC is predominantly mediated by the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, characterized by an intra-layer extended $s$-wave pairing in the outer layers, accompanied by an inter-layer pairing with opposite sign. Furthermore, we find that electron doping enhances SC, while hole doping tends to suppress it. These findings provide new insights into the SC mechanisms of La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and its sensitivity to charge doping.

Title: A simple and accurate method to determine fluid-crystal phase boundaries from direct coexistence simulations
Authors: Frank Smallenburg, Giovanni Del Monte, Marjolein de Jager, Laura Filion
Abstract: One method for computationally determining phase boundaries is to explicitly simulate a direct coexistence between the two phases of interest. Although this approach works very well for fluid-fluid coexistences, it is often considered to be less useful for fluid-crystal transitions, as additional care must be taken to prevent the simulation boundaries from imposing unwanted strains on the crystal phase. Here, we present a simple adaptation to the direct coexistence method that nonetheless allows us to obtain highly accurate predictions of fluid-crystal coexistence conditions, assuming a fluid-crystal interface can be readily simulated. We test our approach on hard spheres, the screened Coulomb potential, and a 2D patchy-particle model. In all cases, we find excellent agreement between the direct coexistence approach and (much more cumbersome) free-energy calculation methods. Moreover, the method is sufficiently accurate to resolve the (tiny) free-energy difference between the face-centered cubic and hexagonally close-packed crystal of hard spheres in the thermodynamic limit. The simplicity of this method also ensures that it can be trivially implemented in essentially any simulation method or package. Hence, this approach provides an excellent alternative to free-energy based methods for the precise determination of phase boundaries.

Title: Low-Dissipation Nanomechanical Devices from Monocrystalline Silicon Carbide
Authors: Leo Sementilli, Daniil M. Lukin, Hope Lee, Joshua Yang, Erick Romero, Jelena Vučković, Warwick P. Bowen
Abstract: The applications of nanomechanical resonators range from biomolecule mass sensing to hybrid quantum interfaces. Their performance is often limited by internal material damping, which can be greatly reduced by using crystalline materials. Crystalline silicon carbide is appealing due to its exquisite mechanical, electrical and optical properties, but has suffered from high internal damping due to material defects. Here we resolve this by developing nanomechanical resonators fabricated from bulk monocrystalline 4H-silicon carbide. This allows us to achieve damping as low as 2.7 mHz, more than an order-of-magnitude lower than any previous crystalline silicon carbide resonator and corresponding to a quality factor as high as 20 million at room temperature. The volumetric dissipation of our devices reaches the material limit for silicon carbide for the first time. This provides a path to greatly increase the performance of silicon carbide nanomechanical resonators.

Title: Quantum weight: A fundamental property of quantum many-body systems
Authors: Yugo Onishi, Liang Fu
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum weight as a ground state property of quantum many-body systems that is encoded in the static structure factor and characterizes density fluctuation at long wavelengths. The quantum weight carries a wealth of information about dielectric responses and optical properties of the system, and is closely related to its quantum geometry. For systems with short-range interactions or low-dimensional Coulomb systems, we show that the many-body quantum metric (which measures the change of the ground state under twisted boundary conditions) can be determined directly from the quantum weight. Notably, the quantum weight is a property of a single ground state and independent of boundary conditions in the thermodynamic limit. Our finding thus enables direct experimental measurement and numerical calculation of many-body quantum metric. On the other hand, for three-dimensional Coulomb systems, we show that the quantum weight is distinct from the many-body quantum metric due to dielectric screening in three dimensions. We further use dielectric sum rules to derive upper and lower bounds on their quantum weight in terms of electron density, static dielectric constant, and plasmon energy. Our work highlights quantum weight as a fundamental material parameter, which can be experimentally determined by x-ray scattering or electron loss spectroscopy.

Title: Cavity-Driven Attractive Interactions in Quantum Materials
Authors: F. Helmrich, H. S. Adlong, I. Khanonkin, M. Kroner, G. Scalari, J. Faist, A. Imamoglu, T. F. Nova
Abstract: Many-body phenomena in quantum materials emerge from the interplay among a broad continuum of electronic states, and controlling these interactions is critical for engineering novel phases. One promising approach exploits fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field confined within optical cavities to tailor electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate that cavity photons can mediate attractive interactions in a tunable van der Waals material and reorganize a continuum of electron-hole transitions into an exciton-like state. We introduce a broadband, sub-wavelength time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated two-dimensional quantum materials into a terahertz cavity. This approach enables the first-ever measurement of the field-tunable bandgap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while revealing ultrastrong coupling with a vacuum Rabi frequency exceeding $\Omega_{Rabi}/\omega\approx 40\%$ of the bare photon energy. Crucially, we identify a novel cavity-induced resonance emerging from the interband continuum that resembles Coulomb-bound excitons and remains stable across a broad temperature range. By uniting longstanding theoretical predictions with advanced experimental techniques, our findings open new avenues for designing and probing unique light-matter states and realizing hybrid correlated phases in quantum materials.

Title: Easy-axis Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice: from supersolid to gapped solid
Authors: Martin Ulaga, Jure Kokalj, Takami Tohyama, Peter Prelovšek
Abstract: We investigate the easy-axis Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice by numerically studying excitations and the dynamical spin structure factor $S^{\mu\mu}({\bf q},\omega)$. Results are analyzed within the supersolid scenario, characterized by the translation-symmetry-breaking parameter $m_z$ and the supersolid offdiagonal order parameter $m_\perp$. We find very robust $m_z > 0$ in the whole easy-axis anisotropy regime $\alpha = J_\perp/J_z > 0$, even enhanced by the magnetic field $h>0$, as well as $m_\perp >0$ for intermediate $\alpha <1$ and $h>0$. Still, at small $\alpha \lesssim 0.2$, relevant for recent experiments on the magnetic material K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, we find at $h=0$ rather vanishing $m_\perp \sim 0$, which appears compatible with the numerically established finite magnon excitation gap $\Delta_1 \sim 0.25 \alpha J$.

Title: Universal Stochastic Equations of Monitored Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Zhenyu Xiao, Tomi Ohtsuki, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: We investigate the monitored quantum dynamics of Gaussian mixed states and derive the universal Fokker-Planck equations that govern the stochastic time evolution of entire density-matrix spectra, obtaining their exact solutions. From these equations, we reveal an even-odd effect in purification dynamics: whereas entropy exhibits exponential decay for an even number $N$ of complex fermions, algebraic decay with divergent purification time occurs for odd $N$ as a manifestation of dynamical criticality. Additionally, we identify the universal fluctuations of entropy in the chaotic regime, serving as a non-unitary counterpart of the universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic electronic transport phenomena. Furthermore, we elucidate and classify the universality classes of non-unitary quantum dynamics based on fundamental symmetry. We also validate the universality of these analytical results through extensive numerical simulations across different types of models.

Title: Numerical analysis of Josephson junction arrays for multi-order quantum voltage steps
Authors: Paolo Durandetto
Abstract: The dynamics of overdamped Josephson junctions under varying microwave-driving conditions have been studied through numerical simulations using the resistively-shunted junction (RSJ) model, with a focus on primary voltage metrology applications, where a significantly high number of series-connected junctions and stringent uniformity of their electrical parameters are required. The aim is to determine the optimal junction characteristics and external microwave (rf) parameters that maximize the width of quantum voltage levels (Shapiro steps) from order $n=0$ to $n > 1$. Both the rf and dc power requirements, along with the junction parameter spread and power attenuation, are analyzed as key factors that need to be optimized for improved performance of the quantum device. This work aims to advance the development of next-generation Programmable Josephson Voltage Standards (PJVS) with logic architectures that surpass the conventional binary and ternary codifications used in present quantum voltage arrays, while significantly reducing the overall number of junctions as well as the number of sub-arrays and bias lines. Existing technologies exploiting $n = 0$ and $n = \pm 1$ voltage steps are first discussed and analyzed to verify the validity of the simulation model. They are then further investigated to extend their usability with multi-order quantum steps for $n$ up to 3. From the simulation results, it follows that present junction technologies may be employed with no modifications for the simultaneous operation of quantum steps up to $n=2$, although optimal power efficiency would require a retrimming of the junction's electrical parameters. On the contrary, extending the highest step order to $n=3$ strictly requires the junction's characteristic parameters to be properly adjusted to maintain sustainable power levels as well as acceptable quantum-locking ranges.

Title: Spin-to-charge conversion in orthorhombic RhSi topological semimetal crystalline thin films
Authors: Surya N. Panda, Qun Yang, Darius Pohl, Hua Lv, Iñigo Robredo, Rebeca Ibarra, Alexander Tahn, Bernd Rellinghaus, Yan Sun, Binghai Yan, Anastasios Markou, Edouard Lesne, Claudia Felser
Abstract: The rise of non-magnetic topological semimetals, which provide a promising platform for observing and controlling various spin-orbit effects, has led to significant advancements in the field of topological spintronics. RhSi exists in two distinct polymorphs: cubic and orthorhombic crystal structures. The noncentrosymmetric B20 cubic structure has been extensively studied for hosting unconventional multifold fermions. In contrast, the orthorhombic structure, which crystallizes in the Pnma space group (No. 62), remains less explored and belongs to the family of topological Dirac semimetals. In this work, we investigate the structural, magnetic, and electrical properties of RhSi textured-epitaxial films grown on Si(111) substrates, which crystallize in the orthorhombic structure. We investigate the efficiency of pure spin current transport across RhSi/permalloy interfaces and the subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion via inverse spin Hall effect measurements. The xperimentally determined spin Hall conductivity in orthorhombic RhSi reaches a maximum value of 126 ($\hbar$/e)($\Omega$.cm)$^{-1}$ at 10 K, which aligns reasonably well with first-principles calculations that attribute the spin Hall effect in RhSi to the spin Berry curvature mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a sizable spin-mixing conductance (34.7 nm$^{-2}$) and an exceptionally high interfacial spin transparency of 88$%$ in this heterostructure, underlining its potential for spin-orbit torque switching applications. Overall, this study broadens the scope of topological spintronics, emphasizing the controlled interfacial spin-transport processes and subsequent spin-to-charge conversion in a previously unexplored topological Dirac semimetal RhSi/ferromagnet heterostructure.

Title: Magnetic field suppression of tomographic electron transport
Authors: Habib Rostami, Nitay Ben-Shachar, Sergej Moroz, Johannes Hofmann
Abstract: Degenerate two-dimensional electron liquids are theoretically established to possess two vastly distinct collisional electron mean free paths, where even-parity deformations of the Fermi surface are hydrodynamic with a short collisional mean free path but odd-parity deformations remain near ballistic (known as the "tomographic" transport regime). Predicted signatures of this regime rely on the scaling of observables with temperature or device dimension, both of which are difficult to establish with certainty. Here, we consider magnetotransport in a minimal model of tomographic electrons and show that even a small magnetic field suppresses tomographic transport signatures and thus acts as a sensitive and unique probe of this regime. Fundamentally, the magnetic field breaks time-reversal invariance, which is a prerequisite for the odd-even parity effect in the collisional relaxation. We analyze in detail the scaling of the transverse conductivity, which has been linked to small-channel conductance of interaction-dominated electrons, and show that a tomographic scaling regime at intermediate wave numbers is quickly suppressed with magnetic field to a hydrodynamic or collisionless form. We confirm that the suppression occurs at relatively small magnetic fields when the cyclotron radius is comparable to the ballistic mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode. This occurs at a much smaller magnetic field than the magnetic field strength required to suppress hydrodynamic electron transport, which suggests an experimental protocol to extract the odd-parity mean free path.

Title: Hindered stokesian settling of discs and rods
Authors: Yating Zhang, Narayanan Menon
Abstract: We report measurements of the mean settling velocities for suspensions of discs and rods in the stokes regime for a number of particle aspect ratios. All these shapes display ''hindered settling'', namely, a decrease in settling speed as the solid volume fraction is increased. A comparison of our data to spheres reveals that discs and rods show less hindering than spheres at the same relative interparticle separation. The data for all six of our particle shapes may be scaled to collapse on that of spheres, with a scaling factor that depends only on the volume of the particle relative to a sphere. Despite the orientational degrees of freedom available with nonspherical particles, it thus appears that the dominant contribution to the hindered settling emerges from terms that are simply proportional to the volume of the sedimenting particles, enabling prediction of hindered settling of other nonpolar axisymmetric shapes.

Title: Emergent complex phases in a discrete flocking model with reciprocal and non-reciprocal interactions
Authors: Matthieu Mangeat, Swarnajit Chatterjee, Jae Dong Noh, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: There is growing interest in multi-species active matter systems with reciprocal and non-reciprocal interactions. While such interactions have been explored in continuous symmetry models, less is known about multi-species discrete-symmetry systems. To address this, we study the two-species active Ising model (TSAIM), a discrete counterpart of the two-species Vicsek model. Our investigation explores both inter-species reciprocal and non-reciprocal interactions, along with the possibility of species interconversion. In the reciprocal TSAIM, we observe the emergence of a high-density parallel flocking state, a feature not seen in previous flocking models. With species interconversion, the TSAIM corresponds to an active extension of the Ashkin-Teller model and exhibits rich state diagrams. In the non-reciprocal TSAIM, a run-and-chase dynamics emerge. We also find that the system is metastable due to droplet excitation and exhibits spontaneous motility-induced interface pinning. A hydrodynamic theory validates our numerical simulations and confirms the phase diagrams.

Title: The spin-orbital Kitaev model: from kagome spin ice to classical fractons
Authors: Weslei B. Fontana, Fabrizio G. Oliviero, Rodrigo G. Pereira, Willian M. H. Natori
Abstract: We study an exactly solvable spin-orbital model that can be regarded as a classical analogue of the celebrated Kitaev honeycomb model and describes interactions between Rydberg atoms on the ruby lattice. We leverage its local and nonlocal symmetries to determine the exact partition function and the static structure factor. A mapping between $S=3/2$ models on the honeycomb lattice and kagome spin Hamiltonians allows us to interpret the thermodynamic properties in terms of a classical kagome spin ice. Partially lifting the symmetries associated with line operators, we obtain a model characterized by immobile excitations, called classical fractons, and a ground state degeneracy that increases exponentially with the length of the system. We formulate a continuum theory that reveals the underlying gauge structure and conserved charges. Extensions of our theory to other lattices and higher-spin systems are suggested.

Title: Universality of percolation at dynamic pseudocritical point
Authors: Qiyuan Shi, Shuo Wei, Youjin Deng, Ming Li
Abstract: Universality, encompassing critical exponents, scaling functions, and dimensionless quantities, is fundamental to phase transition theory. In finite systems, universal behaviors are also expected to emerge at the pseudocritical point. Focusing on two-dimensional percolation, we show that the size distribution of the largest cluster asymptotically approaches to a Gumbel form in the subcritical phase, a Gaussian form in the supercritical phase, and transitions within the critical finite-size scaling window. Numerical results indicate that, at consistently defined pseudocritical points, this distribution exhibits a universal form across various lattices and percolation models (bond or site), within error bars, yet differs from the distribution at the critical point. The critical polynomial, universally zero for two-dimensional percolation at the critical point, becomes nonzero at pseudocritical points. Nevertheless, numerical evidence suggests that the critical polynomial, along with other dimensionless quantities such as wrapping probabilities and Binder cumulants, assumes fixed values at the pseudocritical point that are independent of the percolation type (bond or site) but vary with lattice structures. These findings imply that while strict universality breaks down at the pseudocritical point, certain extreme-value statistics and dimensionless quantities exhibit quasi-universality, revealing a subtle connection between scaling behaviors at critical and pseudocritical points.

Title: Shape-asymmetry and flexibility in active cross-stream migration in nonuniform shear
Authors: Derek C. Gomes, Tapan C. Adhyapak
Abstract: We show that activity and broken fore-aft shape symmetry enable microswimmers to cross streamlines in nonuniform shear, a key yet overlooked factor in active cross-stream migration. Using a model of flagellated microswimmers in microchannel flow, we find that hydrodynamic coupling and flagellar flexibility significantly impact migration. A simplified theory identifies key factors driving the underlying rich nonlinear dynamics. Our findings apply to dynamics and control of both living and artificial microswimmers, while the hydrodynamic framework extends to diverse shear flow scenarios.

Title: The First Principles Equation for Coherent Phonons: Dynamics and Polaron distortions
Authors: Gianluca Stefanucci, Enrico Perfetto
Abstract: This paper addresses the first principles description of coherent phonons in systems subjected to optical excitations and/or doping. We reformulate the first-principles Ehrenfest equation (fpEE) [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 031026 (2023)] in terms of Born-Oppenheimer phonon frequencies and dynamical Born effective charges. We demonstrate that nonadiabatic effects renormalize the Born-Oppenheimer frequencies and introduce a damping term responsible for the finite lifetime of coherent phonons. Notably, both the frequency renormalization and the lifetime are identical to those of quantum phonons. Furthermore, we show that electrons exert a force driven by an unconventional dynamically screened electron-phonon coupling. This coupling is smaller than the bare one even in the adiabatic limit, highlighting the need to revise current models. The fpEE is also used to develop a first-principles polaron theory that describes lattice distortions induced by doping.

Title: Time-domain extreme ultraviolet diffuse scattering spectroscopy of nanoscale surface phonons

Abstract: We report the observation of dynamic fringe patterns in the diffuse scattering of extreme ultraviolet light from surfaces following femtosecond optical excitation. At each point on the detector, the diffuse scattering intensity exhibits oscillations at well-defined frequencies that correspond to surface phonons propagating with wave vectors determined by the scattering geometry. This indicates that the optical excitation generates coherent surface phonon wave packets across a broad wave vectors range, spanning from 300 to 60 nm. This phenomenon is observed in a variety of samples, including single-layer and multilayer metal films, as well as bulk semiconductors. The measured surface phonon dispersions show good agreement with theoretical calculations. By comparing signal amplitudes from samples with different surface morphologies, we find that the excitation mechanism is linked to the natural surface roughness of the samples, and the signal is still detectable also on extremely smooth surfaces with sub-nanometer roughness. These findings demonstrate a simple and effective method for optically exciting coherent surface phonons with nanoscale wavelengths across a wide range of solid surfaces. They also establish a foundation for surface phonon spectroscopy in a wave vectors regime that is well beyond the limit of conventional surface Brillouin scattering techniques.

Title: Quasiparticle picture of topological phase transitions induced by interactions
Authors: S. S. Krishtopenko, A. V. Ikonnikov, F. Hartmann, S. Höfling, B. Jouault, F. Teppe
Abstract: We present a general recipe to describe topological phase transitions in condensed matter systems with interactions. We show that topological invariants in the presence of interactions can be efficiently calculated by means of a non-Hermitian quasiparticle Hamiltonian introduced on the basis of the Green's function. As an example analytically illustrating the application of the quasiparticle concept, we consider a topological phase transition induced by the short-range electrostatic disorder in a two dimensional system described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. The latter allows us to explicitly demonstrate the change in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant and explain the quantized values of the longitudinal conductance in a certain range of the Fermi energy and the disorder strength found previously in numerical calculations.

Title: Phase diagrams and two key factors to superconductivity of RP nickelates
Authors: Zhenfeng Ouyang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has drawn great attention. Many works have been done to study the superconductivity as well as to find more superconducting RP nickelates. However, there is a lack of general understanding regarding the key factors that contribute to the superconductivity of RP nickelates. Here, we systematically study the series of RP nickelates under doping or high-pressure conditions by means of density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory. We find that enhanced quasi-particle weights and local spin fluctuation of the Ni-$e_g$ orbitals are commonly realized by hole doping or high pressure in the known superconducting RP nickelates, suggesting that they are crucial to the superconductivity. We also summarize experimentally synthesized RP nickelates into phase diagrams with local spin moment and local entanglement entropy as parameters, where phases of spin density wave/antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and Fermi liquid are distinguished. At last, we predict a promising candidate for superconducting RP nickelates, which is constructed in a "bilayer-trilayer" stacking sequence.

Title: Fluctuation Relations associated to an arbitrary bijection in path space
Authors: Raphael Chetrite, Stefano Marcantoni
Abstract: We introduce a framework to identify Fluctuation Relations for vector-valued observables in physical systems evolving through a stochastic dynamics. These relations arise from the particular structure of a suitable entropic functional and are induced by transformations in trajectory space that are invertible but are not involutions, typical examples being spatial rotations and translations. In doing so, we recover as particular cases results known in the literature as isometric fluctuation relations or spatial fluctuation relations and moreover we provide a recipe to find new ones. We mainly discuss two case studies, namely stochastic processes described by a canonical path probability and non degenerate diffusion processes. In both cases we provide sufficient conditions for the fluctuation relation to hold, considering either finite time or asymptotically large times.

Title: The Free-Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions
Authors: Lars Kürten, Antoine Castagnède, Frank Smallenburg, C. Patrick Royall
Abstract: Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on its origins, due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy. Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of pre-critical nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been successfully compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.

Title: Electron-Phonon Coupling Mediated by Fröhlich Interaction in Rb2SnBr6 Perovskite
Authors: C. C. S. Soares, J. S. Rodríguez-Hernández, Bruno P. Silva, Mayra A. P. Gómez, V. S. Neto, A. P. Ayala, C.W.A. Paschoal
Abstract: Due to their well-suited optoelectronic properties, metal halide perovskites are emerging semiconductor materials with potential applications in solar cells, detectors, and light-emitting diodes. Beyond the traditional 3D perovskites, low-dimensional counterparts have more attractive effects such as excitonic emissions and quantum confinements that are enhanced by the reduced dimensionality, which involve the Electron-Phonon Coupling (EPC). Such phenomenon, which comprehends the interaction between charge carriers and lattice vibrations, usually strongly impacts the photoluminescence (PL) response in low-dimensional frameworks. In this paper, we investigated the intrinsic EPC onto low-temperature PL of the zero-dimensional (0D) Rb2SnBr6 perovskite. Temperature-dependent PL measurements, complemented by various characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, revealed broadband emission with a significant Stokes shift attributed to self-trapped excitons (STEs). The Fröhlich mechanism, mediated by interactions between excitonic charge carriers and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, primarily accounts for the emission broadening through phonon-assisted radiative recombination. The EPC strength was evaluated through the Huang-Rhys factor S=34, confirming strong correlations between electronic and vibrational properties and supporting the STE emission assumption. The possible mechanism of STE formation was evaluated by the Fröhlich parameter {\alpha} of 1.94 for electrons and 4.73 for holes, which points out a major contribution of the hole-polaron quasi-particle on exciton trapping. Our findings give insights regarding the influence of EPC in 0D perovskites and STE formation, which leads to the assessment of Rb2SnBr6 for light-harvesting applications.

Title: Best practices in Quantum Monte Carlo for metal catalysis: CO hydrolysis on Pt(111)
Authors: Ali Bagci, Philip E Hoggan
Abstract: Hydrogen production as a clean, sustainable replacement for fossil fuels is gathering pace. Research work and prototyping various aspects of hydrogen power is now a priority. Over 90 \% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. This work describes catalytic selective hydrogen production optimising reactant structure on a model catalyst. Focus is on O-H bond dissociation in format radicals formed after carbon-monoxide is co-adsorbed with water at Pt(111). Finally, hydrogen gas is given off. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. %This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site approach is used. This work demonstrates Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology using a very simple four primitive-cell layer model, oriented to expose Pt (111). QMC is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr{ö}dinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous systems involving solids. During hydrolysis of carbon monoxide, initial O-H bond stretch is rate-limiting. This dissociation energy is offset by Pt-H bond formation at the surface. The reactive formate (H-O-C=O) species formed, by initial hydrolysis of CO, also interact with a vicinal Pt. These are subsequently desorbed. They then produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a H-atom dissociated from the formate species and another desorbed at the Pt(111) face. Our approach allows a high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function is used to guide the QMC calculation.

Title: Erratic non-Hermitian skin localization
Authors: Stefano Longhi
Abstract: A novel localization phenomenon, termed erratic non-Hermitian skin localization, has been identified in disordered globally-reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices. Unlike conventional non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization, it features macroscopic eigenstate localization at irregular, disorder-dependent positions with sub-exponential decay. Using the Hatano-Nelson model with disordered imaginary gauge fields as a case study, this effect is linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. Finite-size scaling analysis confirms the localized nature of the eigenstates. This discovery challenges conventional wave localization paradigms, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.

Title: Full Crystallographic Imaging of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayers with Phonon-Enhanced Sum-Frequency Microscopy

Heenen, Christoph Scheurer, Karsten Reuter, Joshua D. Caldwell, Martin Wolf, Piran R. Kidambi, Martin Thämer, Alexander Paarmann
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an important 2D material for van der Waals heterostructures, single photon emitters, and infrared nanophotonics. The optical characterization of mono- and few-layer samples of hBN however remains a challenge as the material is almost invisible optically. Here we introduce phase-resolved sum-frequency microscopy as a technique for imaging monolayers of hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and visualize their crystal orientation. A combination of femtosecond mid-infrared (IR) and visible laser pulses is used for sum-frequency generation (SFG), which is imaged in a wide-field optical microscope. The IR laser resonantly excites a phonon of hBN that leads to an ~800-fold enhancement of the SFG intensity, making it possible to image large 100x100 {\mu}m2 sample areas in less than 1 s. Implementing heterodyne detection in combination with azimuthal rotation of the sample further provides full crystallographic information. Through combined knowledge of topography and crystal orientation, we find that triangular domains of CVD-grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen-terminated zigzag edges. Overall, SFG microscopy can be used as an ultra-sensitive tool to image crystal structure, strain, stacking sequences, and twist angles, and is applicable to the wide range of van der Waals structures, where location and identification of monolayer regions and interfaces with broken inversion symmetry is of paramount importance.

Title: Road layout in the KPZ class
Authors: Márton Balázs, Sudeshna Bhattacharjee, Karambir Das, David Harper
Abstract: We propose a road layout and traffic model, based on last passage percolation (LPP). An easy naive argument shows that coalescence of traffic trajectories is essential to be considered when observing traffic networks around us. This is a fundamental feature in first passage percolation (FPP) models where nearby geodesics naturally coalesce in search of the easiest passage through the landscape. Road designers seek the same in pursuing cost savings, hence FPP geodesics are straightforward candidates to model road layouts. Unfortunately no detailed knowledge is rigorously available on FPP geodesics. To address this, we use exponential LPP instead to build a stochastic model of road traffic and prove certain characteristics thereof. Cars start from every point of the lattice and follow half-infinite geodesics in random directions. Exponential LPP is known to be in the KPZ universality class and it is widely expected that FPP shares very similar properties, hence our findings should equally apply to FPP-based modelling. We address several traffic-related quantities of this model and compare our theorems to real life road networks.

Title: Quantum Liang Information Flow Probe of Causality across Critical Points
Authors: Roopayan Ghosh, Bin Yi, Sougato Bose
Abstract: Investigating causation in the quantum domain is crucial. Despite numerous studies of correlations in quantum many-body systems, causation, which is very distinct from correlations, has hardly been studied. We address this by demonstrating the efficacy of the newly established causation measure, quantum Liang information flow, in quantifying causality across phase diagrams of quantum many-body systems. We focus on quantum criticality, which are highly nonclassical points. We extract causation behavior across a spectrum-wide critical point and a ground state second-order phase transition in both integrable and nonintegrable systems. Across criticality, each case exhibits distinct hallmarks, different from correlation measures. We also deduce that quantum causation qualitatively follows the quasiparticle picture of information propagation in integrable systems but exhibits enhanced quantum nonlocality near criticality. At times significantly larger than the spatial separation, it extracts additional features from the equilibrium wave function, leading to a peak just before the critical point for near boundary sites.

Title: Monitored long-range interacting systems: spin-wave theory for quantum trajectories
Authors: Zejian Li, Anna Delmonte, Xhek Turkeshi, Rosario Fazio
Abstract: Measurement-induced phases exhibit unconventional dynamics as emergent collective phenomena, yet their behavior in tailored interacting systems -- crucial for quantum technologies -- remains less understood. We develop a systematic toolbox to analyze monitored dynamics in long-range interacting systems, relevant to platforms like trapped ions and Rydberg atoms. Our method extends spin-wave theory to general dynamical generators at the quantum trajectory level, enabling access to a broader class of states than approaches based on density matrices. This allows efficient simulation of large-scale interacting spins and captures nonlinear dynamical features such as entanglement and trajectory correlations. We showcase the versatility of our framework by exploring entanglement phase transitions in a monitored spin system with power-law interactions in one and two dimensions, where the entanglement scaling changes from logarithm to volume law as the interaction range shortens, and by dwelling on how our method mitigates experimental post-selection challenges in detecting monitored quantum phases.

Title: Negative thermodynamic pressure: no-go theorem and yes-go examples
Authors: Varazdat Stepanyan
Abstract: Theory and experiment have long discussed negative thermodynamic pressure states, but their microscopic origins are unclear. I address this problem within the framework of quantum thermodynamics. I show that the pressure exerted on the boundary is positive when there is no interaction with the boundary. This is formalized by a no-go theorem that holds for any quantum state with finite motion. As a consequence of this analysis, I deduce a general formula for quantum non-equilibrium pressure. It is believed that stable negative pressure states cannot exist in gases. I provide solvable examples of quantum and classical gases, where negative pressure is achieved due to a suitable coupling with the boundary walls.

Title: Many-body quantum catalysts for transforming between phases of matter
Authors: David T. Stephen, Rahul Nandkishore, Jian-Hao Zhang
Abstract: A catalyst is a substance that enables otherwise impossible transformations between states of a system, without being consumed in the process. In this work, we apply the notion of catalysts to many-body quantum physics. In particular, we construct catalysts that enable transformations between different symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of matter using symmetric finite-depth quantum circuits. We discover a wide variety of catalysts, including GHZ-like states which spontaneously break the symmetry, gapless states with critical correlations, topological orders with symmetry fractionalization, and spin-glass states. These catalysts are all united under a single framework which has close connections to the theory of quantum anomalies, and we use this connection to put strong constraints on possible pure- and mixed-state catalysts. We also show how the catalyst approach leads to new insights into the structure of certain phases of matter, and to new methods to efficiently prepare SPT phases with long-range interactions or projective measurements.

Title: Synchronous manipulation of nuclear spins via boron vacancy centers in hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Fattah Sakuldee, Mehdi Abdi
Abstract: We develop a method for entangling operations on nuclear spins surrounding a negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-center) point defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). To this end, we propose to employ the electron spin of a VB-center as a control qubit. We show that in the presence of a background magnetic field and by applying control pulses, one can collectively manipulate the state of the nuclei with $\hat{U}_z$ and $\hat{U}_x$ rotations. These rotations can serve for implementing the synchronous three-qubit $X$, $Z$, and the Hadamard gates. Through our numerical analyses considering realistic system parameters and the decoherence effects, we demonstrate that these gates can be executed with high fidelities. Furthermore, as an example for the application of our toolbox, we utilize these collective gates to prepare the highly entangled GHZ states among the three nuclear spins with a fidelity of $0.99$. By including the electron decoherence effects, we find that the relative deviations of the gate fidelities from the noisy terms are negligibly small, proving the noise-resilience of our protocols. Our work can serve as the foundation for exploiting the nuclear spins in hBN in future quantum technological applications.

Title: Constrained composite Bayesian optimization for rational synthesis of polymeric particles
Authors: Fanjin Wang, Maryam Parhizkar, Anthony Harker, Mohan Edirisinghe
Abstract: Polymeric nano- and micro-scale particles have critical roles in tackling critical healthcare and energy challenges with their miniature characteristics. However, tailoring their synthesis process to meet specific design targets has traditionally depended on domain expertise and costly trial-and-errors. Recently, modeling strategies, particularly Bayesian optimization (BO), have been proposed to aid materials discovery for maximized/minimized properties. Coming from practical demands, this study for the first time integrates constrained and composite Bayesian optimization (CCBO) to perform efficient target value optimization under black-box feasibility constraints and limited data for laboratory experimentation. Using a synthetic problem that simulates electrospraying, a model nanomanufacturing process, CCBO strategically avoided infeasible conditions and efficiently optimized particle production towards predefined size targets, surpassing standard BO pipelines and providing decisions comparable to human experts. Further laboratory experiments validated CCBO capability to guide the rational synthesis of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles with diameters of 300 nm and 3.0 $\mu$m via electrospraying. With minimal initial data and unknown experiment constraints, CCBO reached the design targets within 4 iterations. Overall, the CCBO approach presents a versatile and holistic optimization paradigm for next-generation target-driven particle synthesis empowered by artificial intelligence (AI).

Title: First-principle theory of the Casimir screening effect
Authors: Yu.A. Budkov, P.E. Brandyshev
Abstract: In this paper, we use the formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory to investigate the Casimir force between flat, ideally conductive surfaces containing confined, but mobile ions. We demonstrate that, in the Gaussian approximation, the ionic fluctuations contribute separately from the electromagnetic fluctuations that are responsible for the standard Casimir effect. This is in line with the "separation hypothesis", has been previously applied on a purely intuitive basis. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of calculating the zero Matsubara frequency component in the electromagnetic contribution, using the formula developed by Schwinger et al., as opposed to the approach based on Lifshitz theory used by other researchers.

Title: Physics-based battery model parametrisation from impedance data
Authors: Noël Hallemans, Nicola E. Courtier, Colin P. Please, Brady Planden, Rishit Dhoot, Robert Timms, S. Jon chapman, David Howey, Stephen R. Duncan
Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.

Title: Discover physical concepts and equations with machine learning
Authors: Bao-Bing Li, Yi Gu, Shao-Feng Wu
Abstract: Machine learning can uncover physical concepts or physical equations when prior knowledge from the other is available. However, these two aspects are often intertwined and cannot be discovered independently. We extend SciNet, which is a neural network architecture that simulates the human physical reasoning process for physics discovery, by proposing a model that combines Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). This allows us to simultaneously discover physical concepts and governing equations from simulated experimental data across various physical systems. We apply the model to several examples inspired by the history of physics, including Copernicus' heliocentrism, Newton's law of gravity, Schrödinger's wave mechanics, and Pauli's spin-magnetic formulation. The results demonstrate that the correct physical theories can emerge in the neural network.

Title: High-field Breakdown and Thermal Characterization of Indium Tin Oxide Transistors
Authors: Haotian Su, Yuan-Mau Lee, Tara Peña, Sydney Fultz-Waters, Jimin Kang, Çağıl Köroğlu, Sumaiya Wahid, Christina J. Newcomb, Young Suh Song, H.-S. Philip Wong, Shan X. Wang, Eric Pop
Abstract: Amorphous oxide semiconductors are gaining interest for logic and memory transistors compatible with low-temperature fabrication. However, their low thermal conductivity and heterogeneous interfaces suggest that their performance may be severely limited by self-heating, especially at higher power and device densities. Here, we investigate the high-field breakdown of ultrathin (~4 nm) amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO) transistors with scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) and multiphysics simulations. The ITO devices break irreversibly at channel temperatures of ~180 °C and ~340 °C on SiO${_2}$ and HfO${_2}$ substrates, respectively, with failure primarily caused by thermally-induced compressive strain near the device contacts. Combining SThM measurements with simulations allows us to estimate a thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of 35 ${\pm}$ 12 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on SiO${_2}$, and 51 ${\pm}$ 14 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on HfO${_2}$. The latter also enables significantly higher breakdown power due to better heat dissipation and closer thermal expansion matching. These findings provide insights into the thermo-mechanical limitations of indium-based amorphous oxide transistors, which are important for more reliable and high-performance logic and memory applications.

Title: Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal
Authors: Samuel D. Tomlinson, Aliki M. Tsopelakou, Tzia M. Onn, Steven R. H. Barrett, Adam M. Boies, Shaun D. Fitzgerald
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.

Title: Benchmarking direct and indirect dipolar spin-exchange interactions between two Rydberg atoms
Authors: Gabriel Emperauger, Mu Qiao, Guillaume Bornet, Cheng Chen, Romain Martin, Yuki Torii Chew, Bastien Gély, Lukas Klein, Daniel Barredo, Antoine Browaeys, Thierry Lahaye
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced Förster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.

Title: Mapping molecular polariton transport via pump-probe microscopy
Authors: Piper Fowler-Wright, Michael Reitz, Joel Yuen-Zhou
Abstract: We demonstrate how the transport properties of molecular polaritons in optical cavities can be extracted from a microscopic modeling of pump-probe spectroscopy. Our approach combines a mean-field treatment of the light-matter Hamiltonian with a perturbative expansion of both light and matter components, along with spatial coarse-graining. This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.
