Title: Some Peculiarities of Dielectric Spectroscopy in Ferroelectric Nematics
Authors: Yuri P. Panarin, Neelam Yadav, Rahul Uttam, Wanhe Jiang, Georg H. Mehl, Jagdish K. Vij
Abstract: Dielectric spectroscopy is known as one of the most powerful techniques for studying ferroelectric and other polar materials. Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in Liquid Crystals, it has been successfully employed for the characterization of ferro-, antiferro- and ferri-electric liquid crystalline phases. However, recently the Boulder group raised the question of the applicability of dielectric spectroscopy for characterizing ferroelectric nematics due to parasitic effects from the insulating alignment layers. This affects the apparent/measured values of the dielectric permittivity. In this paper, we study this effect in greater detail. The following issues will receive special attention: Are the real values of dielectric permittivity lower or higher than the measured ones? Can the real values of dielectric permittivity be recovered in the cell with alignment layers? We also provide an example of the effect of insulating alignment layers in a non-ferroelectric nematic phase.

Title: Indirect Tunneling Enabled Spontaneous Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking and Josephson Diode Effect in TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$/Hf$_{0.8}$Zr$_{0.2}$O$_2$/Nb tunnel junctions
Authors: Shaoqing Ding, Jinyuan Yao, Zhen Bi, Quyen Tran, Bangzhi Liu, Qi Li, Susan Trolier-McKinstry, Thomas N. Jackson, Ying Liu
Abstract: Josephson diode (JD) effect found in Josephson tunnel junctions (JTJs) has attracted a great deal of attention due to its importance for developing superconducting circuitry based quantum technologies. So far, the highly desirable electrical control of the JD effect has not been demonstrated in any JTJ prepared by techniques used in semiconductor industry. We report the fabrication of JTJs featuring a composite tunnel barrier of Al$_2$O$_3$ and Hf$_{\mathrm{0.8}}$Zr$_\mathrm{0.2}$O$_2$ prepared by complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD). These JTJs were found to show the JD effect in nominally zero magnetic fields with the nonreciprocity controllable using an electric training current, yielding a surprisingly large diode efficiency not achieved previously. The quasiparticle tunneling, through which the Josephson coupling in a JTJ is established, was found to show no nonreciprocity. We attribute these observations to the simultaneous presence of positive and negative Josephson couplings, with the latter originating from indirect tunneling. The resulted spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking and the double-minima washboard potential for the ensemble averaged phase difference in the resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model are shown to fully account for the experimentally observed JD effect.

Title: Fluxoid Valve Effect in Full-Shell Nanowire Josephson Junctions
Authors: Carlos Payá, F.J. Matute-Cañadas, A. Levy Yeyati, Ramón Aguado, Pablo San-Jose, Elsa Prada
Abstract: We introduce a new type of supercurrent valve based on full-shell nanowires. These hybrid wires consist of a semiconductor core fully wrapped in a thin superconductor shell and subjected to an axial magnetic field. Due to the tubular shape of the shell, the superconductor phase acquires an integer number $n$ of $2\pi$ twists or fluxoids that increases in steps with applied flux. By connecting two such hybrid wires, forming a Josephson junction (JJ), a flux-modulated supercurrent develops. If the two superconducting sections of the JJ have different radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, they can develop equal or different fluxoid numbers $n_1,n_2$ depending on the field. If $n_1\neq n_2$ the supercurrent is blocked, while it remains finite for $n_1=n_2$. This gives rise to a fluxoid valve effect controlled by the applied magnetic field. We define a fluxoid-valve quality factor that is perfect for cylindrically symmetric systems and decreases as this symmetry is reduced. We further discuss the role of Majorana zero modes at the junction when the full shell-nanowires are in topological superconducting regime.

Title: Bosonic vs. Fermionic Matter in Quantum Simulations of $2+1$D Gauge Theories
Authors: N. S. Srivatsa, Jesse J. Osborne, Debasish Banerjee, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: Quantum link models extend lattice gauge theories beyond the traditional Wilson formulation and present promising candidates for both digital and analog quantum simulations. Fermionic matter coupled to $U(1)$ quantum link gauge fields has been extensively studied, revealing a phase diagram that includes transitions from the columnar phase in the quantum dimer model to the resonating valence bond phase in the quantum link model, potentially passing through a disordered liquid-like phase. In this study, we investigate the model coupled to hardcore bosons and identify a similar phase structure, though with a more intricate mixture of phases around the transition. Our analysis reveals that near the transition region, a narrow and distinct ordered phase emerges, characterized by gauge fields forming plaquette configurations with alternating orientations, which is then followed by a thinner, liquid-like regime. This complexity primarily stems from the differences in particle statistics, which manifest prominently when the matter degrees of freedom become dynamic. Notably, our findings suggest that bosons can effectively replace fermions in lattice gauge theory simulations, offering solutions to the challenges posed by fermions in both digital and analog quantum simulations.

Title: 2D Anderson Localization and KPZ sub-Universality Classes : sensitivity to boundary conditions and insensitivity to symmetry classes
Authors: Nyayabanta Swain, Shaffique Adam, Gabriel Lemarié
Abstract: We challenge two foundational principles of localization physics by analyzing conductance fluctuations in two dimensions with unprecedented precision: (i) the Thouless criterion, which defines localization as insensitivity to boundary conditions, and (ii) that symmetry determines the universality class of Anderson localization. We reveal that the fluctuations of the conductance logarithm fall into distinct sub-universality classes inherited from Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) physics, dictated by the lead configurations of the scattering system and unaffected by the presence of a magnetic field. Distinguishing between these probability distributions poses a significant challenge due to their striking similarity, requiring sampling beyond the usual threshold of $\sim 10^{-6}$ accessible through independent disorder realizations. To overcome this, we implement an importance sampling scheme - a Monte Carlo approach in disorder space - that enables us to probe rare disorder configurations and sample probability distribution tails down to $10^{-30}$. This unprecedented precision allows us to unambiguously differentiate between KPZ sub-universality classes of conductance fluctuations for different lead configurations, while demonstrating the insensitivity to magnetic fields.

Title: Laughlin-like states of few atomic excitations in small subwavelength atom arrays
Authors: Błażej Jaworowski, Darrick E. Chang
Abstract: Atom arrays with sub-wavelength lattice constant can exhibit fascinating optical properties. Up to now, much of our understanding of these systems focuses on the single-excitation regime. In one relevant example, the combination of multiple excited states and magnetic fields can yield topological band structures, albeit with dispersion relations that can exhibit divergences near the light cone. Here, we go beyond the single-excitation level to show that such systems can give rise to few-particle Laughlin-like states. In particular, we consider small honeycomb ``flakes,'' where the divergences can be smeared out by finite-size effects. By choosing an appropriate value of magnetic field we thereby obtain an energy spectrum and eigenstates resembling those of Landau levels. The native hard-core nature of atomic excitations then gives rise to multi-excitation Laughlin-like states. This phenomenon occurs not only in samples of tens of sites, but also in a minimal nanoring system of only six sites. Next, considering two-particle Laughlin-like states, we show that they can be driven by uniform light, and that correlations of the output light contain identifying fingerprints of these states. We believe that these results are a step towards new paradigms of engineering and understanding strongly-correlated many-body states in atom-light interfaces.

Title: Density Functional Theory ToolKit (DFTTK) to Automate First-Principles Thermodynamics via the Quasiharmonic Approximation
Authors: Nigel Lee En Hew, Luke Allen Myers, Axel van de Walle, Shun-Li Shang, Zi-Kui Liu
Abstract: The Helmholtz energy is a key thermodynamic quantity representing available energy to do work at a constant temperature and volume. Despite a well-established methodology from first-principles calculations, a comprehensive tool and database are still lacking. To address this gap, we developed an open-source Density Functional Theory Tool Kit (DFTTK), which automates first-principles thermodynamics using the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA) for Helmholtz energy predictions. This Python-based package provides a solution for automating the calculation and analysis of various contributions to Helmholtz energy, including the static total energy contributions at 0 K in terms of DFT-based energy-volume curves, vibrational contributions from the Debye-Gruneisen model and phonons, and thermal electronic contributions via the electronic density of states. The QHA is also implemented to calculate the Gibbs energy and associated properties at constant temperature and pressure. The present work demonstrates DFTTK's capabilities through case studies on a simple FCC Al and various collinear magnetic configurations of Invar Fe3Pt, where DFTTK enumerates all unique configurations and their associated multiplicities. DFTTK is freely available on GitHub, and its modular design allows for the easy addition of new workflows.

Title: Type-II Weyl nodes, flat bands, and evidence for a topological Hall-effect in the new ferromagnet FeCr$_3$Te$_6$
Authors: Shyam Raj Karullithodi, Vadym Kulichenko, Mario A. Plata, Andrzej Ptok, Sang-Eon Lee, Gregory T. McCandless, Julia Y. Chan, Luis Balicas
Abstract: The interplay between linearly dispersing or Dirac-like, and flat electronic bands, for instance, in the kagome ferromagnets, has attracted attention due to a possible interplay between topology and electronic correlations. Here, we report the synthesis, structural, electrical, and magnetic properties of a single-crystalline ferromagnetic compound, namely Fe$_{1/3}$CrTe$_2$ or FeCr$_3$Te$_6$, which crystallizes in the $P\bar{3}m1$ space group instead of the $I2/m$ previously reported for FeCr$_2$Te$_4$. Electronic band structure calculations reveal type-II Dirac nodes and relatively flat bands near the Fermi level ($\varepsilon_F$). This compound shows onset Curie temperature $T_{\text{c}}\simeq 120$ K, followed by an additional ferromagnetic transition near $T_{\text{c2}} \sim 92.5 $ K. Below $T_{\text{c}}$, FeCr$_3$Te$_6$ displays a pronounced anomalous Hall effect, as well as sizable coercive fields that exceed $\mu_0H = 1$~T at low $T$s. However, a scaling analysis indicates that the anomalous Hall effect results from a significant intrinsic contribution, as expected from the calculations, but also from the extrinsic mechanism, i.e., scattering. The extrinsic contribution probably results from occupational disorder at the 1b Fe-site within the van der Waals gap of the CrTe$_2$ host. We also observe evidence for a topological Hall component superimposed onto the overall Hall response, suggesting the presence of chiral spin textures akin to skyrmions in this centrosymmetric system. Their possible presence will require experimental confirmation.

Title: Effects of chemical disorder and spin-orbit coupling on electronic-structure and Fermi-surface topology of YbSb-based monopnictides
Authors: Maxwell Eibert, Christopher Burgio, Tyler Del Rose, Prince Sharma, Yaroslav Mudryk, Prashant Singh
Abstract: In this work, we study the influence of disorder on the electronic structure of YbSb -- a rare-earth monopnictide featuring a simple rock-salt (B1) crystal structure and a well-defined Fermi surface topology -- by employing first-principles density functional theory (DFT). We focus on chemical disorder introduced through Te and Al doping, selected based on their thermodynamic stability in alloyed configurations, to understand how such perturbations modify the electronic states of YbSb. Our results indicate that Te doping predominantly introduces electron-like states at the \textit{X} and \textit{L} points, while Al doping leads to a suppression of hole-like states at $\Gamma$, effectively driving the system from a semimetallic state to one characterized by very narrow-gap behavior at $\Gamma$. This modulation of the Fermi surface, particularly the reduction of central hole pockets at $\Gamma$, plays a central role in altering inter-pocket scattering -- a mechanism critical for tuning quantum transport properties, including superconductivity. This disorder-driven modulation of the Fermi surface, particularly the suppression of central hole pockets at $\Gamma$, controls inter-pocket scattering, which is essential for optimizing quantum transport properties, including superconductivity. Our results show that disorder can be effectively used as a means of engineering band topology, thereby tuning quantum-related responses through tailored electronic structure.

Title: Magneto-Optical Analysis of Magnetic Anisotropy in Ultrathin Tm$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$/Pt Bilayers
Authors: T. Nathan Nunley, Daniel Russell, Liang-Juan Chang, David Lujan, Jeongheon Choe, Side Guo, Shang-Fan Lee, Fengyuan Yang, Xiaoqin Li
Abstract: Magnetic bilayers consisting of an epitaxially grown ferrimagnetic insulator and a heavy metal layer are attractive for spintronic application because of the opportunity for electric control and read-out of spin textures via spin orbit torque. Here, we investigate ultrathin thulium iron garnet (TmIG)/Pt bilayers when the TmIG layer thickness is 3 nm and below using a sensitive Sagnac magneto-optical Kerr effect technique. We compare the hysteresis loops from out-of-plane and in-plane applied magnetic fields. The preferred magnetization orientation evolves with the TmIG thickness and the presence of the Pt overlayer. We quantify the evolution of the magnetic anisotropy in these ultrathin films and find a significant change even when the TmIG thickness is varied by less than 1 nm. In these ultrathin films, the presence of a Pt overlayer changes the effective anisotropy field by more than a factor of 2, suggesting that the interfacial anisotropy at the Pt/TmIG interface plays a critical role in this regime.

Title: Lattice Dynamics of Energy Materials Investigated by Neutron Scattering
Authors: Tyler C. Sterling
Abstract: In this thesis, I discuss several basic science studies in the field of energy materials using neutron scattering as a probe for the lattice dynamics. To enable understanding of neutron scattering spectra, I also use computational and theoretical methods. These methods and neutron scattering in general are discussed in detail in Chapter 2. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with basic quantum mechanics as well as with solid state physics topics including the band theory of electrons, harmonic lattice dynamics, and molecular dynamics. For the unfamiliar reader, the details of electronic structure theory and lattice dynamics that are needed to understand the methods in Chapter 2 are provided in Chapters 3 and 4. In the remaining chapters, these methods are applied to the study of several energy materials: cuprate La2CuO4,(hybrid) solar perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, and thermoelectric clathrate Ba8Ga16Ge30.

Title: Semimetals without correspondence between the topological charge of nodal line/surface and Fermi arc
Authors: Xue-Min Yang, Jiang-Shan Chen, Ying Chen, Yu-Hang Qin, Hong Wu
Abstract: It is generally believed that there is a correspondence between the topological charge of nodal points or lines and the presence of Fermi arcs. Using a $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-invariant system as an example, we demonstrate that this general belief is no longer valid. When two charged nodal lines or surfaces touch, the topological charge {dissipates without gap opening}, yet the surfaces or hinge Fermi arcs can remain preserved. It is found that both static and Floquet semimetals can exhibit Fermi arcs, even when the nodal lines or surfaces do not carry a $Z_2$ charge from second Stiefel-Whitney class.

Title: Ordered and Disordered Skyrmion States on a Square Substrate
Authors: J. C. Bellizotti Souza, C. J. O. Reichhardt, C. Reichhardt, N. P. Vizarim, P. A. Venegas
Abstract: We examine the ordering of skyrmions interacting with a square substrate created from a modulation of anisotropy using atomistic simulations. We consider fillings of {\it f} = 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 skyrmions per potential minimum as a function of magnetic field and sample size. For a filling of {\it f} = 2.0, we find various dimer orderings, such as tilted dimer states, as well as antiferromagnetic ordering that is similar to the colloidal dimer ordering seen on square substrates. The ability of the skyrmions to change shape or annihilate produces additional states that do not occur in the colloidal systems. For certain parameters at {\it f} = 2.0, half of the skyrmions can annihilate to form a square lattice, or a superlattice of trimers and monomers containing skyrmions of different sizes can form. At lower fields, ordered stretched skyrmion states can appear, and for zero field, there can be ordered stripe states. For {\it f} = 3.0, we find ferromagnetic ordered trimers, tilted lattices, columnar lattices, and stretched phases. For fillings of {\it f} = 1.5 and 2.5, we find bipartite lattices, different ordered and disordered states, and several extended disordered regions produced by frustration effects.

Title: Inference of phase field fracture models
Authors: Elizabeth Livingston, Siddhartha Srivastava, Jamie Holber, Hashem M. Mourad, Krishna Garikipati
Abstract: The phase field approach to modeling fracture uses a diffuse damage field to represent a crack. This addresses the singularities that arise at the crack tip in computations with sharp interface models, mollifying some of the difficulties associated with the mathematical and numerical treatment of fracture. The introduction of the diffuse field helps with crack propagation dynamics, enabling phase-field approaches to model all phases of damage from crack initiation to propagation, branching, and merging. Specific formulations, beginning with brittle fracture, have also been shown to converge to classical solutions. Extensions to cover the range of material failure, including ductile and cohesive fracture, leads to an array of possible models. There exists a large body of studies of these models and their consequences for crack evolution. However, there have not been systematic studies into how optimal models may be chosen. Here we take a first step in this direction by developing formal methods for identification of the best parsimonious model of phase field fracture given full-field data on the damage and deformation fields. We consider some of the main models that have been used to model damage, its degradation of elastic response, and its propagation. Our approach builds upon Variational System Identification (VSI), a weak form variant of the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In this first communication we focus on synthetically generated data but we also consider central issues associated with the use of experimental full-field data, such as data sparsity and noise.

Title: Weyl nodes and Kondo interaction in noncentrosymmetric semimetals RGaGe (R=La, Ce and Pr) with long Fermi arcs
Authors: Huan Li
Abstract: In non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals based on rare-earth compounds, the correlation effects among $f$ electrons may play a crucial role in shaping the properties of Weyl nodes, potentially giving rise to magnetic Weyl semimetals or correlated Weyl excitations. Here, we investigates a recently identified class of magnetic rare-earth Weyl semimetals, RGaGe (R = La, Ce, and Pr). By employing a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations, we demonstrate that under ambient pressure, the $f$ electrons in CeGaGe and PrGaGe are nearly fully localized. Concurrently, three inequivalent types of Weyl nodes emerge near the Fermi level due to intersections between $spd$ bands. Notably, one type of Weyl point exhibits substantial chiral separation (significantly greater than in CeAlSi and CeAlGe), leading to the formation of long and well-defined surface Fermi arcs on the (001) surface. These Fermi arcs remain well-separated by bulk states, thereby facilitating future experimental observations. In contrast, the chiral separation of Weyl points in LaGaGe is relatively modest. Upon application of volume compression, the $f$ electrons in CeGaGe progressively become itinerant and begin to obscure the Weyl nodes formed by $spd$ electrons, rendering them less accessible for direct observation. These findings suggest that in correlated materials, particularly $f$-electron systems, even when $f$ electrons do not directly contribute to the formation of topological nodes, they can still exert a profound influence on the characteristics of Weyl nodes.

Title: Hyperuniform Mixing of Binary Active Spinners
Authors: Rui Liu, Mingcheng Yang, Ke Chen
Abstract: Spinner mixtures consisting of both clockwise and counterclockwise self-spinning particles are often expected to phase separate. However, we demonstrate that such a demixing is absent for dimer (or rod-like) spinners. These particles always mix, even in a globally-hyperuniform way, with the total structure factor $S(q\to 0)\sim q^{\alpha}\,(\alpha>0)$. This global hyperuniformity can be enhanced or weakened by changes in the driving torques or the particle density in various ways. The corresponding microscopic mechanism is attributed to the competition between a dynamical heterocoordination effect and effective like-particle attractions. Critical scaling for the absorbing state transition of the system is also found to persist, with a significant shift in its critical point observed. The system can be further thermalized, by the driving torques or through thermostating, into an ideal solution with identical partial radial distribution functions, which denys the possibility of being multi-hyperuniform. A simply-extented coupled density-oscillator theory explains why the system can not be multi-hyperuniform, but can have a global hyperuniformity with the scaling exponent $\alpha$ approaching $2$. Such a hyperuniform mixing provides a way to regulate the topological boundary flows of this chiral system, and this mixing regulation is found to barely affect the bulk density fluctuations and even preserve the localization of the flows and the bulk hyperuniformity.

Title: Quantum geometry and elliptic optical dichroism in $p$-wave magnets
Authors: Motohiko Ezawa
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor is composed of the Berry curvature and the quantum metric, which is observable by means of optical absorption of elliptically polarized light. Especially, the quantum geometric tensor at the zero-momentum is observable by the optical absorption at the optical band edge. In this context, we study optical absorption of a $p$-wave magnet under irradiation of elliptically polarized light. The $p$-wave magnet has a band splitting along one axis, which we choose the $x$ axis. We obtain analytic formulae for the optical conductivity up to the second order in the magnitude of the Néel vector. In particular, the optical conductivity is exactly obtained when the Néel is along the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axis. It shows strong ellipticity a dependence of the light polarization, which is an elliptic dichroism. Especially, there is a perfect elliptic optical dichroism when the Néel vector is along the $y$ axis. It is possible to determine the Néel vector by measuring the ellipticity of the perfect elliptic dichroism.

Title: Dual role of stripe phase on superconducting correlation in a bilayer square lattice
Authors: Ting Guo, Lufeng Zhang, Tianxing Ma, Hai-Qing Lin
Abstract: While the stripe phase has been observed not only in monolayer cuprates but also in bilayer cuprates, research on its behavior in bilayer cuprates has been limited. Using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo, we explore the effect of stripes on the bilayer square lattice. We find the system exhibits short-range antiferromagnetism, which is enhanced by stripes and is strongest when the electron density of the interstriped rows reaches half-filling. The hole doping concentration plays a crucial role in the interaction between stripes and superconductivity. The $d$-wave pairing is enhanced by stripe potential $V_0$ at the hole doping $\delta_h=1/4$, whereas it is suppressed by stripe potential $V_0$ at the hole doping $\delta_h=1/8$. We elucidate this phenomenon through an analysis of the magnetism of the interstriped rows. Furthermore, the effective $d$-wave pairing is stronger in the bilayer model compared to the monolayer model when stripes are introduced on the square lattice. Overall, our unbiased numerical simulations provide a further understanding of the crossed bilayer square lattice model.

Title: Magnetic-field oscillations of the critical temperature in ultraclean, two-dimensional Type-I superconductor
Authors: Aiying Zhao, Richard A Klemm, Qiang Gu
Abstract: We investigate the influence of Landau Levels (LLs) and Zeeman energy, induced by an applied magnetic field ${\bf B}$, on the critical temperature $T_c$ for two-dimensional (2D) ultraclean metals using a fully quantum mechanical approach within the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. In contrast to standard BCS theory, it allows for Cooper pair formation between electrons with opposite spins and momenta along the ${\bf B}$ direction, both on the same or on neighboring LLs. Our quantum mechanical treatment of LLs reveals that $T_c({\bf B})$ for electrons paired on the same LLs exhibits oscillations around the BCS critical temperature at lower magnetic fields, a phenomenon analogous to the de Haas-van Alphen effect. The Zeeman energy leads to a decrease in $T_c({\bf B})$ with increasing ${\bf B}$ for electrons paired both on the same and on neighboring LLs. Notably, as the $g$-factor increases, the amplitude of the ${\bf B}$ oscillations gradually diminishes until they vanish at higher magnetic fields. Conversely, for small $g$-factors, electron pairing on the same or on neighboring LLs can result in a re-entrant superconducting phase at very high magnetic fields.

Title: Anisotropy-induced collapse of Landau levels in Weyl semimetals and its detection via the planar Hall effect
Authors: Fu-Yang Chen, Zhuo-Hua Chen, Hou-Jian Duan, Mou Yang, Rui-Qiang Wang, Ming-Xun Deng
Abstract: The planar Hall effect (PHE) is a powerful tool for characterizing Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Here, we inves- tigate the PHE in general anisotropic WSMs under strong magnetic fields. We analytically derive the Landau levels (LLs) and their wavefunctions using the Bogoliubov transformation, where the tilt vector, anisotropic axis of the Fermi velocity, and the magnetic field can be oriented in arbitrary directions. Notably, due to the interaction with the magnetic field and the anisotropy of the Fermi velocity, the component of the tilt vector perpendicular to the magnetic field can induce a tilt in the LLs parallel to the magnetic field. Our analytical re- sults show that the LLs do not collapse in type-I WSMs but must collapse in type-II WSMs when the magnetic field is vertical to the tilt vector. More importantly, we demonstrate that the magnetotransport signal of the LL collapse, which manifests as significant enhancement and quantum oscillations in the longitudinal and planar Hall conductivities simultaneously, can be used to identify the phase transition from type-I to type-II WSMs.

Title: Broad-temperature-range ultrafast terahertz excitation of collective dynamics in polar skyrmions
Authors: Wei Li, Sixu Wang, Pai Peng, Haojie Han, Xinbo Wang, Jing Ma, Jianlin Luo, Jun-Ming Liu, Jing-Feng Li, Ce-Wen Nan, Qian Li
Abstract: Ultrafast coherent control of electric dipoles using strong terahertz (THz) pulses provides a means to discover hidden phases of materials and potentially leads to applications in high-speed electro-optic devices. The effectiveness of this means, albeit demonstrated in architype (incipient) ferroelectric systems such as SrTiO3, hinges on a spectral overlapping between their soft phonon modes within the excitation bandwidth of THz pulses. Generally this can only induce an appreciable coupling close to the phase transition temperatures, where the lattice phonons substantially soften. Because of their emergent subterahertz collective dynamics, a fundamentally distinct and effective THz coupling mechanism can be envisaged in topological polar structures recently discovered in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices. Here, we show that polar skyrmions can be coherently driven into a hidden phase with transient macroscopic polarization, as probed based on THz field-induced second harmonic generation and optical Kerr effects. Such an ultrafast THz-driven phase transition is found to sustain across a broad temperature range of 4-470 K, in accordance with the equilibrium stability field of the skyrmions. Supplemented by dynamical phase-field simulations, we identify the spatial symmetries and relaxation behaviors of the excited collective modes, thereby revealing their correlation with the emergence of the polar phases. Our results unveil the exotic dynamical properties of topological polar structures, which could be technologically exploited given their remarkable flexibility in structure design and tunability under external fields.

Title: Synchronized in-gap edge states and robust copropagation in topological insulators without magnetic flux
Authors: Liangcai Xie, Tianyi He, Liang Jin
Abstract: Copropagation of antichiral edge states in the metallic phase requires the bulk states as counterpropagating modes. Without the band gap protection, the copropagation along the boundaries is easily scattered into the bulk and the counterpropagation in the bulk is not robust against disorder and defects. Here, we propose a novel time-reversal symmetric topological insulator holding the synchronized in-gap edge states. To prevent the participation of bulk states, we introduce the time-reversal symmetry to detach the edge states from the bulk band, then the robust copropagation is realized through widening the band gap across a metal-insulator transition with anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor couplings. The time-reversal symmetry ensures the in-gap edge states with opposite momenta as the counterpropagating modes. The inversion symmetry protects the quantized polarization as a topological invariant. The synchronized in-gap edge states not only enrich the family of topological edge states, but also provide additional flexibility in the design of reconfigurable topological optical devices. Our findings open a new avenue for the tailored robust wave transport using the in-gap edge states for future acousto-optic topological metamaterials.

Title: Polydisperse polymer networks with irregular topologies
Authors: Jason Mulderrig, Michael Buche, Matthew Grasinger
Abstract: The structure of polymer networks, defined by chain lengths and connectivity patterns, fundamentally influences their bulk properties. Despite decades of research, many open questions remain regarding structure-property relationships, particularly in heterogeneous networks. While existing polymer network models connect chain properties to emergent network behavior, they are often limited to monodisperse networks with regular connectivities, making the extension to heterogeneous systems an active area of research. In this work, we introduce a novel modeling framework that shifts the focus from individual polymer chains to cross-links and their connected chains as the fundamental unit of analysis. This perspective enables direct incorporation of structural heterogeneity by averaging over cross-links with different chain lengths and coordination numbers. We establish important connections between polymerization theory and statistical descriptors of network structure, providing key components of a theoretical foundation for predicting properties from the synthesis parameters. Our results demonstrate that increased variance in monomer numbers generally leads to network softening, while in bimodal networks, the onset of strain stiffening is controlled by shorter chains and the stiffening response is modulated by the ratio of short to long chains. By deriving closed-form approximations valid in both the limits of (1) small deformation and (2) finite deformation but with small polydispersity, we offer an efficient computational approach to modeling complex networks. This framework represents an advance toward the rational modeling and design of heterogeneous polymer networks with structures tailored for specific properties.

Title: Rapid and Scalable Synthesis of Alkali Metal-Intercalated C$_{60}$ Superconductors
Authors: Akira Iyo, Hiroshi Fujihisa, Yoshito Gotoh, Shigeyuki Ishida, Hiroshi Eisaki, Hiraku Ogino, Kenji Kawashima
Abstract: Alkali metal-intercalated C$_{60}$, $A_3$$C_{60}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs, and their combinations), holds significant potential for practical applications due to its high superconducting transition temperature (33 K), high upper critical field (900 kOe), and isotropic superconductivity. However, application-oriented research has been limited by the lack of an efficient $A_3$$C_{60}$ synthesis process. In this study, we demonstrate a rapid and scalable synthesis of $A_3$$C_{60}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs$_{1/3}$Rb$_{2/3}$) via direct mixing of $A$ and C$_{60}$, realizing the fabrication of high-quality sintered $A_3$$C_{60}$ pellets within just 1 hour of heating at 200-300°C. The pellets exhibited large superconducting shielding volume fractions with sharp transitions, and the relationship between the lattice constant and transition temperature was in good agreement with previous reports. This direct mixing method enables simple and rapid production of large quantities of $A_3$$C_{60}$, which is expected to accelerate research into applications such as superconducting wires and bulk magnets.

Title: Hilbert Transform Technique for Analyzing Mode I Crack Growth in an Pre- Stressed Monoclinic Crystalline Strip Under Punch Pressure
Authors: Diksha, Soniya Chaudhary, Pawan Kumar Sharma
Abstract: The crux of the present study is to analyze the Mode I crack propagation behavior in a pre-stressed monoclinic crystalline strip of finite thickness and infinite extent. The investigation focuses on the effects of collinear Griffith cracks and dynamic punch loading induced by plane wave propagation. The cracks are assumed to be in motion, and a Galilean transformation is employed to formulate the problem within a moving coordinate system. The boundary value problem is transformed into a system of coupled Cauchy-type singular integral equations, which are solved analytically using the Hilbert transform method. This approach yields elegant closed-form solutions for both the stress intensity factor and the crack opening displacement. The study considers two monoclinic crystalline materials, Lithium Niobate and Lithium Tantalate, and compares their behavior with that of an isotropic material to assess the role of material anisotropy. Numerical simulations and graphical analysis are performed for the crystalline materials with monoclinic symmetry to evaluate the influence of crack velocity, punch loading, material anisotropy, initial stress, and crack geometry on the fracture parameters. As a special case, the system is analyzed under the action of point loading from the punch pressure, and a comparative assessment is conducted between point loading and constant normal punch pressure. The results unveil critical insights into the dynamic fracture behavior of anisotropic materials under localized loading. This understanding enhances failure prediction in high-precision fields such as geomechanics, MEMS, surface acoustic devices, and biosensors.

Title: Thermally quenched metastable phase in the Ising model with competing interactions
Authors: Hiroshi Oike, Hidemaro Suwa, Yasunori Takahashi, Fumitaka Kagawa
Abstract: Thermal quenching has been used to find metastable materials such as hard steels and metallic glasses. More recently, quenching-based phase control has been applied to correlated electron systems that exhibit metal--insulator, magnetic or superconducting transitions. Despite the discovery of metastable electronic phases, however, how metastability is achieved through the degrees of freedom, which can vary even at low temperatures such as those of an electron, is unclear. Here, we show a thermally quenched metastable phase in the Ising model without conservation of magnetization by Monte Carlo simulations. When multiple types of interactions that stabilize different long-range orders are introduced, the ordering kinetics divergently slow toward low temperatures, meaning that the system will reach a low temperature without ordering if the cooling rate is high enough. Quantitative analysis of the divergent behavior suggests that the energy barrier for eliminating the local structure of competing orders is the origin of this metastability. Thus, the present simulations show that competing interactions play a key role in realizing metastability.

Title: Scalable Parallel Single-Electron Pumps in Silicon with Split-Source Control in the Nanoampere Regime
Authors: Gento Yamahata, Takase Shimizu, Katsuhiko Nishiguchi, Akira Fujiwara
Abstract: Parallelizing single-electron pumps offers a promising route to achieving nanoampere-level currents crucial for quantum current standard applications. Achieving such current levels is essential for demonstrating the ultra-high accuracy of single-electron pumps below 0.1 ppm toward quantum metrology triangle experiments. In addition, improving the accuracy at this current range is also desirable for practical small-current measurements. However, nanoampere-level currents have not yet been achieved with parallel pumps, mainly due to challenges in optimizing operating conditions. Here, we propose a scalable and easily implementable parallelization method based on tunable-barrier single-electron pumps with split source electrodes. By tuning the source voltages, we successfully parallelize four single-electron pumps at 200 MHz and further demonstrate a current plateau exceeding 2 nA using three pumps at 2.1 GHz. The wide applicability of this parallelization technique opens a path toward advancing high-accuracy quantum current standards.

Title: Observation of the Einstein-de Haas Effect in a Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Hiroki Matsui, Yuki Miyazawa, Ryoto Goto, Chihiro Nakano, Yuki Kawaguchi, Masahito Ueda, Mikio Kozuma
Abstract: The Einstein-de Haas effect is a phenomenon in which angular momentum is transferred from microscopic spins to mechanical rotation of a rigid body. Here, we report the first observation of the Einstein-de Haas effect in a spinor-dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate where quantized vortices emerge in depolarized spinor components through coherent angular-momentum transfer from microscopic atomic spins to macroscopic quantized circulation. Experimental results clearly show that the spherical symmetry of the condensate is dynamically broken into the axisymmetry by an intrinsic magnetic dipole-dipole interaction.

Title: Light-driven lattice metastability for enhanced superconductivity in FeSe/SrTiO3
Authors: Qiang Zou, Zhan Su, Andres Tellez Mora, Na Wu, Joseph Benigno, Christopher L. Jacobs, Aldo H. Romero, Subhasish Mandal, Yaxian Wang, Sheng Meng, Michael Weinert, Hua Zhou, Lian Li, Cheng Cen
Abstract: Driven quantum materials with on demand properties controlled by external stimuli are critical for emergent quantum technology. In optically tunable superconducting heterostructures, the lattice responses at the buried interface may hold the key to the light susceptibility but is very challenging to detect. In this work, a nondestructive synchrotron-based X-ray scattering phase-retrieval technique is implemented in monolayer-FeSe/SrTiO3 heterostructures to capture the three-dimensional interfacial atomic displacements in-situ as the interface superconductivity is actively manipulated by light. It is found that the interlayer sliding between FeSe and SrTiO3 can drastically alter how the lattice responds to the light. In domains with selected stacking configurations, the interface transforms the very weak photoexcitation in SrTiO3 into significant Fe-atom displacements in FeSe and generate metastable interfacial structures that can lead to a persistent superconductivity enhancement. These findings demonstrate an effective strategy for achieving greatly amplified light-lattice coupling for efficient quantum phase manipulations at designed interfaces.

Title: A local quantized marker for topological magnons from circular dichroism
Authors: Baptiste Bermond, Anaïs Defossez, Nathan Goldman
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of a spin system can display Bloch bands with non-trivial topological properties. While topological magnons can be identified through the detection of chiral propagating modes at the sample's edge, an intriguing approach would be to directly probe their topological nature via localized measurements deep within the bulk. In this work, we introduce a quantized topological marker suitable for topological spin systems, which can be experimentally accessed by combining a local driven-dissipative preparation scheme with a circular-dichroic measurement. Demonstrated on a 2D ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin system incorporating Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this method effectively maps a local Chern marker with single-site resolution while inherently accounting for magnon losses. Our work offers a general strategy to access local topological markers in bosonic settings within a driven-dissipative framework.

Title: NMR chemical shielding for solid-state systems using spin-orbit coupled ZORA GIPAW
Authors: T. Speelman, M.-T. Huebsch, R.W.A. Havenith, M. Marsman, G.A. de Wijs
Abstract: We present an implementation of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for the computation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shielding tensors within linear response theory. Our implementation in the Vienna {\it Ab initio} Simulation Package (VASP) is tailored to solid-state systems by employing periodic boundary conditions and the gauge-including projector augmented waves (GIPAW) approach. Relativistic effects are included on the level of the zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA). We discuss the challenges posed by the PAW partial wave basis in describing SOC regarding chemical shielding tensors. Our method is in good agreement with existing local-basis ZORA implementations for a series of Sn, Hg, and Pb molecules and cluster approximations for crystalline systems.

Title: Structural design and multiple magnetic orderings of the intergrowth compound Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$
Authors: Xiyu Chen, Ziwen Wang, Wuzhang Yang, Jia-Yi Lu, Zhiyu Zhou, Zhi Ren, Guang-Han Cao, Shuai Dong, Zhi-Cheng Wang
Abstract: We report the design, synthesis, crystal structure, and physical properties of a layered intergrowth compound, Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$. The structure of Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$ features an alternating arrangement of hexagonal EuCuP block layers and trigonal EuMn$_2$P$_2$ block layers, interconnected through shared Eu planes. This structural hybridization leads to multiple magnetic orderings in Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$: weak antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Mn at $T_\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{Mn}$ = 80 K, AFM ordering of Eu at $T_\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{Eu}$ = 29 K, a spin-reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ = 14.5 K, and weak ferromagnetism below $T_\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{Mn}$. The spin configurations at different temperature regions were discussed based on the calculations of magnetic energies for various collinear arrangements. Resistivity measurements reveal a pronounced transition peak at $T_\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{Eu}$, which is suppressed in the presence of a magnetic field, resulting in a significant negative magnetoresistance effect. The computed semimetallic band structure, characterized by a small density of states at the Fermi level, aligns well with experimental observations. The successful synthesis of Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$ and its fascinating magnetic properties highlight the effectiveness of our block-layer design strategy. By assembling magnetic block layers of compounds with compatible crystal symmetries and closely matched lattice parameters, this approach opens exciting avenues for discovering layered materials with unique magnetic behaviors.

Title: Emergence of the logarithmic average phonon frequency in the superconducting critical temperature formula
Authors: Nattawut Natkunlaphat, Pakin Tasee, Udomsilp Pinsook
Abstract: We analytically demonstrate the essential role of the logarithmic average phonon frequency in describing the superconducting critical temperature, directly from a predictive function. The current study assumes that the Eliashberg spectral function follows the Debye model in the low frequency spectrum, whereas contributions from optical phonons dominate outside this range. Our findings confirm that, under a specific condition, we obtained a formula for superconducting transition temperature. Furthermore, we compared our formula with the Allen-Dynes formula and its modified version, and the exact solutions. They reveal notable correlations.

Title: Optimizing thermoelectric performance of graphene antidot lattices via quantum transport and machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: Yang Xiao, Yuqi Liu, Zihan Tan Bohan Zhang, Ke Xu, Zheyong Fan, Shunda Chen, Shiyun Xiong, Haikuan Dong
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials, which can convert waste heat to electricity or be utilized as solid-state coolers, hold promise for sustainable energy applications. However, optimizing thermoelectric performance remains a significant challenge due to the complex interplay between electronic and thermal transport properties. In this work, we systematically optimize $ZT$ in graphene antidot lattices (GALs), nanostructured graphene sheets with periodic nanopores characterized by two geometric parameters: the hexagonal unit cell side length $L$ and the antidot radius $R$. The lattice thermal conductivity is determined through machine-learned potential-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, while electronic transport properties are computed using linear-scaling quantum transport in combination with MD trajectories based on a bond-length-dependent tight-binding model. This method is able to account for electron-phonon scattering, allowing access to diffusive transport in large-scale systems, overcoming limitations of previous methods based on nonequilibrium Green function formalism. Our results show that the introduction of the antidots effectively decouples lattice and electronic transport and lead to a favorable and significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. We find that optimal $ZT$ values occur in GALs with intermediate $L$ and $R$, closely correlated with peak power factor values. Notably, thermoelectric performance peaks near room temperature, with maximal $ZT$ values approaching 2, highlighting GALs as promising candidates for high-performance thermoelectric energy conversion.

Title: The need for statistical physics in Africa: perspective and an illustration in drug delivery problems
Authors: Mtabazi G. Sahini, Isaac Onoka, Said A.H. Vuai, Édgar Roldán, Hulda S. Swai, Daniel M. Shadrack
Abstract: The development of statistical physics in Africa is in its nascent stages, yet its application holds immense promise for advancing emerging research trends on the continent. This perspective paper, a product of a two-week workshop on biophysics in Morogoro (Tanzania), aims to illuminate the potential of statistical physics in regional scientific research. We employ in-silico atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the loading and delivery capabilities of lecithin nanolipids for niclosamide, a poorly water-soluble drug. Our simulations reveal that the loading capacity and interaction strength between lecithin nanolipids and niclosamide improve with increased lecithin concentrations. We perform a free-energy landscape analysis which uncovers two distinct metastable conformations of niclosamide within both the aqueous phase and the lecithin nanolipids. Over a simulation period of half a microsecond, lecithin nanolipids self-assemble into a spherical monolayer structure, providing detailed atomic-level insights into their interactions with niclosamide. These findings underscore the potential of lecithin nanolipids as efficient drug delivery systems.

Title: Consistency between the Green-Kubo formula and Lorentz model for predicting the infrared dielectric function of polar materials
Authors: Wei-Zhe Yuan, Yangyu Guo, Hong-Liang Yi
Abstract: Accurate prediction of infrared dielectric functions in polar materials is fundamental for thermal and photonic applications, yet it remains unexplored whether the two main methods, Green-Kubo formula and Lorentz model, can give unified predictions. In this work, we present a detailed comparison of these two approaches using MgO and LiH as prototypical cases employing both empirical rigid ion model (RIM) and machine learning potential (MLP). We demonstrate that the conventional Lorentz model fails to capture the multi-phonon absorption inherent in Green-Kubo method, which can be resolved via using the phonon self-energy as a generalization of the usual linewidth. In addition, with RIM, a correction factor is required in the ionic contribution to infrared response to account for the electronic polarization effect, which is yet captured by MLP using the Born effective charges for calculating dipole moment. The present benchmark study thus enables cross-validation of dielectric function calculations while providing mechanistic insights into the polarization dynamics.

Title: Magnetically disordered ground state in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnets Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$ and Cs$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$
Authors: Zhen Ma, Yingqi Chen, Zhongtuo Fu, Shuaiwei Li, Xin-An Tong, Hong Du, Jan Peter Embs, Shuhan Zheng, Yongjun Zhang, Meifeng Liu, Ruidan Zhong, Jun-Ming Liu, Jinsheng Wen
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids~(QSLs) represent a unique quantum disordered state of matter that hosts long-range quantum entanglement and fractional excitations. However, structural disorder resulting from site mixing between different types of ions usually arises in real QSL candidates, which is considered as an obstacle to gain the insight into the intrinsic physics. Here, we have synthesized two new rare-earth compounds Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$ and Cs$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$. X-ray diffractions reveal a perfect triangular-lattice structure with no detectable disorder. Magnetic susceptibility measurements do not capture any phase transition or spin freezing down to 1.8~K. A fit to low-temperature data indicates dominant antiferromagnetic interactions with the Curie-Weiss temperature of -1.40~K and -0.43~K for Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$ and Cs$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$, respectively. Specific heat results show no sign of long-range magnetic order down to $\sim$0.1~K either, but only a Schottky anomaly that is continuously mediated by the external magnetic fields. Additionally, inelastic neutron scattering is employed to detect low-energy spin excitations in Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$. The absence of magnetic excitation signals as well as static magnetic order down to 97~mK aligns with the results from magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Collectively, these findings point to a quantum disordered ground state with persistent spin dynamics, reminiscent of QSL behaviors. Our work provides a promising platform for further exploration of quantum magnetism in this new disorder-free system.

Abstract: This research delves into the synthesis and characterization of novel liquid crystal compounds derived from benzo[b]Ithiophene cores, focusing on their potential applications in microwave technology. Two synthetic strategies were developed to construct rigid cores, resulting in the successful synthesis of ten compounds with varied terminal groups and lateral substituents. Correlations between molecular structure and mesomorphic properties were elucidated through extensive comparative analysis. Birefringence measurements and quantum chemical calculations further provided insights into the optical properties and polarizability anisotropy of the synthesized compounds. The results highlight the influence of structural diversity on the compounds' suitability for microwave applications. Specifically, compounds featuring carbon-carbon triple bonds and polar terminal groups demonstrated enhanced birefringence and polarizability values, indicating their potential in microwave device fabrication. This study underscores the importance of molecular design in optimizing liquid crystal materials for advanced technological applications.

Title: Surface morphology and thickness variation estimation of zeolites via electron ptychography
Authors: Enci Zhang, Zhuoya Dong, Xubin Han, Jianhua Zhang, Yanhang Ma, Huaidong Jiang
Abstract: Zeolites, as representative porous materials, possess intricate three-dimensional frameworks that endow them with high surface areas and remarkable catalytic properties. There are a few factors that give a huge influence on the catalytic properties, including the size and connectivity of these three-dimensional channels and atomic level defects. In additional to that, the surface morphology and thickness variation of zeolites particles are essential to their catalytic performances as well. However, it is a significant challenge to characterize these macroscopic properties of zeolites using conventional techniques due to their sensitivity to electron beams. In this study, we introduce surface-adaptive electron ptychography, an advanced approach based on multi-slice electron ptychography, which enables high-precision reconstruction of both local atomic configurations and global structural features in zeolite nanoparticles. By adaptively optimizing probe defocus and slice thickness during the reconstruction process, SAEP successfully resolves surface morphology, thickness variations and atomic structure simultaneously. This integrated framework facilitates a direct and intuitive correlation between zeolite channel structures and particle thickness. Our findings open new pathways for large-scale, comprehensive structure property analysis of beam-sensitive porous materials, deepening the understanding of their catalytic behavior.

Title: Current phase relation in a planar graphene Josephson junction with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Federico Bonasera, Giuseppe A. Falci, Elisabetta Paladino, Francesco M.D. Pellegrino
Abstract: We study a graphene Josephson junction where the inner graphene layer is subjected to spin-orbit coupling by proximity effect. This could be achieved, for example, by growing the graphene layer on top of a transition metal dichalcogenide, such as WS$_2$. Here, we focus on the ballistic, wide, and short junction limits and study the effects of the spin-orbit interaction on the supercurrent. In particular, we analyze the current phase relation using an analytical approach based on the continuum model. We find combinations of types of spin-orbit coupling that significantly suppress the supercurrent by opening a gap in the graphene band structure. At the same time, other combinations enhance it, acting as an effective spin-valley resolved chemical potential. Moreover, we find that a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling leads to a junction with a highly voltage tunable harmonic content.

Title: Permeation and thermal desorption model of hydrogen in steel: a sensitivity analysis
Authors: Paolo Emilio Di Nunzio
Abstract: This work presents a fully physical model of the hydrogen diffusion and trapping kinetics in metals, integrating permeation and thermal desorption within a unified framework. Based on the McNabb and Foster approach, it requires only binding energy and number density of trap sites. It correctly reproduces the physics of the system and the results of the analytical solutions of the permeation kinetics. It is also capable of reproducing thermal desorption spectra with considerable accuracy. The sensitivity analysis has elucidated the relationships among the processing conditions and the parameters commonly used to characterize permeation and thermal desorption experiments. An equation empirically derived from the simulation results, expressing the dependence of time lag in desorption on specimen thickness, number density of occupied trap sites, and cathodic concentration, is proposed. In summary, the model represents a valuable tool in supporting the interpretation and rationalization of experiments also from a quantitative viewpoint.

Title: Quasi-particle residue and charge of the one-dimensional Fermi polaron
Authors: Giuliano Orso, Lovro Barišić, Ekaterina Gradova, Frédéric Chevy, Kris Van Houcke
Abstract: We consider a mobile impurity coupled to an ideal Fermi gas in one spatial dimension through an attractive contact interaction. We calculate the quasi-particle residue $Z$ exactly, based on Bethe Ansatz and diagrammatic Monte Carlo methods, and with varational Ansatz up to one particle-hole excitation of the Fermi sea. We find that the exact quasi-particle residue vanishes in the thermodynamic limit as a power law in the number of particles, consistent with the Luttinger-liquid paradigm and the breakdown of Fermi-liquid theory. The variational Ansatz, however, predicts a finite value of $Z$, even in the thermodynamic limit. We also study how the presence of the impurity affects the density of the spin-up sea by calculating the pair correlation function. Subtracting the homogeneous background and integrating over all distances gives the charge $Q$. This charge turns out to grow continuously from 0 at zero coupling to 1 in the strong-coupling limit. The varational Ansatz predicts $Q=0$ at all couplings. So, although the variational Ansatz has been shown to be remarkably accurate for the energy and the effective mass, it fails even qualitatively when predicting $Z$ and the pair correlation function in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: THz Emission from Spintronic Microstructure
Authors: Abbas Ghaffari, Malek Abdelsamei, Puja Thapa, Seiji Mita, Ramón Collazo, Kenan Gundogdu, Dali Sun, Qing Gu
Abstract: Recent advancements in spintronics have opened a new avenue in terahertz (THz) radiation sources that may outperform the traditional contact-based metallic counterparts. Inspired by the generation of broadband spintronic THz signals at the interface of a ferromagnet and ultrawide bandgap semiconductors, here we investigated the generation of THz radiation from micro-structured heterostructures of a metallic ferromagnet (Ni80Fe20) and an ultrawide bandgap semiconductor (AlGaN/GaN) that contains a layer of 2D electron gas. By precisely tailoring the dimension of the subwavelength pillars of a THz device, the micro-structured spintronic THz emitter can achieve up to more than three times higher emission intensity compared to that of the un-patterned counterpart. Our study advances the development of the next generation of spintronic THz sources that allow a tailored emission frequency and intensity control and, further, are compatible with existing integrated wide-bandgap semiconductor circuits.

Title: Dynamical gauge invariance of statistical mechanics
Authors: Johanna Müller, Florian Sammüller, Matthias Schmidt
Abstract: We investigate gauge invariance against phase space shifting in nonequilibrium systems, as represented by time-dependent many-body Hamiltonians that drive an initial ensemble out of thermal equilibrium. The theory gives rise to gauge correlation functions that characterize spatial and temporal inhomogeneity with microscopic resolution on the one-body level. Analyzing the dynamical gauge invariance allows one to identify a specific localized shift gauge current as a fundamental nonequilibrium observable that characterizes particle-based dynamics. When averaged over the nonequilibrium ensemble, the shift current vanishes identically, which constitutes an exact nonequilibrium conservation law that generalizes the Yvon-Born-Green equilibrium balance of the vanishing sum of ideal, interparticle, and external forces. Any given observable is associated with a corresponding dynamical hyperforce density and hypercurrent correlation function. An exact nonequilibrium sum rule interrelates these one-body functions, in generalization of the recent hyperforce balance for equilibrium systems. We demonstrate the physical consequences of the dynamical gauge invariance using both harmonically confined ideal gas setups, for which we present analytical solutions, and molecular dynamics simulations of interacting systems, for which we demonstrate the shift current and hypercurrent correlation functions to be accessible both via finite-difference methods and via trajectory-based automatic differentiation. We show that the theory constitutes a starting point for developing nonequilibrium reduced-variance sampling algorithms and for investigating thermally-activated barrier crossing.

Title: Time-resolved dynamics of GaN waveguide polaritons
Authors: Loïc Méchin, François Médard, Joël Leymarie, Sophie Bouchoule, Blandine Alloing, Jesús Zúñiga-Pérez, Pierre Disseix
Abstract: We implement a new experimental approach to directly measure the lifetime of guided polaritons arising from the strong-coupling of GaN excitons and the guided photonic modes of a slab waveguide. Using a Fourier imaging setup, combined with spatial filtering of the emission, the emission associated to polaritonic modes with well-defined propagation constants can be selectively analyzed in the temporal domain. By directing it to the entrance slit of a streak camera, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements along the polariton dispersion branch were performed at 40 K, enabling to assess the time decay of polariton modes. By combining this information with the photonic/excitonic fraction corresponding to each polariton mode, extracted from a coupled-oscillators model that indicate a Rabi splitting of $\Omega$ = 80 meV, we could extract the photon lifetime in the waveguide $\tau_\gamma\, =\, 3\pm 1$ ps. This corresponds to a record $Q$-factor in the UV of 16 000. The excitonic reservoir lifetime, which contributes to polariton formation, was determined through TRPL measurements on excitonic luminescence. Finally, measurements conducted at lower temperature highlight secondary feeding mechanisms for the guided polaritonic mode, either via photon recycling from the AlGaN cladding layer or through resonant injection of photons from transitions below the band gap.

Title: Thermal Hall conductivity in the strongest cuprate superconductor: Estimate of the mean free path in the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8 + δ}$
Authors: Munkhtuguldur Altangerel, Quentin Barthélemy, Étienne Lefrançois, Jordan Baglo, Manel Mezidi, Gaël Grissonnanche, Ashvini Vallipuram, Emma Campillo, Anne Forget, Dorothée Colson, Ruixing Liang, D. A. Bonn, W. N. Hardy, Cyril Proust, Louis Taillefer
Abstract: The thermal Hall conductivity of the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) - the superconductor with the highest critical temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure - was measured at temperatures down to 2 K for three dopings in the underdoped regime ($p$ = 0.09, 0.10, 0.11). By combining a previously introduced simple model and prior theoretical results, we derive a formula for the inverse mean free path, $1 / \ell$, which allows us to estimate the mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in Hg1223 below $T_c$. We find that $1 / \ell$ grows as $T^3$, in agreement with the theoretical expectation for a clean $d$-wave superconductor. Measurements were also conducted on the single layer mercury-based cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Hg1201), revealing that the mean free path in this compound is roughly half that of its three-layered counterpart at the same doping ($p$ = 0.10). This observation can be attributed to the protective role of the outer planes in Hg1223, which results in a more pristine inner plane. We also report data in an ultraclean crystal of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (YBCO) with full oxygen content $p$ = 0.18, believed to be the cleanest of any cuprate, and find that $\ell$ is not longer than in Hg1223.

Title: Programmable glassy dynamics using tunable disorder in tweezer arrays
Authors: Kaustav Mukherjee, Grant W. Biedermann, Robert J. Lewis-Swan
Abstract: We propose a unifying framework for non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics in ensembles of positionally disordered interacting quantum spins based on the statistical properties, such as mean and variance, of the underlying disorder distribution. Our framework is validated through extensive exact numerical calculations and we use it to disentangle and understand the importance of dimensionality and interaction range for the observation of glassy (i.e., sub-exponential) decay dynamics. Leveraging the deterministic control of qubit positioning enabled by modern tweezer array architectures, we also introduce a method (``J-mapping'') that can be used to emulate the relaxation dynamics of a disordered system with arbitrary dimensionality and interaction range in bespoke one-dimensional arrays. Our approach paves the way towards tunable relaxation dynamics that can be explored in quantum simulators based on arrays of neutral atoms and molecules.

Title: Long-range four-body interactions in the Hamiltonian mean field model
Authors: Qiang Zhang, Yu Xue, Haojie Luo, Bingling Cen
Abstract: In this paper, a Hamiltonian mean field model with long-range four-body interactions is proposed. The model describes a long-range mean-field system in which N unit-mass particles move on a unit circle. Each particle theta_i interacts with any three other particles through an infinite-range cosine potential with an attractive interaction (epsilon > 0). By applying a method that remaps the average phase of global particle pairs onto a new unit circle, and using the saddle-point technique, the partition function is solved analytically after introducing four-body interactions, yielding expressions for the free energy f and the energy per particle U. These results were further validated through numerical simulations. The results show that the system undergoes a second-order phase transition at the critical energy U_c. Specifically, the critical energy corresponds to U_c = 0.32 when the coupling constant epsilon = 5, and U_c = 0.63 when epsilon = 10. Finally, we calculated the system's largest Lyapunov exponent lambda and kinetic energy fluctuations Sigma through numerical simulations. It is found that the peak of the largest Lyapunov exponent lambda occurs slightly below the critical energy U_c, which is consistent with the point of maximum kinetic energy fluctuations Sigma. And there is a scaling law of Sigma / N^(1/2) proportional to lambda between them.

Title: Metal-insulator transitions in pyrochlore oxides
Authors: Yoshinori Tokura, Yukitoshi Motome, Kentaro Ueda
Abstract: Pyrochlore oxides with chemical formula of A2B2O7 exhibit a diverse range of electronic properties as a representative family of quantum materials. These properties mostly stem from strong electron correlations at the transition metal B site and typical geometrical frustration effects on the pyrochlore lattice. Furthermore, the coupling between the magnetic moments of the rare-earth A site and the conduction electrons at the B site, along with the relativistic spin-orbit coupling particularly affecting the 4d/5d electrons at the B site, gives rise to the topological characteristics of the correlated electrons. This review paper focuses on the metal-insulator transitions in pyrochlore oxides as evidence of the strong electron correlation, which is highlighted as a rich source of intriguing charge dynamics coupled with frustrated spin-orbital entangled magnetism.

Title: Real-space superconducting properties in the atomically-thin limit: Ab initio approach and its application to Josephson junctions
Authors: Jonas Bekaert, Mikhail Petrov, Milorad V. Milošević
Abstract: Real-space superconducting properties are increasingly important to characterize low-dimensional, layered, and nanostructured materials. Here, we present a method to extract the real-space superconducting order parameter from the superconducting gap spectrum obtained via anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg calculations, using the Bloch wave functions of the Fermi states. We apply this approach to a selection of atomically thin material systems. Our analysis of gallenene, a monolayer of gallium atoms, shows that its planar and buckled phases exhibit distinct superconducting order parameter behaviors, shaped by their structural and electronic properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our real-space approach is exceptionally suited to identify and characterize Josephson junctions made from van der Waals materials. Our examination of a bilayer of NbSe$_2$ reveals that the van der Waals gap acts as an intrinsic weak link between the superconducting NbSe$_2$ layers. Therefore, a bilayer of NbSe$_2$ represents one of the thinnest and most tunable Josephson junction architectures, with potential applications in quantum devices. Our findings underscore the utility of transformation into real-space in understanding superconducting properties through ab initio calculations.

Title: Study on P-Type Doping of Mid-Wave and Long-Wave Infrared Mercury Cadmium Telluride
Authors: Arash Dehzangi, John Armstrong, Chris Schaake, Mark Skokan, Tyler Morrison, Justin Wilks, Sameer Ajmera, Mike Kinch
Abstract: We present in depth study of p-type doping concentration of mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) mercury cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe) thin films. Annealing time was changed under specific conditions to achieve a stable copper (Cu) doping concentration for HgCdTe thin films. Both MWIR and LWIR HgCdTe material were grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), where different trends were observed between LWIR and MWIR HgCdTe thin films by increasing anneal time. We also report the impact of different thickness (4 micron, 6 micron and 9 micron) along with annealing time on doping level of LWIR HgCdTe thin films.

Title: Bandstructure of a coupled BEC-cavity system: effects of dissipation and geometry
Authors: David Baur, Simon Hertlein, Alexander Baumgärtner, Justyna Stefaniak, Tilman Esslinger, Gabriele Natale, Tobias Donner
Abstract: We present a theoretical model for a transversally driven Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity. We focus on the interplay between different coherent couplings, which can trigger a structural phase transition, known as the superradiant phase transition. Our approach, based on band structure theory and a mean-field description, enables a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the system's excited modes, precursing the phase transitions. By incorporating dissipative couplings, intrinsic to these systems, we find non-Hermitian phenomena such as the coalescence of crossing precursor modes and the emergence of exceptional points (EPs). The general formulation of our model allows us to explain the role of an angle between transverse pump and the cavity deviating from $90^\circ$. This offers us a unified perspective on the plethora of different implementations of such systems.

Title: Synchronization of Quasi-Particle Excitations in a Quantum Gas with Cavity-Mediated Interactions
Authors: Gabriele Natale, Alexander Baumgärtner, Justyna Stefaniak, David Baur, Simon Hertlein, Dalila Rivero, Tilman Esslinger, Tobias Donner
Abstract: Driven-dissipative quantum systems can undergo transitions from stationary to dynamical phases, reflecting the emergence of collective non-equilibrium behavior. We study such a transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity and develop a cavity-assisted Bragg spectroscopy technique to resolve its collective modes. We observe dissipation-induced synchronization at the quasiparticle level, where two roton-like modes coalesce at an exceptional point. This reveals how dissipation microscopically drives collective dynamics and signals a precursor to a dynamical phase transition.

Title: Spall strength of symmetric tilt grain boundaries in 6H silicon carbide
Authors: Chunyu Li, Alejandro Strachan
Abstract: Characterizing microstructural effects on the dynamical response of materials is challenging due to the extreme conditions and the short timescales involved. For example, little is known about how grain boundary characteristics affect spall strength. This study explores 6H-SiC bicrystals under shock waves via large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. We focused on symmetric tilt grain boundaries with a wide range of misorientations and found that spall strength and dynamical fracture surface energy are strongly affected by the grain boundary microstructure, especially the excess free volume. Grain boundary energy also plays a considerable role. As expected, low-angle grain boundaries tend to have higher spallation strengths. We also extracted cohesive models for the dynamical strength of bulk systems and grain boundaries that can be used in continuum simulations.

Title: Bringing light into the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation: Consequences of its fractal non-Markovian memory kernel for optically induced magnetic inertia and magnons
Authors: Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: The Landau-Lisfhitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has been the cornerstone of modeling the dynamics of localized spins, viewed as classical vectors of fixed length, within nonequilibrium magnets. When light is employed as the nonequilibrium drive, the LLG equation must be supplemented with additional terms that are usually conjectured using phenomenological arguments for direct opto-magnetic coupling between localized spins and (real or effective) magnetic field of light. However, direct coupling of magnetic field to spins is 1/c smaller than coupling of light and electrons; or both magnetic and electric fields are too fast for slow classical spins to be able to follow them. Here, we displace the need for phenomenological arguments by rigorously deriving an extended LLG equation via Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT). Within such a theory, light interacts with itinerant electrons, and then spin current carried by them exerts spin-transfer torque onto localized spins, so that when photoexcited electrons are integrated out we arrive at a spin-only equation. Unlike the standard phenomenological LLG equation with local-in-time Gilbert damping, our extended one contains a non-Markovian memory kernel whose plot within the plane of its two times variables exhibits fractal properties. By applying SKFT-derived extended LLG equation, as our central result, to a light-driven ferromagnet as an example, we predict an optically induced magnetic inertia term. Its magnitude is governed by spatially nonlocal and time-dependent prefactor, leading to excitation of coherent magnons at sharp frequencies in and outside of the band of incoherent (or thermal) magnons.

Title: Zeptosecond free-electron compression through temporal lensing
Authors: Xin Jin, Cruz I. Velasco, F. Javier García de Abajo
Abstract: The pursuit of ever-shorter time scales is a frontier in modern physics, exemplified by the synthesis of attosecond light pulses -- an achievement made possible by coherently superimposing a broad range of photon energies, as required by the uncertainty principle. However, extending this progress into the zeptosecond regime poses significant challenges, as it demands phase-correlated optical spectra spanning hundreds of electronvolts. In this context, electrons offer a compelling alternative to light because they can be coherently manipulated to form broad energy superpositions, as demonstrated by the generation of attosecond pulses in ultrafast electron microscopes. Here, we propose a practical scheme for compressing free electrons into the zeptosecond domain by modulating their wave functions using suitably tailored broadband light fields. Building on recent advances in {free-electron--light--matter} interactions, our method introduces the concept of temporal lensing -- an extension of conventional optical lensing to the time domain -- to produce electron pulses with arbitrarily short durations.

Title: Demagnetization in micromagnetics: magnetostatic self-interactions of bulk chiral magnetic skyrmions
Authors: Paul Leask, Martin Speight
Abstract: It is known that the magnetization in a ferromagnet induces an internal demagnetizing magnetic field. This, in-turn, generates a magnetostatic self-energy, coming from dipole-dipole interactions. In general, this energy is singular and intrinsically non-local. However, one can introduce a magnetic scalar potential associated with the demagnetizing field. We show that computation of the magnetic potential can be achieved by solving Poisson's equation where the source is the divergence of the magnetization. Furthermore, we determine the variation of the magnetostatic self-energy and its associated back-reaction on the magnetization. Then, we present a theoretical study of the effect of the long-range dipolar interaction on magnetic skyrmion textures in the bulk of chiral ferromagnetic materials with the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. It is observed that the demagnetizing dipolar self-interaction can stabilize antiskyrmion crystals in Heusler compounds.

Title: Flexoelectric polarization in chiral liquid crystals: electrostatic self-interactions of topological defects
Authors: Paul Leask
Abstract: The presence of topological defects in apolar chiral liquid crystals cause orientational distortions, leading to non-uniform strain. This non-uniform strain generates an electric polarization response due to the flexoelectric effect, which induces an internal electric field. Associated to this electric field is an electrostatic self-energy, which has a back-reaction on the director field. Calculation of this internal electric field and its resulting back-reaction on the director field is complicated. We propose a method to do such, adapting a method recently developed to study the magnetostatic self-interaction effect on skyrmions in chiral ferromagnets. Bloch skyrmions in chiral magnets are solenoidal and are unaffected by the magnetostatic self-interaction. However, Bloch skyrmions in liquid crystals yield non-solenoidal flexoelectric polarization and, thus, are affected by the electrostatic self-interaction. Additionally, as the flexoelectric coefficients are increased in strength, a transition from a hopfion to a skyrmion is observed in three-dimensional confined systems.

Title: Josephson anomalous vortices
Authors: Dan Crawford, Stefan Ilić, Pauli Virtanen, Tero T. Heikkilä
Abstract: We show that vortices with circulating current, related with odd-frequency triplet pairing, appear in Josephson junctions where the barrier is a weak ferromagnet with strong spin-orbit coupling. By both symmetry analysis and microscopic methods we show that there is an additional term - a rotary invariant - in the superconducting free energy which allows for magnetoelectric effects even when the previously considered Lifshitz invariant vanishes. We show that the size, shape, and position of these vortices can be controlled by manipulating Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the weak link, via gates, and we suggest that these vortices could be detected via scanning magnetometry techniques. We also show that the transverse triplet components of the superconducting correlations can form a texture.

Title: Nanoscale infrared and microwave imaging of stacking faults in multilayer graphene

Abstract: Graphite occurs in a range of metastable stacking orders characterized by both the number and direction of shifts between adjacent layers by the length of a single carbon-carbon bond. At the extremes are Bernal (or ``ABAB...'') stacking, where the direction of the interlayer shift alternates with each layer, and rhombohedral (or ``ABCABC...'') stacking order where the shifts are always in the same direction. However, for an N-layer system, there are in principle $N-1$ unique metastable stacking orders of this type. Recently, it has become clear that stacking order has a strong effect on the low energy electronic band structure with single-layer shifts completely altering the electronic properties. Most experimental work has focused on the extremal stacking orders in large part due to the difficulty of isolating and identifying intermediate orders. Motivated by this challenge, here we describe two atomic force microscopy (AFM) based techniques to unambiguously distinguish stacking orders and defects in graphite flakes. Photo-thermal infrared atomic force microscope (AFM-IR) is able to distinguish stacking orders across multiple IR wavelengths and readily provides absolute contrast via IR spectral analysis. Scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM) can distinguish the relative contrast between Bernal, intermediate and rhombohedral domains. We show that both techniques are well suited to characterizing graphite van der Waals devices, providing high contrast determination of stacking order, subsurface imaging of graphene flakes buried under a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) dielectric layer, and identifying nanoscale domain walls. Our results pave the way for the reliable fabrication of graphene multilayer devices of definite interlayer registry.

Title: Emergent fractals in dirty topological crystals
Authors: Daniel J. Salib, Bitan Roy
Abstract: Non-trivial geometry of electronic Bloch states gives birth to topological insulators that are robust against sufficiently weak randomness, inevitably present in any quantum material. However, increasing disorder triggers a quantum phase transition into a featureless normal insulator. As the underlying quantum critical point is approached from the topological side, small scattered droplets of normal insulators start to develop in the system and their coherent nucleation causes ultimate condensation of a trivial insulation. Unless disorder is too strong, the normal insulator accommodates disjoint tiny topological puddles. Furthermore, in the close vicinity of such a transition the emergent islands of topological and trivial insulators display spatial fractal structures, a feature that is revealed only by local topological markers. Here we showcase this (possibly) generic phenomenon that should be apposite to dirty topological crystals of any symmetry class in any dimension from the Bott index and local Chern marker for a square lattice-based disordered Chern insulator model.

Title: Probing Bulk Band Topology from Time Boundary Effect in Synthetic Dimension
Authors: Huisheng Xu, Zhaohui Dong, Luqi Yuan, Liang Jin
Abstract: An incident wave at a temporal interface, created by an abrupt change in system parameters, generates time-refracted and time-reflected waves. We find topological characteristics associated with the temporal interface that separates distinct spatial topologies and report a novel bulk-boundary correspondence for the temporal interface. The vanishing of either time refraction or time reflection records a topological phase transition across the temporal interface, and the difference of bulk band topology predicts nontrivial braiding hidden in the time refraction and time reflection coefficients. These findings, which are insensitive to spatial boundary conditions and robust against disorder, are demonstrated in a synthetic frequency lattice with rich topological phases engendered by long-range couplings. Our work reveals the topological aspect of temporal interface and paves the way for using the time boundary effect to probe topological phase transitions and topological invariants.

Title: Anomalous matrix product operator symmetries and 1D mixed-state phases
Authors: Xiao-Qi Sun
Abstract: The renormalization group for matrix product density operators (MPDOs) provides a powerful framework for describing one-dimensional mixed-state phases of matter and the renormalization fixed points (RFPs) are representative states for analyzing nontrivial phases. Recently, it was found that anomalous symmetries can provide a fundamental obstruction for certain short-range correlated mixed states to be efficiently prepared. In this work, we consider generalized symmetries including non-invertible ones realized microscopically as matrix product operators (MPOs), and study the physical implications of their quantum anomaly on the MPDO RFPs. We prove that MPDOs with strong anomalous MPO symmetries cannot be prepared from a normal matrix product state in the trivial phase via a translationally invariant finite-depth local quantum channel. We explicitly construct a general class of zero-correlation-length MPDO RFPs that exhibit strong anomalous MPO symmetries, and represent a distinct class of MPDO RFPs from those that can be efficiently prepared as a consequence of quantum anomaly. Nonetheless, we further prove that all the constructed MPDO RFPs can be prepared from product states by finite-depth quantum circuit with measurements and feedforward.

Title: Quantum information conveyor belt
Authors: Piotr Wysocki, Marcin Płodzień, Jan Chwedeńczuk
Abstract: Forthcoming quantum devices will require high-fidelity information transfer across a many-body system. We formulate the criterion for lossless signal propagation and show that a single qubit can play the role of an antenna, collecting large amounts of information from a complex system. We derive the condition under which the antenna, far from the source and embedded in a many-body interacting medium, can still collect the complete information. A striking feature of this setup is that a single qubit antenna can receive even the full signal amplified by the entanglement of the source. As a consequence, the recovery of this information can be performed with simple single-qubit operations on the antenna (which we fully characterize) rather than with multi-qubit measurements of the source. Finally, we discuss the control of the system parameters necessary for lossless signal propagation. A method discussed here could improve the precision of quantum devices and simplify metrological protocols.

Title: Computational Physics in the Advanced Lab: Experiment and Simulation of Thermal Diffusion in Metal Rods
Authors: Yash Mohod, Matthew C. Sullivan
Abstract: Computational physics is integrated throughout the current undergraduate physics curriculum, though there are surprisingly few resources for computational physics in the advanced lab courses. This is despite the fact that a comparison of numerical simulations to experimental results is common practice in modern physics research. In this paper we present a simple experiment in thermal diffusion in metal rods. An analytical solution exists for the transient heat conduction in an infinite rod with a delta function heat input, but no analytical solution exists for short rods or for long duration heat inputs. Our apparatus is a copper rod with a heater and thermometers attached to the rod. The temperature difference on the metal rods due to transient heat conduction can be modeled using a simple numerical simulation using the finite centered difference method. Using a 22 cm long copper rod with the ends thermally sunk in aluminum blocks, we show poor agreement between the experimental results and the infinite-rod analytical model, but excellent agreement between the experimental results and our numerical simulation. Repeating the experiment with only one end of the rod sunk into an aluminum block (the other floating), we get good qualitative agreement between the experimental results and the numerical model. This experiment shows the power of a numerical simulation but also the limitations of the chosen model, which can be used as motivation for further exploration.

Title: Dynamic Shock Recovery in IO Networks with Priority Constraints
Authors: Jichu Han, Lina Wang, Richard Bookstaber, Dhruv Sharma
Abstract: Physical risks, such as droughts, floods, rising temperatures, earthquakes, infrastructure failures, and geopolitical conflicts, can ripple through global supply chains, raising costs, and constraining production across industries. Assessing these risks requires understanding not only their immediate effects, but also their cascading impacts. For example, a localized drought can disrupt the supply of critical raw materials such as cobalt or copper, affecting battery and electric vehicle production. Similarly, regional conflicts can impede cross-border trade, leading to broader economic consequences. Building on an existing model of simultaneous supply and demand shocks, we introduce a new propagation algorithm, Priority with Constraint, which modifies standard priority-based rationing by incorporating a minimum supply guarantee for all customers, regardless of their size or priority ranking. We also identify a buffer effect inherent in the Industry Proportional algorithm, which reflects real-world economic resilience. Finally, we extend the static shock propagation model to incorporate dynamic processes. We introduce mechanisms for gradual shock propagation, reflecting demand stickiness and the potential buffering role of inventories, and gradual recovery, modeling the simultaneous recovery of supply capacity and the inherent tendency for demand to return to pre-shock levels. Simulations demonstrate how the interplay between demand adjustment speed and supply recovery speed significantly influences the severity and duration of the economic impact after a shock.

Authors: Takanori Ishii, Daichi Takeda
Abstract: We develop, in the AdS/CFT correspondence, a method to compute correlation functions when the CFT is governed by the Lindblad equation for open quantum systems, via the AdS theory. Using a simple example in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we demonstrate that the predictions of the AdS theory based on our method match the direct computations in the dual CFT.

Title: Probing molecular concentration in cell nuclei with Brillouin microscopy
Authors: Lucie Vovard, Alexis Viel, Estelle Bastien, Lou-Anne Goutier, Gaetan Jardine, Jeremie Margueritat, Sylvain Monnier, Thomas Dehoux
Abstract: Cell volume is controlled by osmotic regulation of the fluid content, via water efflux through the cell membrane. The rate of this process is controlled by the ability of the liquid to move through the meshwork of solid elements within the cell. While such dynamics have been interpreted in the frame of the poroelastic theory in the cytoplasm, the behavior of the nucleus remains unknown due to a lack of technique to probe it. Brillouin light scattering (BLS) allows to interrogate the sound velocity and attenuation of a sample in a non-contact manner, thus revealing the dynamic response of the material. In cells, such data were initially interpreted as the viscoelastic response of the actin meshwork, but later studies pointed out the importance of water content. To resolve this lack of consensus in the interpretation of the hypersonic data obtained from BLS spectra, and investigate the possible poroelastic nature of the nucleus, we vary the relative volume fraction of intracellular water and solid network by applying osmotic compressions to single cells. In the nucleus, we observe a non-linear increase in the sound velocity and attenuation with increasing osmotic pressure that we fit to a poroelastic model, providing an estimate of the friction coefficient between the water phase and the network. By comparing BLS data to volume measurements, our approach demonstrates clearly that Brillouin microscopy actually provides a measure of molecular concentration in living cells

Title: Mach-Zehnder atom interferometry with non-interacting trapped Bose Einstein condensates
Authors: Tommaso Petrucciani, Andrea Santoni, Chiara Mazzinghi, Dimitrios Trypogeorgos, Francesco S. Cataliotti, Massimo Inguscio, Giovanni Modugno, Augusto Smerzi, Luca Pezzé, Marco Fattori
Abstract: The coherent manipulation of a quantum wave is at the core of quantum sensing. For instance, atom interferometers require linear splitting and recombination processes to map the accumulated phase shift into a measurable population signal. Although Bose Einstein condensates (BECs) are the archetype of coherent matter waves, their manipulation between trapped spatial modes has been limited by the strong interparticle collisions. Here, we overcome this problem by using BECs with tunable interaction trapped in an innovative array of double-well potentials and exploiting quantum tunneling to realize linear beam splitting. We operate several Mach-Zehnder interferometers in parallel, canceling common-mode potential instabilities by a differential analysis, thus demonstrating a trapped-atom gradiometer. Furthermore, by applying a spin-echo protocol, we suppress additional decoherence sources and approach unprecedented coherence times of one second. Our interferometer will find applications in precision measurements of forces with a high spatial resolution and in linear manipulation of quantum entangled states for sensing with sub shot-noise sensitivity.

Title: Classical Estimation of the Free Energy and Quantum Gibbs Sampling from the Markov Entropy Decomposition
Authors: Samuel O. Scalet, Angela Capel, Anirban N. Chowdhury, Hamza Fawzi, Omar Fawzi, Isaac H. Kim, Arkin Tikku
Abstract: We revisit the Markov Entropy Decomposition, a classical convex relaxation algorithm introduced by Poulin and Hastings to approximate the free energy in quantum spin lattices. We identify a sufficient condition for its convergence, namely the decay of the effective interaction. We prove that this condition is satisfied for systems in 1D at any temperature as well as in the high-temperature regime under a certain commutativity condition on the Hamiltonian. This yields polynomial and quasi-polynomial time approximation algorithms in these settings, respectively. Furthermore, the decay of the effective interaction implies the decay of the conditional mutual information for the Gibbs state of the system. We then use this fact to devise a rounding scheme that maps the solution of the convex relaxation to a global state and show that the scheme can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer, thus proving efficiency of quantum Gibbs sampling under our assumption of decay of the effective interaction.

Title: Self-consistent GW via conservation of spectral moments
Authors: Oliver J. Backhouse, Marcus K. Allen, Charles C. J. Scott, George H. Booth
Abstract: We expand on a recently introduced alternate framework for $GW$ simulation of charged excitations [Scott et. al., J. Chem. Phys., 158, 124102 (2023)], based around the conservation of directly computed spectral moments of the GW self-energy. Featuring a number of desirable formal properties over other implementations, we also detail efficiency improvements and a parallelism strategy, resulting in an implementation with a demonstrable similar scaling to an established Hartree--Fock code, with only an order of magnitude increase in cost. We also detail the applicability of a range of self-consistent $GW$ variants within this framework, including a scheme for full self-consistency of all dynamical variables, whilst avoiding the Matsubara axis or analytic continuation, allowing formal convergence at zero temperature. By investigating a range of self-consistency protocols over the GW100 molecular test set, we find that a little-explored self-consistent variant based around a simpler coupled chemical potential and Fock matrix optimization to be the most accurate self-consistent $GW$ approach. Additionally, we validate recently observed evidence that Tamm--Dancoff based screening approximations within $GW$ lead to higher accuracy than traditional random phase approximation screening over these molecular test cases. Finally, we consider the Chlorophyll A molecule, finding agreement with experiment within the experimental uncertainty, and a description of the full-frequency spectrum of charged excitations.

Title: Leakage at zero temperature from changes in chemical potential in Majorana qubits
Authors: M. C. Goffage, A. Alase, M. C. Cassidy, S. N. Coppersmith
Abstract: Building a fault-tolerant quantum computer requires physical qubits with exceptionally low error rates. Majorana-based tetron qubits are predicted to exhibit error rates that decrease exponentially with inverse temperature and length of each topological superconducting wire in the tetron. In contrast to this prediction, we show that errors arising from small variations in the chemical potential grow linearly with tetron length at zero temperature. These errors stem from leakage into excited quasiparticle states, which ultimately poison Majorana modes at opposite ends of the tetron, causing errors. We further demonstrate that the dynamics of this leakage is captured by the half Landau-Zener effect, which dictates its dependence on key system parameters such as the superconducting gap, chemical potential variations, and dynamic changes in the spatial profile of Majorana modes. These results motivate further investigations into the impact of leakage on qubit performance and potential mitigation strategies.

Title: Microscopic derivation of the stationary Chern-Simons-Schrödinger equation for almost-bosonic anyons
Authors: Alireza Ataei, Douglas Lundholm, Théotime Girardot
Abstract: In this work we consider the $N$-body Hamiltonian describing the microscopic structure of a quantum gas of almost-bosonic anyons. This description includes both extended magnetic flux and spin-orbit/soft-disk interaction between the particles which are confined in a scalar trapping potential. We study a physically well-motivated ansatz for a sequence of trial states, consisting of Jastrow repulsive short-range correlations and a condensate, with sufficient variational freedom to approximate the ground state (and possibly also low-energy excited states) of the gas. In the limit $N \to \infty$, while taking the relative size of the anyons to zero and the total magnetic flux $2\pi\beta$ to remain finite, we rigorously derive the stationary Chern-Simons-Schrödinger/average-field-Pauli effective energy density functional for the condensate wave function. This includes a scalar self-interaction parameter $\gamma$ which depends both on $\beta$, the diluteness of the gas, and the spin-orbit coupling strength $g$, but becomes independent of these microscopic details for a particular value of the coupling $g=2$ in which supersymmetry is exhibited (on all scales, both microscopic and mesoscopic) with $\gamma=2\pi|\beta|$. Our findings confirm and clarify the predictions we have found in the physics literature.

Title: All-dielectric Metaphotonics for Advanced THz Control of Spins

Abstract: While nearly single cycle THz pulse is conventionally accepted as the stimulus for the fastest and the most energy efficient control of spins in magnets, all-dielectric metasurfaces have been recently demonstrated to be the least dissipative mean to enhance and control the coupling of light to spins. All-dielectric metasurfaces for the THz control of spins hold great potential in the field of spintronics and related technologies, pushing the boundaries of speed and energy efficiency in spin-based information processing. Here we demonstrate such a metasurface for an advanced THz control of spins in a ferrimagnetic film of iron garnet. Structuring a nonmagnetic substrate one can force a THz electromagnetic field, otherwise described by plane waves, to acquire an out-of-plane magnetic field and thus enable arbitrary direction of the torque acting on spins in all three dimensions. Hence, metaphotonics opens up a plethora of opportunities for advanced control of spins at THz rates in many hot fields of contemporary science, including spintronics, magnonics and quantum computing.

Title: From surface roughness to crater formation in a 2D multi-scale simulation of ultrashort pulse laser ablation
Authors: Nicolas Thomae, Maximilian Stabroth, Julian Vollmann, Markus Döring, David Redka, Heinz Paul Huber, Michael Schmidt
Abstract: Surface roughness plays a critical role in ultrashort pulse laser ablation, particularly for industrial applications using burst mode operations, multi-pulse laser processing, and the generation of laser-induced periodic surface structures. Hence, we address the impact of surface roughness on the resulting laser ablation topography predicted by a simulation model and compared to experimental results. We present a comprehensive multi-scale simulation framework that first employs finite-difference-time-domain simulations for calculating the surface fluence distribution on a rough surface measured by an atomic-force-microscope followed by the two-temperature model coupled with hydrodynamic/solid mechanics simulation for the initial material heating. Lastly, a computational fluid dynamics model for material relaxation and fluid flow is developed and employed. Final state results of aluminum and AISI 304 stainless steel simulations demonstrated alignment with established ablation models and crater dimension prediction. Notably, Al exhibited significant optical scattering effects due to initial surface roughness of 15 nm - being 70 times below the laser wavelength, leading to localized, selective ablation processes and substantially altered crater topography compared to idealized conditions. Contrary, AISI 304 with RMS roughness of 2 nm showed no difference. Hence, we highlight the necessity of incorporating realistic, material-specific surface roughness values into large-scale ablation simulations. Furthermore, the induced local fluence variations demonstrated the inadequacy of neglecting lateral heat transport effects in this context.

Title: One-dimensional $q$-state modified Potts model and its thermodynamic functions
Authors: Hasan Akin
Abstract: Since its introduction, the Potts model has gained widespread popularity across various fields due to its diverse applications. Even minor advancements in this model continue to captivate scientists worldwide, and small modifications often intrigue researchers from different disciplines. This paper investigates a one-dimensional \(q\)-state modified Potts model influenced by an external magnetic field. By leveraging the transfer matrix method, exact expressions are derived for key thermodynamic quantities, including free energy, entropy, magnetization, susceptibility, and specific heat capacity. Numerical analyses explore how these thermodynamic functions vary with relevant parameters, offering insights into the system's behavior. Additionally, the asymptotic properties of these quantities are examined in the limiting cases \(T \to 0\) and \(T \to \infty\). The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the model's thermodynamic characteristics and highlight its potential applications across various disciplines.

Title: Fragmentation, Zero Modes, and Collective Bound States in Constrained Models
Authors: Eloi Nicolau, Marko Ljubotina, Maksym Serbyn
Abstract: Kinetically constrained models were originally introduced to capture slow relaxation in glassy systems, where dynamics are hindered by local constraints instead of energy barriers. Their quantum counterparts have recently drawn attention for exhibiting highly degenerate eigenstates at zero energy -- known as zero modes -- stemming from chiral symmetry. Yet, the structure and implications of these zero modes remain poorly understood. In this work, we focus on the properties of the zero mode subspace in quantum kinetically constrained models with a $U(1)$ particle-conservation symmetry. We use the $U(1)$ East, which lacks inversion symmetry, and the inversion-symmetric $U(1)$ East-West models to illustrate our two main results. First, we observe that the simultaneous presence of constraints and chiral symmetry generally leads to a parametric increase in the number of zero modes due to the fragmentation of the many-body Hilbert space into disconnected sectors. Second, we generalize the concept of compact localized states from single particle physics and introduce the notion of collective bound states. We formulate sufficient criteria for their existence, arguing that the degenerate zero mode subspace plays a central role, and demonstrate bound states in both example models. Our results motivate a systematic study of bound states and their relation to ergodicity breaking, transport, and other properties of quantum kinetically constrained models.

Title: Geometry-induced asymmetric level coupling
Authors: Alhun Aydin
Abstract: Tailoring energy levels in quantum systems via Hamiltonian control parameters is essential for designing quantum thermodynamic devices and materials. However, conventional methods for manipulating finite-size systems, such as tuning external fields or system size, typically lead to uniform spectral shifts, limiting precise control. A recently introduced technique, called the size-invariant shape transformation, overcomes this by introducing a new control parameter that deforms the potential landscape without altering system size, enabling nonuniform level scaling. This shape parameter gives rise to quantum shape effects in confined systems, conceptually distinct from quantum size effects. We explore the limits of this phenomenon by asking: what is the minimal system in which such spectral behavior can emerge? We show that even a two-level system can exhibit thermodynamic consequences of quantum shape effects, including spontaneous transitions into lower-entropy states, a feature absent in classical thermodynamics for non-interacting systems. We identify the origin as geometry-induced asymmetric level coupling, where the ground-state energy and level spacing respond oppositely to shape changes. This extends to many-level systems, where the thermally averaged level spacing and ground-state energy evolve in opposite directions. We construct spontaneity maps revealing energy- and entropy-driven spontaneous processes. These behaviors emerge under quasistatic, isothermal deformations and show how geometry alone can induce thermodynamic effects typically exclusive to interacting or open systems. Our results offer a broadly applicable route to spectral gap control in quantum technologies.

Title: polyGen: A Learning Framework for Atomic-level Polymer Structure Generation
Authors: Ayush Jain, Rampi Ramprasad
Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for their intrinsic structural flexibility.

Title: FRG analysis for relativistic BEC in arbitrary spatial dimensions
Authors: Fumio Terazaki, Kazuya Mameda
Abstract: A relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is studied within the complex scalar field theory using the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation. We investigate fluctuation effects on the relativistic BEC through numerical analyses for various spatial dimensions and chemical potentials. Our numerical results are consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and this consistency is also analytically confirmed from the flow equation. We also discuss a numerical instability of the FRG in lower spatial dimensions, which is evadable for certain parameter choices.

Title: Network Sampling: An Overview and Comparative Analysis
Authors: Quoc Chuong Nguyen
Abstract: Network sampling is a crucial technique for analyzing large or partially observable networks. However, the effectiveness of different sampling methods can vary significantly depending on the context. In this study, we empirically compare representative methods from three main categories: node-based, edge-based, and exploration-based sampling. We used two real-world datasets for our analysis: a scientific collaboration network and a temporal message-sending network. Our results indicate that no single sampling method consistently outperforms the others in both datasets. Although advanced methods tend to provide better accuracy on static networks, they often perform poorly on temporal networks, where simpler techniques can be more effective. These findings suggest that the best sampling strategy depends not only on the structural characteristics of the network but also on the specific metrics that need to be preserved or analyzed. Our work offers practical insights for researchers in choosing sampling approaches that are tailored to different types of networks and analytical objectives.

Title: Flux tube clustering from magnetic coupling of adjacent type-I and -II superconductors in a neutron star: persistent gravitational radiation
Authors: K. H. Thong, A. Melatos
Abstract: Adjacent type-I and -II proton superconductors in a rotation-powered pulsar are predicted to exist in a metastable state containing macroscopic and quantized flux tubes, respectively. Previous studies show that the type-I and -II regions are coupled magnetically, when macroscopic flux tubes divide dendritically into quantized flux tubes near the type-I-II interface, through a process known as flux branching. The studies assume that the normal-superconducting boundary is sharp, and the quantized flux tubes do not repel mutually. Here the sharp-interface approximation is refined by accounting for magnetic repulsion. It is found that flux tubes in the same flux tree cluster with a minimum-energy separation two to seven times less than that of isolated flux tubes. Neutron vortices pin and cluster about flux trees. We find that the maximum characteristic wave strain $h_0$ of the current quadrupole gravitational radiation emitted by a rectilinear array of clustered vortices exceeds by $(1+N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ the strain $h_0 \sim 10^{-32}(f/30 {\rm Hz})^{5/2} (D/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$ emitted by uniformly distributed vortices, where $N_{\rm v,t}$ is the mean number of pinned vortices per flux tree, $f$ is the star's spin frequency, and $D$ is the star's distance from Earth. The factor $(1 + N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ brings $h_0$ close to the sensitivity limit of the current generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors under certain circumstances, specifically when flux branching forms relatively few (and hence relatively large) flux trees.

Title: Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability
Authors: Zhao Zhang
Abstract: It is shown that the existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the ``coincidence'' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.

Title: Emergence of Tension Chains and Active Force Patterning
Authors: Ayan Roychowdhury, Saptarshi Dasgupta, Madan Rao
Abstract: Viewed under a fluorescence microscope, the actomyosin cytoskeleton presents vivid streaks of lines together with persistent oscillatory waves. Using an active hydrodynamic approach, we show how a uniform distribution of single or mixture of contractile stresslets spontaneously segregate, followed by the formation of singular structures of high contractility (tension chains) in finite time. Simultaneously, the collection of stresslets exhibit travelling waves and swapping as a consequence of nonreciprocity. In the finite geometry of the cell, the collection of active tension chains can form an active web held together by specific anchoring at the cell boundary. On the other hand, preferential wetting at the cell boundary can reinforce active segregation in a mixture of stresslets leading to stratification.

Title: Dielectric properties of aqueous electrolytes at the nanoscale
Authors: Maximilian R. Becker, Philip Loche, Douwe Jan Bonthuis, Dominique Mouhanna, Roland R. Netz, Hélène Berthoumieux
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of aqueous electrolytes, the effect of salt on water organization remains controversial. We introduce a nonlocal and nonlinear field theory for the nanoscale polarization of ions and water and derive the electrolyte dielectric response as a function of salt concentration to first order in a loop expansion. By comparison with molecular dynamics simulations, we show that rising salt concentration induces a dielectric permittivity decrement and Debye screening in the longitudinal susceptibility but leaves the water structure remarkably unchanged.

Title: A unified theory of strong coupling Bose polarons: From repulsive polarons to non-Gaussian many-body bound states
Authors: Nader Mostaan, Nathan Goldman, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: We address the Bose polaron problem of a mobile impurity interacting strongly with a host Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) through a Feshbach resonance. On the repulsive side at strong couplings, theoretical approaches predict two distinct polaron branches corresponding to attractive and repulsive polarons, but it remains unclear how the two are related. This is partly due to the challenges resulting from a competition of strongly attractive (destabilizing) impurity-boson interactions with weakly repulsive (stabilizing) boson-boson interactions, whose interplay is difficult to describe with contemporary theoretical methods. Here we develop a powerful variational framework that combines Gaussian correlations among impurity-boson scattering states, including up to an infinite number of bosonic excitations, with exact non-Gaussian correlations among bosons occupying an impurity-boson bound state. This variational scheme enables a full treatment of strong nonlinearities arising in the Feshbach molecule on the repulsive side of the resonance. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the interplay of impurity-induced instability and stabilization by repulsive boson-boson interactions results in a discrete set of metastable many-body bound states at intermediate energies between the attractive and repulsive polaron branches. These states exhibit strong quantum statistical characteristics in the form of non-Gaussian quantum correlations, requiring non-perturbative beyond mean-field treatments for their characterization. Furthermore, these many-body bound states have sizable molecular spectral weights, accessible via molecular spectroscopy techniques. This work provides a unified theory of attractive and repulsive Bose polarons on the repulsive side of the Feshbach resonance.

Title: Effective Equilibrium Theory of Quantum Light-Matter Interaction in Cavities: Extended Systems and the Long Wavelength Approximation
Authors: Mark Kamper Svendsen, Michael Ruggenthaler, Hannes Hübener, Christian Schäfer, Martin Eckstein, Angel Rubio, Simone Latini
Abstract: When light and matter interact strongly, the resulting hybrid system inherits properties from both constituents, allowing one to modify material behavior by engineering the surrounding electromagnetic environment. This concept underlies the emerging paradigm of cavity materials engineering, which aims at the control of material properties via tailored vacuum fluctuations of dark photonic environments. The theoretical description of such systems is challenging due to the combined complexity of extended electronic states and quantum electromagnetic fields. Here, we derive an effective, non-perturbative theory for low-dimensional crystals embedded in a Fabry-Pérot resonator, within the long-wavelength limit. Our approach incorporates the multimode and dispersive nature of the cavity field and reduces it to an effective single-mode description by imposing the condition of negligible momentum transfer from light to matter. Importantly, the resulting effective mode is characterized by a finite mode volume-even in the limit of extended cavities-which is directly linked to realistic cavity parameters. This ensures that the light-matter coupling remains finite in bulk systems. By explicitly accounting for the finite reflectivity of cavity mirrors, our theory also avoids double counting the contribution from free-space light-matter coupling. Overall, our results provide a robust and realistic framework for describing cavity-matter interactions at the Hamiltonian level, incorporating the electromagnetic environment beyond the idealized perfect-mirror approximation.

Title: Locally Purified Density Operators for Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Mixed States
Authors: Yuchen Guo, Jian-Hao Zhang, Hao-Ran Zhang, Shuo Yang, Zhen Bi
Abstract: We propose a tensor network approach known as the locally purified density operator (LPDO) to investigate the classification and characterization of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in open quantum systems. We extend the concept of injectivity, originally associated with matrix product states and projected entangled pair states, to LPDOs in $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ systems, unveiling two distinct types of injectivity conditions inherent in short-range entangled density matrices. Within the LPDO framework, we outline a classification scheme for decohered average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases, consistent with earlier results obtained through spectrum sequence techniques. We first illustrate our framework with ASPT phases protected by fermion parity symmetry, then extend the classification of ASPT phases to a general group extension. We demonstrate examples of explicit construction of fixed-point LPDOs for ASPT phases including intrinsic ASPTs in both $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ systems.

Title: Matsubara-Frequency-Resolved Spin Exchange-Correlation Kernel for the Three-Dimensional Uniform Electron Gas
Authors: Zhiyi Li, Pengcheng Hou, Youjin Deng, Kun Chen
Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems and can be characterized by the exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the spin channel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,\omega)$. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we compute the Matsubara-frequency-resolved spin XC kernel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,i\omega_n)$ for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas at sufficiently low temperatures with high precision. In the long-wavelength limit, we identified a singular behavior of the form $A(i\omega_n)/q^2$, confirming the theoretically predicted ultranonlocal behavior associated with spin Coulomb drag. Analysis of this structure in the low frequency region enables precise determination of two crucial parameters characterizing the spin Coulomb drag effect: the spin mass enhancement factor and spin diffusion relaxation time. We observe a significant trend of increasing enhancement of the spin mass factor with decreasing electron density, and provide clear evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures. These quantitative findings advance our understanding of Coulomb interaction effects on spin transport and provide essential parameters for time-dependent density functional theory and spintronics applications.

Title: Universal Planckian relaxation in the strange metal state of the cuprates
Authors: A. Shekhter, B. J. Ramshaw, M. K. Chan, N. Harrison
Abstract: A major puzzle in understanding high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity is the microscopic origin of the linear-in-temperature ($T$-linear) resistivity in the strange metal state, which persists up to very high temperatures. Implicit to existing theoretical discussions of this universal `{Planckian}' relaxation rate is the assumption that it must also be independent of doping, $p$. Applied to the cuprates, however, this apparently contradicts the observed strong doping-dependence ($\propto 1/p$) of the slope of the $T$-linear resistivity over a wide doping range. Here, we show through a combination of measurements, including optical conductivity and entropy, that the plasma frequency squared $\omega_p^2$ scales as $p$ over a similar doping range. Together, these dependences provide compelling evidence that the relaxation rate $1/\tau$ is indeed doping-independent (i.e. universal) throughout the entire strange metal state. Furthermore, we argue that the entire doping dependence of $\omega_p^2$ can be understood to arise from an effective mass enhancement of a specific form proposed by Anderson [\emph{Science} \textbf{235}, 1196 (1987)] in the context of doped Mott insulators. Such a mass enhancement originates from strong short-range repulsive interactions, while the Planckian relaxation rate itself appears to be an emergent phenomenon of independent physical origin.

Title: Robust Hilbert space fragmentation in group-valued loop models
Authors: Alexey Khudorozhkov, Charles Stahl, Oliver Hart, Rahul Nandkishore
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.

Title: Unveiling Supersolid Order via Vortex Trajectory Correlations
Authors: Subrata Das, Vito W. Scarola
Abstract: The task of experimentally investigating the inherently dual properties of a supersolid, a simultaneous superfluid and solid, has become more critical following the recent experimental exploration of supersolid regimes in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of $^{164}\text{Dy}$. We introduce a supersolid order parameter that uses vortex-vortex trajectory correlations to simultaneously reveal the periodic density of the underlying solid and superfluidity in a single measure. We propose experiments using existing technology to optically create and image trajectories of vortex dipoles in dipolar BECs that is applicable to large system sizes. We numerically test our observable and find that vortex-vortex correlations reveal the supersolid lattice structure while distinguishing it from superfluidity even in the presence of dissipation. Our method sets the stage for experiments to use vortex trajectory correlations to investigate fundamental properties of supersolids arising from their dynamics and phase transitions as experimental system sizes are increased.

Title: Twin branching in shape memory alloys: a 1D model with energy dissipation effects
Authors: Stanislaw Stupkiewicz, Seyedshoja Amini, Mohsen Rezaee-Hajidehi
Abstract: We develop a 1D model of twin branching in shape memory alloys. The free energy of the branched microstructure comprises the interfacial and elastic strain energy contributions, both expressed in terms of the average twin spacing treated as a continuous function of the position. The total free energy is then minimized, and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation is solved numerically using the finite element method. The model can be considered as a continuous counterpart of the recent discrete model of Seiner et al. (2020), and our results show a very good agreement with that model in the entire range of physically relevant parameters. Furthermore, our continuous setting facilitates incorporation of energy dissipation into the model. The effect of rate-independent dissipation on the evolution of the branched microstructure is thus studied. The results show that significant effects on the microstructure and energy of the system are expected only for relatively small domain sizes.

Title: Segregation, Finite Time Elastic Singularities and Coarsening in Renewable Active Matter
Authors: Ayan Roychowdhury, Saptarshi Dasgupta, Madan Rao
Abstract: Material renewability in active living systems, such as in cells and tissues, can drive the large-scale patterning of forces, with distinctive phenotypic consequences. This is especially significant in the cell cytoskeleton, where multiple species of myosin bound to actin, apply differential contractile stresses and undergo differential turnover, giving rise to patterned force channeling. Here we study the dynamical patterning of stresses that emerge in a hydrodynamic description of a renewable active actomyosin elastomer comprising two myosin species. Our analytical framework also holds for an actomyosin elastomer with a single myosin species. We find that a uniform active contractile elastomer spontaneously segregates into spinodal stress patterns, followed by a finite-time collapse into tension carrying singular structures that display self-similar scaling and caustics. Our numerical analysis carried out in 1D, shows that these singular structures move and merge, and gradually result in a slow coarsening dynamics. We discuss the implications of our findings to the emergence of stress fibers and the spatial patterning of actomyosin. Our study suggests, that with state-dependent turnover of crosslinkers and myosin, the in vivo cytoskeleton can navigate through the space of material parameters to achieve a variety of functional phenotypes.

Title: Atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ in High Magnetic Fields: Quantum Criticality and Dimensional Reduction of a Sawtooth-Chain Compound

Abstract: We report an extensive high-field study of atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$, a material realization of quantum sawtooth chains with weak interchain couplings, in continuous and pulsed magnetic fields up to 58 T. In particular, we have mapped the entropy landscape for fields as high as 35 T and have identified a field-induced quantum critical point at 21.9(1) T for $\mathbf{H} \parallel c$ axis. The quantum critical point separates field regions with and without magnetic order, evidenced by our thermodynamic study and $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, but lies far below full saturation of the magnetization. Corroborated by numerical results using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we find this behavior associated with a dimensional reduction of the spin system: the sawtooth chain effectively decouples into an antiferromagnetic spin-$1/2$ chain (backbone of the sawtooth chain) in the presence of an exchange field produced by the remaining field-polarized spins.

Title: Moiré amplification of highly tunable shift current response in twisted trilayer graphene
Authors: Yuncheng Mao, Claudio Attaccalite, Diego García Ovalle
Abstract: In this work we analyze the shift current conductivity in helical twisted trilayer graphene. Without loss of generality, we show that the density of states and the twist angle set an upper bound for this response, which is inversely proportional to the square of the twist angle. For the case of ABA stacking and at the magic angle, the shift photoconductivity can reach values of order $10^4~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ for frequencies below 50 meV, which can be attributed to the interband transitions between the two flattened middle bands close to the Fermi level. By tuning the twist angle, we demonstrate that the photoconductivity is shifted in the frequency range and it is further influenced by two additional factors: The magnitude of the shift vector and the energy separation between the bands. Furthermore, we propose a scenario in the AAA stacked configuration, where the photoconductivity can be of order $10^5~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ in the THz regime, revealing a potential influence of the stacking in the optimization of the shift current conductivity. Therefore, a large density of states, a small twist angle and the layer stacking are ingredients that hold promising functionality for photovoltaic applications in moiré heterostructures.

Title: Universal properties of Wigner delay times and resonance widths of tight-binding random graphs
Authors: K. B. Hidalgo-Castro, L.A. Razo-López, A. M. Martínez-Argüello, J. A. Méndez-Bermúdez
Abstract: The delay experienced by a probe due to interactions with a scattering media is highly related to the internal dynamics inside that media. This property is well captured by the Wigner delay time and the resonance widths. By the use of the equivalence between the adjacency matrix of a random graph and the tight-binding Hamiltonian of the corresponding electronic media, the scattering matrix approach to electronic transport is used to compute Wigner delay times and resonance widths of Erdös-Rényi graphs and random geometric graphs, including bipartite random geometric graphs. In particular, the situation when a single-channel lead attached to the graphs is considered. Our results show a smooth crossover towards universality as the graphs become complete. We also introduce a parameter $\xi$, depending on the graph average degree $\langle k \rangle$ and graph size $N$, that scales the distributions of both Wigner delay times and resonance widths; highlighting the universal character of both distributions. Specifically, $\xi = \langle k \rangle N^{-\alpha}$ where $\alpha$ is graph-model dependent.

Title: Harnessing Chiral Spin States in Molecular Nanomagnets for Quantum Technologies
Authors: Aman Ullah, Ziqi Hu, Juan Aragó, Alejandro Gaita-Ariño
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework to investigate spin chirality in molecular quantum systems. Focusing on a minimal three-spin-center model with antiferromagnetic exchange and symmetry breaking driven by an electric-field-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and applied magnetic fields-give rise to chiral ground states characterized by nonzero scalar spin chirality, $\chi = \textbf{S}_1\cdot(\textbf{S}_r\times \textbf{S}_2)$. The emergent chiral qubits naturally suppress always-on interactions that can not be switched off in weakly coupled qubits, as demonstrated through Liouville-von Neumann dynamics, which reveal phase difference in superposition states that form chiral qubits. To validate this framework, we examine realistic lanthanide complexes with radical-bridged magnetic centers, where spin-orbit coupling and asymmetric exchange facilitate chirality. Our findings establish spin chirality engineering as a promising strategy for mitigating always-on interaction in entangling two chiral qubits in molecular quantum technologies.

Title: Ambient pressure growth of bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity over 90 K under high pressure
Authors: Feiyu Li, Zhenfang Xing, Di Peng, Jie Dou, Ning Guo, Liang Ma, Yulin Zhang, Lingzhen Wang, Jun Luo, Jie Yang, Jian Zhang, Tieyan Chang, Yu-Sheng Chen, Weizhao Cai, Jinguang Cheng, Yuzhu Wang, Zhidan Zeng, Qiang Zheng, Rui Zhou, Qiaoshi Zeng, Xutang Tao, Junjie Zhang
Abstract: Recently, the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate $La_3Ni_2O_7$ has emerged as a superconductor with a transition temperature ($T_c$) of ~ 80 K above 14 GPa$^{[1-4]}$. Efforts to search for nickelate superconductors with higher $T_c$$^{[5,6]}$, to grow reproducible high-quality single crystals$^{[2,7-10]}$, and to eliminate reliance on demanding high gas pressure synthesis conditions$^{[11]}$, remain significant challenges. Here we report superconductivity up to 92 K under high pressure in single crystals of bilayer nickelates synthesized at ambient pressure using flux methods. High quality $La_2SmNi_2O_{7-{\delta}}$ single crystals with dimensions up to 220 {\mu}m on edge were successfully grown. At ~ 15 GPa, these crystals exhibit superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c^{onset}$) of 68 K and zero-resistance temperature ($T_c^{zero}$) of 47 K. Increasing pressure further enhances both transition temperatures, reaching record values for nickelates: $T_{c,max}^{onset}$ = 92 K and $T_{c,max}^{zero}$ = 73 K @ 21 GPa. Notably, higher $T_c$ correlates with larger in-plane lattice distortion at ambient conditions for bilayer nickelates. Furthermore, we observed a structural transition from monoclinic $P2_1/a$ to tetragonal $I4/mmm$ at ~ 18 GPa, indicating that tetragonal structure is not a prerequisite for superconductivity to appear in this bilayer nickelate. This study provides an easy-to-access method for growing reproducible high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals and offers new insights into achieving higher Tc superconductivity.

Title: Paired Superfluidity and Quantum Quadruple Criticality in Synthetic-Dimension-Engineered Bose Mixtures: Phase-Dependent Demixing and Emergent XY Ferromagnetism
Authors: Chenrong Liu, Zhi Lin
Abstract: We utilize the cluster Gutzwiller mean-field method to explore ground-state phases and demixing effects in synthetic-dimensional binary boson mixtures with pair hopping. Our investigation uncovers two exotic interspecies paired superfluids: (i) the PSCF phase, characterized by bosonic `four-particle' correlations (two particles of one species paired with two holes of the other), analogous to fermionic charge-4e superconductivity; (ii) the SCF$^*$ phase, hosting coexisting PSCF and super-counter-fluidity orders, serves as the bosonic analog of fermionic charge-2e/4e superconducting coexistence. Both phases exhibit distinct XY ferromagnetic states at varying fillings, including unreported pseudo-spin phases. A quantum quadruple critical point emerges under interexchange asymmetry. Crucially, pair hopping introduces phase-dependent mixed-demixed criticality, deviating from conventional two-component bosonic systems. We propose experimental protocols leveraging noise correlations and Feshbach resonance techniques to probe these states.

Title: Floating zone growth as a tool for phase formation exploration at high oxygen pressures in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate Y$_{y}$Sr$_{3-y}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_{7-δ}$
Authors: H. Yilmaz, P. Sosa-Lizama, M. Knauft, K. Küster, U. Starke, M. Isobe, O. Clemens, P. A. van Aken, Y. E. Suyolcu, P. Puphal
Abstract: With the discovery of superconductivity under pressure in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer La$_3$Ni$^{2.5+}_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$^{2.66+}_3$O$_{10}$, a new field of nickelate superconductors opened up. In this respect, Sr-Ni-O RP-type phases represent alternative systems that exist with partial cation substitution. We demonstrate that by Y-doping in Sr$_{3}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (SNAO), as Y$_{y}$Sr$_{3-y}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (YSNAO), the drawback of an insulating ground state is overcome, and a significant decrease in resistivity is achieved with crystals exhibiting semiconducting behavior. We employ optical floating zone (OFZ) growth at 10 bar oxygen partial pressure to explore the phase formation in a narrow region of Y-Sr-Ni-Al-O and investigate via DFT the general stability of the pure Sr-Ni-O scenario. Using extensive diffraction and spectroscopy, as well as transport and magnetization measurements, the structural, chemical, electrical, and magnetic properties of the as-grown and reduced compounds were investigated. The optimal growth of YSNAO allows for large high quality crystals suitable for neutron studies. In the Al-free growth, a known $n=1$ RP system with Sr$_{1.66}$Y$_{0.33}$NiO$_{4-\delta}$, from which the first single crystals were obtained, was further confirmed, opening the door for future exploration of \textit{A}-site substituted RP-type phases without Ni-site disorder.

Title: Machine Learning Reveals Composition Dependent Thermal Stability in Halide Perovskites
Authors: Abigail R. Hering, Mansha Dubey, Elahe Hosseini, Meghna Srivastava, Yu An, Juan-Pablo Correa-Baena, Houman Homayoun, Marina S. Leite
Abstract: Halide perovskites exhibit unpredictable properties in response to environmental stressors, due to several composition-dependent degradation mechanisms. In this work, we apply data visualization and machine learning (ML) techniques to reveal unexpected correlations between composition, temperature, and material properties while using high throughput, in situ environmental photoluminescence (PL) experiments. Correlation heatmaps show the strong influence of Cs content on film degradation, and dimensionality reduction visualization methods uncover clear composition-based data clusters. An extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost) effectively forecasts PL features for ten perovskite films with both composition-agnostic (>85% accuracy) and composition-dependent (>75% accuracy) model approaches, while elucidating the relative feature importance of composition (up to 99%). This model validates a previously unseen anti-correlation between Cs content and material thermal stability. Our ML-based framework can be expanded to any perovskite family, significantly reducing the analysis time currently employed to identify stable options for photovoltaics.

Title: Field-tunable spin disordered phase in the triangular-lattice delafossite TlYbSe2
Authors: Bishnu P. Belbase, Arjun Unnikrishnan, Eun Sang Choi, Arnab Banerjee
Abstract: We introduce a relatively disorder-free frustrated triangular lattice compound TlYbSe2 belonging to the rare-earth delafossite family - extending the search for the quintessential chiral quantum spin liquid state. While DC magnetization suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetization and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a highly frustrated quantum-disordered ground state. The high-field AC magnetization reveals a phase diagram generally consistent with a large family of Yb delafossites. We observe a spin glass transition around ~ 30 mK at zero field, which we argue is due to free spins. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2-5 K - indicative of short-range spin correlations - along with a linear temperature dependence at low temperatures and the complete absence of long-range order at low fields, establishes the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe2 as a prime location for exploring field-tunable QSL behavior.

Title: Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors
Authors: S. I. Mukhin
Abstract: Proposed recently by the author Q-ball mechanism of the pseudogap state and high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates (2022) was supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ (2023). In the present paper it is demonstrated that T-linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity arises naturally in the Q-ball gas phase, that may explain corresponding experimental data in the "strange metal" phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates, as reviewed by Barisic et al. (2013). In the present theory it arises due to scattering of electrons on the Q-balls gas of condensed charge/spin fluctuations. Close to the lowest temperature boundary of the "strange metal" phase, at which Q-ball radius diverges, electrical resistivity caused by a slide of the Q-balls as a whole is calculated using fluctuation paraconductivity calculation method by Alex Abrikosov (1987). The diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas is calculated as well and shows good accord with experimental data by this http URL et al. (2010) in the "strange metal" phase. In total, obtained results demonstrate different properties of the correlated electrons systems that arise due to formation of Q-balls possessing internal bosonic frequency $\Omega=2\pi nT$ in Matsubara time and, thus, forming the quantum thermodynamic time polycrystals. Presented theory may give a clue concerning a possible mechanism of the experimentally measured properties of high-T$_c$ cuprates in the "strange metal" phase of their phase diagram. We believe , these results provide support to the quantum thermodynamic time crystal model of the Euclidean Q-balls considered in the present paper.

Title: The Role of Flexoelectric Coupling and Chemical Strains in the Emergence of Polar Chiral Nano-Structures
Authors: Anna N. Morozovska, Salia Cherifi-Hertel, Eugene A. Eliseev, Victoria V. Khist, Riccardo Hertel, Dean R. Evans
Abstract: This review examines the conditions that lead to the formation of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in thin films and core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. It also analyzes possible mechanisms by which the flexoelectric effect impacts the polarization structure in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. Special attention is given to the role of the anisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization states with distinct chiral properties, referred to as "flexons". In the first part of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the polarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures in uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the transition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs gradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings indicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains, termed as "flexo-chemical" coupling, can significantly influence the effective Curie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality in multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening effects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization morphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of the review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics elements and cryptography. We underline the possibilities of the flexoelectric control of multiple-degenerated labyrinthine states, which may correspond to a differential negative capacitance (NC) state stabilized in the uniaxial ferroelectric core by the presence of a screening shell.

Title: Exact steady states and fragmentation-induced relaxation in the no-passing asymmetric simple exclusion process
Authors: Urei Miura
Abstract: We introduce a multi-species generalization of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with a ``no-passing" constraint, forbidding overtaking, on a one-dimensional open chain. This no-passing rule fragments the Hilbert space into an exponential number of disjoint sectors labeled by the particle sequence, leading to relaxation dynamics that depend sensitively on the initial ordering. We construct exact matrix-product steady states in every particle sequence sector and derive closed-form expressions for the particle-number distribution and two-point particle correlation functions. In the two-species case, we identify a parameter regime where some sectors relax in finite time while others exhibit metastable relaxation dynamics, revealing the coexistence of fast and slow dynamics and strong particle sequence sector dependence. Our results uncover a novel mechanism for non-equilibrium metastability arising from Hilbert space fragmentation in exclusion processes.

Title: Electronic structure of compressively strained thin film La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in the bulk nickelates under high pressure is a major advance in physics. The recent observation of superconductivity at ambient pressure in compressively strained bilayer nickelate thin films has now enabled direct characterization of the superconducting phase through angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Here we present an in-situ ARPES study of compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ films grown by oxide molecular beam epitaxy, and the ozone treated counterparts with an onset T$_c$ of 40 K, supplemented with results from pulsed laser deposition films with similar T$_c$. We resolve a systematic strain-driven electronic band shift with respect to that of bulk crystals, in qualitative agreement with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, the strongly renormalized flat 3$d_{z2}$ band shifts a factor of 5-10 smaller than anticipated by DFT. Furthermore, it stays ~70 meV below the Fermi level, contradicting the expectation that superconductivity results from the high density of states of this band at the Fermi level. We also observed a non-trivial k$_z$ dispersion of the cuprate-like 3$d_{x2-y2}$ band. Combined with results from both X-ray diffraction and DFT, we suggest that the strained films are under ~5 GPa effective pressure, considerably larger than the naïve expectation from the DFT relaxed structure. Finally, the ~70 meV energy position is intriguingly close to the collective mode coupling more prominently seen in thin films, in the energy range of both oxygen related phonons and the maximum of the spin excitation spectrum.

Abstract: We present in this work a molecular dynamics study of a size effect relating to the volume fraction of gamma-prime precipitate of edge dislocation motion in a simple model of Nickel superalloys. We model the superalloy as periodically spaced cubic gamma-prime precipitates inside a uniform gamma matrix. We then analyze the motion of paired edge dislocations in the gamma phase when subject to an external shear stress for various volume fractions of the gamma-prime precipitate for a wide range of temperatures, from 300 K to 700 K. While the variation of dislocation velocity is not significant, the critical resolved shear stress is found to exhibit a power law dependence on the volume fraction of the gamma-prime precipitate with two distinct regimes which have similar exponent but markedly different prefactors; we also observe that this two-regime behavior remains true across a wide range of temperatures. We present a detailed analysis of this behavior and reduce it to a linear dependence of the critical resolved shear stress on the length of the gamma-prime precipitate along the direction of dislocation motion. We further identify the critical length scale underlying the transition between the two observed regimes as the total core width of the paired dislocations in a pure gamma-prime system, which includes in addition to the complex stacking fault separating the partials of the paired dislocations the width of the anti-phase boundary that is formed between the super-dislocations. The results presented in this work provides new details on the strengthening effect of gamma-prime precipitates in nickel superalloys and also has important implications for larger scale dislocation dynamics studies for nickel superalloys.

Abstract: The drive for solid-state heating and cooling technologies is fuelled by their potential for enhanced sustainability and environmental impact compared to traditional vapour compression devices. The recent discovery of colossal barocaloric (BC) effects in the plastic crystal (PC) neopentyl glycol (NPG) has highlighted PCs as promising candidates for future solid-state thermal management. However, achieving optimal operational temperatures, low-pressure requirements, and substantial entropy changes in a single material remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to address these constraints by forming a ternary solid solution of neopentyl PCs: NPG, pentaglycerine (PG) and pentaerythritol (PE). Notably, by including only a small quantity (2%) of the third component, we observe a seven-fold increase in reversible isothermal entropy change (|$\Delta S_{it,rev}$| = 13.4 J kg-1 K-1) and twenty-fold increase in operational temperature span ($\Delta T_{span }$ = 18 K) at pressures of 1 kbar, compared to pure NPG. The origin of these enhancements is revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering and synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction. We find a reduction in the activation energies of the rotational modes associated with the main entropic component of the BC effect, linked to a weakening of the intermolecular hydrogen bond network. This is proposed to improve the phase transition reversibility and operational temperature span by facilitating a broadened first-order phase transition, characterised by a significant phase co-existence region. These findings suggest an effective strategy for practicable molecular BCs, which is to design solid solutions that exploit the large compositional phase space of multi-component molecular systems.

Title: A Graph-Theoretic Framework for Free-Parafermion Solvability
Authors: Ryan L. Mann, Samuel J. Elman, David R. Wood, Adrian Chapman
Abstract: We present a graph-theoretic characterisation of when a quantum spin model admits an exact solution via a mapping to free parafermions. Our characterisation is based on the concept of a frustration graph, which represents the commutation relations between Weyl operators of a Hamiltonian. We show that a quantum spin system has an exact free-parafermion solution if its frustration graph is an oriented indifference graph. Further, we show that if the frustration graph of a model can be dipath oriented via switching operations, then the model is integrable in the sense that there is a family of commuting independent set charges. Additionally, we establish an efficient algorithm for deciding whether this is possible. Our characterisation extends that given for free-fermion solvability. Finally, we apply our results to solve three qudit spin models.

Title: Quasi-Perfect State Transfer in Spin Chains via Parametrization of On-Site Energies
Authors: Fateh Bezaz, Chad C. Nelmes, Marta P. Estarellas, Timothy P. Spiller, Irene D'Amico
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of state transfer in spin chains, with the aim of achieving perfect state transfer for quantum information processing applications. Previous research has mainly focused on manipulating inter-site couplings within spin chains; here, we investigate in detail the potential of modifying on-site energies to facilitate precise quantum information transfer. Our findings demonstrate that through targeted adjustments to the diagonal elements of the XY Hamiltonian and leveraging a genetic algorithm, quasi-perfect state transfer can be achieved with careful consideration of the system's spectral characteristics. This investigation into on-site energies offers an alternative approach for achieving high-fidelity state transfer, especially in cases where manipulation of inter-site couplings may be impractical. This study thus represents a significant advancement towards unlocking the diverse applications of spin chains within practical quantum information systems.

Title: Datatractor: Metadata, automation, and registries for extractor interoperability in the chemical and materials sciences
Authors: Matthew L. Evans, Gian-Marco Rignanese, David Elbert, Peter Kraus
Abstract: Two key issues hindering the transition towards FAIR data science are the poor discoverability and inconsistent instructions for the use of data extractor tools, i.e., how we go from raw data files created by instruments, to accessible metadata and scientific insight. If the existing format conversion tools are hard to find, install, and use, their reimplementation will lead to a duplication of effort, and an increase in the associated maintenance burden is inevitable. The Datatractor framework presented in this work addresses these issues. First, by providing a curated registry of such extractor tools their discoverability will increase. Second, by describing them using a standardised but lightweight schema, their installation and use is machine-actionable. Finally, we provide a reference implementation for such data extraction. The Datatractor framework can be used to provide a public-facing data extraction service, or be incorporated into other research data management tools providing added value.

Title: Quantum linear algebra for disordered electrons
Authors: Jielun Chen, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: We describe how to use quantum linear algebra to simulate a physically realistic model of disordered non-interacting electrons. The physics of disordered electrons outside of one dimension challenges classical computation due to the critical nature of the Anderson localization transition or the presence of large localization lengths, while the atypical distribution of the local density of states limits the power of disorder averaged approaches. Starting from the block-encoding of a disordered non-interacting Hamiltonian, we describe how to simulate key physical quantities, including the reduced density matrix, Green's function, and local density of states, as well as bulk-averaged observables such as the linear conductivity, using the quantum singular value transformation, quantum amplitude estimation, and trace estimation. We further discuss a quantum advantage that scales polynomially with system size and exponentially with lattice dimension.

Title: Floquet driven long-range interactions induce super-extensive scaling in quantum batteries
Authors: Stavya Puri, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: Achieving quantum advantage in energy storage and power extraction is a primary objective in the design of quantum-based batteries. We explore how long-range (LR) interactions in conjunction with Floquet driving can improve the performance of quantum batteries, particularly when the battery is initialized in a fully polarized state. In particular, we analytically prove that the upper bound of the instantaneous power obtained through this system-charger duo scales quadratically with moderate system-size. By optimizing the driving frequency, we demonstrate that the maximum average power which is a lower bound of the instantaneous power can achieve the super-extensive scaling with system-size, thereby providing genuine quantum advantage. Further, we illustrate that the inclusion of either two-body or many-body interaction terms in the LR charging Hamiltonian leads to a scaling benefit. We also discover that a super-linear scaling in power results from increasing the strength of interaction compared to the transverse magnetic field and the range of interaction with low fall-off rate, highlighting the advantageous role of long-range interactions in optimizing quantum battery charging.

Title: The surface code beyond Pauli channels: Logical noise coherence, information-theoretic measures, and errorfield-double phenomenology
Authors: Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri
Abstract: We consider the surface code under errors featuring both coherent and incoherent components and study the coherence of the corresponding logical noise channel and how this impacts information-theoretic measures of code performance, namely coherent information and quantum relative entropy. Using numerical simulations and a phenomenological field theory, focusing on the most general single-qubit X-error channel, we show that, for any nonzero incoherent noise component, the coherence of the logical noise is exponentially suppressed with the code distance. We also find that the information-theoretic measures require this suppression to detect optimal thresholds for Pauli recovery; they thus require increasingly large distances for increasing error coherence and ultimately break down for fully coherent errors. To obtain our results, we develop a statistical mechanics mapping and a corresponding matrix-product-state algorithm for approximate syndrome sampling. These methods enable the large-scale simulation of these non-Pauli errors, including their maximum-likelihood thresholds, away from the limits captured by previous approaches.

Title: Gapless higher-order topology and corner states in Floquet systems
Authors: Longwen Zhou, Rongtao Wang, Jiaxin Pan
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.

Title: Generating Generalised Ground-State Ansatzes from Few-Body Examples
Authors: Matt Lourens, Ilya Sinayskiy, Johannes N. Kriel, Francesco Petruccione
Abstract: We introduce a method that generates ground-state ansatzes for quantum many-body systems which are both analytically tractable and accurate over wide parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a custom symbolic language to construct tensor network states (TNS) via an evolutionary algorithm. This language provides operations that allow the generated TNS to automatically scale with system size. Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground-state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to restore broken symmetries and obtain exact expressions for the expectation values of local observables and correlation functions.

Title: On the generalized Langevin equation and the Mori projection operator technique
Authors: Christoph Widder, Johannes Zimmer, Tanja Schilling
Abstract: In statistical physics, the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism (also called Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator formalism) is used to derive a linear integro-differential equation for observables in Hilbert space, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). This technique relies on the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part. We prove that the GLE together with the second fluctuation dissipation theorem (2FDT) uniquely define the fluctuating forces as well as the memory kernel. The GLE and 2FDT are an immediate consequence of the existence and uniqueness of solutions of linear Volterra equations. They neither rely on the Dyson identity nor on the concept of orthogonal dynamics. This holds true for autonomous as well as non-autonomous systems. Further results are obtained for the Mori projection for autonomous systems, for which the fluctuating forces are orthogonal to the observable of interest. In particular, we prove that the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup generated by $\overline{\mathcal{QL}}Q$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the time evolution operator, and $\mathcal{P}=1-\mathcal{Q}$ is the Mori projection operator. As a consequence, the corresponding orbit maps (e.g. the fluctuating forces) are the unique mild solutions of the associated abstract Cauchy problem. Furthermore, we show that the orthogonal dynamics is a unitary group, if $\mathcal{L}$ is skew-adjoint. In this case, the fluctuating forces are stationary. In addition, we present a proof of the GLE by means of semigroup theory, and we retrieve the commonly used definitions for the fluctuating forces, memory kernel, and orthogonal dynamics. Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems, whose time evolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup. This includes large classes of systems in classical statistical mechanics.

Title: Hybrid interfaces at the single quantum level in fluorescent molecules
Authors: Daniele De Bernardis, Hugo Levy-Falk, Elena Fanella, Rocco Duquennoy, Valerio Digiorgio, Giacomo Scalari, Maja Colautti, Costanza Toninelli
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a single fluorescent molecule as a hybrid quantum optical device, in which multiple external laser sources exert control of the vibronic states. In the high-saturation regime, a coherent interaction is established between the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom, and molecules can simulate several cavity QED models, whereby a specific vibrational mode plays the role of the cavity mode. Focusing on the specific example where the system is turned into an analogue simulator of the quantum Rabi model, the steady state exhibits vibrational bi-modality resulting in a statistical mixture of highly non-classical vibronic cat states. Applying our paradigm to molecules with prominent spatial asymmetry and combining an optical excitation with a THz(IR) driving, the system can be turned into a single photon transducer. Two possible implementations are discussed based on the coupling to a subwavelength THz patch antenna or a resonant metamaterial. In a nutshell, this work assesses the role of molecules as an optomechanical quantum toolbox for creating hybrid entangled states of electrons, photons, and vibrations, hence enabling frequency conversion over very different energy scales.

Title: Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point
Authors: Aditya Banerjee
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point between states deep inside the para- and ferromagnetic regimes. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states and recurrences of an approximately Page-like dynamics of entanglement entropies of one- and two-spin subsystems, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.
