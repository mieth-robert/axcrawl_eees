Title: Crushing, Comminution and Fracture: Extreme Particle Deformation in Three-Dimensional Granular Aggregates
Authors: Debdeep Bhattacharya, Davood Damircheli, Robert P. Lipton
Abstract: We present a high-fidelity three dimensional computational framework for simulating the bulk mechanical behavior of granular aggregates composed of deformable brittle grains. Departing from classical discrete element methods (DEM), our approach captures both inter-particle and intra-particle deformation using a nonlocal continuum formulation based on peridynamics. Each grain is individually meshed from level-set representations, enabling accurate modeling of elastic response and autonomous fracture evolution without requiring explicit crack tracking or fragment reconstruction. We validate the method through benchmark simulations, including the Kalthoff-Winkler fracture test, crushing of hollow spheres, and compound impact-crushing scenarios. The framework is further applied to large aggregates of up to 1000 sand grains of irregular shapes reconstructed from three dimensional X-ray computed tomography. Simulations reveal convergence of bulk stress response under compression, suggesting the feasibility of constructing representative volume elements (RVEs) for multiscale modeling. Finally, we investigate the role of grain geometry and topology on the macroscopic strength of the aggregate, providing insight into microstructure-driven failure mechanisms. The framework exhibits excellent strong and weak scaling behavior, with simulations executed on up to 1600 cores, demonstrating its suitability for high-performance computing environments and large-scale modeling.

Title: 3D tracking of Plankton with single-camera stereoscopy
Authors: J. Moscatelli, X Benoit Gonin, F. Elias
Abstract: We introduce a device developed to perform a 3D tracking of passive or active particles under flow, confined in a medium of hundreds micrometers wide. Micro-objects are placed inside a vertical glass capillary and two mirrors are set behind it with a certain angle, making it possible to have the two reflections of the capillary on the same optical plane. A 3D reconstruction of the trajectories, captured with a single camera, is carried out along the vertical axis with a micrometer-scale precision. To investigate the interaction between the shear, the role of the gravity field, and motile microorganism, we track a model puller-type microalgae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under a Poiseuille flow, using first its natural fluorescence and then a bright-field imaging. Understanding how confinement influences motility is crucial, and we show that this 3D tracking setup enables a full description of interactions between a motile organism and a solid border.

Title: The scaling regimes for unsteady diffusion across particle-stabilized fluid interfaces
Authors: T.J.J.M. van Overveld, V. Garbin
Abstract: Colloidal particles at fluid interfaces can enhance the stability of drops and bubbles. Yet, their effect on mass transfer in these multiphase systems remains ambiguous, with some experiments reporting strongly hindered diffusion, while others show nearly no effect, even at near-complete surface coverage. To resolve this ambiguity, we solve the Fick-Jacobs equation for unsteady diffusion, allowing us to treat the particle-laden interface as a locally reduced cross-sectional area for mass transfer. Our numerical solutions reveal two limiting regimes, with the particle layer hindering diffusion only at short times. Guided by analytical solutions for a homogeneous layer with reduced diffusivity, we derive quantitative expressions for the transport regimes and associated transition times for diffusion across the particle layer. This analysis yields a simple criterion for long-term hindrance that accurately distinguishes between conflicting experimental results, providing a unifying framework for mass transfer in particle-laden multiphase systems.

Title: Hyperelastic characterization via deep indentation
Authors: Mohammad Shojaeifard, Mattia Bacca
Abstract: Hyperelastic material characterization is crucial for understanding the behavior of soft materials, such as tissues, rubbers, hydrogels, and polymers, under quasi-static loading before failure. Traditional methods typically rely on uniaxial tensile tests, which require the cumbersome preparation of dumbbell-shaped samples for clamping in a uniaxial testing machine. In contrast, indentation-based methods, which can be conducted in situ without sample preparation, have been underexplored. To characterize the hyperelastic behavior of soft materials, deep indentation is required, where the material response extends beyond linear elasticity. In this study, we perform finite element analysis to link the force (F) vs. indentation depth (D) curve with the hyperelastic behavior of a soft incompressible material, using a one-term Ogden model for simplicity. We identify three indentation regimes based on the ratio between indentation depth and the radius (R) of the spherical-tipped cylindrical indenter: (1) the Hertzian regime (D<0.1 R) with F=ER^0.5 D^1.5 16/9, (2) the parabolic regime (D>10 R) with F=ED^2 \b{eta}, where the indenter radius becomes irrelevant, and (3) an intermediate regime (0.1 R<D<10 R) bridging the two extremes. We find that the Ogden strain-stiffening coefficient ({\alpha}) increases the parabolic indentation coefficient (\b{eta}), allowing for the estimation of {\alpha} from \b{eta}. Furthermore, we observe that Coulomb friction increases \b{eta}, potentially masking the effect of strain-stiffening for small {\alpha}. However, for {\alpha}>3, friction has a negligible effect. Finally, our results show good agreement with experimental data, demonstrating that deep indentation can be an effective method for extracting hyperelastic properties from soft materials through in-situ testing.

Title: Kilobyte-Scale, Selector-Free, Temperature-Hard AlScN Ferroelectric Diode Crossbar Arrays
Authors: Zirun Han, Chao-Chuan Chen, Dhiren K. Pradhan, David C. Moore, Ravali Gudavalli, Xindi Yang, Kwan-Ho Kim, Hyunmin Cho, Zachary Anderson, Spencer Ware, Harsh Yellai, W. Joshua Kennedy, Nicholas R. Glavin, Roy H. Olsson III, Deep Jariwala
Abstract: We report the fabrication and characterization of kilobyte-scale, selector-free, ferroelectric (FE) diode crossbar memory arrays based on aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). Utilizing a fully CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible process, we fabricated 2-kilobyte (128 $\times$ 128) arrays with device diameters down to 5 $\mu$m, achieving memory densities up to 2500 bits/mm$^2$. Large-scale electrical characterization across 1000 randomly selected devices reveals a yield rate of 95.2%, a tight switching voltage distribution with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.003, and consistent on/off ratios of around 10 with a CV of 0.27. We demonstrate selector-free read and program operations of the array, enabled by the high nonlinearity, rectification, and uniform switching behavior of the FE diodes. Furthermore, we verified consistent ferroelectric switching during array operation at temperatures up to 600 $^\circ$C. Our results highlight the potential of AlScN FE diode arrays for energy-efficient, high-density memory applications and lay the groundwork for future integration in compute-near-memory, high-temperature memory, and analog compute-in-memory systems.

Title: Emergent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless deconfinement in super-Coulombic plasmas
Authors: Ayush De, Leo Radzihovsky, Snir Gazit
Abstract: We study the statistical mechanics of two-dimensional "super-Coulombic" plasmas, namely, neutral plasmas with power-law interactions longer-ranged than Coulomb. To that end, we employ numerically exact large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Contrary to naive energy-entropy arguments, we observe a charge confinement-deconfinement transition as a function of temperature. Remarkably, the transition lies in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) universality class. Our results corroborate recent dielectric medium and renormalization group calculations predicting effective long-scale Coulomb interactions in microscopically super-Coulombic gases. We explicitly showcase this novel dielectric screening phenomenon, capturing the emergent Coulomb potential and the associated crossover length scale. This is achieved by utilizing a new test charge based methodology for determining effective inter-particle interactions. Lastly, we show that this Coulomb emergence and the associated BKT transition occur universally across generic interactions and densities.

Title: Probing quantum geometry with two-dimensional nonlinear optical spectroscopy
Authors: Paul Froese, Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Yong Baek Kim
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the nonlinear optical response of crystalline systems is fundamentally a quantum geometric property. In this work, we propose two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), which measures the nonlinear conductivity as a function of two independent frequencies using two time-delayed light pulses, as a probe of quantum geometry. We show how the two-frequency second-order nonlinear conductivity, which is naturally measured by 2DCS, decomposes into distinct quantum geometric contributions. We identify a term arising from the multi-band quantum connection that does not appear in linear response, and show that it can be measured in isolation by considering specific polarizations and enforcing time-reversal symmetry. We explore this finding via model calculations for transition metal dichalcogenides and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Through these examples, we demonstrate how 2DCS enables study of the quantum connection, providing a way to compare the quantum geometry of different materials. We also show that one can gain rough momentum-resolved knowledge of the quantum geometry by varying the chemical potential.

Title: Embrittling bulk metals into hydride in acid solution
Authors: Ankang Chen, Zihao Huo, Jiewen Liu, Chuang Liu, Yongming Sui, Xuan Liu, Qingkun Yuan, Bao Yuan, Yan Li, Defang Duan, Bo Zou
Abstract: Hydride induced embrittlement (HIE), in which the hydrogen infiltrates metal lattices to form hydrides, typically causes catastrophic failure. Inspired by HIE effect, we propose an "HIE-mediated synthesis" approach, where bulk metal foils serve as precursors and oleic/sulfuric acid act as hydrogen donors under solvo/hydrothermal conditions, enabling the synthesis of 18 high-purity metal hydrides (MgH$_2$, ScH$_2$, YH$_2$, LaH$_2$, LaH$_{2.3}$, SmH$_2$, LuH$_2$, TiH$_2$, $\delta$-ZrH$_{1.6}$, $\epsilon$-ZrH$_2$, HfH$_{1.7}$, HfH$_2$, VH$_{0.8}$, VH$_2$, NbH, NbH$_2$, Ta$_2$H, and TaH). Integrated high-pressure experiments and first-principles calculations, the concept of equivalent chemical pressure ($\Delta$Pc) was introduced to elucidate the mechanism of synthesizing and stabilizing metal hydrides in an acidic environment. This mechanism predicts the synthesis of challenging hydrides such as LiH. Our approach successfully converts HIE from a primary culprit of material failure to an effective contributor in hydride synthesis.

Title: Theory of plasmon spectroscopy with the quantum twisting microscope
Authors: Nemin Wei, Francisco Guinea, Felix von Oppen, Leonid I. Glazman
Abstract: We consider plasmon-assisted electron tunneling in a quantum twisting microscope (QTM). The dependence of the differential conductance on the two control parameters of the QTM -- the twist angle and bias -- reveals the plasmon spectrum as well as the strength of plasmon-electron interactions in the sample. We perform microscopic calculations for twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), to predict the plasmon features in the tunneling spectra of TBG close to the magic angle for different screening environments. Our work establishes a general framework for inelastic tunneling spectroscopy of collective electronic excitations using the quantum twisting microscope.

Title: All-electrically controlled spintronics in altermagnetic heterostructures
Authors: Pei-Hao Fu, Qianqian Lv, Yong Xu, Jorge Cayao, Jun-Feng Liu, Xiang-Long Yu
Abstract: The recent development of altermagnetic materials, supporting spin splitting without net magnetization, opens new directions for spintronics that are fundamentally distinct from conventional ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or spin-orbit coupling systems. Here we investigate spin-selective quantum transport in heterostructures composed of a normal metal and a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet. We focus on two types of $d$-wave altermagnets, namely, weak and strong altermagnets that support close elliptic and open hyperbolic spin-resolved Fermi surfaces, respectively. Building on these distinct electronic structures, we propose all-electrically controlled spin filter and spin valve devices, where quantum resonant tunneling enables highly spin-polarized conductance tunable via gate voltage and interface transparency. In particular, we find that strong altermagnets allow gate-tunable full spin polarization that is robust against interface scattering and can be reversed by gate control. We further demonstrate that a double-gated spin valve electrically switches between parallel and antiparallel spin configurations, analogous to magnetic junctions but without the need for external magnetic fields. Our results establish both weak and strong altermagnets as promising platforms for realizing magnetic-field-free electrically tunable spintronic functionalities.

Title: Phonon dephasing times determined with time-delayed, broadband CARS
Authors: Franz Hempel, Michael Rüsing, Federico Vernuccio, Kai J. Spychala, Robin Buschbeck, Giulio Cerullo, Dario Polli, Lukas M. Eng
Abstract: Coherent Raman scattering techniques as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), offer significant advantages in terms of pixel dwell times and speed as compared to spontaneous Raman scattering for investigations of crystalline materials. However, the spectral information in CARS is often hampered by the presence of a non-resonant contribution to the scattering process that shifts and distorts the Raman peaks. In this work, we apply a method to obtain non-resonant background-free spectra based on time-delayed, broadband CARS (TD-BCARS) using an intra-pulse excitation scheme. In particular, this method can measure the phononic dephasing times across the full phonon spectrum at once. We test the methodology on amorphous SiO2 (glass), which is used to characterize the setup-specific and material-independent response times, and then apply TD-BCARS to the analysis of single crystals of diamond and ferroelectrics of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) and potassium titanyl arsenate (KTA). For diamond, we determine a dephasing time of t = 7.81 ps for the single sp3 peak.

Title: Cyclic loading of a heterogeneous non-linear poroelastic material
Authors: Zoe C. Godard, Derek E. Moulton, Sarah L. Waters
Abstract: Cyclic loading is a common feature in poroelastic systems, the material response depending non-trivially on the exact form of boundary conditions, pore structure, and mechanical properties. The situation becomes more complex when heterogeneity is introduced in the properties of the poroelastic material, yet heterogeneity too is common in physical poroelastic structures. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of a soft porous material in response to a uniaxial cyclic stress or displacement, with a focus on understanding how this response is affected by continuous heterogeneity in the stiffness or permeability. Our work is motivated by observed altered material properties of the diseased tendon, but the framework we develop and analyse is generically applicable. We construct a one-dimensional non-linear poroelastic model, assuming Darcy flow through the pores of the solid skeleton which we assume has neo-Hookean elasticity. The system is driven by an applied uniaxial cyclic stress or a uniaxial cyclic displacement at one boundary. Heterogeneity in the stiffness or permeability profile is imposed via a Gaussian bump function. By exploring a range of loading frequencies together with magnitudes and locations of heterogeneity, we characterise the effect of heterogeneity on the response of the material, and show that the response of the system to an applied stress is qualitatively distinct from the response to an applied displacement. Our analysis of this simple model provides a foundation for understanding how heterogeneity affects the poroelastic response to cyclic loading.

Title: Twist-Angle-Controlled Anomalous Gating in Bilayer Graphene/BN Heterostructures
Authors: G. Maffione, L. S. Farrar, M. Kapfer, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, H. Aubin, D. Mailly, R. Ribeiro-Palau
Abstract: Anomalous gating effects-such as gate ineffectiveness and pronounced hysteresis-have been observed in graphene-based systems encapsulated in boron nitride (BN) and linked to a possible ferroelectric state. However, their origin, stability, and reproducibility remain under debate. Here, we present charge transport experiments in dual-gated, dynamically rotatable van der Waals heterostructures based on bilayer graphene encapsulated in BN. Remarkably, the angular degree of freedom acts as an ON/OFF switch for the anomalous gating response. We show that the angular alignment between the two BN layers -- not the presence of a moiré superlattice with graphene -- is the key parameter governing these effects. The relevant alignment between the two BN layers, to observe the anomalous gating effect at room temperature, lies between 15 deg and 45 deg, with no evidence of the expected 60 deg periodicity. Both gate ineffectiveness and hysteresis are highly sensitive to small angular changes, which we classify into three distinct regimes. Our results clarify the conditions necessary to reproduce these phenomena and pave the way for theoretical investigation of their microscopic origins.

Title: Axionic nonreciprocal superconductivity
Authors: Maitê Kessler de Azambuja, David Möckli
Abstract: In nonreciprocal superconductors, inversion and time-reversal symmetries are absent, which may be broken extrinsically or spontaneously. Here, we consider a simple BCS model with both attractive singlet and attractive triplet pairing channels. We show that when the triplet instability dominates, the model predicts a nonreciprocal superconducting state of the axionic subtype, in which both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are spontaneously broken by the superconductivity without requiring spin-orbit coupling. This leads to characteristic experimental signatures of spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, such as a two-step transition in the specific heat. We critically analyze whether familiar pairing mechanisms such as the electron-phonon interaction and ferromagnetic spin fluctuations could produce such an axionic state.

Title: Low-temperature cotunneling electron transport in photo-switchable molecule-nanoparticle networks
Authors: Yannick Viero, David Guérin, Dominique Vuillaume
Abstract: We report the temperature-dependent (4.2 - 300 K) electron transport properties (current-voltage) of photo-switchable two-dimensional arrays of gold nanoparticles (10 nm in diameter) functionalized by azobenzene derivatives. Under UV-light irradiation at 4.2 K, the azobenzene moieties are switched from the trans to cis isomers, leading to an increase of the current. In both conformations, at low temperature (< 77 K) and low voltage (< 1 V) the voltage- and temperature-dependent current behaviors show that electron cotunneling is the dominant transport mechanism. The number of cotunneling events Ncot slightly increases from ca. 1. 4 to 1.7 upon trans-to-cis isomerization of the azobenzenes. The nanoparticle Coulomb charging energy is not significantly modified (ca. 15 meV) by the azobenzene isomerization. This weak increase of Ncot is explained by the modest cis/trans current ratio (< 10) and the limited numbers of nanoparticle-molecule-nanoparticle junctions inserted between the two nanoscale electrodes (< 50 nm apart) connecting the network.

Title: Cavity-mediated exciton hopping in a dielectrically engineered polariton system
Authors: Lukas Husel, Farsane Tabataba-Vakili, Johannes Scherzer, Lukas Krelle, Ismail Bilgin, Samarth Vadia, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Iacopo Carusotto, Alexander Högele
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons - coherently hybridized states of excitons and photons - are instrumental for solid-state nonlinear optics and quantum simulations. To enable engineered polariton energy landscapes and interactions, local control over the particle-like states can be achieved by tuning the properties of the exciton constituent. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides stand out in this respect, as they readily allow for a deterministic, flexible and scalable control of excitons, and thus of hybrid exciton-polaritons, via environmental dielectric engineering. Here, we demonstrate the realization of mesoscopic exciton-polariton domains in a structured dielectric exciton environment, and establish an effective long-range exciton hopping in the dispersive regime of cavity-coupling. Our results represent a crucial step toward interacting polaritonic networks and quantum simulations in exciton-polariton lattices based on dielectrically tailored two-dimensional semiconductors.

Title: Rheology of bidisperse suspensions at the colloidal-to-granular transition
Authors: Xuan Li, John R. Royer, Christopher Ness
Abstract: We use particle-based simulation to study the rheology of dense suspensions comprising mixtures of small colloids and larger grains, which exhibit shear thinning at low shear rates and shear thickening at high shear rates. By systematically varying the volume fraction of the two species, we demonstrate a monotonic increase in viscosity when grains are added to colloids, but, conversely, a nonmonotonic response in both the viscosity and shear thickening onset when colloids are added to grains. Both effects are most prominent at intermediate shear rates where diffusion and convection play similar roles in the dynamics. We rationalise these results by measuring the maximum flowable volume fraction as functions of the Peclet number and composition, showing that in extreme cases increasing the solids content can allow a jammed suspension to flow. These results establish a constitutive description for the rheology of bidisperse suspensions across the colloidal-to-granular transition, with implications for flow prediction and control in multicomponent particulate systems.

Title: BO-graphane and BO-diamane
Authors: Babu Ram, Rohit Anand, Arun S. Nissimagoudar, Geunsik Lee, Rodney S Ruoff
Abstract: The adsorption of boron and oxygen atoms onto mono- and multi-layer graphene leads to the formation of a buckled graphene layer (BO-graphane) and a 2D diamond-like structure (BO-diamane) sandwiched between boron monoxide layers per DFT calculations. BO-graphane has a calculated Young's modulus ($\it{E}$) of 750 GPA and BO-diamane 771 GPa, higher than the calculated $\it{E}$ of -F,-OH, and -H diamanes; this is due to the presence of B-O bonds in the functionalizing layers. Electronic band structure calculations show BO-graphane and BO-diamane are wide band gap semiconductors with an indirect band gap up to a thickness of three layers (3L). Phonon dispersion and $ab-initio$ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations confirm dynamic and thermal stability, maintaining structural integrity at 1000 K. The room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of BO-graphane and BO-diamane is found to be 879 W/m.K and 1260 W/m.K, respectively, surpassing BeO (385 W/m.K), MgO (64 W/m.K), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (36 W/m.K); and F-diamane (377 W/m.K), and comparable to H-diamane (1145-1960 W/m.K), suggesting them as candidates for thermal management in applications.

Title: Magnetic Moiré Systems: a review
Authors: Paula Mellado
Abstract: This review synthesizes recent advancements in the study of moiré magnetism. This emerging field, at the intersection of twistronics, topology, and strongly correlated systems, explores novel phenomena that arise when moiré potentials influence magnetic two-dimensional systems. The manuscript presents recent advances highlighting the interfacial incongruity as a novel mechanism for regulating the magnetism of two-dimensional materials and for the manifestation of various phenomena in twisted and mismatched magnetic two-dimensional interfaces. The manuscript addresses seminal and recent experimental and theoretical advances associated with both small- and large-period magnetic moiré lattices, including novel magnetic phases, low-energy and topological magnetic excitations, magnetic and electronic transport, optical properties, phase transitions, and prospective applications of these materials. Moiré magnetism signifies a promising frontier for manipulating complex quantum states in quantum matter. The ongoing advances in this field are poised to impact condensed matter physics, materials science, and quantum information science.

Title: Coherent phonon motions and ordered vacancy compound mediated quantum path interference in Cu-poor CuIn$_{x}$Ga$_{(1-x)}$Se$_2$ (CIGS) with attosecond transient absorption
Authors: Hugo Laurell, Jonah R. Adelman, Elizaveta Yakovleva, Carl Hägglund, Kostiantyn Sopiha, Axel Stenquist, Han K. D. Le, Peidong Yang, Marika Edoff, Stephen R. Leone
Abstract: In this study, coherent phonon motion is observed in bandgap excited CuIn$_{x}$Ga$_{(1-x)}$Se$_2$ (CIGS) utilizing extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy across the Se M$_{4,5}$ absorption edge. Two frequencies of coherent phonon motion are resolved, a low frequency mode attributed through Raman measurements to the $A_{1g}$ phonon motion of a Cu-deficient ordered vacancy compound (OVC), while the high frequency mode originates from the $A_{1g}$ phonon motion in the chalcopyrite phase. The two oscillations lead to modulations in the XUV differential absorption $\Delta A(\epsilon,\tau)$ due to energy shifts of the Se M$_{4,5}$ edge, with a minima occuring approximately 1 ps after the band gap excitation. The hot carrier cooling time of holes and electrons are disentangled and the observed slower cooling of holes is attributed to the higher density of hole states in the valence band. We also observe fast oscillations (18.6(3) fs period) across the Se absorption edge, which are interpreted to originate from quantum path interference between the electronic conduction bands of the chalcopyrite CIGS and OVC phases, opening the possibility towards quantum coherent metrology in photovoltaics on the femtosecond timescale. The complex interplay between the chalcopyrite and OVC phases are revealed in this investigation through both coherent vibrational and electronic motions.

Title: Magnetic excitations in the 1/3 plateau state in InCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_3$
Authors: Moyu Kato, Hiroyuki K. Yoshida, R. Kumar, Yoshihiko Ihara
Abstract: Magnetic dynamics in InCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_3$ was investigated from the NMR relaxation rate measurement. In InCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_3$, the magnetization isotherm shows a plateau at the 1/3 of full-saturation magnetization, characterizing the 1/3 plateau state. As the 1/3 plateau state appears above 7 T upto 14 T, the microscopic magnetic properties were investigated with the NMR measurement in steady fields. The temperature and field dependence of $1/T_1$ measurement reveals a gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum and its evolution with field in the 1/3 plateau state. The field dependence of spin gap provides an important information to understand the microscopic origin of 1/3 plateau state in the kagome antiferromagnets.

Title: Molecular dynamics of $cis$-polybutadiene across glass transition revealed by muonated-radical spin relaxation
Authors: S. Takeshita, H. Okabe, M. Hiraishi, K. M. Kojima, A. Koda, H. Seto, T. Masui, N. Wakabayashi, F. L. Pratt, R. Kadono
Abstract: The local molecular motion of $cis$-polybutadiene, a typical polymeric material exhibiting a glass transition ($T_{\rm g}=168$ K), has been investigated by the spin relaxation of muonated radicals, where the relaxation is induced by the fluctuation of hyperfine (HF) fields exerted from unpaired electron to nearby muon and surrounding protons. The relaxation rate ($1/T_\mu$) measured under various longitudinal magnetic fields was analyzed by the recently developed theory of spin relaxation to consider the coexistence of quasistatic and fluctuating HF fields, where the fluctuation frequency for the latter ($\nu$) was evaluated over a temperature ($T$) range of 5--320 K. The obtained $\nu(T)$ is found to be well reproduced by the Arrhenius relation, and the activation energy and pre-exponential factor are in good agreement with those for the ``E-process'' revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering and attributed to a fluctuation across three CC bonds. This result demonstrates that muonated-radical spin relaxation is a promising approach for direct access to local molecular motions in the sub-nanosecond range and for their detailed modeling in the atomic scale.

Title: Dynamically stable topological edge states in an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger ladder with balanced perturbation
Authors: E. S. Ma, K. L. Zhang, Z. Song
Abstract: The on-site potentials may break the symmetry of a system, resulting in the loss of its original topology protected by the symmetry. In this work, we study the counteracting effect of non-Hermitian terms on real potentials, resulting in dynamically stable topological edge states. We show exactly for a class of systems that the spectrum remains unchanged in the presence of balanced perturbations. As a demonstration, we investigate an extended non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) ladder. We find that the bulk-boundary correspondence still holds, and the zero-energy edge states become coalescing states. In comparison to the original SSH chain, such edge states are robust not only against local perturbations but also in the time domain. As a result, a trivial initial state can always evolve to a stable edge state. Our results provide insights for the application of time-domain stable topological quantum devices.

Title: Nature of nonanalytic chemical short-range order in metallic alloys
Authors: Hao Deng, Jue-Yi Qi, Qin-Han Xia, Jinshan Li, Xie Zhang
Abstract: Nonanalytic chemical short-range order (SRO) has long been observed in diffuse scattering experiments for metallic alloys. However, considerable debate surrounds the validity of these observations due to the unresolved nature of the nonanalyticity. Using prototypical face-centered cubic alloys as an example, here we demonstrate that SRO in metallic alloys is mostly nonanalytic at {\Gamma}. The nonanalyticity stems from the elastic anisotropy and long-range atomic interactions of the \emph{host} lattice. The physical insights substantially improve our understanding of chemical order in alloys and resolves the long-standing debate in the field. Nonanalytic SRO is expected to be general in alloys and the nonanalyticity may serve as a unique feature to verify the intensely debated existence of SRO in compositionally complex alloys.

Title: Phonon angular momentum induced by Terahertz electric field
Authors: Hong Sun, Xiaozhe Li, Lifa Zhang
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in phonon angular momentum (AM) in recent years, current studies remain limited to a few materials due to the constraints imposed by time reversal symmetry on macroscopic phonon AM. In this work, we theoretically investigate the generation of total phonon AM through alternating terahertz electric fields in polarized materials. In contrast to previous studies on phonon AM, here the off-diagonal elements of the phonon AM operator play an essential role. According to our formula, the large AM is generated when the energy of incident electric fields matches the frequency of optical phonons at {\Gamma} point. Furthermore, a specific resonance on the imaginary part of the response coefficient, as well as periodic regulation of the phonon AM by the phase difference of the driving field, is observed. In polar material GaN, the oscillation maximum is observed as \hbar per unit cell which can be experimentally measured through orbital magnetization induced by phonon AM. Our work offers a promising approach to generate observable phonon AM in a wider range of materials, advancing both the understanding of phonon fundamental physics and potential applications in phononic devices.

Abstract: Small-footprint, low-power arrays of coupled coherent emitters with the capability of near- and far-field engineering and coherence control are highly sought after to meet modern nanophotonics evolving needs. Between existing solutions based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, phase masks in bulk traditional cavity-based systems, and lattices of exciton-polariton condensates, only the strongly light-matter coupled systems were shown to be capable of controlled on-chip interaction between the individual coherent states while often operating at cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate electrically controlled in-plane interaction between optically reconfigurable spatially separated lasing states, operating at room temperature in the weak light-matter coupling regime. We show spatially extended coherent lasing state or "supermode" with wide-range micro-scale control of near-field, far-field and on-chip phase-locking tuning functionality. An extended lasing state appears due to near-field transverse coupling between distinct spatially pumped lasing states in the plane of an organic liquid crystal-filled microcavity. We realize electrical control over the interaction strength between lasing states and corresponding mutual coherence going beyond nearest neighbours through electrical tuning of the microcavity optical modes with external voltage, and a spin-selective directional coupling regime by using a photonic analogue of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction.

Title: Acoustic Phonon Characteristics of Gallium Oxide Single Crystals Investigated with Brillouin-Mandelstam Light Scattering Spectroscopy
Authors: Dylan Wright, Erick Guzman, Md. Sabbir Hossen Bijoy, Richard B. Wilson, Dinusha Herath Mudiyanselage, Houqiang Fu, Fariborz Kargar, Alexander A. Balandin
Abstract: We report an investigation of the bulk and surface acoustic phonons in gallium oxide ultra-wide bandgap single crystals along various crystallographic directions using Brillouin-Mandelstam spectroscopy. Pronounced anisotropy in the acoustic phonon dispersion and velocities was observed across different crystal orientations. The measured average acoustic phonon velocities for the crystallographic directions of interest are 5,250 m/s and 4,990 m/s. The surface acoustic phonons propagate approximately twice as slowly as the bulk acoustic phonons. Our results suggest that the anisotropy of heat conduction in gallium oxide results from the difference in phonon velocities rather than the phonon lifetime. The obtained information for bulk and surface acoustic phonons can be used for developing accurate theoretical models of phonon scattering and optimization of thermal and electrical transport in this technologically important ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor.

Title: pH-Dependent Zeta Potential Induces Diffusiophoretic Focusing in an Acid-Base Reaction
Authors: Ethan Coleman, Ankur Gupta
Abstract: Diffusiophoresis of charged particles in the presence of electrolytes has been extensively studied in the literature. However, in these setups, particles typically move in a single direction, either up or down the electrolyte gradient. Here, we theoretically investigate the conditions under which a particle can reverse its diffusiophoretic direction within the same setup, leading to the formation of a focusing band under steady-state concentration gradients. Using multi-ion diffusiophoresis calculations, we simulate particle transport in an acid-based reaction system where salt is added alongside the acid. For a range of salt concentrations, particles focus within the channel. Our analysis reveals that a pH-dependent zeta potential is necessary for this focusing to occur, and determines where the particles focus, i.e., on or off the acid-base reaction front. We report qualitative agreement with prior experimental observations and derive analytical conditions governing particle focusing, highlighting the delicate balance between concentration gradients and zeta potential variations. The work elucidates the crucial physics of pH-dependent zeta potential and opens new avenues for exploring diffusiophoresis in acid-base systems, with implications for microfluidic design and biophysical transport processes.

Title: Symmetry Classification for Alternating Excitons in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets
Authors: Jiayu David Cao, Konstantin S. Denisov, Yuntian Liu, Igor Zutic
Abstract: Excitons, bound electron-holes states, often dominate the optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials and reflect their inherent properties, including spin-orbit coupling, magnetic ordering, or band topology. By focusing on a growing class of collinear antiferromagnets with a nonrelativistic spin splitting, referred to also as altermagnets (AM), we propose a theoretical framework based on the spin space group (SSG) to elucidate their resulting excitons. Our approach is illustrated on 2D AM with spin-polarized valleys, where we classify the combination of conduction and valence bands by the SSG representations into two cases that hosts bright $s$-like and $p$-like excitons, respectively. This analysis is further supported by effective Hamiltonians and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We identify the excitonic optical selection rules from the calculated absorption spectra and the symmetry of bright excitons from their momentum space envelope functions. Our framework provides optical fingerprints for various cases of AM, while their tunability, such as the strain-induced valley splitting, is also transferred to excitons allowing, additionally, valley-polarized photocurrent generation.

Title: Dynamical Phase Transition of Dissipative Fermionic Superfluids
Authors: Xin-Yuan Gao, Yangqian Yan
Abstract: Driven-dissipative open quantum many-body systems exhibit rich phases that are characterized by the steady states in the long-time dynamics. However, lossy open systems inevitably decay to the vacuum, making their transient evolution the primary focus. Assuming the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov ansatz, we derive a generalized time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equation based on the least action principle for open quantum systems. By solving the quench dynamics after abruptly introducing inelastic scattering or one-body loss in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer limit, we reveal a generic dynamical phase transition: the superfluid order parameter vanishes non-analytically while the superfluid fraction's first-order time derivative undergoes a discontinuous change at a finite critical time. This marks a new paradigm of dynamical phase transitions, distinct from those in closed systems, where the initial state must be finely tuned.

Title: Efficient dataset generation for machine learning perovskite alloys
Authors: Henrietta Homm, Jarno Laakso, Patrick Rinke
Abstract: Lead-based perovskite solar cells have reached high efficiencies, but toxicity and lack of stability hinder their wide-scale adoption. These issues have been partially addressed through compositional engineering of perovskite materials, but the vast complexity of the perovskite materials space poses a significant obstacle to exploration. We previously demonstrated how machine learning (ML) can accelerate property predictions for the CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$ perovskite alloy. However, the substantial computational demand of density functional theory (DFT) calculations required for model training prevents applications to more complex materials. Here, we introduce a data-efficient scheme to facilitate model training, validated initially on CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$ data and extended to the ternary alloy CsSn(Cl/Br/I)$_3$. Our approach employs clustering to construct a compact yet diverse initial dataset of atomic structures. We then apply a two-stage active learning approach to first improve the reliability of the ML-based structure relaxations and then refine accuracy near equilibrium structures. Tests for CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$ demonstrate that our scheme reduces the number of required DFT calculations during the different parts of our proposed model training method by up to 20% and 50%. The fitted model for CsSn(Cl/Br/I)$_3$ is robust and highly accurate, evidenced by the convergence of all ML-based structure relaxations in our tests and an average relaxation error of only 0.5 meV/atom.

Title: Defect-free and defective adaptations of crystalline sheets to stretching deformation
Authors: Ranzhi Sun, Zhenwei Yao
Abstract: The elastic response of the crystalline sheet to the stretching deformation in the form of wrinkles has been extensively investigated. In this work, we extend this fundamental scientific question to the plastic regime by exploring the adaptations of crystalline sheets to the large uniaxial mechanical stretching. We reveal the intermittent plastic shear deformations leading to the complete fracture of the sheets wrapping the cylinder. Specifically, systematic investigations of crystalline sheets of varying geometry show that the fracture processes can be classified into defect-free and defective categories depending on the emergence of topological defects. We highlight the characteristic mechanical and geometric patterns in response to the large stretching deformation, including the shear-driven intermittent lattice tilting, the vortex structure in the displacement field, and the emergence of mobile and anchored dislocations as plastic excitations. The effects of noise and initial lattice orientation on the plastic deformation of the stretched crystalline sheet are also discussed. These results advance our understanding of the atomic level on the irreversible plastic instabilities of 2D crystals under large uniaxial stretching and may have potential practical implications in the precise engineering of structural instabilities in packings of covalently bonded particulate systems.

Title: Robust quantification of the diamond nitrogen-vacancy center charge state via photoluminescence spectroscopy
Authors: Giannis Thalassinos, Daniel J. McCloskey, Alessandro Mameli, Alexander J. Healey, Charlie Pattinson, David Simpson, Brant C. Gibson, Alastair Stacey, Nikolai Dontschuk, Philipp Reineck
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are at the heart of many emerging quantum technologies, all of which require control over the NV charge state. Hence, methods for quantification of the relative photoluminescence (PL) intensities of the NV$^0$ and NV$^-$ charge state, i.e., a charge state ratio, are vital. Several approaches to quantify NV charge state ratios have been reported but are either limited to bulk-like NV diamond samples or yield qualitative results. We propose an NV charge state quantification protocol based on the determination of sample- and experimental setup-specific NV$^0$ and NV$^-$ reference spectra. The approach employs blue (400-470 nm) and green (480-570 nm) excitation to infer pure NV$^0$ and NV$^-$ spectra, which are then used to quantify NV charge state ratios in subsequent experiments via least squares fitting. We test our dual excitation protocol (DEP) for a bulk diamond NV sample, 20 and 100 nm nanodiamond particles and compare results with those obtained via other commonly used techniques such as zero-phonon line fitting and non-negative matrix factorization. We find that DEP can be employed across different samples and experimental setups and yields consistent and quantitative results for NV charge state ratios that are in agreement with our understanding of NV photophysics. By providing robust NV charge state quantification across sample types and measurement platforms, DEP will support the development of NV-based quantum technologies.

Title: Mechanisms of Afterglow and Thermally Stimulated Luminescence in UV-irradiated InP/ZnS Quantum Dots
Authors: S. S. Savchenko, A. O. Shilov, A. S. Vokhmintsev, I. A. Weinstein
Abstract: Indium phosphide-based quantum dots (QDs) are a potential material for designing optoelectronic devices, owing their adjustable spectral parameters over the entire visible range, as well as their high biocompatibility and environmental safety. Concurrently, they exhibit structural defects, the rectification of which is crucial for enhancing their optical properties. The present work explores, for the first time, the low-temperature afterglow (AG) and spectrally resolved thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) of UV-irradiated colloidal core/shell InP/ZnS QDs in the range of 7-340 K. It is shown that, when localized during irradiation and released after additional stimulation, charge carriers recombine involving defect centers based on indium and phosphorus dangling bonds. The mechanisms of the observed luminescent phenomena can be caused by both thermal activation and tunneling processes. By means of the initial rise method, the formalism of general-order kinetics, and the analytical description using the Lambert W function, we have analyzed the kinetic features of possible thermally stimulated mechanisms. We have also estimated the energy characteristics of appropriate trapping centers. A low rate of charge carriers recapture is revealed for InP/ZnS QDs. Active traps in nanocrystals of different sizes are characterized by close values of activation energy in the 26-31 meV range. The current paper discloses new horizons for exploiting TSL approaches to study the properties of local defective states in the energy structure of colloidal QDs, which can contribute to the development of targeted synthesis of nanocrystals with tunable temperature sensitivity for optoelectronic and sensor applications.

Title: Unusual Electron-Phonon Interactions in Highly Anisotropic Two-Dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$
Authors: Fei Wang, Qiaohui Zhou, Hong Tang, Fan Zhang, Yanxing Li, Ana M Sanchez, Keyuan Bai, Sidra Younus, Chih-Kang Shih, Adrienn Ruzsinszky, Xin Lu, Jiang Wei
Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) represent a fundamental cornerstone of condensed matter physics, commanding persistent attention due to their pivotal role in driving novel quantum phenomena within low-dimensional materials. Here, we unveil unusual anisotropic electron-phonon coupling behaviors in quasi-one-dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ nano-flakes through a powerful combination of angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy directly visualize the pronounced quasi-one-dimensional atomic chains within the crystal structure, establishing a structural foundation for the observed anisotropic interactions. Our Raman investigations reveal remarkable polarization-dependent responses in $A_g$ phonon modes that deviate significantly from conventional behavior, which our theoretical analyses attribute to complex anisotropic electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions. Temperature-dependent Raman measurements further uncover an intriguing phonon decay mechanism involving both three- and four-phonon processes, with the latter showing significant contributions in some modes - a possible manifestation of strong anisotropic electron-phonon interactions. Beyond revealing $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ as an exceptional platform for exploring anisotropic EPIs, this work demonstrates that integrating angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy with DFPT calculations offers a powerful methodology for investigating electron-phonon interactions in emerging low-dimensional quantum materials.

Title: Anisotropic vortex motion and two-dimensional superconducting transition
Authors: Zhipeng Xu, Kun Jiang, Jiangping Hu
Abstract: Vortex motion plays a central role in determining the resistance of two-dimensional superconductors, both in the context of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition and in the mixed state of type-II superconductors under magnetic fields. In this study, we introduce an anisotropic pinning potential to investigate vortex-induced resistance across the BKT transition and the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ transition. Our results demonstrate that the anisotropic pinning potential gives rise to distinct critical temperatures and upper critical fields along two orthogonal directions of current transport. These findings provide a general route toward the realization of multiple "critical temperatures" in two-dimensional superconductors.

Title: Ground states of classical spin polygons: Rigorous results and examples
Authors: Wojciech Florek, Heinz-Jürgen Schmidt, Katarzyna Jaśniewicz-Pacer
Abstract: We present a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the lowest energy configurations (LECs) of classical spin polygons characterized by arbitrary couplings between neighboring spin sites. Our study shows that these ground states exhibit either collinear or coplanar arrangements, which allows us to determine the precise boundaries between these two phases. By simultaneously applying a spin flip and a bond inversion, we simplify the LEC problem and reduce it to a specific scenario with predominantly ferromagnetic (FM) bonds and a single antiferromagnetic (AFM) bond. Hence, competing interactions are always present, but, nevertheless, in the well-defined ranges of the system parameters the collinear LEC is realized. The difference angles between neighboring spins within the LEC can be captured by a single Lagrange parameter. We analytically investigate its dependence on the AFM bond and arrive at revealing results. Similarly, we can analyze the energy of the LEC, which shows a pronounced maximum as a function of AFM bond. To illustrate our findings, we give various examples that clearly demonstrate these results.

Title: Bath parameterization in multi-band cluster Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
Authors: Diego Florez-Ablan, Carlos Mejuto-Zaera, Massimo Capone
Abstract: Accurate and reliable algorithms to solve complex impurity problems are instrumental to a routine use of quantum embedding methods for material discovery. In this context, we employ an efficient selected configuration interaction impurity solver to investigate the role of bath discretization -- specifically, bath size and parameterization -- in Hamiltonian-based cluster dynamical mean field theory (CDMFT) for the one- and two-orbital Hubbard models. We consider two- and four-site lattices for the single-orbital model and a two-site cluster for the two-orbital model. Our results demonstrate that, for small bath sizes, the choice of parameterization can significantly influence the solution, highlighting the importance of systematic convergence checks. Comparing different bath parameterizations not only reveals the robustness of a given solution but can also provide insights into the nature of different solutions and potential instabilities of the paramagnetic state. We present an extensive analysis of the zero-temperature Mott transition of the paramagnetic half-filled single-band Hubbard model, where we can benchmark with previous literature, and for multi-band models, overcoming limitations of traditional methods and opening the door to systematic studies of multi-orbital systems with the inclusion of non-local effects. Our results show that the dependence on parameterization is strongly reduced for feasible bath sizes in the case of the single-orbital model, while some dependence is still observed for the two-orbital model.

Title: A Combined DFT and MD Study on Interface Stability in Ferrite-Cementite Systems
Authors: Pablo Canca, Chu-Chun Fu, Christophe J. Ortiz, Blanca Biel
Abstract: Understanding the atomic structure and energetic stability of ferrite-cementite interfaces is essential for optimizing the mechanical performance of steels, especially under extreme conditions such as those encountered in nuclear fusion environments. In this work, we combine Classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) to systematically investigate the stability of ferrite-cementite interfaces within the Bagaryatskii Orientation Relationship. Three interface orientations and several cementite terminations are considered to identify the most stable configurations. MD simulations reveal that the (010)||(11-2) and (001)||(1-10) orientations are energetically favourable for selected terminations, and these predictions are validated and refined by subsequent DFT calculations. A key result of our study is the destabilizing effect of interfacial carbon atoms, which increase the interface energy and decrease the Griffith energy, indicating a reduced resistance to fracture. This finding contrasts with earlier reports suggesting a stabilizing role for carbon. Our analysis of the electronic structure shows that Fe-C bonding at the interface perturbs the metallic environment of interfacial Fe atoms. This bonding response explains the observed variations in magnetic moment and helps rationalize the trends in interface energy. We also establish correlations between interface energy, magnetic perturbation, and a bond-based descriptor quantifying new and broken bonds. These insights provide a physically grounded, predictive framework for the design and optimization of ferrite-cementite interfaces in advanced steels.

Title: Microstructural Studies Using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN): a Case Study
Authors: Owais Ahmad, Vishal Panwar, Kaushik Das, Rajdip Mukherjee, Somnath Bhowmick
Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) is one of the most widely used deep generative models for synthesizing high-quality images with the same statistics as the training set. Finite element method (FEM) based property prediction often relies on synthetically generated microstructures. The phase-field model is a computational method of generating realistic microstructures considering the underlying thermodynamics and kinetics of the material. Due to the expensive nature of the simulations, it is not always feasible to use phase-field for synthetic microstructure generation. In this work, we train a GAN with microstructures generated from the phase-field simulations. Mechanical properties calculated using the finite element method on synthetic and actual phase field microstructures show excellent agreement. Since the GAN model generates thousands of images within seconds, it has the potential to improve the quality of synthetic microstructures needed for FEM calculations or any other applications requiring a large number of realistic synthetic images at minimal computational cost.

Title: Stochastic elastohydrodynamics of adhesion and phase separation during cell-cell contact across a viscous channel
Authors: Vira Dhaliwal, Jingbang Liu, Andreas Carlson
Abstract: Contact between fluctuating, fluid-lubricated soft surfaces is prevalent in engineering and biological systems, a process starting with adhesive contact, which can give rise to complex coarsening dynamics. One representation of such a system, which is relevant to biological membrane adhesion, is a fluctuating elastic interface covered by adhesive molecules that bind and unbind to a solid substrate across a narrow gap filled with a viscous fluid. This flow is described by the stochastic elastohydrodynamics thin-film equation, which combines the effects of viscous nanometric thin film flow, elastic membrane properties, adhesive springs, and thermal fluctuations. The average time it takes the fluctuating elastic membrane to adhere is predicted by the rare event theory, increasing exponentially with the square of the initial gap height. Numerical simulations reveal a phase separation of membrane domains driven by the binding and unbinding of adhesive molecules. The coarsening process displays close similarities to classical Ostwald ripening; however, the inclusion of hydrodynamics affects power-law growth. In particular, we identify a new bending-dominated coarsening regime, which is slower than the well-known tension-dominated case.

Title: Magnetic aftereffect and Barkhausen effect in thin films of the altermagnetic candidate Mn5Si3
Authors: Gregor Skobjin, Javier Rial, Sebastian Beckert, Helena Reichlova, Vincent Baltz, Lisa Michez, Richard Schlitz, Michaela Lammel, Sebastian T.B. Goennenwein
Abstract: Altermagnetism as a third distinct type of collinear magnetic ordering lately attracts vivid attention. We here study the Hall effect response of micron-scale Hall bars patterned into Mn5Si3 thin films, an altermagnet candidate material. Recording transport data as a function of time, at fixed magnetic field magnitude, we observe a time-dependent relaxation of the Hall voltage qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the magnetic viscosity response well established in ferromagnetic films. In addition, the Hall voltage time traces feature clear unilateral steps, which we interpret as Barkhausen steps, i.e., as experimental evidence for abrupt reorientations of magnetic (Hall vector) domains in the altermagnetic candidate material. A quantitative analysis yields a Barkhausen length of around 18nm in the Hall bar devices with the smallest width of 100 nm.

Title: The Interplay of Polar and Nematic Order in Active Matter: Implications for Non-Equilibrium Physics and Biology
Authors: Varun Venkatesh, Niels de Graaf Sousa, Amin Doostmohammadi
Abstract: Active matter has played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of non-equilibrium systems, leading to a fundamental shift in the study of biophysical phenomena. The foundation of active matter research is built on assumptions regarding the symmetry of microscopic constituents. While these assumptions have been validated extensively, instances of mixed or joint symmetries are prevalent in biological systems. This review explores the coexistence of polar and nematic order in active matter, emphasizing the theoretical and experimental challenges associated with these systems. By integrating insights from recent studies, we highlight the importance of considering mixed symmetries to accurately describe biological processes. This exploration not only benefits the field of biology but could also open new horizons for non-equilibrium physics, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding complex behavior in active matter.

Title: Curvature induced modifications of chirality and magnetic configuration in perpendicular magnetized films
Authors: David Raftrey, Dhritiman Bhattacharya, Colin Langton, Bradley Fugetta, S. Satapathy, Olha Bezsmertna, Andrea Sorrentino, Denys Makarov, Gen Yin, Peter Fischer, Kai Liu
Abstract: Designing curvature in three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures enables controlled manipulation of local energy landscapes and subsequent modifications of noncollinear spin textures with unconventional magnetic properties that could be relevant for next-generation spintronic devices. Here, we experimentally investigate 3D spin textures in a Co/Pd multilayer film with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), deposited onto curved Cu nanowire meshes with diameters as small as 50 nm and lengths of several microns. Utilizing magnetic soft X-ray nanotomography at the MISTRAL beamline (ALBA, Spain), we achieve reconstructions of 3D magnetic domain patterns at approximately 30 nm spatial resolution by exploiting XMCD contrast at the Co L3 edge. This approach provides detailed information on both the orientation and magnitude of magnetization within the film. Our results reveal that interfacial anisotropy in the Co/Pd multilayers drives the magnetization to align with the local surface normal. In contrast to typical labyrinthine domains observed in planar films, the presence of curved nanowires significantly alters the domain structure, with domains preferentially aligning along the nanowire axis in close proximity, while adopting random orientations farther away. We report direct experimental observation of curvature induced DMI, which is quantified to be approximately one-third of the intrinsic DMI in Co/Pd stacks. The curvature induced DMI enhances the stability of Néel-type domain walls. Micromagnetic simulations support the experimental observations. Our findings demonstrate that introducing curvature into magnetic nanostructures provides a powerful strategy for tailoring complex magnetic behaviors, paving the way for the design of advanced 3D racetrack memory and neuromorphic computing devices.

Title: Phase transitions induced by resonant light: a phenomenological approach
Authors: A. Kudlis, L. S. Ricco, H. Sigurðsson, I. A. Shelykh
Abstract: We present a phenomenological framework to describe a subclass of light-induced phase transitions (LIPTs) in condensed matter systems, specifically those mediated by the resonant generation of excitons. Our approach extends the classical Landau theory by introducing dynamic coupling between the system's order parameter and complex excitonic fields, along with Langevin-type forces that drive the system toward states of minimal free energy. The model is applied in the context of all-optical resonant magnetization switching in two-dimensional magnetic materials, particularly reproducing the experimental findings for reverse magnetization by all-optical means for a monolayer CrI$_3$. Our phenomenological model can be applied to other systems characterized by an order parameter and excitonic fields created through resonant light, offering versatility and potential to guide future experimental and theoretical studies in LIPT phenomena.

Title: Optimization of Floquet fluxonium qubits with commensurable two-tone drives
Authors: Joachim Lauwens, Kristof Moors, Bart Sorée
Abstract: Protecting superconducting qubits from low-frequency noise by operating them on dynamical sweet-spot manifolds has proven to be a promising setup, theoretically as well as experimentally . These dynamical sweet spots are induced by an externally applied Floquet drive, and various drive forms have been studied in different types of qubits. In this work we study the effects of using two-tone drives on the applied magnetic flux of the form $\phi_{ac}(t)=\phi_m\cos(m\omega_\mathrm{d} t)+\phi_n\cos(n\omega_\mathrm{d} t+\varphi)$, where $m,n \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$, on the coherence times of fluxonium qubits. The optimal drive parameters are found through analysis using perturbation theory and numerical calculations. We show that this type of drive allows for more tunability of the quasi-energy spectrum, creating higher and wider peaks of the dephasing time without affecting the relaxation times too strongly. Further we show that the second commensurable drive tone can be used to implement an improved phase gate compared to implementations with a single tone, supported by Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Exciton-polariton condensates in van der Waals magnetic microwires
Authors: Heng Zhang, Niloufar Nilforoushan, Christian Weidgans, Julian Hirschmann, Imke Gronwald, Kseniia Mosina, Zdeněk Sofer, Fabian Mooshammer, Florian Dirnberger, Rupert Huber
Abstract: Quasiparticle condensates are among the most spectacular solid-state manifestations of quantum physics. Coupling macroscopic real-space wave functions to other degrees of freedom, such as the electron spin, could add valuable control knobs for quantum applications. While creating spin-carrying superconducting condensates has attracted enormous attention, man-made condensates of light-matter hybrids known as exciton-polaritons have lacked a comparable spin-related perspective. Here we open a new door by demonstrating exciton-polariton condensation in the antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr, a van der Waals material with strongly intertwined optical and magnetic properties. Under photoexcitation, CrSBr microwires embedded in an optical cavity show the hallmarks of polariton condensation: a dramatic increase of the emission intensity from an excited laterally confined polariton state by multiple orders of magnitude, spectral narrowing of the emission line, and an intriguing continuous shift of the peak energy. Interferometry evidences an increase of spatial and temporal coherence. The conditions for efficient optical pumping suggest a crucial role of surface excitons and ultrafast polariton-magnon scattering. Our results highlight CrSBr microwires as a promising platform for exploring magnetically tunable polariton condensates, their directional propagation and their potential for spin-based quantum devices.

Title: Field-induced magnetic order in DyTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with two-dimensional pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular lattice
Authors: Feihao Pan, Nan Zhao, Songnan Sun, Chenglin Shang, Peng Cheng, Jieming Sheng, Liusuo Wu
Abstract: The magnetic ground state of geometrically frustrated antiferromagnet attracts great research interests due to the possibility to realize novel quantum magnetic state such as a quantum spin liquid. Here we present a comprehensive magnetic characterization of DyTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with ideal two-dimensional triangular lattice. DyTa$_7$O$_{19}$ exhibits $c$-axis single-ion magnetic anisotropy. Although long-range magnetic order is not observed down to 100 mK under zero field, by applying a small magnetic field ($\sim$0.1 T), a magnetically ordered state with net magnetization of $M_s$/3 below $T_m$=0.14 K is identified ($M_s$ denotes the saturated magnetization). We argue that this state is an up-up-down magnetic structure phase driven by the dipole-dipole interactions between Ising-like spins of Dy$^{3+}$ in a two-dimensional triangular lattice, since its ordering temperature and temperature-field phase diagram can be well explained by the theoretical calculations based on dipolar interactions. DyTa$_7$O$_{19}$ could be viewed as a rare material platform that realizing pure Ising-like dipolar interaction in a geometrically frustrated lattice.

Title: Squeezing and quantum control of antiferromagnetic magnon pseudospin
Authors: Anna-Luisa E. Römling, Johannes Feist, Francisco J. García-Vidal, Akashdeep Kamra
Abstract: Antiferromagnets have been shown to harbor strong magnon squeezing in equilibrium, making them a potential resource for quantum correlations and entanglement. Recent experiments have also found them to host coherently coupled magnonic excitations forming a magnon pseudospin, in analogy to electronic spin. Here, we delineate the quantum properties of antiferromagnetic magnon pseudospin by accounting for spin non-conserving interactions and going beyond the rotating wave approximation. Employing concrete examples of nickel oxide and hematite, we find strong squeezing of the magnon pseudospin highlighting its important role in determining the eigenmode quantum properties. Via ground state quantum fluctuations engineering, this pseudospin squeezing enables an enhancement and control of coupling between the magnonic modes and other excitations. Finally, we evaluate the quantum superpositions that comprise a squeezed pseudospin ground state and delineate a qubit spectroscopy protocol to detect them. Our results are applicable to any system of coupled bosons and thus introduce quantum fluctuations engineering of a general bosonic pseudospin.

Title: Magnetic and thermodynamic studies on the distorted kagome magnet Pr$_3$BWO$_9$
Authors: Ahmed Elghandour, Jan Arneth, Annu Yadav, Sven Luther, Panchanan Khuntia, Rüdiger Klingeler
Abstract: We report specific heat, ac/dc magnetic susceptibility as well as static and pulsed field magnetization studies on the distorted kagome magnet Pr$_3$BWO$_9$ down to 0.4~K and up to high magnetic fields. The low-temperature thermodynamic properties are found to be governed by an electronic quasi-doublet ground state; the energy splitting of which amounts to $\Delta_1\simeq 18$ K and exhibits a quadratic field dependence with $g_\mathrm{eff} = 2.6$. Fitting of the specific heat data implies that the next excited state is strongly gapped at $\Delta_2=430$ K and three-fold degenerate in zero field. Our dc and ac susceptibility studies down to 0.4 K do not detect signatures of distinct spin glass behavior. Pulsed field magnetization measurements up to 60 T confirm the Ising-like paramagnetic nature of the magnetic ground state which is characterized by $m_J=\pm 4$ and the anisotropy energy $E_a\simeq 950$ K.

Title: Optical Injection and Detection of Long-Lived Interlayer Excitons in van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Alperen Tüğen, Anna M. Seiler, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Martin Kroner, Ataç İmamoğlu
Abstract: Interlayer excitons in semiconducting bilayers separated by insulating hBN layers constitute a promising platform for investigation of strongly correlated bosonic phases. Here, we report an optical method for the generation and characterization of long-lived interlayer excitons. We find confirmation of tightly bound interlayer excitons by measuring 1s and 2s intralayer excitons in each layer concurrently. Using a pump-probe technique, we find interlayer exciton lifetimes up to 8.8 $\mu$s, increasing with the thickness of the hBN. With optical access to long-lived interlayer excitons, our approach provides a new promising route to explore degenerate Bose--Fermi mixtures of excitons and itinerant electrons with high spatial and temporal resolution.

Title: Magnetism in $M_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ ($M$ = Fe, V, Mn): insight into intercalated transition-metal dichalcogenides using $μ$SR
Authors: N. P. Bentley, T. L. Breeze, A. Hernández-Melián, T. J. Hicken, B. M. Huddart, F. L. Pratt, A. E. Hall, D. A. Mayoh, G. Balakrishnan, S. J. Clark, T. Lancaster
Abstract: We present the results of muon-spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements of the static and dynamic magnetism of $M_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ ($M$ = Fe, V, Mn), three intercalated transition-metal dichalcogenides. Transitions to long-range magnetic order are observed in all three materials and local magnetic fields at muon sites are compared to dipole field calculations. Measurements on Fe$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ capture the evolution of two coexisting magnetic phases. In V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ we observe a peak in the dynamic response at $9$ K, coincident with previous reports of a possible low-temperature phase transition. The observation of high-frequency muon precession in Mn$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ suggests the existence of an additional muon site that implies a difference in electronic energy landscape compared to the other materials in the series. Taken together, this demonstrates that the change in intercalant species drives significant variations in magnetism, highlighting the $M_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ ($M$ = Fe, V, Mn) series as an ideal group of materials for investigating a wide range of magnetic phenomena.

Abstract: Understanding time-resolved quantum transport is crucial for developing next-generation quantum technologies, particularly in nano- and molecular junctions subjected to time-dependent perturbations. Traditional steady-state approaches to quantum transport are not designed to capture the transient dynamics necessary for controlling electronic behavior at ultrafast time scales. In this work, we present a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, within the recently-developed iterated generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA), to study thermoelectric quantum transport beyond the wide-band limit approximation (WBLA). We employ the Meir-Wingreen formula for both charge and energy currents and analyze the transition from Lorentzian line-width functions to the WBLA, identifying unphysical divergences in the latter. Our results highlight the importance of finite-bandwidth effects and demonstrate the efficiency of the $i$GKBA approach in modeling time-resolved thermoelectric transport, also providing benchmark comparisons against the full Kadanoff-Baym theory. We exemplify the developed theory in the calculation of time-resolved thermopower and thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency in a cyclobutadiene molecular junction.

Title: Cavity-control of the Ginzburg-Landau stiffness in superconductors
Authors: Vadim Plastovets, Francesco Piazza
Abstract: Confining light around solids via cavities enhances the coupling between the electromagnetic fluctuations and the matter. We predict that in superconductors this cavity-enhanced coupling enables the control of the order-parameter stiffness, which governs key length scales such as the coherence length of Cooper pairs and the magnetic penetration depth. We explain this as a renormalization of the Cooper-pair mass caused by photon-mediated repulsive interactions between the electrons building the pair. The strength of this effect can be tuned via the length of the cavity and we estimate it to be sizable for cavities in the infrared range.

Title: Load-Dependent Power-Law Exponent in Creep Rupture of Heterogeneous Materials
Authors: Chloé Braux, Antoine Bérut, Loïc Vanel
Abstract: Creep tests on heterogeneous materials under subcritical loading typically show a power-law decaying strain rate before failure, with the exponent often considered material-dependent but independent of applied stress. By imposing successive small stress relaxations through a displacement feedback loop, we probe creep dynamics and show experimentally that this exponent varies with both applied load and loading direction. Simulations of a disordered fiber bundle model reproduce this load dependence, demonstrating that such models capture essential features of delayed rupture dynamics.

Title: One-dimensional interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model at quarter filling: An exact diagonalization study
Authors: Yan-Xiao Wang, Yin Zhong
Abstract: This study explores the ground-state phase diagram and topological properties of the spinless 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions at quarter filling. We analyze key physical quantities such as the local electron density distribution, correlation functions for bond-order-wave (BOW) and charge-density-wave (CDW) -- by integrating twisted boundary conditions with the Lanczos technique and employing high-precision numerical diagonalization methods, complemented by a mean-field approximation (MFA) based on bond-order and charge-density modulation analysis. This approach enables precise identification of phase transition critical points. Our results indicate that the system exhibits a topologically trivial band insulating (BI) phase for strong attractive interactions, with its upper boundary forming a downward-opening curve peaking at $V/t\simeq-2.3$ and extending to $V/t\simeq-2.6$. Within $-2.6 \leq V/t \leq -0.5$, a BOW phase emerges for $\left|\delta t/t\right| > 0.45$, with its boundaries converging as $\left|\delta t/t\right|$ decreases, terminating at a single point at $\left|\delta t/t\right|\simeq0.45$. In other parameter regions, a CDW phase is realized. Through this analysis, we elucidate the topological properties of the interacting spinless SSH model at quarter filling, highlighting the competition among CDW, BOW, and BI phases. By tuning $V$ and $\delta t$, the system exhibits diverse correlated phenomena, offering new insights into one-dimensional quantum phase transitions and the interplay between topology and order.

Title: Tilt-Induced Localization in Interacting Bose-Einstein Condensates for Quantum Sensing
Authors: Argha Debnath, Mariusz Gajda, Debraj Rakshit
Abstract: We investigate localization transitions in interacting Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) confined in tilted optical lattices, focusing on both the continuum limit accessed via shallow lattice depths and the tight-binding limit realized in the deep lattice regime. Utilizing the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and the many-body Bose-Hubbard model, we analyze the scaling behavior of localization indicators, such as the root mean square width and fidelity susceptibility, as a function of the applied tilt. Our results reveal clear signatures of a localization-delocalization transition driven by the linear potential, with scaling properties that characterize criticality even in the presence of interactions within the GPE description. Despite the single-mode nature of the condensate wavefunction, we demonstrate that it can effectively probe quantum criticality. Building on this, we propose the use of interacting BECs in tilted lattices as a platform for quantum critical sensing, where the condensate wavefunction serves both as a sensitive probe of localization and a practical resource for quantum-enhanced metrology. This approach opens new avenues for precision gradient sensing based on localization phenomena in bosonic systems.

Title: Transient osmotic flows in a microfluidic channel: measurements of solute permeability and reflection coefficients of hydrogel membranes
Authors: Julien Renaudeau, Pierre Lidon, Jean-Baptiste Salmon
Abstract: We first highlight theoretically a microfluidic configuration that allows to measure two fundamental parameters describing mass transport through a membrane: the solute permeability coefficient $\mathcal{L}_D$, and the associated reflection coefficient $\sigma$. This configuration exploits the high confinement of microfluidic geometries to relate these two coefficients to the dynamics of a transient flow induced by forward osmosis through a membrane embedded in a chip. We then applied this methodology to hydrogel membranes photo-crosslinked in a microchannel with \textit{in situ} measurements of osmotically-induced flows. These experiments enable us to estimate $\mathcal{L}_D$ and $\sigma$ and their dependence on the molecular weight of the solute under consideration, ultimately leading to a precise estimate of the molecular weight cut-off of these hydrogel membranes.

Title: Competing Interactions and the Effects of Uniaxial Out-of-plane Perturbations in the Honeycomb Antiferromagnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$
Authors: J. Arneth, R. Kalaivanan, R. Sankar, K.-Y. Choi, R. Klingeler
Abstract: Despite exhibiting magnetic long-range order below $T_\mathrm{N} = 26.7\,\mathrm{K}$, the honeycomb cobaltate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ is predicted to enter a Kitaev spin liquid state when subjected to small external perturbations. While most of the reported literature investigates the effects of magnetic fields applied parallel to the honeycomb layers, we present high-resolution capacitance dilatometry studies for fields perpendicular to the Co-planes up to $15\,\mathrm{T}$. Grüneisen analysis reveals the effect of uniaxial out-of-plane strain and shows that antiferromagnetic order in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ is stabilized at a rate of $\partial T_\mathrm{N}/\partial p_\mathrm{c} = 0.28(5)\,\mathrm{K/GPa}$. Further, failure of the Grüneisen scaling at low temperatures around $T_\mathrm{cr} \simeq 7.5\,\mathrm{K}$ demonstrates the presence of competing energy scales. In contrast to an only weak field dependence of the anomaly at $T_\mathrm{N}$, a broad hump at $T_\mathrm{cr}$ ($B=0\,\mathrm{T}$) evolves into a sharp peak at high fields applied $B \parallel c$. Our magnetostriction data show that a kink in the magnetisation at $B_\mathrm{C} \simeq 4.6\,\mathrm{T}$ is accompanied by an inflection point in the field-induced length changes, which is likely related to weak unequal spin canting. All observed phenomena leave their signatures in the magnetoelastic phase diagram as constructed by our experimental results.

Title: Theory and computation of thermal-field emission from semiconductors
Authors: Salvador Barranco Cárceles, Veronika Zadin, Aquila Mavalankar, Ian Underwood, Andreas Kyritsakis
Abstract: Semiconducting field emitters present some interesting features (e.g.; self-limited electron emission) for both scientific interest and industrial applications. The analysis of experimental results and device design has been restrained by the lack of accurate 3D models for the simulation of thermal-field emission from semiconductors. Here we review and correct the equations of field emission from semiconductors and include them to expand GETELEC (General Tool for Electron Emission Calculations). Our method covers all electron emission regime (field, thermal, and intermediate), aiming to maximise the calculation accuracy while minimising the computational cost. GETELEC-2.0 is able to reproduce the characteristic non-linear I-V curves in Fowler-Nordheim coordinates obtained from semiconductors, giving insights about their nature. As well as providing an explanation to the lack of experimental observation of valence band electrons from semiconductors.

Title: Thickness Dependence of Coercive Field in Ferroelectric Doped-Hafnium Oxide
Authors: Revanth Koduru, Sumeet Kumar Gupta
Abstract: Ferroelectric hafnium oxide (${HfO_2}$) exhibits a thickness-dependent coercive field $(E_c)$ behavior that deviates from the trends observed in perovskites and the predictions of Janovec-Kay-Dunn (JKD) theory. Experiments reveal that, in thinner $HfO_2$ films ($<100\,nm$), $E_c$ increases with decreasing thickness but at a slower rate than predicted by the JKD theory. In thicker films, $E_c$ saturates and is independent of thickness. Prior studies attributed the thick film saturation to the thickness-independent grain size, which limits the domain growth. However, the reduced dependence in thinner films is poorly understood. In this work, we expound the reduced thickness dependence of $E_c$, attributing it to the anisotropic crystal structure of the polar orthorhombic (o) phase of $HfO_2$. This phase consists of continuous polar layers (CPL) along one in-plane direction and alternating polar and spacer layers (APSL) along the orthogonal direction. The spacer layers decouple adjacent polar layers along APSL, increasing the energy barrier for domain growth compared to CPL direction. As a result, the growth of nucleated domains is confined to a single polar plane in $HfO_2$, forming half-prolate elliptical cylindrical geometry rather than half-prolate spheroid geometry observed in perovskites. By modeling the nucleation and growth energetics of these confined domains, we derive a modified scaling law of $E_c \propto d^{-1/2}$ for $HfO_2$ that deviates from the classical JKD dependence of $E_c \propto d^{-2/3}$. The proposed scaling agrees well with the experimental trends in coercive field across various ferroelectric $HfO_2$ samples.

Title: Finite-temperature entanglement and coherence in asymmetric bosonic Josephson junctions
Authors: Cesare Vianello, Matteo Ferraretto, Luca Salasnich
Abstract: We investigate the finite-temperature properties of a bosonic Josephson junction composed of N interacting atoms confined by a quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric double-well potential, modeled by the two-site Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. We compute numerically the spectral decomposition of the statistical ensemble of states, the thermodynamic and entanglement entropies, the population imbalance, the quantum Fisher information, and the coherence visibility. We analyze their dependence on the system parameters, showing in particular how finite temperature and on-site energy asymmetry affect the entanglement and coherence properties of the system. Moreover, starting from a quantum phase model which accurately describes the system over a wide range of interactions, we develop a reliable description of the strong tunneling regime, where thermal averages may be computed analytically using a modified Boltzmann weight involving an effective temperature. We discuss the possibility of applying this effective description to other models in suitable regimes.

Title: Fermion parity switches imprinted in the photonic field of cavity embedded Kitaev chains
Authors: Victor Fernandez Becerra, Olesia Dmytruk
Abstract: The entanglement of electronic states with quantum light in cavity embedded systems has opened new avenues to manipulate quantum materials. In this work we investigate the Kitaev chain coupled to a single mode photonic cavity. Using exact diagonalization we calculate the many-body energy spectrum of the electron-photon Hamiltonian in finite-length chains. We find two distinct types of ground states, one with a well defined parity and another with an alternating parity where a doubly degenerate ground state takes place at exceptional points, known as parity switching points. The double ground state hosts edge states weakly affected by the cavity coupling, even in the low frequency regime, in contrast with higher excited states showing strong dependence with the cavity coupling. Besides the electronic quantities, we also find that the photon number peaks at values of the chemical potential corresponding to parity switching points. Therefore, we suggest that quantum optics experiments could be employed to detect the double ground state hosting edge states weakly hybridized with light. Finally, calculations of photonic quadratures reveal squeezed states that are both captured by the exact diagonalization technique and mean field decoupling. However, within these two approaches differences in the photon probability in odd numbers of photons are reported.

Title: Correlated Structural and Optical Characterization during Van der Waals Epitaxy of PbI2 on Graphene

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures of 2D layered materials have gained much attention due to their flexible electronic properties, which make them promising candidates for energy, sensing, catalytic, and biomedical applications. Lead iodide (PbI2), a 2D layered semiconductor material belonging to the metal halide family, shows a thickness-dependent band gap with an indirect-to-direct transition above one monolayer. It has emerged as an excellent candidate for photodetectors and is a key component in metal halide perovskites solar cells. In the current work, we investigated the growth dynamics and the real-time correlation between structural and optical properties of PbI2 layers deposited on graphene/SiC(0001) by Molecular Beam Epitaxy. The structural and optical properties are probed respectively by Grazing Incidence Fast Atom Diffraction and Surface Differential Reflectance Spectroscopy. The growth proceeds layer-by-layer in a van der Waals-like epitaxy, with the zigzag direction of PbI2 parallel to the armchair direction of graphene. Both techniques bring evidence of significant modifications of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the first PbI2 monolayer, characterized by a 1% tensile strain that relaxes over 3 to 5 monolayers. For a single monolayer, Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy reveals a charge transfer from graphene to PbI2, demonstrated by an energy shift of the order of 50 meV in the graphene band structure.

Title: Tuning of altermagnetism by strain
Authors: M. Khodas, Sai Mu, I. I. Mazin, K. D. Belashchenko
Abstract: For all collinear altermagnets, we sort out piezomagnetic free-energy invariants allowed in the nonrelativistic limit and relativistic piezomagnetic invariants bilinear in the Néel vector $\mathbf{L}$ and magnetization $\mathbf{M}$, which include strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The symmetry-allowed responses are fully determined by the nonrelativistic spin Laue group. In the nonrelativistic limit, two distinct mechanisms are discussed: the band-filling mechanism, which exists in metals and is illustrated using the simple two-dimensional Lieb lattice model, and the temperature-dependent exchange-driven mechanism, which is illustrated using first-principles calculations for transition-metal fluorides. The leading second-order nonrelativistic term in the strain-induced magnetization is also obtained for CrSb. Piezomagnetism due to the strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is calculated from first principles for transition-metal fluorides, MnTe, and CrSb. Finally, we discuss triplet superconducting correlations supported by altermagnets and protected by inversion rather than time-reversal symmetry. We apply the nonrelativistic classification of Cooper pairs to describe the interplay between strain and superconductivity in the two-dimensional Lieb lattice and in bulk rutile structures. We show that triplet superconductivity is, on average, unitary in an unstrained altermagnet, but becomes non-unitary under piezomagnetically active strain.

Title: SESaMo: Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation for Normalizing Flows
Authors: Janik Kreit, Dominic Schuh, Kim A. Nicoli, Lena Funcke
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently garnered significant attention across various fields, from physics to chemistry, where sampling from unnormalized Boltzmann-like distributions represents a fundamental challenge. In particular, autoregressive models and normalizing flows have become prominent due to their appealing ability to yield closed-form probability densities. Moreover, it is well-established that incorporating prior knowledge - such as symmetries - into deep neural networks can substantially improve training performances. In this context, recent advances have focused on developing symmetry-equivariant generative models, achieving remarkable results. Building upon these foundations, this paper introduces Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation (SESaMo). Similar to equivariant normalizing flows, SESaMo enables the incorporation of inductive biases (e.g., symmetries) into normalizing flows through a novel technique called stochastic modulation. This approach enhances the flexibility of the generative model, allowing to effectively learn a variety of exact and broken symmetries. Our numerical experiments benchmark SESaMo in different scenarios, including an 8-Gaussian mixture model and physically relevant field theories, such as the $\phi^4$ theory and the Hubbard model.

Title: Spin textures in curved paths on a curved surface
Authors: Guo-Hua Liang, Ai-Guo Mei, Zhi-Hui Yang, Ze-Lin Wei
Abstract: This study investigates the quantum dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle confined to a curved path from the dynamics of a two-dimensional curved thin-layer system incorporating spin connection contributions. We demonstrate that the geodesic curvature, normal curvature, and geodesic torsion of the curve govern the emergent non-Abelian gauge potential and effective scalar potential in the system's Hamiltonian. The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed, revealing that the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and the pseudo-magnetic flux are topologically governed by the surface geometry. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus non-geodesic propagation. Further, spin evolution in a closed trajectory-Viviani's curve, exemplifies the surface-dependent spin orientation and path-ordering sensitivity of the non-Abelian gauge potential. Our theory establishes a framework for spin-state manipulation via engineered nanostructured channels, enabling novel topological quantum control strategies.

Title: Transient and steady-state chaos in dissipative quantum systems
Authors: Debabrata Mondal, Lea F. Santos, S. Sinha
Abstract: Dissipative quantum chaos plays a central role in the characterization and control of information scrambling, non-unitary evolution, and thermalization, but it still lacks a precise definition. The Grobe-Haake-Sommers conjecture, which links Ginibre level repulsion to classical chaotic dynamics, was recently shown to fail [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. We properly restore the quantum-classical correspondence through a dynamical approach based on entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which reveal signatures of chaos beyond spectral statistics. Focusing on the open anisotropic Dicke model, we identify two distinct regimes: transient chaos, marked by rapid early-time growth of entanglement and OTOCs followed by low saturation values, and steady-state chaos, characterized by high long-time values. We introduce a random matrix toy model and show that Ginibre spectral statistics signals short-time chaos rather than steady-state chaos. Our results establish entanglement dynamics and OTOCs as reliable diagnostics of dissipative quantum chaos across different timescales.

Title: Impact of Temporally Correlated Dephasing Noise on the Fidelity of the 2-Qubit Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
Authors: Souvik Ghosh
Abstract: Understanding the influence of realistic noise on quantum algorithms is paramount for the advancement of quantum computation. While often modeled as Markovian, environmental noise in quantum systems frequently exhibits temporal correlations, leading to non-Markovian dynamics that can significantly alter algorithmic performance. This paper investigates the impact of temporally correlated dephasing noise, modeled by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, on the fidelity of the 2-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. We perform numerical simulations using Qiskit, systematically varying the noise strength ($\sigma_{\text{OU}}$) and correlation time ($\tau_c$) of the OU process. Our results demonstrate that the algorithm's fidelity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\tau_c$, particularly at higher noise strengths, with certain intermediate correlation times proving more detrimental than others. We find that a standard Markovian dephasing model, matched to the single-step error variance of the OU process, accurately predicts fidelity only in the limit of very short correlation times. For longer correlation times, the Markovian approximation often overestimates the algorithm's fidelity, failing to capture the complex error dynamics introduced by the noise memory. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating non-Markovian characteristics for accurate performance assessment of quantum algorithms on near-term devices and underscore the limitations of simpler, memoryless noise models.

Title: On the completeness of the $δ_{KLS}$-generalized statistical field theory
Authors: P. R. S. Carvalho
Abstract: In this work we introduce a field-theoretic tool that enable us to evaluate the critical exponents of $\delta_{KLS}$-generalized systems undergoing continuous phase transitions, namely $\delta_{KLS}$-generalized statistical field theory. It generalizes the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs through the introduction of the $\delta_{KLS}$ parameter from which Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics is recovered in the limit $\delta_{KLS}\rightarrow 0$. From the results for the critical exponents we provide the referred physical interpretation for the $\delta_{KLS}$ parameter. Although new generalized universality classes emerge, we show that they are incomplete for describing the behavior of some real materials. This task is fulfilled only for nonextensive statistical field theory, which is related to fractal derivative and multifractal geometries, up to the moment, for our knowledge.

Title: When can in-context learning generalize out of task distribution?
Authors: Chase Goddard, Lindsay M. Smith, Vudtiwat Ngampruetikorn, David J. Schwab
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize \emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem influence the transition.

Title: Toward Greater Autonomy in Materials Discovery Agents: Unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists
Authors: Lianhao Zhou, Hongyi Ling, Keqiang Yan, Kaiji Zhao, Xiaoning Qian, Raymundo Arróyave, Xiaofeng Qian, Shuiwang Ji
Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning, physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous materials discovery.

Title: Application-specific Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials: Exploring the Trade-off Between Precision and Computational Cost
Authors: Ilgar Baghishov, Jan Janssen, Graeme Henkelman, Danny Perez
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing computational materials science and chemistry by offering an efficient alternative to {\em ab initio} molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, fitting high-quality MLIPs remains a challenging, time-consuming, and computationally intensive task where numerous trade-offs have to be considered, e.g. How much and what kind of atomic configurations should be included in the training set? Which level of {\em ab initio} convergence should be used to generate the training set? Which loss function should be used for fitting the MLIP? Which machine learning architecture should be used to train the MLIP? The answers to these questions significantly impact both the computational cost of MLIP training and the accuracy and computational cost of subsequent MLIP MD simulations. In this study, we highlight that simultaneously considering training set selection strategies, energy versus force weighting, precision of the {\em ab initio} reference simulations, as well as model complexity and computational cost of MLIPs can lead to a significant reduction in the overall computational cost associated with training and evaluating MLIPs. This opens the door to computationally efficient generation of high-quality MLIPs for a range of applications which demand different accuracy versus training and evaluation cost trade-offs.

Title: Invariant transports of stationary random measures: asymptotic variance, hyperuniformity, and examples
Authors: Michael A. Klatt, Günter Last, Luca Lotz, D. Yogeshwaran
Abstract: We consider invariant transports of stationary random measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and establish natural mixing criteria that guarantee persistence of asymptotic variances. To check our mixing assumptions, which are based on two-point Palm probabilities, we combine factorial moment expansion with stopping set techniques, among others. We complement our results by providing formulas for the Bartlett spectral measure of the destinations. We pay special attention to the case of a vanishing asymptotic variance, known as hyperuniformity. By constructing suitable transports from a hyperuniform source we are able to rigorously establish hyperuniformity for many point processes and random measures. On the other hand, our method can also refute hyperuniformity. For instance, we show that finitely many steps of Lloyd's algorithm or of a random organization model preserve the asymptotic variance if we start from a Poisson process or a point process with exponentially fast decaying correlation. Finally, we define a hyperuniformerer that turns any ergodic point process with finite intensity into a hyperuniform process by randomizing each point within its cell of a fair partition.

Title: The influence of multi-dimensionality and off-diagonal non-Markovian friction coupling on coarse-grained dynamics
Authors: Henrik Kiefer, Cihan Ayaz, Benjamin A. Dalton, Roland R. Netz
Abstract: Coarse-graining complex molecular systems to lower-dimensional reaction coordinates is a powerful approach for capturing their effective dynamics. The generalized Langevin equation (GLE) provides an exact framework for modeling coarse-grained dynamics, and is particularly useful when non-Markovian effects are significant. While one-dimensional GLE models are commonly used, many systems require multi-dimensional reaction coordinates to account for coupled dynamics. Here, we study the GLE formalism for multi-dimensional reaction coordinates, incorporating a memory matrix to quantify non-Markovian frictional coupling between coordinates, and a multi-dimensional potential. Using the GLE model, in conjunction with a multi-dimensional Markovian embedding scheme, we investigate different systems that are characterized by two-dimensional reaction coordinates, namely the dihedral dynamics of pentane and alanine dipeptide, obtained from molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water. We identify significant off-diagonal friction couplings arising from intramolecular and hydrodynamic interactions. Unlike previous studies, our results highlight the critical role of different terms in the multi-dimensional GLE in accurately capturing key dynamical properties, including mean first-passage times and mean-squared displacements, particularly in systems with coupled non-Markovian coordinates.

Title: Anomalous flow in correlated quantum systems: No-go result and multiple-charge scenario
Authors: Rui Guan, Junjie Liu
Abstract: Correlated quantum systems can exhibit thermodynamic behaviors that defy classical expectations, with anomalous energy flow (AEF) against temperature gradients serving as a paradigmatic example. While AEF has been shown to arise from the consumption of initial quantum correlations, little is known about whether AEF can occur without correlation depletion, or if analogous anomalous transport exists for conserved charges beyond energy. Here, we develop a general global-local thermodynamic approach to describe charge exchange between arbitrary correlated quantum systems. For energy-conserving systems, we analytically rule out AEF in initially uncorrelated states, even with the involvement of quantum catalysts, thereby complementing existing studies. In contrast, in systems with multiple conserved charges, we uncover a mechanism for AEF that requires no initial correlations but is instead induced by a drag effect from normal flows of non-energy charges. Furthermore, by treating all conserved charges on equal footing, we generalize AEF to a broader concept of anomalous charge flow, applicable to any conserved charge. We confirm theoretical expectations with numerical examples. These findings deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and open new avenues for controlling transport phenomena in correlated quantum systems.

Title: Machine learning for in-situ composition mapping in a self-driving magnetron sputtering system
Authors: Sanna Jarl, Jens Sjölund, Robert J. W. Frost, Anders Holst, Jonathan J. S. Scragg
Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks, obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10 experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials exploration.

Title: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework
Authors: Emad Chaparian
Abstract: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of percolation when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.

Title: An Optimized Franz-Parisi Criterion and its Equivalence with SQ Lower Bounds
Authors: Siyu Chen, Theodor Misiakiewicz, Ilias Zadik, Peiyuan Zhang
Abstract: Bandeira et al. (2022) introduced the Franz-Parisi (FP) criterion for characterizing the computational hard phases in statistical detection problems. The FP criterion, based on an annealed version of the celebrated Franz-Parisi potential from statistical physics, was shown to be equivalent to low-degree polynomial (LDP) lower bounds for Gaussian additive models, thereby connecting two distinct approaches to understanding the computational hardness in statistical inference. In this paper, we propose a refined FP criterion that aims to better capture the geometric ``overlap" structure of statistical models. Our main result establishes that this optimized FP criterion is equivalent to Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds -- another foundational framework in computational complexity of statistical inference. Crucially, this equivalence holds under a mild, verifiable assumption satisfied by a broad class of statistical models, including Gaussian additive models, planted sparse models, as well as non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA), single-index (SI) models, and convex truncation detection settings. For instance, in the case of convex truncation tasks, the assumption is equivalent with the Gaussian correlation inequality (Royen, 2014) from convex geometry. In addition to the above, our equivalence not only unifies and simplifies the derivation of several known SQ lower bounds -- such as for the NGCA model (Diakonikolas et al., 2017) and the SI model (Damian et al., 2024) -- but also yields new SQ lower bounds of independent interest, including for the computational gaps in mixed sparse linear regression (Arpino et al., 2023) and convex truncation (De et al., 2023).

Title: Ultrafast intrinsic optical-to-electrical conversion dynamics in graphene photodetector
Authors: Katsumasa Yoshioka, Taro Wakamura, Masayuki Hashisaka, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Norio Kumada
Abstract: Optical-to-electrical (O-E) conversion in graphene is a central phenomenon for realizing anticipated ultrafast and low-power-consumption information technologies. However, revealing its mechanism and intrinsic time scale require uncharted terahertz (THz) electronics and device architectures. Here, we succeeded in resolving O-E conversion processes in high-quality graphene by on-chip electrical readout of ultrafast photothermoelectric current. By suppressing the RC time constant using a resistive zinc oxide top gate, we constructed a gate-tunable graphene photodetector with a bandwidth of up to 220 GHz. By measuring nonlocal photocurrent dynamics, we found that the photocurrent extraction from the electrode is instantaneous without a measurable carrier transit time across several-micrometer-long graphene, following the Shockley-Ramo theorem. The time for photocurrent generation is exceptionally tunable from immediate to > 4 ps, and its origin is identified as Fermi-level-dependent intraband carrier-carrier scattering. Our results bridge the gap between ultrafast optical science and device engineering, accelerating ultrafast graphene optoelectronic applications.

Title: Biased random walk on random networks in presence of stochastic resetting: Exact results
Authors: Mrinal Sarkar, Shamik Gupta
Abstract: We consider biased random walks on random networks constituted by a random comb comprising a backbone with quenched-disordered random-length branches. The backbone and the branches run in the direction of the bias. For the bare model as also when the model is subject to stochastic resetting, whereby the walkers on the branches reset with a constant rate to the respective backbone sites, we obtain exact stationary-state static and dynamic properties for a given disorder realization of branch lengths sampled following an arbitrary distribution. We derive a criterion to observe in the stationary state a non-zero drift velocity along the backbone. For the bare model, we discuss the occurrence of a drift velocity that is non-monotonic as a function of the bias, becoming zero beyond a threshold bias because of walkers trapped at very long branches. Further, we show that resetting allows the system to escape trapping, resulting in a drift velocity that is finite at any bias.

Title: On-chip transfer of ultrashort graphene plasmon wavepackets using terahertz electronics
Authors: Katsumasa Yoshioka, Guillaume Bernard, Taro Wakamura, Masayuki Hashisaka, Ken-ichi Sasaki, Satoshi Sasaki, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Norio Kumada
Abstract: Steering transport of ultrashort polariton wavepackets is essential for achieving on-chip integrated nanocircuits with tightly confined electromagnetic fields towards ultrafast information processing. However, conventional optical techniques have struggled to integrate the necessary components for transferring polariton signals. Here, we address this challenge by electrically generating, manipulating, and reading out terahertz graphene plasmon-polariton wavepackets on-chip. By injecting an electrical pulse into graphene via an ohmic contact, we achieve coherent conversion of the pulse into a plasmon wavepacket exhibiting a pulse duration of 1.2 ps and extreme three-dimensional spatial confinement within a volume of $2.1 \times 10^{-18} m^3$. We reveal the transport properties of plasmons along graphene ribbons in different dielectric environments, providing a basis for designing graphene plasmonic circuits. Furthermore, we find that the conversion efficiency between the electrical pulses and plasmon wavepackets reaches ~30% thanks to the absence of a momentum mismatch. With unprecedented controllability, our platform represents a significant advance in on-chip handling of plasmonic signals in various van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Accurate and efficient predictions of keyhole dynamics in laser materials processing using machine learning-aided simulations
Authors: Jiahui Zhang, Runbo Jiang, Kangming Li, Pengyu Chen, Shengbo Bi, Xiao Shang, Zhiying Liu, Jason Hattrick-Simpers, Brian J. Simonds, Qianglong Wei, Hongze Wang, Tao Sun, Anthony D. Rollett, Yu Zou
Abstract: The keyhole phenomenon has been widely observed in laser materials processing, including laser welding, remelting, cladding, drilling, and additive manufacturing. Keyhole-induced defects, primarily pores, dramatically affect the performance of final products, impeding the broad use of these laser-based technologies. The formation of these pores is typically associated with the dynamic behavior of the keyhole. So far, the accurate characterization and prediction of keyhole features, particularly keyhole depth, as a function of time, has been a challenging task. In situ characterization of keyhole dynamic behavior using the synchrotron X-ray technique is informative but complicated and expensive. Current simulations are generally hindered by their poor accuracy and generalization abilities in predicting keyhole depths due to the lack of accurate laser absorptance data. In this study, we develop a machine learning-aided simulation method that accurately predicts keyhole dynamics, especially in keyhole depth fluctuations, over a wide range of processing parameters. In two case studies involving titanium and aluminum alloys, we achieve keyhole depth prediction with a mean absolute percentage error of 10%, surpassing those simulated using the ray-tracing method with an error margin of 30%, while also reducing computational time. This exceptional fidelity and efficiency empower our model to serve as a cost-effective alternative to synchrotron experiments. Our machine learning-aided simulation method is affordable and readily deployable for a large variety of materials, opening new doors to eliminate or reduce defects for a wide range of laser materials processing techniques.

Title: Percolative supercurrent in superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator bilayers
Authors: A. Maiani, A. C. C. Drachmann, L. Galletti, C. Schrade, Y. Liu, R. Seoane Souto, S. Vaitiekėnas
Abstract: We report tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements in superconducting Al and ferromagnetic-insulator EuS bilayers. The samples display remanent spin-splitting, roughly half the superconducting gap, and supercurrent transport above the average paramagnetic limit. We interpret this behavior as arising from the interplay between two characteristic length scales: the superconducting coherence length, $\xi$, and the magnetic domain size, $d$. By comparing experimental results to a theoretical model, we find $\xi/d \approx 10$. In this regime, spin-averaging across the micromagnetic configuration can locally suppress superconductivity, resulting in percolative supercurrent flow.

Title: Fast manipulation of a quantum gas on an atom chip with a strong microwave field
Authors: Manon Ballu (LPL), Bastien Mirmand (LPL), Thomas Badr (LPL), Hélène Perrin (LPL), Aurélien Perrin (LPL)
Abstract: We report on an experimental platform based on an atom chip encompassing a coplanar waveguide which enables the manipulation of a quantum gas of sodium atoms with strong microwave fields. We describe the production with this setup of a very elongated degenerate quantum gas with typically 10^6 atoms, that can be prepared all along the cross-over from the three-dimensional to the one-dimensional regime, depending on the atom number and trapping geometry. Using the microwave field radiated by the waveguide, we drive Rabi oscillations between the hyperfine ground states, with the atoms trapped at various distances from the waveguide. At the closest position explored, the field amplitude exceeds 5 G, corresponding to a Rabi frequency on the strongest transition larger than 6 MHz. This enables fast manipulation of the atomic internal state.

Title: An Investigation into the Thermoelectric Characteristics of Silver-based Chalcopyrites Utilizing a Non-empirical Range-separated Dielectric-dependent Hybrid Approach
Authors: Dimple Rani, Subarata Jana, Manish Kumar Niranjan, Prasanjit Samal
Abstract: Our investigation explores the intricate domain of thermoelectric phenomena within silver (Ag)-infused chalcopyrites, focusing on compositions such as AgXTe$_2$ (where X=Ga, In) and the complex quaternary system Ag$_2$ZnSn/GeY$_2$ (with Y=S, Se). Using a sophisticated combination of methodologies, we integrate a non-empirical screened dielectric-dependent hybrid (DDH) functional with semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. This approach allows us to conduct a detailed analysis of critical thermoelectric properties, including electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and power factor. Our methodology goes beyond superficial assessments, delving into the intricate interplay of material properties to reveal their true thermoelectric potential. Additionally, we investigate the often-overlooked phenomena of phonon scattering by leveraging both the elastic constant tensor and the deformation potential method. This enables a rigorous examination of electron relaxation time and lattice thermal conductivity, enhancing the robustness of our predictions and demonstrating our commitment to thorough this http URL our rigorous investigation, we identify materials with a thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT = $\sigma S^{2}T/ \kappa$) exceeding the critical threshold of unity. This significant achievement signals the discovery of materials capable of revolutionizing efficient thermoelectric systems. Our findings delineate a promising trajectory, laying the groundwork for the emergence of a new class of Ag-based chalcopyrites distinguished by their exceptional thermoelectric characteristics. This research not only contributes to the understanding of materials science principles but also catalyzes transformative advancements in thermoelectric technology.

Title: Thermally activated detection of dark particles in a weakly coupled quantum Ising ladder
Authors: Yunjing Gao, Jiahao Yang, Huihang Lin, Rong Yu, Jianda Wu
Abstract: The Ising$_h^2$ integrable field theory emerges when two quantum critical Ising chains are weakly coupled. This theory possesses eight types of relativistic particles, among which the lightest one ($B_1$) has been predicted to be a dark particle, which cannot be excited from the ground state through (quasi-)local operations. The stability on one hand highlights its potential for applications, and on the other hand makes it challenging to be observed. Here, we point out that the mass of the $B_1$ dark particle $m_{B_1}$ appears as a thermally activated gap extracted from local spin dynamical structure factor at low frequency ($\omega \ll m_{B_1}$) and low temperatures ($T \ll m_{B_1}$). We then further propose that this gapped behavior can be directly detected via the NMR relaxation rate measurement in a proper experimental setup. Our results provide a practical criterion for verifying the existence of dark particles.

Title: Electrical magnetochiral anisotropy and quantum metric in chiral conductors
Authors: Yiyang Jiang, Qinyan Yi, Binghai Yan
Abstract: Electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (EMCA) refers to the chirality- and current-dependent nonlinear magnetoresistance in chiral conductors and is commonly interpreted in a semiclassical picture. In this work, we reveal a quantum geometry origin of EMCA using a chiral rectangular lattice model that resembles a chiral organic conductor (DM-EDT-TTF)${}_2$ClO${}_4$ studied for EMCA recently and exhibits symmetry-protected Dirac bands similar to those of graphene. Compared to the semiclassical term, we find that Dirac states contribute significantly to both traditional longitudinal EMCA and the unconventional transverse EMCA via the quantum metric when Fermi energy is close to the Dirac point. Besides, we discover that a topological insulator state can emerge once spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is added to our chiral model lattice. Our work paves a path toward understanding quantum geometry in the magnetotransport of chiral materials.

Title: Bathing in a sea of candidate quantum spin liquids: From the gapless ruby to the gapped maple-leaf lattice
Authors: Philipp Schmoll, Jan Naumann, Erik Lennart Weerda, Jens Eisert, Yasir Iqbal
Abstract: The spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the two-dimensional ruby and maple-leaf lattices is emerging as a new paradigmatic model of frustrated quantum magnetism, with the potential to realize intricate many-body phases on both mineral and synthetic platforms. We provide evidence that the generalized model interpolating between these two lattices features an extended quantum spin liquid ground state, which is gapless on the ruby lattice and gapped on the maple-leaf lattice, with the transition between the two occurring midway. We present equal-time spin structure factors which further characterize the nature of the presumed quantum spin liquid. Our results are based on one of the most extensive state-of-the-art variational infinite tensor network calculations to date, thereby helping us to resolve the long-standing issue of the delicate competition between magnetically ordered and paramagnetic states in this family of models.

Title: Method of images for one-dimensional discrete random walk under a reflecting barrier
Authors: Kazuhiko Seki
Abstract: The transition probability for a one-dimensional discrete symmetric random walk under a reflecting barrier was once given by the method of images. [S. Chandrasekhar, Rev. Mod. Phys. 15, 1 (1943).] However, several inconsistencies have been reported when the method of images is applied in cases where a reflecting barrier is considered, even after the exact solution has been obtained. Here, we explicitly show that the method of images becomes applicable if the image position is shifted.

Title: Boltzmann Sampling by Diabatic Quantum Annealing
Authors: Ju-Yeon Gyhm, Gilhan Kim, Hyukjoon Kwon, Yongjoo Baek
Abstract: Boltzmann sampling plays a key role in numerous algorithms, including those in machine learning. While quantum annealers have been explored as fast Boltzmann samplers, their reliance on environmental noise limits control over the effective temperature, introducing uncertainties in the sampling process. As an alternative, we propose diabatic quantum annealing -- a faster, purely unitary process -- as a controllable Boltzmann sampler, where the effective temperature is tuned via the annealing rate. Using infinite-range and two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising models, we show that this approach enables rapid and accurate sampling in the high-temperature regime, with errors remaining bounded in the paramagnetic phase, regardless of system size.

Title: Engineering quantum droplet formation by cavity-induced long-range interactions
Authors: Leon Mixa, Milan Radonjić, Axel Pelster, Michael Thorwart
Abstract: We investigate a dilute Bose gas with both a short-range contact and an effective long-range interaction between the atoms. The latter is induced by the strong coupling to a cavity light mode and is spatially characterized by a periodic signature and a tunable envelope rooted in the pumping of the cavity. We formulate a Bogoliubov theory based on a homogeneous mean-field description and quantum fluctuations around it. The competition between the repulsive contact interaction and the long-range interaction allows the formation of self-bound quantum droplets. This generic approach is applied to two cavity setups, one without and one with a momentum-conserving effective long-range interaction between the atoms in the form of a driven dispersive cavity mode and a multimode cavity, respectively. For both cases we show analytically how the size and the central density of the cavity-induced quantum droplets depend on the contact interaction strength and on the shape of the spatial envelope of the long-range interaction.

Title: Exactly solvable models for fermionic symmetry-enriched topological phases and fermionic 't Hooft anomaly
Authors: Jing-Ren Zhou, Zheng-Cheng Gu
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry and topological properties plays a very important role in modern physics. In the past decade, the concept of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases was proposed and their classifications have been systematically studied for bosonic systems. Very recently, the concept of SET phases has been generalized into fermionic systems and their corresponding classification schemes are also proposed. Nevertheless, how to realize all these fermionic SET (fSET) phases in lattice models remains to be a difficult open problem. In this paper, we first construct exactly solvable models for non-anomalous non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases, namely, the symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net models, which are described by commuting-projector Hamiltonians whose ground states are the fixed-point wavefunctions of each fSET phase. Mathematically, we provide a partial definition to $G$-graded super fusion category, which is the input data of a symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net model. Next, we construct exactly solvable models for non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases with 't Hooft anomaly, especially the $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly which is different from the well known bosonic $H^4(G,U(1)_T)$ anomaly. In our construction, this $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly is characterized by a violation of fermion-parity conservation in some of the surface ${F}$-moves (a kind of renormalization moves for the ground state wavefunctions of surface SET phases), and also by a new fermionic obstruction $\Theta$ in the surface pentagon equation. We demonstrate this construction in a concrete example that the surface topological order is a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory embedded into a fermion system and the total symmetry $G^f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$.

Title: Random-Flux-Induced Transition Sequence between Weak and Strong Topological Phases with Anisotropic Localization Properties
Authors: Chang-An Li, Bo Fu, Jian Li, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: We demonstrate that random flux is able to drive nontrivial topological phase transitions, in particular between weak topological insulators (WTIs) and Chern insulators (CIs), illustrated on an anisotropic Wilson-Dirac model in two dimensions. Remarkably, an intriguing topological transition sequence WTIs$\rightarrow$CIs$\rightarrow$WTIs occurs with the reentrance to a WTI but of different weak topology, which is unattainable with chemical potential disorder. The involvement of anisotropy and weak topology in such a transition gives rise to emergent quasi-critical points, where eigen states are extended in one spatial direction but localized in the other one. This new quantum criticality lies outside the conventional quantum Hall universality class. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the random-flux-induced phase transitions and quantum criticality from both bulk and boundary perspectives. Our results describe a qualitatively new disorder effect based on the interplay of random flux with topological phases of matter.

Title: Emergence of a Bandgap in Nano-Scale Graphite: A Computational and Experimental Study

Abstract: Bandgaps in layered materials are critical for enabling functionalities such as tunable photodetection, efficient energy conversion, and nonlinear optical responses, which are essential for next-generation photonic and quantum devices. Gap engineering could form heterostructures with complementary materials like transition metal dichalcogenides or perovskites for multi-functional devices. Graphite, conventionally regarded as a gapless material, exhibits a bandgap of ~100 meV in nano-scale patterned highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), as revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and Raman measurements. Our state-of-the-art calculations, incorporating photoemission matrix element effects, predict this bandgap with remarkable accuracy and attribute it to mechanical distortions introduced during patterning. This work bridges theory and experiment, providing the direct evidence of a tunable bandgap in HOPG. Beyond its fundamental significance, this finding opens new possibilities for designing materials with tailored electronic properties, enabling advancements in terahertz devices and optoelectronics.

Title: Many-Body Dissipative Particle Dynamics Simulations of Lipid Bilayers with the MDPD-MARTINI Force-Field
Authors: Natalia Kramarz, Luís H. Carnevale, Panagiotis E. Theodorakis
Abstract: Many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD) offers a significant speed-up in the simulation of various systems, including soft matter, in comparison with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on Lennard-Jones nteractions, which is crucial for describing phenomena characterized by large time and length scales. Moreover, it has recently been shown that the MARTINI force-field coarse-graining approach is applicable in MDPD, thus rendering feasible the simulation of complex systems as in MD MARTINI for ever larger systems for longer physical times. Here, simulations of various lipid membranes were performed by using the MDPD-MARTINI coarse-grained (CG) force-field, relevant properties were calculated, and comparison with standard MD MARTINI CG simulations and experimental data was made. Thus insights into structural properties of these bilayer systems and further evidence regarding the transferability of the MDPD-MARTINI models are provided. In this regard, this is a natural next step in the development of the general-purpose MDPD-MARTINI CG force-field, which generally provides significant speed-ups in both computational and physical simulated times, in comparison with standard CG MD simulations.

Title: Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon Analogs in Full-Shell Hybrid Nanowires
Authors: M. T. Deng, Carlos Payá, Pablo San-Jose, Elsa Prada, C. M. Marcus, S. Vaitiekėnas
Abstract: We report tunneling spectroscopy of Andreev subgap states in hybrid nanowires with a thin superconducting full-shell surrounding a semiconducting core. The combination of the quantized fluxoid of the shell and the Andreev reflection at the superconductor-semiconductor interface gives rise to analogs of Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states found in Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors. Unlike in metallic superconductors, CdGM analogs in full-shell hybrid nanowires manifest as one-dimensional van Hove singularities with energy spacings comparable to the superconducting gap and independent of the Fermi energy, making them readily observable. Evolution of these analogs with axial magnetic field, skewed within the Little-Parks lobe structure, is consistent with theory and yields information about the radial distribution and angular momenta of the corresponding subbands.

Title: On the origin of heating-induced softening and enthalpic reinforcement in elastomeric nanocomposites
Authors: Pierre Kawak, Harshad Bhapkar, David S. Simmons
Abstract: Despite a century of use, the mechanism of nanoparticle-driven mechanical reinforcement of elastomers is unresolved. A major hypothesis attributes it to glassy interparticle bridges, supported by an observed inversion of the variation of the modulus E(T) on heating -- from entropic stiffening in elastomers to enthalpic softening in nanocomposites. Here, molecular simulations reveal that elastomer enthalpic softening can instead emerge from a competition over preferred nonequilibrium volumes between elastomer and nanoparticulate networks. A theory for this competition accounting for softening of the bulk modulus on heating predicts the simulated E(T) inversion, suggesting that reinforcement is driven by a volume-competition mechanism unique to co-continuous systems of soft and rigid networks.

Title: Coherent Interaction of 2s and 1s Exciton States in Transition-Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers
Authors: Max Wegerhoff, Moritz Scharfstädt, Stefan Linden, Andrea Bergschneider
Abstract: We use femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy to study the coherent interaction of excited exciton states in WSe2 and MoSe2 monolayers via the optical Stark effect. For co-circularly polarized pump and probe, we measure a blueshift which points to a repulsive interaction between the 2s and 1s exciton states. The determined 2s-1s interaction strength is on par with that of the 1s-1s, in agreement with the semiconductor Bloch equations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a 2s-1s biexciton bound state in the cross-circular configuration in both materials and determine their binding energy.

Title: Learning the Electronic Hamiltonian of Large Atomic Structures
Authors: Chen Hao Xia, Manasa Kaniselvan, Alexandros Nikolaos Ziogas, Marko Mladenović, Rayen Mahjoub, Alexander Maeder, Mathieu Luisier
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in learning the ground-state electronic properties of materials, subverting ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations when the underlying lattices can be represented as small and/or repeatable unit cells (i.e., molecules and periodic crystals). Realistic systems are, however, non-ideal and generally characterized by higher structural complexity. As such, they require large (10+ Angstroms) unit cells and thousands of atoms to be accurately described. At these scales, DFT becomes computationally prohibitive, making GNNs especially attractive. In this work, we present a strictly local equivariant GNN capable of learning the electronic Hamiltonian (H) of realistically extended materials. It incorporates an augmented partitioning approach that enables training on arbitrarily large structures while preserving local atomic environments beyond boundaries. We demonstrate its capabilities by predicting the electronic Hamiltonian of various systems with up to 3,000 nodes (atoms), 500,000+ edges, ~28 million orbital interactions (nonzero entries of H), and $\leq$0.53% error in the eigenvalue spectra. Our work expands the applicability of current electronic property prediction methods to some of the most challenging cases encountered in computational materials science, namely systems with disorder, interfaces, and defects.

Title: RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin-spin interactions in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: D. O. Oriekhov, T. T. Osterholt, R. A. Duine, V. P. Gusynin
Abstract: We study the competition between the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin-spin interactions of two magnetic impurities in twisted bilayer graphene away from the magic angle. We apply the Bistritzer-MacDonald model of two graphene layers twisted with respect to each other by a small angle. By reducing the model to the Dirac-type one with modified Fermi velocity, we derive expressions for the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin interactions using perturbation theory for the free energy. The biquadratic interaction is suppressed by a larger power of the interaction constant and decreases faster with a the distance between impurities comparing to the quadratic one. Nevertheless, due to the different period of oscillations with impurity separation distance, chemical potential, twist angle and temperature, it is possible to fine-tune the system to the regime of dominating biquadratic interaction. The existence of such fine-tuned regime might provide a promising opportunity to observe non-conventional spin ordering.

Title: Topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions
Authors: Grant Z. X. Yang, Zi-Ting Sun, Ying-Ming Xie, K. T. Law
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are pivotal for engineering topological superconductivity, yet are severely hindered by orbital effects induced by in-plane magnetic fields. In this work, we introduce the generic topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions (TAJJs) by leveraging the intrinsic spin-polarized band splitting and zero net magnetization attributes of altermagnets. Our proposed TAJJs effectively mitigate the detrimental orbital effects while robustly hosting Majorana end modes (MEMs) at both ends of the junction. Specifically, we demonstrate that MEMs emerge in $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave TAJJs but vanish in the $d_{xy}$-wave configuration, thereby establishing the crystallographic orientation angle $\theta$ of the altermagnet as a novel control parameter of topology. The distinct spin-polarization of the MEMs provides an unambiguous experimental signature for the spin-resolved measurement. Furthermore, by harnessing the synergy between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet and its superconducting counterpart, our proposal extends to high-$T_c$ platforms naturally. Overall, this work establishes altermagnets as a versatile paradigm for realizing topological superconductivity, bridging conceptual innovations with scalable quantum architectures devoid of orbital effects and stray fields.

Title: The role of effective mass and long-range interactions in the band-gap renormalization of photo-excited semiconductors
Authors: Cian C. Reeves, Scott K. Cushing, Vojtech Vlcek
Abstract: Understanding how to control changes in electronic structure and related dynamical renormalizations by external driving fields is the key for understanding ultrafast spectroscopy and applications in electronics. Here we focus on the band-gap's modulation by external electric fields and uncover the effect of band dispersion on the gap renormalization. We employ the Green's function formalism using the real-time Dyson expansion to account for dynamical correlations induced by photodoping. The many-body formalism captures the dynamics of systems with long-range interactions, carrier mobility, and variable electron and hole effective mass. We also demonstrate that mean-field simulations based on the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, which lacks dynamical correlations, yields a qualitatively incorrect picture of band-gap renormalization. We find the trend that increasing effective mass, thus decreasing mobility, leads to as much as a 6\% enhancement in band-gap renormalization. Further, the renormalization is strongly dependent on the degree of photodoping. As the screening induced by free electrons and holes effectively reduces any long-range and interband interactions for highly excited systems, we show that there is a specific turnover point with minimal band-gap. We further demonstrate that the optical gap renormalization follows the same trend though its magnitude is altered by the Moss-Burstein effect.

Title: Comprehensive landscape and simple rules for transition-metal Heusler semiconductors
Authors: Yubo Zhang, Zirui Dong, Jun Luo
Abstract: Heusler alloys, renowned for their multifunctionality and capacity for vast elemental customization, are primarily classified into half-Heusler (XYZ) and full-Heusler (X2YZ) structural types. Typically, the 18-electron half-Heusler and the 24-electron full-Heusler alloys are recognized as semiconductors, following the Slater-Pauling rule. Semiconductors are desired for many applications, but they represent a minor portion compared to the predominantly metallic and half-metallic members of the Heusler family. Recently, vacancy-filling off-stoichiometric Heuslers of ternary X1+bYZ (0 <= b <= 1) and quaternary XaX'bYZ (1 <= a + b <= 2) have emerged as a more versatile strategy. However, the flexibility associated with off-stoichiometry inevitably leads to complications, including issues with fractional filling ratios and complex site occupations. This work presents a comprehensive landscape of transition-metal-containing Heusler semiconductors, focusing on the off-stoichiometric Heuslers but seamlessly encompassing the integer-stoichiometric systems. The structural and electronic properties can be theoretically understood through a few simple rules. Many systems have been experimentally validated, showcasing their potential for applications such as thermoelectric converters.

Title: Screening in Hubbard models with long-range interactions
Authors: Florian Gebhard, Kevin Bauerbach, Örs Legeza
Abstract: We provide solid evidence for the long-standing presumption that model Hamiltonians with short-range interactions faithfully reproduce the physics of the long-range Coulomb interaction in real materials. For this aim, we address a generic Hubbard model that captures the quantum phase transitions between metal, Mott insulator, and charge-density-wave insulator, in the absence of Fermi-surface nesting. By comparing the quantum phase diagrams for the $1/r$-Hubbard model on a half-filled chain with nearest-neighbor and $1/r$-long-range interactions, we argue that the inclusion of long-range interactions is not crucial for a proper description of interacting many-electron systems. To this end, we employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method on finite lattices and antiperiodic boundary conditions to determine the quantum phase transitions between the metallic Luttinger liquid for weak interactions, the Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant on-site interactions, and the charge-density wave insulator for dominant inter-site interactions. The two phase diagrams qualitatively agree inasmuch as the quantum phase transitions are continuous in both cases. Moreover, simple Hartree-Fock theory and the atomic limit provide renormalization factors that allow us to quantitatively map the two phase diagrams onto each other. As a practical advantage, our findings imply that computational efforts can be reduced tremendously by using models with short-range interactions only.

Title: Monitored Fluctuating Hydrodynamics
Authors: Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Ewan McCulloch, Romain Vasseur
Abstract: We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced "sharpening" phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known charge-sharpening transition for diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.

Title: A machine learning approach to fast thermal equilibration
Authors: Diego Rengifo, Gabriel Tellez, Gabriel Téllez
Abstract: We present a method to design driving protocols that achieve fast thermal equilibration of a system of interest using techniques inspired by machine learning training algorithms. For example, consider a Brownian particle manipulated by optical tweezers. The force on the particle can be controlled and adjusted over time, resulting in a driving protocol that transitions the particle from an initial state to a final state. Once the driving protocol has been completed, the system requires additional time to relax to thermal equilibrium. Designing driving protocols that bypass the relaxation period is of interest so that, at the end of the protocol, the system is either in thermal equilibrium or very close to it. Several studies have addressed this problem through reverse engineering methods, which involve prescribing a specific evolution for the probability density function of the system and then deducing the corresponding form of the driving protocol potential. Here, we propose a new method that can be applied to more complex systems where reverse engineering is not feasible. We simulate the evolution of a large ensemble of trajectories while tracking the gradients with respect to a parametrization of the driving protocol. The final probability density function is compared to the target equilibrium one. Using machine learning libraries, the gradients are computed via backpropagation and the protocol is iteratively adjusted until the optimal protocol is achieved. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with several examples.

Abstract: Electronic-structure theory is the foundation of the description of materials including multiscale modeling of their properties and functions. Obviously, without sufficient accuracy at the base, reliable predictions are unlikely at any level that follows. The software package FHI-aims has proven to be a game changer for accurate free-energy calculations because of its scalability, numerical precision, and its efficient handling of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and van der Waals interactions. It treats molecules, clusters, and extended systems (solids and liquids) on an equal footing. Besides DFT, FHI-aims also includes quantum-chemistry methods, descriptions for excited states and vibrations, and calculations of various types of transport. Recent advancements address the integration of FHI-aims into an increasing number of workflows and various artificial intelligence (AI) methods. This Roadmap describes the state-of-the-art of FHI-aims and advancements that are currently ongoing or planned.

Title: Counting observables in stochastic excursions
Authors: Guilherme Fiusa, Pedro E. Harunari, Abhaya S. Hegde, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: Understanding fluctuations of observables across stochastic trajectories is essential for various fields of research, from quantum thermal machines to biological motors. We introduce the notion of stochastic excursions as a framework to analyze sub-trajectories of processes far from equilibrium. Given a partition of state space in two phases, labeled active and inactive, an excursion starts with a transition into the active phase and ends upon returning to inactivity. By incorporating counting observables, our approach captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, providing insights on thermodynamic trade-offs between energy expenditure, entropy production, and dynamical activity. As our main result, we uncover a fundamental relation between fluctuations of counting observables at the single-excursion level and the steady state noise obtained from full counting statistics. We also show the existence of an exchange-type fluctuation theorem at the level of individual excursions. As an application, we explore how analyzing excursions yields additional insights into the operation of the three-qubit absorption refrigerator.

Title: Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium MaxEnt
Authors: Miguel Aguilera, Sosuke Ito, Artemy Kolchinsky
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables (such as spatiotemporal correlation functions). It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. It may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different kinds of interactions, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.

Title: Subsystem localization
Authors: Arpita Goswami, Pallabi Chatterjee, Ranjan Modak, Shaon Sahoo
Abstract: We consider a ladder system where one leg, referred to as the ``bath", is governed by an Aubry-André (AA) type Hamiltonian, while the other leg, termed the ``subsystem", follows a standard tight-binding Hamiltonian. We investigate the localization properties in the subsystem induced by its coupling to the bath. For the coupling strength larger than a critical value ($t'>t'_c$), the analysis of the static properties show that there are three distinct phases as the AA potential strength $V$ is varied: a fully delocalized phase at low $V$, a localized phase at intermediate $V$, and a weakly delocalized (fractal) phase at large $V$. An analysis of the wavepacket dynamics shows that the delocalized phase exhibits a ballistic behavior, whereas the weakly delocalized phase is subdiffusive. Interestingly, we also find a superdiffusive narrow crossover regime along the line separating the delocalized and localized phases. When $t'<t'_c$, the intermediate localized phase disappears, and we find a delocalized (ballistic) phase at low $V$ and a weakly delocalized (subdiffusive) phase at large $V$. Between those two phases, there is also a crossover regime where the system can be super- or subdiffusive. Finally, in some limiting scenario, we also establish a mapping between our ladder system and a well-studied one-dimensional generalized Aubry-André (GAA) model.

Title: Unlocking the hybrid piezo and pyroelectric nanogenerators performance by SiO2 nanowires confinement in poly(vinylidene fluoride)
Authors: Juan Delgado-Alvarez, Hari Krishna Mishra, Francisco J. Aparicio, Xabier Garcia-Casas, Angel Barranco, Juan R. Sanchez-Valencia, Victor Lopez-Flores, Ana Borras
Abstract: We report on the development of a novel flexible piezo/pyro-electric nanogenerator (PPNG) that combines a uniform film of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) infiltrated over vertically supported SiO2 nanowires (NWs) to enhance both piezoelectric and pyroelectric energy harvesting capabilities. The synthetic procedure involves a low-temperature multi-step approach, including the soft-template formation of SiO2 NWs on a flexible substrate, followed by the infiltration of a PVDF thin film (TF). The plasma-enabled fabrication of SiO2 NWs facilitated vertical alignment and precise control over the surface microstructure, density, and thickness of the confined nanostructures. These strategic structural systems promote the development of the most favourable electroactive \b{eta}- and {\gamma}-phases in the PVDF matrix. Notably, the electrical poling plays a major role in aligning the random dipoles of the PVDF macromolecular chain in a more ordered fashion to nucleate the amplified electroactive phases. As a proof-of-concept, the fabricated PPNG exhibited a significant improvement in the instantaneous piezoelectric output power density (P), ~ 9-fold amplification relative to its bare PVDF TF counterpart. Analogously, the pyroelectric coefficient (p) demonstrated a 4-fold superior performance with referenced PVDF TF based PPNG. Thus, the engineered system of SiO2 NWs@PVDF comprising PPNG offers a promising pathway toward multisource energy harvesting capabilities through efficient energy transduction at mechanical excitation frequencies of 10-12 Hz and across a temperature difference ({\Delta}T) of 9 to 22 K.

Title: Buried unstrained Ge channels: a lattice-matched platform for quantum technology
Authors: Davide Costa, Karina Hudson, Patrick Del Vecchio, Lucas E. A. Stehouwer, Alberto Tosato, Davide Degli Esposti, Mario Lodari, Stefano Bosco, Giordano Scappucci
Abstract: Ge and Si strained quantum wells have enabled the most advanced spin-qubit quantum processors, but they are deposited on defective, metamorphic SiGe substrates, which may impact device performance and scaling. Here we introduce an alternative platform, based on a heterojunction between unstrained Ge and a strained SiGe barrier, which is lattice-matched to a Ge substrate. In a structure with a 52-nm-thick strained SiGe barrier, we demonstrate a low-disorder two-dimensional hole gas with a high-mobility of 1.33$\times$10$^5$ cm$^2$/Vs and a low percolation density of 1.4(1)$\times$10$^1$$^0$ cm$^-$$^2$. Quantum transport measurements show that confined holes have a strong density-dependent in-plane effective mass and out-of-plane $g$-factor, pointing to a significant heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in agreement with theory. The expected strong spin-orbit interaction, possibility of isotopic purification, and ability to host superconducting pairing correlations make this platform appealing for fast quantum hardware and hybrid quantum systems.

Abstract: Optical generation of transverse coherent phonons by femtosecond light pulses is appealing for high-speed sub-THz active control of material properties. Lead-free double perovskite semiconductors, such as Cs2AgBiBr6, attract particular interest due to their cubic to tetragonal phase transition below room temperature and strong polaron effects from carrier-lattice coupling. Here, we reveal that the anisotropic photostriction in halide perovskites with tetragonal crystal structure represents an efficient non-thermal tool for generating transverse coherent phonons. In particular, we demonstrate that along with compressive strain, optical generation of photoexcited carriers leads to strong shear strain in Cs2AgBiBr6 below the phase transition temperature of 122 K. Using time-domain Brillouin spectroscopy, we observe coherent transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons with comparable amplitudes in the tetragonal phase, while in the cubic phase only longitudinal phonons are generated. The polarization of the photoinduced transverse phonons is dictated by the projection of the c-axis on the surface plane, which leads to a prominent anisotropic polarization response in the detection. The generated strain pulses correspond to transverse acoustic soft eigenmodes with a strong temperature dependence of dispersion, which provides an additional degree of freedom for active hypersonic control.

Title: Hole spin qubits in unstrained Germanium layers
Authors: Lorenzo Mauro, Mauricio J. Rodriguez, Esteban A. Rodriguez-Mena, Yann-Michel Niquet
Abstract: Strained germanium heterostructures are one of the most promising material for hole spin qubits but suffer from the strong anisotropy of the gyromagnetic factors that hinders the optimization of the magnetic field orientation. The figures of merit (Rabi frequencies, lifetimes...) can indeed vary by an order of magnitude within a few degrees around the heterostructure plane. We propose to address this issue by confining the holes at the interface of an unstrained, bulk Ge substrate or thick buffer. We model such structures and show that the gyromagnetic anisotropy is indeed considerably reduced. In addition, the Rabi frequencies and quality factors can be significantly improved with respect to strained heterostructures. This extends the operational range of the qubits and shall ease the scale-up to many-qubit systems.

Title: Third order corrections to the ground state energy of a Bose gas in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime
Authors: Cristina Caraci, Alessandro Olgiati, Diane Saint Aubin, Benjamin Schlein
Abstract: For a translation invariant system of $N$ bosons in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime, we establish a precise bound for the ground state energy $E_N$. While the leading, order $N$, contribution to $E_N$ has been known since [30,28] and the second order corrections (of order one) have been first determined in [5], our estimate also resolves the next term in the asymptotic expansion of $E_N$, which is of the order $(\log N) / N$.

Title: Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: I. Calculation of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence intensities
Authors: Józef Kuśba
Abstract: Previously obtained expressions describing the intensity of stationary fluorescence emitted by a multicomponent solution were significantly improved by using matrix calculus. Then, using a similar technique, new expressions describing the decay of the fluorescence intensity of the multicomponent system after pulsed excitation were found. In both of these cases, the effects of the internal filter, the effects of multistep radiative transfer of excitation energy, the possibility of radiative back-transfer, as well as the possibility of changes in the quantum yield of individual components due to radiationless transfer of excitation energy were taken into account. The cases of one-, two- and three-component systems were discussed in detail.

Title: Collective motion from quantum-inspired dynamics in visual perception
Authors: Jyotiranjan Beuria, Mayank Chaurasiya, Laxmidhar Behera
Abstract: We propose a model of collective behavior in self-propelled active agents that incorporates a perceptual decision-making process. In this framework, the decision-making dynamics is modeled using quantum formalism. The perceptual decision state of each agent is an entangled or superposed state of the decision states for the neighboring agents within the vision cone. We suggest that in this framework, the force driving the movement of active agents is governed by the quantum average of its perception operator, providing a bridge between perceptual decision-making processes and classical dynamics. Additionally, we introduce two perceptual measures of cohesion in the flock, namely, perception strength and perceptual energy, to characterize collective behavior in terms of decision-making dynamics. Our model demonstrates that, with an appropriate choice of perceptual decision state, the well-known Vicsek model of flocking behavior can be derived as a specific case of this quantum-inspired approach. This approach provides fresh insights into collective behavior and multi-agent coordination, revealing how classical patterns of collective behavior emerge naturally from perception.

Title: Competing automorphisms and disordered Floquet codes
Authors: Cory T. Aitchison, Benjamin Béri
Abstract: Topological order is a promising basis for quantum error correction, a key milestone towards large-scale quantum computing. Floquet codes provide a dynamical scheme for this while also exhibiting Floquet-enriched topological order (FET) where anyons periodically undergo a measurement-induced automorphism that acts uniformly in space. We study disordered Floquet codes where automorphisms have a spatiotemporally heterogeneous distribution -- the automorphisms "compete". We characterize the effect of this competition, showing how key features of the purification dynamics of mixed codestates can be inferred from anyon and automorphism properties for any Abelian topological order. This perspective can explain the protection or measurement of logical information in a dynamic automorphism (DA) code when subjected to a noise model of missing measurements. We demonstrate this using a DA color code with perturbed measurement sequences. The framework of competing automorphisms captures essential features of Floquet codes and robustness to noise, and may elucidate key mechanisms involving topological order, automorphisms, and fault-tolerance.

Title: Cavity-Quantum Electrodynamics with Moiré Flatband Photonic Crystals

Abstract: Quantum emitters are a key component in photonic quantum technologies. Enhancing their single-photon emission by engineering the photonic environment using cavities can significantly improve the overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often constrained by the need for precise nanoscale control over the emitter's position within micro- or nano-cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moiré patterns, we present an approach to strongly modify the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter using a finely designed multilayer moiré photonic crystal with a robust isolated-flatband dispersion. Theoretical analysis reveals that, due to its nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moiré cavity can simultaneously achieve a high Purcell factor and exhibit large tolerance over the emitter's position. We experimentally demonstrate the coupling between this moiré cavity and a quantum dot through the cavity-determined polarization of the dot's emission. The radiative lifetime of the quantum dot can be tuned by a factor of 40, ranging from 42 ps to 1692 ps, which is attributed to strong Purcell enhancement and Purcell inhibition effects. Our findings pave the way for moiré flatband cavity-enhanced quantum light sources, quantum optical switches, and quantum nodes for quantum internet applications.

Title: A self-consistent quasilinear theory for collisionless relaxation to universal quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos
Authors: Uddipan Banik, Amitava Bhattacharjee
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent mystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven, inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for the secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to linear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that are collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the response matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to all orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in $N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core, and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor solutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state solution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white noise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal nature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more particles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the fluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated halo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ can either be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary condition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact subhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo profiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation described by a self-consistent QLT.

Title: Towards scalable active steering protocols for genuinely entangled state manifolds
Authors: Samuel Morales, Silvia Pappalardi, Reinhold Egger
Abstract: We introduce and analyze an active steering protocol designed to target multipartite entangled states. The protocol involves multiple qubits subjected to weak Bell pair measurements with active feedback, where the feedback operations are optimized to maximize the Quantum Fisher Information. Our scheme efficiently reaches a genuinely entangled one-parameter state manifold. Numerical simulations for systems with up to 22 qubits suggest that the protocol is scalable and allows high multipartite entanglement across the system.

Title: Identifying Switching of Antiferromagnets by Spin-Orbit Torques
Authors: Martin Jourdan, Jonathan Bläßer, Guzmán Orero Gámez, Sonka Reimers, Lukas Odenbreit, Miriam Fischer, Yuran Niu, Evangelos Golias, Francesco Maccherozzi, Armin Kleibert, Hermann Stoll, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: Antiferromagnets are promising candidates for ultrafast spintronic applications, leveraging current-induced spin-orbit torques. However, experimentally distinguishing between different switching mechanisms of the staggered magnetization (Néel vector) driven by current pulses remains a challenge. In an exemplary study of the collinear antiferromagnetic compound Mn$_2$Au, we demonstrate that slower thermomagnetoelastic effects predominantly govern switching over a wide parameter range. In the regime of short current pulses in the nanosecond range, however, we observe fully Néel spin-orbit torque driven switching. We show that this ultrafast mechanism enables the complete directional alignment of the Néel vector by current pulses in device structures.

Title: In-context denoising with one-layer transformers: connections between attention and associative memory retrieval
Authors: Matthew Smart, Alberto Bietti, Anirvan M. Sengupta
Abstract: We introduce in-context denoising, a task that refines the connection between attention-based architectures and dense associative memory (DAM) networks, also known as modern Hopfield networks. Using a Bayesian framework, we show theoretically and empirically that certain restricted denoising problems can be solved optimally even by a single-layer transformer. We demonstrate that a trained attention layer processes each denoising prompt by performing a single gradient descent update on a context-aware DAM energy landscape, where context tokens serve as associative memories and the query token acts as an initial state. This one-step update yields better solutions than exact retrieval of either a context token or a spurious local minimum, providing a concrete example of DAM networks extending beyond the standard retrieval paradigm. Overall, this work solidifies the link between associative memory and attention mechanisms first identified by Ramsauer et al., and demonstrates the relevance of associative memory models in the study of in-context learning.

Title: A new pathway to generative artificial intelligence by minimizing the maximum entropy
Authors: Mattia Miotto, Lorenzo Monacelli
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence revolutionized society. Current models are trained by minimizing the distance between the produced data and the training set. Consequently, development is plateauing as they are intrinsically data-hungry and challenging to direct during the generative process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a paradigm shift through a framework where we do not fit the training set but find the most informative yet least noisy representation of the data simultaneously minimizing the entropy to reduce noise and maximizing it to remain unbiased via adversary training. The result is a general physics-driven model, which is data-efficient and flexible, permitting to control and influence the generative process. Benchmarking shows that our approach outperforms variational autoencoders. We demonstrate the methods effectiveness in generating images, even with limited training data, and its unprecedented capability to customize the generation process a posteriori without any fine-tuning or retraining

Title: How to build transfer matrices, one wave at a time
Authors: Joaquin Garcia-Suarez
Abstract: We show how to build the closed-form expression of transfer matrices for wave propagation in layered media. The key is to represent the propagation across the piece-wise constant medium as a superposition of a finite number of paths ($2^{N-1}$ paths for a medium with $N$ layers), each one of them contributing a certain phase change (corresponding to signed sums of the phase change in each individual layer) and amplitude change (corresponding to the pattern of transmission and/or reflection associated to each path). The outlined technique is combinatorial in nature: it begins with the linear governing equations in frequency domain, whose fundamental solution is known, then it enumerates the finite number of paths across the overall system, then computes their associated phase and amplitude change, and finally adds all the possible paths to find the final result. Beyond providing physical insight, this ''path-by-path'' construction can also circumvent the need for transfer matrix numerical multiplication in many practical applications, potentially enabling substantial computational savings.

Title: Exciton--hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridization in Biased Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Tomer Eini, N. M. R. Peres, Yarden Mazor, Itai Epstein
Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.

Title: Thermal avalanches in isolated many-body localized systems
Authors: Muhammad Sajid, Rozhin Yousefjani, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: Many-body localization is a profound phase of matter affecting the entire spectrum which emerges in the presence of disorder in interacting many-body systems. Recently, the stability of many-body localization has been challenged by the avalanche mechanism, in which a small thermal region can spread, destabilizing localization and leading to global thermalization of the system. A key unresolved question is the critical competition between the thermal region's influence and the disorder strength required to trigger such an avalanche. Here, we numerically investigate many-body localization stability in an isolated Heisenberg spin chain of size $L$ subjected to a disordered magnetic field. By embedding a tunable thermal region of size $P$, we analyze the system's behavior in both static and dynamical regimes using entanglement entropy and the gap ratio. Our study yields two main findings. Firstly, for strong disorder, the avalanche only occurs if the thermal region scales with system size, specifically when $P/L$ exceeds a threshold value. Secondly, at strong disorder, we identify an intermediate phase between many-body localization and ergodic behavior as $P$ increases. This intermediate phase leaves its finger print in both static and dynamic properties of the system and tends to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. Although our simulations are restricted to finite system sizes, the analysis suggests that these results hold in the thermodynamic limit for isolated many-body systems.
