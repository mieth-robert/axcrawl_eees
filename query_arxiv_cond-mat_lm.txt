Title: Nitrogen and hydrogen intercalation into crystalline fullerite C$_{60}$ and photoluminescent studies in a wide temperature range
Authors: V. Zoryansky, P. Zinoviev, Yu. Semerenko
Abstract: Optical properties of fullerite C$_{60}$ single crystals saturated with hydrogen and nitrogen molecules were studied in the temperature range from 20 K to 230 K using the spectral-luminescent method. Saturation was carried out under a pressure of 30 atm at various temperatures from 470 K to 720 K. At saturation temperatures above 520 K for hydrogen and 690 K for nitrogen, chemical interaction of impurity molecules and the fullerene matrix occurs, forming new chemical compounds. The results of a study of the photoluminescent properties of a new substances are presented for the first time.

Title: Gauging non-invertible symmetries on the lattice
Authors: Sahand Seifnashri, Shu-Heng Shao, Xinping Yang
Abstract: We provide a general prescription for gauging finite non-invertible symmetries in 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian systems. Our primary example is the Rep(D$_8$) fusion category generated by the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation, which is the simplest anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry on a spin chain of qubits. We explicitly compute its lattice F-symbols and illustrate our prescription for a particular (non-maximal) gauging of this symmetry. In our gauging procedure, we introduce two qubits around each link, playing the role of "gauge fields" for the non-invertible symmetry, and impose novel Gauss's laws. Similar to the Kramers-Wannier transformation for gauging an ordinary $\mathbb{Z}_2$, our gauging can be summarized by a gauging map, which is part of a larger, continuous non-invertible cosine symmetry.

Title: Finite-temperature quantum topological order in three dimensions
Authors: Shu-Tong Zhou, Meng Cheng, Tibor Rakovszky, Curt von Keyserlingk, Tyler D. Ellison
Abstract: We identify a three-dimensional system that exhibits long-range entanglement at sufficiently small but nonzero temperature--it therefore constitutes a quantum topological order at finite temperature. The model of interest is known as the fermionic toric code, a variant of the usual 3D toric code, which admits emergent fermionic point-like excitations. The fermionic toric code, importantly, possesses an anomalous 2-form symmetry, associated with the space-like Wilson loops of the fermionic excitations. We argue that it is this symmetry that imbues low-temperature thermal states with a novel topological order and long-range entanglement. Based on the current classification of three-dimensional topological orders, we expect that the low-temperature thermal states of the fermionic toric code belong to an equilibrium phase of matter that only exists at nonzero temperatures. We conjecture that further examples of topological orders at nonzero temperatures are given by discrete gauge theories with anomalous 2-form symmetries. Our work therefore opens the door to studying quantum topological order at nonzero temperature in physically realistic dimensions.

Title: Vestigial Order from an Excitonic Mother State in Kagome Superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Julian Ingham, Ronny Thomale, Harley D. Scammell
Abstract: Alongside high-temperature charge order and superconductivity, kagome metals exhibit signatures of time-reversal symmetry breaking and nematicity which appear to depend strongly on external perturbations such as strain and magnetic fields, posing a fundamental challenge for conceptual reconciliation. We develop a theory of vestigial order descending from an excitonic mother state in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$=K,Rb,Cs), which develops around $T_* \approx 40$ K. The application of external fields stabilises a subset of the phase-melted order parameter manifold, referred to as a vestigial state, producing a symmetry-breaking response which depends on the applied probe. Our theory reproduces the observations of piezomagnetism, electric magnetic chiral anisotropy, absence of Kerr rotation, unusual elastoresistance response, and superconducting diode effect. Our proposed excitonic mother state accounts for probe-dependent symmetry breaking patterns without fine-tuning, and predicts additional signatures accessible through optical spectroscopy.

Title: Quantum oscillation studies of the nodal line semimetal Ni3In2S2-xSex
Authors: M. M. Sharma, Santosh Karki Chhetri, Gokul Acharya, David Graf, Dinesh Upreti, Sagar Dahal, Md Rafique Un Nabi, Sumaya Rahman, Josh Sakon, Hugh O. H. Churchill, Jin Hu
Abstract: Ternary shandite compounds with the general formula T3M2X2 (T = Ni, Co, Rh or Pd; M = Sn, In or Pb and X = S or Se) have emerged as a large pool of topological semimetals. This family of compounds hosts different topological phases for various combinations of T, M and X. This paper reports the observation of quantum oscillations under the high magnetic fields in Ni3In2S2-xSex single crystals. Angular dependence of oscillation frequency suggests an evolution of the Fermi surface from three-dimensional to two-dimensional on Se substitution for S in Ni3In2S2. The effective mass obtained for each composition by fitting the oscillation amplitude with the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula, shows no significant change, suggesting that the topological phase might be relatively robust against enhanced SOC upon Se doping in Ni3In2S2.

Title: Configurational Information Measures, Phase Transitions, and an Upper Bound on Complexity
Authors: Damian R Sowinski, Sean Kelty, Gourab Ghoshal
Abstract: Configurational entropy (CE) and configurational complexity (CC) are recently popularized information theoretic measures used to study the stability of solitons. This paper examines their behavior for 2D and 3D lattice Ising Models, where the quasi-stability of fluctuating domains is controlled by proximity to the critical temperature. Scaling analysis lends support to an unproven conjecture that these configurational information measures (CIMs) can detect (in)stability in field theories. The primary results herein are the derivation of a model dependent CC-CE relationship, as well as a model independent upper bound on CC. CIM phenomenology in the Ising universality class reveals multiple avenues for future research.

Title: Transmissions and group delay time in graphene with proximity exchange field and double barriers
Authors: Ahmed Jellal, Rachid El Aitouni, Pablo Díaz, David Laroze
Abstract: We study the transmission and group delay time for fermions in graphene under a proximity exchange field scattered by double barriers. Solving the Dirac equation over five regions, we calculate transmission and reflection coefficients using the transfer matrix method, and analyze group delay time using a Gaussian wave packet and the stationary phase method. Our results reveal spin-dependent features in transmission and group delay time, with notable shifts between spin orientations, especially for configurations with up to three layers of boron nitride (BN). We observe enhanced Klein tunneling peaks and full transmission conditions for certain combinations of system parameters. The double-barrier configuration also significantly improves the group delay time compared to the single-barrier case. In fact, we show that the group delay time oscillates as the barrier width increases without showing signs of saturation, indicating the absence of the Hartman effect. This is in contrast to the single-barrier case, where the group delay time is found to saturate as the barrier width increases. In addition, we identify critical angles and maximum energies for evanescent modes.

Title: Self-sustained frictional cooling in active matter
Authors: Alexander P. Antonov, Marco Musacchio, Hartmut Löwen, Lorenzo Caprini
Abstract: Cooling processes in nature are typically generated by external contact with a cold reservoir or bath. According to the laws of thermodynamics, the final temperature of a system is determined by the temperature of the environment. Here, we report a spontaneous internal cooling phenomenon for active particles, occurring without external contact. This effect, termed ``self-sustained frictional cooling'', arises from the interplay between activity and dry (Coulomb) friction, and in addition is self-sustained from particles densely caged by their neighbors. If an active particle moves in its cage, dry friction will stop any further motion after a collision with a neighbor particle thus cooling the particle down to an extremely low temperature. We demonstrate and verify this self-sustained cooling through experiments and simulations on active granular robots and identify dense frictional arrested clusters coexisting with hot, dilute regions. Our findings offer potential applications in two-dimensional swarm robotics, where activity and dry friction can serve as externally tunable mechanisms to regulate the swarm's dynamical and structural properties.

Title: Laser-assisted tunneling and Hartman effect in graphene under scalar potential and exchange fields
Authors: Rachid El Aitouni, Ahmed Jellal, Pablo Díaz, David Laroze
Abstract: We study the tunneling effect of Dirac fermions in a graphene sheet by introducing a potential barrier in a region of width $D$ exposed to laser field. This sheet is placed on a boron nitride/ferromagnetic substrate such as cobalt or nickel. By using the Floquet theory, we determine the solutions of the energy spectrum. We calculate the transmission and reflection coefficients by applying the boundary conditions along with the transfer matrix method. These coefficients help determine their probabilities by current densities and group delay times by their phases. We numerically show that the laser field plays a crucial role in this structure, as it completely suppresses Klein tunneling compared to the case without laser. Furthermore, in contrast to the Hartman effect, the group delay time becomes dependent on the barrier width with the appearance of additional peaks. This suggests that fermion-field interactions cause additional delays within the barrier and also help to reduce spin coupling. Adding BN layers increases the interval of transmission suppression and completely eliminates coupling after the addition of three BN layers. Total reflection is observed for incident fermions with an angle less than $-1$ or greater than one.

Title: Collective neutral excitations as sensitive probe for the quality of 2D charge carrier systems in ultra-pure GaAs quantum wells
Authors: Ursula Wurstbauer, Michael J. Manfra, Ken W. West, Loren N. Pfeiffer
Abstract: Ultra-clean low-dimensional interacting charge carrier systems are the basis to explore correlated states and phases. We report the observation of very narrow collective intersubband excitations (ISBE) of 2D electron systems (2DESs) with ultra-high mobilities in high quality GaAs quantum well structures. These findings from resonant inelastic light scattering (RILS) experiments are used as tools for exploration of links between transport mobility and collective electron behavior in 2DES of high perfection. We find that the linewidths of collective ISBE modes can be very narrow with values smaller than 80{\mu}eV. Comparison of ISBE measurements from several high-mobility samples exhibits a variation in linewidth of more than a factor of two. There is, however, a surprising lack of direct correlation between ISBE linewidth with mobility in the range 15x10^6 cm^2/Vs<{\mu}<24x10^6 cm^2/Vs. ISBE by RILS are discussed as a sensitive probe to characterize the interacting electron systems for fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) studies.

Title: Twisting in h-BN bilayers and their angle-dependent properties
Authors: Diem Thi-Xuan Dang, Dai-Nam Le, Lilia M. Woods
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of twisted h-BN bilayers to understand the role of the twisting angle. Using first-principles methods with relaxation taken into account, we simulate h-BN bilayers with commensurate supercells with the smallest angle being $2.88^{\circ}$ until $60^{\circ}$. We find that the interlayer separation is not constant throughout each bilayer because of the various stacking patterns of AA, AA', AB, AB', and A'B throughout the layers, which also play a significant role in their unique charge redistribution. The calculations for the 110 generated structures show the existence of flat bands in several twisted h-BN bilayers, as well as the emergence of different trends in their properties as a function of the twist angle. These results are useful for establishing a systematic base line of registry-dependent relations for the development of more advanced computational methods to access incommensurate h-BN bilayers.

Title: State-dependent friction for a moving liquid contact line over rough solid surfaces
Authors: Caishan Yan, Penger Tong, Qin Xu
Abstract: Solid friction between two rough surfaces is often observed to increase logarithmically over time due to contact creeping. An intriguing question is whether a similar aging effect occurs in contact line (CL) friction over rough substrates. Here, we report a systematic experimental study of CL friction using a hanging-fiber atomic force microscope (AFM) to measure the frictional force as a liquid CL moves across a fiber surface with different coatings under a well-controlled time protocol. State- (or time-)dependent CL friction is observed for the fiber surface with different textures in both the advancing and receding directions. The experimental findings are explained by a phenomenological model that links mesoscale CL friction to the microscopic relaxation of metastable air bubbles or liquid droplets trapped in the interstices of a rough surface. This model offers a general aging mechanism relevant to a wide range of liquid-solid interfaces.

Title: Linking quantum mechanical features to structural phase-transformation in inorganic solids
Authors: Prashant Singh, Anis Biswas, Alexander Thayer, Yaroslav Mudryk
Abstract: We present a new descriptor, i.e., local lattice distortion, to predict structural phase transformation in inorganic compounds containing lanthanides and transition metals. The descriptor utilizes local lattice and angular distortions obtained from structural optimization of experimentally known crystalline phases within state-of-the-art density-functional theory method. The predictive power of the descriptor was tested on lanthanide based RE2In (RE=rare-earth) compounds known for a variety of phase transformations. We show that the inclusion of quantum-mechanical effects through local-charge, bonding, symmetry, and electronic-structure enhances the robustness of the descriptor in predicting structural phase transformation. To gain further insights, we analyzed phononic and electronic behavior of Y2In, and show that experimentally observed phase transformation can only be predicted when atomic strains are included. The descriptor was used to predict structural phase change in couple of new compounds, i.e., (Yb1-xErx)2In and Gd2(In1-xAlx), which was validated by X-ray powder diffraction measurements. Finally, we demonstrated the generality of the proposed descriptor by predicting phase transformation behavior in different classes of compounds indicating the usefulness of our approach in mapping desired phase changes in novel functional materials.

Title: Quantum Geometric Engineering of Dual Hall Effects in 2D Antiferromagnetic Bilayers via Interlayer Magnetic Coupling
Authors: Zhenning Sun, Tao Wang, Hao Jin, Xinru Li, Yadong Wei, Jian Wang
Abstract: The interplay between quantum geometry and magnetic order offers a novel strategy for designing next-generation nanodevices. Here, we demonstrate that interlayer magnetic coupling in two-dimensional (2D) CoPSe3 bilayers enables precise control over quantum geometric mechanisms, unlocking dual intrinsic Hall effects. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the altermagnetic (AM) phase exhibits a giant anisotropic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) ($\sigma_{xy}$ is approximately 46 S/cm) driven by Berry curvature localized at generic k-points, while the PT-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase hosts an intrinsic second-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NAHE) ($\chi_{xyy}$ is approximately 160 ${\mu}$S/V) originating from quantum metric accumulation at high-symmetry k-points. By tuning interlayer magnetic couplings, we achieve reversible switching between these phases, leveraging their distinct band structures and symmetry constraints. The Neel-vector-dependent AHE in the AM phase and the symmetry-protected NAHE in the AFM phase highlight quantum geometry as a versatile tool for manipulating transport properties. Our work establishes 2D antiferromagnets as a promising platform for multifunctional device architectures, bridging linear and nonlinear magnetoelectric responses through tailored quantum geometric engineering.

Title: Observation of giant nonlinear valley Hall effect
Authors: Pan He, Min Zhang, Jin Cao, Jingru Li, Hao Liu, Jinfeng Zhai, Ruibo Wang, Cong Xiao, Shengyuan A. Yang, Jian Shen
Abstract: The valley Hall effect (VHE) holds great promise for valleytronic applications by leveraging the valley degree of freedom. To date, research on VHE has focused on its linear response to an applied current, leaving nonlinear valley responses undetected and nonlinear valleytronic devices undeveloped. Here, we report the experimental observation of a nonlinear VHE in a graphene-hBN moire superlattice, evidenced by the generation of second-harmonic nonlocal voltages under AC currents. Remarkably, the nonlinear VHE has magnitude surpassing the linear VHE and is highly tunable via a gate voltage, which exhibits a pair of opposite peaks on the two sides of a Dirac gap. The nonlinear signal shows quadratic scaling with driving current and quartic scaling with local resistance, setting it apart from the linear counterpart. These experimental features are consistent with the theoretical picture of nonlocal transport mediated by nonlinear VHE and linear inverse VHE. We further reveal a nonlinear inverse VHE by observing the third- and fourth-harmonic nonlocal voltages. The nonlinear VHE provides a novel mechanism for valley manipulation and enables a novel valleytronic device, the valley rectifier, that converts AC charge current into DC valley current.

Title: Glassy Behavior and Anomalous Transport in Chimney Ladder Crystals Induced by Soft Optical Phonons
Authors: Srinivas V. Mandyam, Weicen Dong, Xiaoxian Yan, Binru Zhao, Junfa Lin, Tianlong Xia, Zhiying Zhao, Xi Chen, Jie Ma, Hui Xing, F. Malte Grosche, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: Nowotny chimney ladder (NCL) crystals present physical properties in between the contrasting paradigms of ideal crystal and amorphous solid, making them promising candidates for thermoelectric applications due to their inherently low thermal conductivity. Here, we report an extensive experimental characterization of the thermodynamic and thermoelectric transport properties of a large class of NCL materials, focusing on the intermetallic compound Ru$_2$Sn$_{3-\delta}$. We show that the heat capacity of these NCL compounds exhibits a boson-peak-like glassy anomaly between $8$ K and $14$ K. By combining experimental measurements with density functional theory (DFT), we attribute its microscopic origin to extremely soft optical phonons that universally appear as a consequence of the chimney ladder sublattice structure. Additionally, the measured thermal conductivity and the thermoelectric response present distinct anomalous glass-like features that strongly correlate with the dynamics of the abundant soft optical phonons revealed by DFT. Our work demonstrates that soft modes in ordered crystals can induce glassy behavior, outlining a pathway to design metallic materials with low thermal conductivity and unique thermoelectric properties without the need for disorder or strong electronic correlations.

Title: Noise-induced cycles in the Togashi-Kaneko model with species-dependent degradation
Authors: Jeremy R. Worsfold, Richard G. Morris
Abstract: The two-state Togashi-Kaneko model demonstrates how, at finite system sizes, autocatalysis can lead to noise-induced bistability between different molecular species. By allowing the export rates to be species-dependent, we find that the nascent stochastic switching between molecular species is coupled to periods of growth or decay in the system size, $N$, leading to a type of noise-induced cycle. Since there is no oscillatory behavior in the underlying deterministic dynamics, this behavior is distinct from other types of noisy cycle. By combining piecewise-deterministic-Markov and linear-noise approximations, we find analytic expressions for the stationary distributions of the different molecular species when stochastic switching is faster than molecular import or export. We envisage that other models in the voter class -- including spin systems, flocking and opinion dynamics -- will also exhibit noise-induced cycles, as well as be amenable to similar techniques.

Title: Vortex Motion Induced Losses in Tantalum Resonators

Cava, Andrew A. Houck, Nathalie P. de Leon
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) based superconducting circuits have been demonstrated to enable record qubit coherence times and quality factors, motivating a careful study of the microscopic origin of the remaining losses that limit their performance. We have recently shown that the losses in Ta-based resonators are dominated by two-level systems (TLSs) at low microwave powers and millikelvin temperatures. We also observe that some devices exhibit loss that is exponentially activated at a lower temperature inconsistent with the superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of the constituent film. Specifically, dc resistivity measurements show a Tc of over 4 K, while microwave measurements of resonators fabricated from these films show losses that increase exponentially with temperature with an activation energy as low as 0.3 K. Here, we present a comparative study of the structural and thermodynamic properties of Ta-based resonators and identify vortex motion-induced loss as the source of thermally activated microwave loss. Through careful magnetoresistance and x-ray diffraction measurements, we observe that the increased loss occurs for films that are in the clean limit, where the superconducting coherence length is shorter than the mean free path. Vortex motion-induced losses are suppressed for films in the dirty limit, which show evidence of structural defects that can pin vortices. We verify this hypothesis by explicitly pinning vortices via patterning and find that we can suppress the loss by microfabrication.

Title: Structural, vibrational, and transport properties of compound forming liquid Li-Bi alloys
Authors: S.G. Khambholja, A. Abhishek, B.Y. Thakore
Abstract: Due to the compound forming tendency, some of the liquid metal alloys show anomalous behavior in their physical and chemical properties. Near the compound forming concentration, their electrical resistivity is beyond the metallic values and hence they may be labelled as liquid semiconductors. Lithium-Bismuth is one such system. It shows some interesting features in terms of physical and chemical properties such as departure from nearly free electron theory, very high value of electrical resistivity near the compound forming composition. While dealing with the electrical resistivity of liquid alloys with very high values of electrical resistivity, the famously used approaches such as Faber-Ziman theory and Morgan theory have some limitations. Hence, some modifications in these theoretical formalisms are required in order to reproduce the experimental values of the electrical transport properties. We, in the present work have modeled liquid Li-Bi system using model potential formalism in conjunction with the established theoretical models along with suitable modifications to study structural, elastic and transport properties. In particular, we have treated the effective valence of pure Li and Bi as parameters and we have calculated the phase shifts using model potentials rather than muffin-tin potential. The results are compared with the results of molecular dynamics simulation and other theoretical models. It is observed that the t-matrix formulation in conjunction with the model potential formalism is able to reproduce the correct trends in the electrical resistivity isotherm. Whereas the results of Faber-Ziman and Morgan theory are highly underestimated, the non-metallic behavior near the critical composition can be explained clearly from the present results of electrical resistivity. Further, phonon frequencies and sound velocities are also estimated.

Title: Large Spin Hall Effect in High-Entropy Alloy/CoFeB Bilayers
Authors: Takahide Kubota, Kazuya Z. Suzuki, Yoshiyuki Hirayama, Shigeki Takahashi, Koki Takanashi
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) exhibit various physical properties, such as high microhardness for structured materials and high efficiency for catalysis. These features are recognized as a cocktail effect of five or more elements that stabilize a single-phase solid solution due to a high configurational entropy. HEAs may also exhibit short-range orders and microdistorshons, which cause the local symmetry breaking of systems. Systems with local symmetry breaking are of interest for spin-dependent transport, such as for spin Hall effects. In this study, sputtered-film samples of an HEA, Mn--Nb--Mo--Ta--W, and related alloys, were fabricated; these films were layered with ferromagnetic CoFeB. All samples exhibited x-ray diffraction peaks originating only from a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase, and transmission electron microscopy images indicated the absence of secondary phases and uniform elemental distributions. The spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) was investigated, and clear resistance changes were observed in all the samples. Quantitative analysis of SMR revealed that the spin Hall angle ($\theta_\mathrm{SH}$) was 0.12 $\pm$ 0.002 and 0.14 $\pm$ 0.037 for the HEA and Nb--Mo--Ta--W alloy (medium-entropy alloy (MEA)), respectively. The $\theta_\mathrm{SH}$s of the HEA and MEA were comparable to that of Pt which is a typical heavy element with relatively large $\theta_\mathrm{SH}$. The newly developed HEA and MEA films are attractive spin Hall materials with the bcc phase and are suitable for spintronic applications using magnetic tunnel junctions with CoFeB and an MgO barrier.

Title: Molecular-dynamics study of diffusional creep in uranium mononitride
Authors: Mohamed AbdulHameed, Benjamin Beeler, Conor O.T. Galvin, Michael W.D. Cooper, Nermeen Elamrawy, Antoine Claisse
Abstract: Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising advanced nuclear fuel due to its high thermal conductivity and high fissile density. Yet, many aspects of its mechanical behavior and microstructural features are currently unknown. In this paper, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study UN's diffusional creep. Nanometer-sized polycrystals are used to simulate diffusional creep and to calculate an effective GB width. It is found that Nabarro-Herring creep is not dominant in the temperature range of 1700$-$2000 K and that the dominant diffusional creep mechanism is Coble creep with an activation energy of 2.28 $\pm$ 0.09 eV. A method is proposed to calculate the diffusional GB width and its temperature dependence in polycrystals. The effective GB width of UN is calculated as 2.69 $\pm$ 0.08 nm. This value fits very well with the prefactor of the phenomenological Coble creep formula. It is demonstrated that the most comprehensive thermal creep model for UN can be represented as the combination of our Coble creep model and the dislocation creep model proposed by Hayes et al.

Title: Dynamics of stiff filaments in size-polydisperse hard sphere fluids
Authors: Thokchom Premkumar Meitei, Lenin S. Shagolsem
Abstract: The dynamics of a stiff filament (made by connecting beads) embedded in size-polydisperse hard sphere fluid is investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulations with focus on how the degree of size-polydispersity, characterized by polydispersity index ($\delta$), affects the dynamics in this model heterogeneous system. Polydispersity of the fluid as well as strong coupling of rotational and translational motion of the rods are two of the various hurdles in interpreting the experimental results in a complex fluid environment. Furthermore, influence of volume fraction, $\phi$, and absolute free volume, $V_{\rm free}$, which changes inherently with $\delta$ on the dynamics are not adequately discussed in the literature. Thus, we investigate the dynamical behaviour of the rods under two different conditions: (i) constant pressure (in which $\phi$ changes with $\delta$), and (ii) constant $\phi$. Under constant pressure it is observed that the rotational relaxation time and hence the diffusion constant, $D_R$, varies with rod length as $D_R \sim l^{-\alpha}$, where the value of exponent $\alpha$ increases from $3.0-3.2$ while varying $\delta$ from $0-40\%$. It is observed that the effect of increasing $\phi$ dominates over the effect of increasing $V_{\rm free}$. Also there is minimal effect of hydrodynamic interaction among the beads belonging to a rod during rotation, whereas the presence of partial hydrodynamic screening for the motion of the centre of mass is seen. On the other hand, for fixed $\phi$ systems, increasing $\delta$ results in increasing $V_{\rm free}$ and thus enhances tracer diffusion, an opposite trend compared to the system under constant pressure.

Title: Universal law for the dispersal of motile microorganisms in porous media
Authors: T. Pietrangeli, R. Foffi, R. Stocker, C. Ybert, C. Cottin-Bizonne, F. Detcheverry
Abstract: Dispersal is essential to the plethora of motile microorganisms living in porous environments, yet how it relates to movement patterns and pore space structure remains largely unknown. Here we investigate numerically the long-time dispersal of a run-and-tumble microorganism that remains trapped at solid surfaces and escapes from them by tumbling. We find that dispersal and mean run time are connected by a universal relation, that applies for a variety of porous microstructures and swimming strategies. We explain how this generic dependence originates in the invariance of the mean free path with respect to the movement pattern, and we discuss the optimal strategy that maximizes dispersal. Finally, we extend our approach to microorganisms moving along the surface. Our results provide a general framework to quantify dispersal that works across the vast diversity of movement patterns and porous media.

Title: Pressure-driven superconductivity in the topological insulator GeBi4Te7
Authors: Yalei Huang, Na Zuo, Zheyi Zhang, Chunqiang Xu, Xiangzhuo Xing, Wen-He Jiao, Bin Li, Wei Zhou, Xiaobing Liu, Dong Qian, Xiaofeng Xu
Abstract: The van der Waals, pseudo-binary chalcogenides (ACh)m(Pn2Ch3)n (A = Ge, Mn, Pb, etc.; Pn = Sb or Bi; Ch = Te, Se) have recently been reported to host a vast landscape of topological phases of matter, including the quantum anomalous Hall state and topological axion state with quantized magnetoelectric effect. A subgroup in this series, like MnSb4Te7 and GeSb4Te7, can be driven to a superconducting state by applying a physical pressure, making them viable candidates to realize so-called topological superconductivity. However, the role of magnetic fluctuations in this pressure-induced superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we report the pressure-induced multiple superconducting phases in the nonmagnetic GeBi4Te7, accompanied by corresponding structural transitions evidenced from the high-pressure Raman scattering. In comparison with other members in this family, we find the superconducting transition temperature of the nonmagnetic subgroup is significantly higher than their magnetic homologues, possibly hinting at the detrimental role played by the magnetic fluctuations in the superconductivity formation, at least in this pseudo-binary chalcogenide family.

Title: Interfacial spin-orbit-coupling-induced strong spin-to-charge conversion at an all-oxide ferromagnetic /quasi-two-dimensional electron gas interface
Authors: Mi-Jin Jin, Guang Yang, Doo-Seung Um, Jacob Linder, Jason W.A. Robinson
Abstract: Functional oxides and hybrid structures with interfacial spin orbit coupling and the Rashba-Edelsterin effect (REE) are promising materials systems for thermal tolerance spintronic device applications. Here, we demonstrate efficient spin-to-charge conversion through enhanced interfacial spin orbit coupling at the all-oxide interface of La1-xCaxMnO3 with quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) SrTiO3 (LCMO/STO). The quasi-2D interface is generated via oxygen vacancies at the STO surface. We obtain a spin-to-charge conversion efficiency of ~ 2.32 +- 1.3 nm, most likely originating from the inverse REE, which is relatively large versus all-metallic spin-to-charge conversion materials systems. The results highlight that the LCMO/STO 2D electron gas is a potential platform for spin-based memory and transistor applications.

Title: Low-temperature structural study of smectic C$_A$* glass by X-ray diffraction
Authors: Aleksandra Deptuch, Marcin Kozieł, Marcin Piwowarczyk, Magdalena Urbańska, Ewa Juszyńska-Gałązka
Abstract: The liquid crystalline compound, forming the glass of the smectic C$_A$* phase, is investigated by the X-ray diffraction in the 18-298 K range. The characteristic distances within the smectic C$_A$* phase are determined. The electron density profile along the smectic layer normal is inferred and compared with the results of the density functional theory calculations. Observations of the selective reflection of the visible light investigate the helical ordering within the smectic C$_A$* glass. The results indicate slow evolution of the smectic layer spacing, intermolecular distances, and electron density distribution below the glass transition temperature. Meanwhile, the relative range of the short-range order within the smectic layers and the helix pitch are relatively constant in the glassy state.

Title: Unconventional topological edge states in one-dimensional gapless systems stemming from nonisolated hypersurface singularities
Authors: Hongwei Jia, Jing Hu, Ruo-Yang Zhang, Yixin Xiao, Dongyang Wang, Mudi Wang, Shaojie Ma, Xiaoping Ouyang, Yifei Zhu, C. T. Chan
Abstract: Topologically protected edge states have been extensively studied in systems characterized by the topological invariants in band gaps (also called line gaps). In this study, we unveil a whole new form of edge states that transcends the established paradigms of band-gap topology. In contrast to the traditional stable edge states in topological insulators with specific band gaps, the one-dimensional systems we investigate are inherently gapless with the Brillouin zones being mapped to the loops encircling hypersurface singularities in a higher-dimensional space with parity-time symmetry. These hypersurface singularities are nonisolated degeneracies embedded entirely on exceptional surfaces, rendering the energy gaps in our systems inevitably closed at the intersections of the Brillouin zone loop and the exceptional surfaces. Unexpectedly, such gapless systems still afford topologically protected edge states at system boundaries, challenging the conventional understanding based on band gaps. To elucidate the existence of these edge states in the absence of a band-gap-based invariant, we propose a theoretical framework based on eigen-frame rotation and deformation that incorporates non-Bloch band theory. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate this new form of topological edge states with nonreciprocal circuits for the first time. Our work constitutes a major advance that extends topological edge states from gapped phases to gapless phases, offering new insights into topological phenomena.

Title: Polydispersity-driven dynamical differences between two- and three-dimensional supercooled liquids
Authors: Ilian Pihlajamaa, Lotte van Gessel, Corentin Laudicina, Luc van Burik, Liesbeth Janssen
Abstract: Previous studies have suggested a conundrum in the relaxation dynamics of polydisperse supercooled liquids. It has been shown that in two dimensions, the relative relaxation times of particles of different sizes become more similar as the material is cooled, whereas the opposite happens in three dimensions: they decouple. Here we resolve this conundrum. First, we show that the coupling observed in two dimensions is an artifact of cage correction introduced to account for Mermin-Wagner fluctuations. Instead, the relative relaxation time of small and large particles in two dimensions remains constant or slightly decouples with temperature, as opposed to the substantial decoupling observed in three dimensions. Investigating these dimensional differences further, we find through mobile cluster analysis that small particles initiate relaxation in both dimensions. As the clusters grow larger, they remain dominated by small particles in three dimensions whereas in two cluster growth becomes particle-size agnostic. We explain these findings with a minimal model by studying the distributions of single-particle barrier heights in the system, showing there is a clear difference in the environments of small and large particles, depending on the dimensionality. These findings highlight the critical role of dimensionality in glass formation, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying the glass transition in polydisperse supercooled liquids.

Title: Momentum-Resolved Signatures of Carrier Screening Effects on Electron-Phonon Coupling in MoS$_2$
Authors: Yiming Pan, Patrick-Nigel Hildebrandt, Daniela Zahn, Marios Zacharias, Yoav William Windsor, Ralph Ernstorfer, Fabio Caruso, Hélène Seiler
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling is central to many condensed matter phenomena. Harnessing these effects for novel material functionality in materials always involves non-equilibrium electronic states, which in turn alter quasi-free-carrier density and screening. Thus, gaining a fundamental understanding of the interplay of carrier screening and electron-phonon coupling is essential for advancing ultrafast science. Prior works have mainly focused on the impact of carrier screening on electronic structure properties. Here we investigate the non-equilibrium lattice dynamics of MoS2 after a photoinduced Mott transition. The experimental data are closely reproduced by ab-initio ultrafast dynamics simulations. We find that the non-thermal diffuse scattering signals in the vicinity of the Bragg peaks, originating from long-wavelength phonon emission, can only be reproduced upon explicitly accounting for the screening of electron-phonon interaction introduced by the Mott transition. These results indicate the screening influences electron-phonon coupling, leading to a suppression of intravalley phonon-assisted carrier relaxation. Overall, the combined experimental and computational approach introduced here offers new prospects for exploring the influence of screening of the electron-phonon interactions and relaxation pathways in driven solids.

Title: Gate-tunable band-edge in few-layer MoS$_2$
Authors: Michele Masseroni, Isaac Soltero, James G. Hugh, Igor Rozhansky, Xue Li, Alexander Schmidhuber, Markus Niese, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Vladimir Fal'ko, Thomas Ihn, Klaus Ensslin
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant research interest due to the variation in band-edge locations within the hexagonal Brillouin zone between single-layer and bulk configurations. In monolayers, the conduction band minima are centered at the $K$-points, whereas in multilayers, they shift to the $Q$-points, midway between the $\Gamma$ and $K$ points. In this study, we conduct magnetotransport experiments to measure the occupation in the $Q$ and $K$ valleys in fourlayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$). We demonstrate electrostatic tunability of the conduction band edge by combining our experimental results with a hybrid $k\cdot p$ tight-binding model that accounts for interlayer screening effects in a self-consistent manner. Furthermore, we extend our model to bilayer and trilayer MoS$_2$, reconciling prior experimental results and quantifying the tunable range of band edges in atomically thin TMDs.

Title: Interaction induced reentrance of Bose glass and quench dynamics of Bose gases in twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices
Authors: Shi-Hao Ding, Li-Jun Lang, Qizhong Zhu, Liang He
Abstract: We investigate the ground state and dynamical properties of ultracold gases in optical lattices with an aperiodic external potential-a scenario motivated by recent experiments on twisted bilayer optical lattices and optical quasicrystals. Our study reveals that the interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and a quasiperiodic potential gives rise to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose glass (BG) phase, characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions, into a SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively characterized by monitoring the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: as the on-site interaction increases, the system initially transitions from BG to SF, but further increase restores the BG phase. This reentrance is ascribed to an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a once percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsive interactions dominate. Furthermore, our analysis of quench dynamics demonstrates distinct transient behaviors. Intra-phase quenches yield minimal variations in both the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the particle density distribution. In contrast, inter-phase quenches produce pronounced effects; for instance, a quench from the SF to BG phase is marked by an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, while a BG-to-SF quench features oscillatory changes in the percolation probability and a gradual decrease in the IPR, eventually stabilizing the SF phase. Our findings unveil the complex interplay between disorder and interaction in ultracold Bose gases, offering valuable insights that are highly pertinent to current experimental efforts employing twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical lattice platforms.

Title: Magneto-rotation coupling for ferromagnetic nanoelement embedded in elastic substrate
Authors: Grzegorz Centała, Jarosław W. Kłos
Abstract: This study investigates magneto-rotational coupling as a distinct contribution to magnetoelastic interactions, which can be influenced by magnetic anisotropy. We determine magneto-rotational coupling coefficients that incorporate the shape anisotropy of a magnetic nanoelement (strip) and demonstrate that this type of coupling can be modified through geometric adjustments. Furthermore, we analyze the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field in a ferromagnetic strip embedded in a nonmagnetic substrate. Both Rayleigh and Love waves are considered sources of the magnetoelastic field, and we examine how the strength of the magneto-rotational coupling varies with the direction of the in-plane applied magnetic field. We found that in the absence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field decreases with a reduction in the thickness-to-width ratio of the strip for a Rayleigh wave, whereas for a Love wave, it changes non-monotonically. These findings enhance the understanding of magneto-rotational coupling in magnonic nanostructures.

Authors: Abdelmahjid Elmahjoubi, Mala Rao, Alexandre Ivanov, Andrei Postnikov, Alain Polian, Toni Alhaddad, Samrath Chaplot, Andrea Piovano, Sebastien Diliberto, Stephanie Michel, Alain Maillard, Karol Strzalkowski, O. Pages
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering measurements on the hexagonal Zn67Mg33S semiconductor alloy reveal a bimodal pattern of the optical modes across the Brillouin zone, confirmed by first-principles simulations. Such modes are sensitive to the local fluctuations in the composition inherent to random Zn/Mg alloying, distinguishing homo from hetero environments of a given bond (1-bond/2-mode), as is formalized for cubic alloys by the percolation model. The latter model thus emerges as a generic framework for systematizing the optical modes of semiconductor alloys in various crystal structures.

Title: On the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking in liquid hydrogen peroxide
Authors: Roberto Menta, Pablo G. Debenedetti, Roberto Car, Pablo M. Piaggi
Abstract: Molecular chirality is a key concept in chemistry with implications for the origin of life and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Simulations of a chiral molecular model with an energetic bias towards homochiral interactions show spontaneous symmetry breaking wherein the liquid separates into two phases, each enriched in one of the two enantiomers. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations of a geometrically similar model with a semi-empirical force field and no explicit bias towards homochiral interactions, in order to test the possible existence of this phenomenon in hydrogen peroxide, the smallest chiral molecule. For this purpose, we study the fluid phase of this substance between 100 K and 1500 K, and from $10^{-4}$ GPa to 1 GPa. We find a glass transition and we suggest that hydrogen bonds, captured by our force field, play a central role in such behavior. We also test the possibility of observing chiral symmetry breaking by performing both constant temperature and cooling simulations at multiple pressures, and we do not observe the phenomenon. An analysis of the structure of the liquid shows negligible differences between homochiral and heterochiral interactions, supporting the difficulty in observing chiral fluid-phase separation. If hydrogen peroxide manifests spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, it likely takes place significantly below room temperature and is hidden by other phenomena, such as the glass transition or crystallization. More broadly, our results, and recent experimental observations, suggest that greater molecular complexity is needed for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the liquid phase to occur.

Title: Engineering excitonic metal-insulator transitions in ultra-thin doped copper sulfides
Authors: Haiyang Chen, Yufeng Liu, Yashi Jiang, Changcang Qiao, Tao Zhang, Jianyang Ding, Zhengtai Liu, Zhenhua Chen, Yaobo Huang, Jinfeng Jia, Shiyong Wang, Peng Chen
Abstract: Exciton condensation in the absence of optical excitation is proposed in 1960s to occur in a semiconductor at low temperatures when the binding energy of excitons overcomes the band gap or in a semimetal with weakly screened coulomb interaction, giving rise to an excitonic insulating state. However, it has been challenging to establish experimental realization in a natural material as the interacting electron-hole pockets rely on the band structures which are difficult to be delicately controlled. Here, we demonstrate an excitonic insulating phase formed in ultra-thin copper sulfide films by effectively tuning the band structure via changing the composition of Cu and S in the system. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we observed a continuous band renormalization and opening of a full gap at low temperatures over a wide range of doping. The electronic origin of the metal-insulator transition is supported by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) measurements, which show no indication of superlattice modulation and lattice symmetry breaking. The evidence of excitonic insulator is further provided by carrier density dependent transitions, a combined effect of electron screening and Coulomb interaction strength. Our findings demonstrate the tunability of the band structure of copper sulfides, allowing for new opportunities to study exotic quantum phases.

Title: Anti Kibble-Zurek behavior in the quantum XY spin-1/2 chain driven by correlated noisy magnetic field and anisotropy
Authors: S. Sadeghizade, R. Jafari, A. Langari
Abstract: In the non-adiabatic dynamics across a quantum phase transition, the Kibble-Zurek paradigm describes that the average number of topological defects is suppressed as a universal power law with the quench time scale. A conflicting observation, which termed anti-Kibble-Zurek dynamics has been reported in several studies, specifically in the driven systems with an uncorrelated stochastic (white) noise. Here, we study the defect generation in the driven transverse field/anisotropy quantum $XY$ model in the presence of a correlated (colored) Gaussian noise. We propose a generic conjecture that properly capture the noise-induced excitation features, which shows good agreement with the numerical simulations. We show that, the dynamical features of defect density are modified by varying the noise correlation time. Our numerical simulations confirm that, for fast noises, the dynamics of the defect density is the same as that of the uncorrelated (white) noise, as is expected. However, the larger ratio of noise correlation time to the annealing time results in larger defects density formation and reforms the universal dynamical features. Our finding reveals that, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the annealing time for fast noises, while in the presence of the slow noises, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the square of the annealing time. The numerical simulations confirm that, the optimal annealing time, at which the defects density is minimum, scales linearly in logarithmic scale with the total noise power having different exponents for the fast and slow noises.

Title: Back-action effects in charge detection
Authors: Sarath Sankar, Matan Lotem, Joshua Folk, Eran Sela, Yigal Meir
Abstract: Charge detection offers a powerful probe of mesoscopic structures based on quantum dots, but it also invariably results in measurement back-action (MBA). If strong, MBA can be detrimental to the physical properties being probed. In this work, we focus on the effects of MBA on an Anderson impurity model in which the impurity is coupled electrostatically to a detector. Introducing a novel non-perturbative method, we explore the interplay of coherent dynamics, strong correlations and non-equilibrium conditions. The effects of MBA can be seen most clearly in the temperature derivative of occupation. In the non-equilibrium case, we identify this as arising due to an energy flow from the detector to the impurity.

Title: Spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking induced by electronic instability in the normal state of La_{1-x} Sr_{x} NiO_{2}
Authors: Qiang Zhao, Rui Liu, Wen-Long Yang, Xue-Yan Wang, Jia-Kun Luo, Jing-Yuan Ma, Fang-Hui Zhu, Cheng-Xue Chen, Mei-Ling Yan, Rui-Fen Dou, Chang-Min Xiong, Chi Xu, Xing-Ye Lu, Hai-Wen Liu, Ji-Kun Chen, Zhi-Ping Yin, Jia-Cai Nie
Abstract: The spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking (RSB), a hallmark phenomenon in cuprates and iron-based high-temperature superconductors, originates from intricate interactions between superconducting order and competing quantum states. Understanding this mechanism is pivotal for unraveling the microscopic origin of unconventional superconductivity. Although infinite-layer nickelates (ILNs) share similar crystalline structure and the same nominal 3d-electron configurations with cuprates, they have significant differences in Fermi surface topology, electronic band characteristics, and charge order. These distinctions make ILNs an ideal platform for studying RSB in unconventional superconductors. Through angular-resolved resistivity measurements within a large temperature and doping range, we identify pronounced RSB signatures near doping concentrations x=0.05 and 0.25. Based on the strongly correlated electronic structures from combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory calculations, we find that the calculated electronic susceptibility has a peak structure at the corresponding doping concentration, indicating pronounced electronic instabilities which drive RSB. Our findings reveal the important role of electronic correlation and Fermi surface nesting in the emergence of RSB. Our work not only deepens the understanding of electronic behavior in ILNs, but also provides new ideas and methods for exploring RSB in other unconventional superconductors.

Title: Exploring Dual-Iron Atomic Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Reduction: A Comprehensive Study on Structural and Electronic Optimization
Authors: Zhe Zhang, Wenxin Ma, Jiajie Qiao, Xiaoliang Wu, Shaowen Yu, Weiye Hou, Xiang Huang, Rubin Huo, Hongbo Wu, Yusong Tu
Abstract: The nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), as an efficient and green pathway for ammonia synthesis, plays a crucial role in achieving on-demand ammonia production. This study proposes a novel design concept based on dual-iron atomic sites and nitrogen-boron co-doped graphene catalysts, exploring their high efficiency in NRR. By modulating the N and B co-doped ratios, we found that Fe2N3B@G catalyst exhibited significant activity in the adsorption and hydrogenation of N2 molecules, especially with the lowest free energy (0.32 eV) on NRR distal pathway, showing its excellent nitrogen activation capability and NRR performance. The computed electron localization function, crystal orbital Hamiltonian population, electrostatic potential map revealed that the improved NRR kinetics of Fe2N3B@G catalyst derived by N3B co-doping induced optimization of Fe-Fe electronic environment, regulation of Fe-N bond strength, and the continuous electronic support during the N2 breakage and hydrogenation. In particular, machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations were employed to verify the high activity of Fe2N3B@G catalyst in NRR, which reveal that Fe2N3B@G effectively regulates the electron density of Fe-N bond, ensuring the smooth generation and desorption of NH3 molecules and avoiding the competition with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, the determined higher HER overpotential of Fe2N3B@G catalyst can effectively inhibit the HER and enhance the selectivity toward NRR. In addition, Fe2N3B@G catalyst also showed good thermal stability by MD simulations up to 500 K, offering its feasibility in practical applications. This study demonstrates the superior performance of Fe2N3B@G in nitrogen reduction catalysis, and provides theoretical guidance for atomic catalyst design by the co-doping strategy and in-deep electronic environment modulation.

Title: Unexpected Density Functional Dependence of the Antipolar $Pbcn$ Phase in HfO$_2$
Authors: Di Fan, Tianyuan Zhu, Shi Liu
Abstract: The antipolar $Pbcn$ phase of HfO$_2$ has been suggested to play an important role in the phase transition and polarization switching mechanisms in ferroelectric hafnia. In this study, we perform a comprehensive benchmark of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations to investigate the thermodynamic stability and phase transition behavior of hafnia, with a particular focus on the relationship between the $Pbcn$ and ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ phases. Our results reveal significant discrepancies in the predicted stability of the $Pbcn$ phase relative to the $Pca2_1$ phase across different exchange-correlation functionals. Notably, the PBE and hybrid HSE06 functionals exhibit consistent trends, which diverge from the predictions of the PBEsol and SCAN functionals. For a given density functional, temperature-driven phase transitions predicted by DFT-based quasi-harmonic free energy calculations aligns with finite-temperature MD simulations using a deep potential trained on the same density functional. Specifically, the PBE functional predicts a transition from $Pca2_1$ to $Pbcn$ with increasing temperature, while PBEsol predicts a transition from $Pca2_1$ to $P4_2/nmc$. A particularly striking and reassuring finding is that under fixed mechanical boundary conditions defined by the ground-state structure of $Pca2_1$, all functionals predict consistent relative phase stabilities and comparable switching barriers as well as domain wall energies. These findings underscore the unique characteristics of the $Pbcn$ phase in influencing phase transitions and switching mechanisms in ferroelectric hafnia.

Title: Geometric Asymmetry-Enhanced Nonreciprocal Supercurrent Transport Revealed by Second-Harmonic Response
Authors: Yu He, Zifeng Wang, Jiaxu Li, Fenglin Zhong, Haozhe Yang, Kewen Shi, Le Wang, Guang Yang, Weisheng Zhao
Abstract: Nonreciprocal transport in superconducting systems serves as a powerful probe of symmetry-breaking mechanisms, with the superconducting diode effect emerging as a key manifestation enabling cryogenic rectification. While theoretical models have extensively explored superconducting nonreciprocity, experimental verification remains challenging, as conventional transport measurements struggle to disentangle intrinsic and extrinsic contributions. Nonlinear transport analysis, particularly second-harmonic response, offers an alternative approach by providing a sensitive probe for detecting spatial inversion symmetry breaking in the presence of time-reversal symmetry violation. Here, we systematically investigate the influence of geometric symmetry on nonreciprocal transport by comparing two triangular-extended Hall bar configurations with a symmetric Hall bar control. Second-harmonic nonlinear transport measurements reveal that the triangular extension significantly enhances nonreciprocal response, exhibiting a clear dependence on the base angle of the extension. These findings establish a direct connection between mesoscopic geometry and macroscopic nonreciprocity, demonstrating how spatial symmetry and vortex dynamics govern nonlinear transport. This insight offers a guiding principle for designing superconducting rectification architectures.

Title: Kondo-like behavior in a mixed valent oxypnictide $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$

Abstract: We have synthesized and characterized the physical properties of a layered, mixed valent oxypnictide $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ via magnetization, electrical resistivity, and specific heat measurements. Although $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ does not exhibit superconductivity down to T = 0.5 K, it demonstrates an intriguing resistivity minimum observed at $\mathrm{T_{min}}$ = 13.7 K. Disappearance of the resistivity minimum under an applied magnetic field of $\mathrm{\mu_{0}H}$ = 9 T together with the negative magnetoresistance at low and positive at high temperatures are observed, which are typical for both Kondo-like spin-dependent scattering and 3D weak localization. We argue that the Kondo scattering is a more plausible explanation due to the low-temperature deviation from a Curie-Weiss law observed in the magnetic susceptibility, consistent with the presence of magnetic interactions between paramagnetic $\mathrm{Cu^{2+}}$ ions and Kondo screening of these $\mathrm{Cu^{2+}}$ moments. We supplemented the experimental characterization with a detailed description of chemical bonding, employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis for $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ and isostructural $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$, which is a superconductor with $\mathrm{T_c = 2.2}$ K. Based on the calculations performed, we present the difference between $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ in the character of electronic states at the Fermi level. This discrepancy impacts structural stability and may cause a lack of superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ down to T = 0.5 K.

Title: Photoluminescence Detection of Polytype Polarization in r-MoS2 Enabled by Asymmetric Dielectric Environments
Authors: Idan Kizel, Omri Meron, Dror Hershkovitz, Maayan Vizner Stern, Alon Ron, Moshe Ben Shalom, Haim Suchowski
Abstract: The rhombohedral (r) polytypes of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) constitute a novel class of two-dimensional ferroelectric materials, where lateral shifts between parallel layers induce reversible out-of-plane polarization. This emerging field, known as SlideTronics, holds significant potential for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic applications. While extensive studies have investigated the effects of electrical and chemical doping on excitonic signatures in 2H-TMDs, as well as the influence of dielectric environments on their optical properties, the impact of intrinsic polarization in asymmetric environments remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a striking polarization-dependent photoluminescence (PL) contrast of up to 400\% between ferroelectric domains in bilayer and trilayer rhombohedral molybdenum disulfide (r-MoS2). This pronounced contrast arises from an asymmetric dielectric environment, which induces polarization-dependent shifts in the Fermi energy, leading to a modulation of the exciton-trion population balance. A detailed temperature-dependent line shape analysis of the PL, conducted from 4K to room temperature, reveals domain-specific trends that further reinforce the connection between polarization states and excitonic properties. The persistence of these distinct optical signatures at room temperature establishes PL as a robust and non-invasive probe for ferroelectric domain characterization, particularly in fully encapsulated device architectures where conventional techniques, such as Kelvin probe force microscopy, become impractical.

Title: Interaction-correlated random matrices
Authors: Abbas Ali Saberi, Sina Saber, Roderich Moessner
Abstract: We introduce a family of random matrices where correlations between matrix elements are induced via interaction-derived Boltzmann factors. Varying these yields access to different ensembles. We find a universal scaling behavior of the finite-size statistics characterized by a heavy-tailed eigenvalue distribution whose extremes are governed by the Fréchet extreme value distribution for the case corresponding to a ferromagnetic Ising transition. The introduction of a finite density of nonlocal interactions restores standard random-matrix behavior. Suitably rescaled average extremes, playing a physical role as an order parameter, can thus discriminate aspects of the interaction structure; they also yield further nonuniversal information. In particular, the link between maximum eigenvalues and order parameters offers a potential route to resolving long-standing problems in statistical physics, such as deriving the exact magnetization scaling function in the two-dimensional Ising model at criticality.

Title: Revealing the electron-spin fluctuation coupling by photoemission in CaKFe4As4
Authors: Peng Li, Yuzhe Wang, Yabin Liu, Jianghao Yao, Zhisheng Zhao, Zhengtai Liu, Dawei Shen, Huiqian Luo, Guanghan Cao, Juan Jiang, Donglai Feng
Abstract: Electron-boson coupling in unconventional superconductors is one of the key parameters in understanding the superconducting pairing symmetry. Here, we report definitive photoemission evidence of electron-spin exciton coupling in the iron-based superconductor CaKFe4As4, obtained via high-resolution ARPES. Our study identifies a distinct kink structure on the {\alpha} band, observable only in the superconducting phase and closely linked with the superconductivity, indicative of strong electron-boson interactions. Notably, this kink structure corresponds to two distinct bosonic modes at 11 meV and 13 meV, aligning with spin resonance modes previously observed in inelastic neutron scattering experiments. This alignment underscores the significant role of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the pairing mechanism of this superconductor. Furthermore, the unique momentum-dependent and orbital-selective properties of the coupling revealed by ARPES provide profound insights into the pairing symmetry, suggesting predominantly s_+- wave pairing facilitated by spin fluctuations. Our findings not only highlight the pivotal role of spin resonance in the superconductivity of CaKFe4As4 but also enhance understanding of the electron-spin exciton interactions in unconventional superconductors.

Title: Dual spectroscopy of quantum simulated Fermi-Hubbard systems
Authors: K. Knakkergaard Nielsen, M. Zwierlein, G. M. Bruun
Abstract: Quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides remarkable insights into the real space properties of many-body systems, but does not directly reveal the nature of their fundamental excitation spectrum. Here, we demonstrate that radio-frequency spectroscopy can reveal the quasi-particle nature of doped quantum many-body systems, crucial for our understanding of, e.g., high-temperature superconductors. In particular, we showcase how the existence and energy of magnetic polaron quasi-particles in doped Fermi-Hubbard systems may be probed, revealed by hallmark peaks in the spectroscopic spectrum. In combination with fundamental dualities of the Fermi-Hubbard model, we describe how these findings may be tested using several experimental platforms.

Title: Atomistically informed phase field study of austenite grain growth
Authors: Ayush Suhane, Daniel Scheiber, Vsevolod I. Razumovskiy, Matthias Militzer
Abstract: Atomistically-informed phase field simulations have been performed to investigate the effect of five common alloying elements (Nb, Ti, Mo, V, Mn) on austenite grain growth. The anisotropic simulations based on the segregation energy profiles of the solutes to four different grain boundary (GB) types from density functional theory calculations suggest a secondary role of solute drag anisotropy on grain growth. Hence, the solute trends are determined to be the same for all investigated GBs, and as a result, the $\Sigma 5(310)[001]$ GB can be considered as a representative GB for solute trend predictions. The decrease in grain growth rates due to solute additions is quantitatively described using a solute trend parameter. The following hierarchy of the solute's effectiveness to retard austenite grain growth has been determined based on the results of the presented model calculations in agreement with the experimental observations: Nb$>$Ti$>$Mo$>$V$\approx$Mn. The limitations and the strengths of the proposed approach are discussed in detail, and a potential application of this approach to steel design is proposed.

Title: Modeling solute-grain boundary interactions in a bcc Ti-Mo alloy using density functional theory
Authors: Hariharan Umashankar, Daniel Scheiber, Vsevolod I. Razumovskiy, Matthias Militzer
Abstract: Solute segregation in alloys is a key phenomenon which affects various material characteristics such as embrittlement, grain growth and precipitation kinetics. In this work, the segregation energies of Y, Zr, and Nb to a \textgreek{S}5 grain boundary in a bcc Ti-25 at \% Mo alloy were determined using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A systematic approach was laid out by computing the solution energy distributions in the bulk alloy using Warren-Cowley short-range order parameters to find a representative bulk-solute reference energy. Additionally, different scenarios were considered when a solute atom replaces different sites in terms of their local Ti-Mo chemistry at the GB plane to calculate the distribution of segregation energies. The solute segregation to a Mo site at the GB plane is preferred rather than to a Ti site. Further analysis shows that these segregation energy trends can be rationalized based on a primarily elastic interaction. Thus the segregation energies scale with the solute size such that Y has the largest segregation energies followed by Zr and Nb.

Abstract: In the context of quantum thermodynamics, quantum batteries have emerged as promising devices for energy storage and manipulation. Over the past decade, substantial progress has been made in understanding the fundamental properties of quantum batteries, with several experimental implementations showing great promise. This Perspective provides an overview of the solid-state materials platforms that could lead to fully operational quantum batteries. After briefly introducing the basic features of quantum batteries, we discuss organic microcavities, where superextensive charging has already been demonstrated experimentally. We then explore other materials, including inorganic nanostructures (such as quantum wells and dots), perovskite systems, and (normal and high-temperature) superconductors. Key achievements in these areas, relevant to the experimental realization of quantum batteries, are highlighted. We also address challenges and future research directions. Despite their enormous potential for energy storage devices, research into advanced materials for quantum batteries is still in its infancy. This paper aims to stimulate interdisciplinarity and convergence among different materials science research communities to accelerate the development of new materials and device architectures for quantum batteries.

Title: IsoME: Streamlining High-Precision Eliashberg Calculations
Authors: Eva Kogler, Dominik Spath, Roman Lucrezi, Hitoshi Mori, Zien Zhu, Zhenglu Li, Elena R. Margine, Christoph Heil
Abstract: This paper introduces the Julia package IsoME, an easy-to-use yet accurate and robust computational tool designed to calculate superconducting properties. Multiple levels of approximation are supported, ranging from the basic McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula and its machine learning-enhanced variant to Eliashberg theory including static Coulomb interactions derived from $GW$ calculations, offering a fully ab initio approach to determine superconducting properties, such as the critical superconducting temperature ($T_\text{c}$) and the superconducting gap function ($\Delta$). We validate IsoME by benchmarking it against various materials, demonstrating its versatility and performance across different theoretical levels. The findings indicate that the previously held assumption that Eliashberg theory overestimates $T_\text{c}$ is no longer valid when $\mu^*$ is appropriately adjusted to account for the finite Matsubara frequency cutoff. Furthermore, we conclude that the constant density of states (DOS) approximation remains accurate in most cases. By unifying multiple approximation schemes within a single framework, IsoME combines first-principles precision with computational efficiency, enabling seamless integration into high-throughput workflows through its $T_\text{c}$ search mode. This makes IsoME a powerful and reliable tool for advancing superconductivity research.

Title: Structure and dynamics of a Rouse polymer in a fluctuating correlated medium
Authors: Pietro Luigi Muzzeddu, Davide Venturelli, Andrea Gambassi
Abstract: We study the static and dynamical properties of a harmonically confined Rouse polymer coupled to a fluctuating correlated medium, which affect each other reciprocally during their stochastic evolution. The medium is modeled by a scalar Gaussian field $\phi(\mathbf{x},t)$, which can feature modes with slow relaxation and long-range spatial correlations. We show that these modes affect the long-time behavior of the center-of-mass position of the polymer, which, after a displacement, turns out to relax algebraically towards its equilibrium position. In contrast, we show that the coupling to the medium speeds up the relaxation of higher Rouse modes. We further characterize the typical size of the polymer as a function of its polymerization degree and of the correlation length of the medium, in particular when the system is driven out of equilibrium via the application of a constant external driving force. Finally, we study the response of a linear polymer to a tensile force acting on its terminal monomers.

Title: Orbital textures and evolution of correlated insulating state in monolayer 1T phase transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Qiang Gao, Haiyang Chen, Wen-shin Lu, Yang-hao Chan, Zhenhua Chen, Yaobo Huang, Zhengtai Liu, Peng Chen
Abstract: Strong electron-electron interaction can induce Mott insulating state, which is believed to host unusual correlated phenomena such as quantum spin liquid when quantum fluctuation dominates and unconventional superconductivity through doping. Transition metal compounds as correlated materials provide a versatile platform to engineer the Mott insulating state. Previous studies mostly focused on the controlling of the repulsive interaction and bandwidth of the electrons by gating or doping. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on monolayer 1T phase NbSe2, TaSe2, and TaS2 and directly observed their band structures with characteristic lower Hubbard bands. By systematically investigating the orbital textures and temperature dependence of the energy gap of the materials in this family, we discovered that hybridization of the chalcogen p states with lower Hubbard band stabilizes the Mott phase via tuning of the bandwidth, as shown by a significant increase of the transition temperature (TC) at a stronger hybridization strength. Our findings reveal a mechanism for realizing a robust Mott insulating phase and establish monolayer 1T phase transition metal dichalcogenide family as a promising platform for exploring correlated electron problems.

Title: Theory of Cation Solvation in the Helmholtz Layer of Li-ion Battery Electrolytes
Authors: Zachary A. H. Goodwin, Daniel M. Markiewitz, Qisheng Wu, Yue Qi, Martin Z. Bazant
Abstract: The solvation environments of Li$^+$ in conventional non-aqueous battery electrolytes, such as LiPF$_6$ in mixtures of ethylene carbaronate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), are often used to rationalize the transport properties of electrolytes and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. In the SEI, the solvation environments in the compact electrical double layer (EDL) next to the electrode, also known as the Helmholtz layer, determine (partially) what species can react to form the SEI, with bulk solvation environments often being used as a proxy. Here we develop and test a theory of cation solvation in the Helmholtz layer of non-aqueous Li-ion battery electrolytes. First, we validate the theory against bulk and diffuse EDL atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of LiPF$_6$ EC/EMC mixtures as a function of surface charge, where we find the theory can capture the solvation environments well. Next we turn to the Helmholtz layer, where we find that the main effect of the solvation structures next to the electrode is an apparent reduction in the number of binding sites between Li$^+$ and the solvents, again where we find good agreement with our developed theory. Finally, by solving a simplified version of the theory, we find that the probability of Li$^+$ binding to each solvent remains equal to the bulk probability, suggesting that the bulk solvation environments are a reasonable place to start when understanding new battery electrolytes. Our developed formalism can be parameterized from bulk MD simulations and used to predict the solvation environments in the Helmholtz layer, which can be used to determine what could react and form the SEI.

Title: Stability, growth, and doping of In$_{2}$(Si, Ge)$_{2}$O$_{7}$ as promising n-type wide-gap semiconductors
Authors: Cheng-Wei Lee, Kingsley Egbo, Emily Garrity, Matthew Jankousky, Henry Garland, Andriy Zakutayev, Vladan Stevanović
Abstract: In this paper we investigate, computationally and experimentally, the phase stability, electronic structure properties, and the propensity for n-type doping of In$_{2}$X$_{2}$O$_{7}$ (X=Si, Ge) ternary oxides. This family of materials contains promising novel wide-gap semiconductors based on their estimated high $n$-type Baliga figures of merit and acceptable thermal conductivity for power electronics applications. Here, we find that both In$_{2}$Si$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and In$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$O$_{7}$ to be n-type dopable, with Zr providing between 10$^{16}$ and above 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$ net donor concentrations under O-poor conditions, depending on the chemistry, structure (ground-state thorvetite or high-pressure pyrochlore) and synthesis temperature. Initial thin-film growth and annealing leads to polycrystalline In$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films in thorvetite structure with band gap over 4 eV, and confirms Zr doping predictions by achieving electron concentrations at 10$^{14}$-10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ under O-rich condition. While future epitaxial growth development is still needed, this study establishes In$_{2}$X$_{2}$O$_{7}$ as promising n-type wide-gap semiconductors for power electronic applications.

Title: Effect of Ag nano-additivation on microstructure formation in Nd-Fe-B magnets built by laser powder bed fusion
Authors: Varatharaja Nallathambi, Philipp Gabriel, Xinren Chen, Ziyuan Rao, Konstantin Skokov, Oliver Gutfleisch, Stephan Barcikowski, Anna Rosa Ziefuss, Baptiste Gault
Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) enables the near-net shape production of permanent magnets with complex geometry while reducing material waste. However, controlling the microstructure and optimizing magnetic properties remain challenging due to rapid solidification and intrinsic heat treatment effects occurring during both inter-layer and intra-layer processing. Surface additivation of the feedstock powder with Ag nanoparticles (NPs) is a concept that has been shown to increase the coercivity of PBF-LB/M-produced Nd-Fe-B magnets. Using atom probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we reveal that Ag nano-additivation promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the Nd2Fe14B phase, leading to refined, equiaxed grains and increased stability of the Ti-Zr-B-rich intergranular phase. The intrinsic heat treatment, influenced by layer-wise processing, further affects the distribution of Ag-rich regions, impacting grain growth and intergranular phase composition across different regions of the melt pool. Compared to the unadditivated sample, the Ag-additivated sample exhibits a significantly finer grain structure and a changed intergranular phase, which contribute to enhanced domain wall pinning and coercivity. These microstructural changes directly modify the magnetic domain structure, as evidenced by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our results highlight that the interplay between nano-additivation and in-process heat treatment provides a novel pathway for tailoring the microstructure and enhancing the magnetic performance of permanent magnets.

Title: Spin Models and Cluster Multipole Method: Application to Kagome Magnets
Authors: Juba Bouaziz, Takuya Nomoto, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: We present a multi-scale computational approach that combines atomistic spin models with the cluster multipole (CMP) method. The CMP method enables a systematic and accurate generation of complex non-collinear magnetic structures using symmetry-adapted representations. The parameters of the spin model are derived from density functional theory using the magnetic force theorem, with the paramagnetic state as a reference. The energy landscape of CMP-generated structures is inspected at the model Hamiltonian level, and sets of low-energy magnetic structures are identified for each material candidate. The inclusion of relativistic antisymmetric and anisotropic pair interactions lifts partially the degeneracy among these most stable structures. To demonstrate the applicability and predictive capability of the method, we apply it to the non-collinear Mn3X and collinear Fe3X (X = Ga, Ge, and Sn) kagome compounds. The computational efficiency of the method in identifying low-energy structures among multiple CMP configurations highlights its potential for high-throughput screening of complex magnets with unknown magnetic order.

Title: Bacterial Turbulence in Shear Thinning Fluid
Authors: Hongyi Bian, Chunhe Li, Jin Zhu, Zijie Qu
Abstract: The collective motion of bacteria, commonly referred to as bacterial turbulence, is well understood in Newtonian fluids. However, studies on complex fluids have predominantly focused on viscoelastic effects. In our experiments, we employed Ficoll and Methocel polymers to compare the impacts of Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids on bacterial turbulence. We reported various physical properties, including energy and enstrophy, and observed that the shear-thinning effect is significantly suppressed in high-concentration bacterial suspensions. This suppression is largely attributed to the disruption of chain-like polymer structures around bacterial flagella due to strong interbacterial interactions in dense suspensions. To validate this hypothesis, we conducted experiments across bacterial concentrations (within the range where bacterial turbulence forms) and verified the findings using theoretical calculations based on the modified Resistive Force Theory (RFT).

Title: Atomistic modeling of functionalized magnetite surfaces with oxidation states
Authors: Emre Gürsoy, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer, Robert H. Meißner
Abstract: Understanding the atomic structure of magnetite-carboxylic acid interfaces is crucial for tailoring nanocomposites involving this interface. We present a Monte Carlo (MC)-based method utilizing iron oxidation state exchange to model magnetite interfaces with tens of thousands of atoms - scales typically inaccessible by electronic structure calculations. By comparing the binding site preferences of carboxylic acids obtained from electronic structure calculations, we validated the accuracy of our method. We found that the oxidation state distribution, and thus the binding site preference depends on the surface thickness and coverage. We found that the oxidation state distribution, and consequently binding site preference, depend on coverage and surface thickness, with a critical thickness signaling the transition from layered to bulk-like oxidation states. The method presented here needs no interface specific parameterization, ensuring seamless compatibility with popular bimolecular force fields providing transferability, and simplifying the study of magnetite interfaces in general.

Title: Lithographically-controlled liquid metal diffusion in graphene: Fabrication and magneto-transport signatures of superconductivity
Authors: S. Wundrack, M. Bothe, M. Jaime, K. Kuester, M. Gruschwitz, Z. Mamiyev, P. Schaedlich, B. Matta, S. Datta, M. Eckert, C. Tegenkamp, U. Starke, R. Stosch, H.W. Schumacher, T. Seyller, K. Pierz, T. Tschirner, A. Bakin
Abstract: Metal intercalation in epitaxial graphene enables the emergence of proximity-induced superconductivity and modified quantum transport properties. However, systematic transport studies of intercalated graphene have been hindered by challenges in device fabrication, including processing-induced deintercalation and instability under standard lithographic techniques. Here, we introduce a lithographically controlled intercalation approach that enables the scalable fabrication of gallium-intercalated quasi-freestanding bilayer graphene (QFBLG) Hall bar devices. By integrating lithographic structuring with subsequent intercalation through dedicated intercalation channels, this method ensures precise control over metal incorporation while preserving device integrity. Magneto-transport measurements reveal superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc,onset ~ 3.5 K and the occurrence of a transverse resistance, including both symmetric and antisymmetric field components, which is attributed to the symmetric-in-field component to non-uniform currents. These results establish an advanced fabrication method for intercalated graphene devices, providing access to systematic investigations of confined 2D superconductivity and emergent electronic phases in van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: The Roles of Size, Packing, and Cohesion in the Emergence of Force Chains in Granular Packings
Authors: Ankit Shrivastava, Kaushik Dayal, Hae Young Noh
Abstract: This study investigates computationally the impact of particle size disparity and cohesion on force chain formation in granular media. The granular media considered in this study are bi-disperse systems under uniaxial compression, consisting of spherical, frictionless particles that interact through a modified Hookean model. Force chains in granular media are characterized as networks of particles that meet specific criteria for particle stress and inter-particle forces. The computational setup decouples the effects of particle packing on force chain formations, ensuring an independent assessment of particle size distribution and cohesion on force chain formation. The decoupling is achieved by characterizing particle packing through the radial density function, which enables the identification of systems with both regular and irregular packing. The fraction of particles in the force chains network is used to quantify the presence of the force chains. The findings show that particle size disparity promotes force chain formation in granular media with nearly-regular packing (i.e., an almost-ordered system). However, as particle size disparities grow, it promotes irregular packing (i.e., a disordered systems), leading to fewer force chains carrying larger loads than in ordered systems. Further, it is observed that the increased cohesion in granular systems leads to fewer force chains irrespective of particle size or packing.

Title: Intermediate band analysis in Green's functions calculations of quasiparticle interference
Authors: Xinze Yang, Alexander F. Kemper, Adrian Gozar, Eduardo H. da Silva Neto
Abstract: The measurement of quasiparticle scattering patterns on material surfaces using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is now an established technique for accessing the momentum-resolved electronic band structure of solids. However, since these quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns reflect spatial variations related to differences in the band momenta rather than the momenta themselves, their interpretation often relies on comparisons with simple geometrical models such as the joint density of states (JDOS) or with the convolution of Green's functions. In this paper, we highlight non-intuitive differences between Green's function and JDOS results. To understand the origin of these discrepancies, we analyze the convolution of Green's functions using the Feynman parametrization technique and introduce a framework that we call the intermediate band analysis. This approach allows us to derive simple selection rules for interband QPI, based on electron group velocities. Connecting the intermediate band analysis with the experiment, we consider experimental Bogoliubov QPI patterns measured for FeSe1-xSx, which were recently used to demonstrate a highly anisotropic superconducting gap, indicating superconductivity mediated by nematic fluctuations [1]. The calculated Green's functions convolutions reproduce the particle-hole asymmetry in the intensity of QPI patterns across the Fermi level observed in experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of intermediate band analysis in tracing the origin of this asymmetry to a coherence factor effect of the superconducting state.

Title: The cost of resetting discrete-time random walks
Authors: John C. Sunil, Richard A. Blythe, Martin R. Evans, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time continuous-space random walk, with a symmetric jump distribution, under stochastic resetting. Associated with the random walker are cost functions for jumps and resets, and we calculate the distribution of the total cost for the random walker up to the first passage to the target. By using the backward master equation approach we demonstrate that the distribution of the total cost up to the first passage to the target can be reduced to a Wiener-Hopf integral equation. The resulting integral equation can be exactly solved (in Laplace space) for arbitrary cost functions for the jump and selected functions for the reset cost. We show that the large cost behaviour is dominated by resetting or the jump distribution according to the choice of the jump distribution. In the important case of a Laplace jump distribution, which corresponds to run-and-tumble particle dynamics, and linear costs for jumps and resetting, the Wiener-Hopf equation simplifies to a differential equation which can easily be solved.

Title: Quantum geometry and local moment swapover in correlated graphene heterostructures
Authors: Niklas Witt, Siheon Ryee, Lennart Klebl, Jennifer Cano, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Tim O. Wehling
Abstract: Graphene-based multilayer systems serve as versatile platforms for exploring the interplay between electron correlation and topology, thanks to distinctive low-energy bands marked by significant quantum metric and Berry curvature from graphene's Dirac bands. Here, we investigate Mott physics and local spin moments in Dirac bands hybridized with a flat band of localized orbitals in functionalized graphene. Via hybridization control, a topological transition is realized between two symmetry-distinct site-selective Mott states featuring local moments in different Wyckoff positions, with a geometrically enforced metallic state emerging in between. We find that this geometrically controlled local moment ``swapover'' and associated metal-insulator physics may be realized through proximity coupling of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with group IV intercalants, where the Mott state faces geometrical obstruction in the large-hybridization limit. Our work shows that chemically functionalized graphene provides a correlated electron platform, very similar to the topological heavy fermions in graphene moiré systems but at significantly enhanced characteristic energy scales.

Title: Ultra-stretchable and Self-Healable Vitrimers with Tuneable Damping and Mechanical Response
Authors: Jiaxin Zhao, Nicholas J. Warren, Richard Mandle, Peter Hine, Daniel J Read, Andrew J. Wilson, Johan Mattsson
Abstract: Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymer materials with unique properties offered by cross-links that can undergo associative exchange dynamics. We here present a new class of vitrimers based on poly(methyl acrylate) with cross-links utilising dioxaboralane metathesis. These vitrimers demonstrate a combination of ultra-stretchability (up to $\sim$ 80 times their own length), mechanical toughness ($\sim$ 40 MJ/m$^3$), and thermal stability up to $T\sim$ 250 °C; moreover, the vitrimers demonstrate excellent mechanical damping characterised by a loss factor ($\tan(\delta)$) with a maximum of $\sim$ 2-3 and an effective value $>$0.3 across five decades in frequency (0.001-100 Hz), or correspondingly across a $T$-range of $\sim$ 35 °C near room temperature (for a probe frequency of 1 Hz). The vitrimers can be successfully re-processed using both a thermo-mechanical and a chemical processing route, and can self-heal at room temperature, making them suitable for sustainable applications. The material properties are directly tuneable by variation of both the amount of cross-linker and by the degree of curing. Thus, this class of vitrimers are promising for applications where stretchability combined with mechanical toughness and/or a high mechanical dissipation is required.

Title: Many-Body Localization and Particle Statistics in Disordered Bose-Hubbard Model
Authors: Jie Chen, Chun Chen, Xiaoqun Wang
Abstract: We study the potential influence of the particle statistics on the stability of the many-body localization in the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. Within the higher-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, we find that there is no apparent finite-size boundary drift between the thermal phase and the many-body localized regime. We substantiate this observation by introducing the Van Vleck perturbation theory into the field of many-body localization. The appropriateness of this method rests largely on the peculiar Hilbert-space structure enabled by the particles' Bose statistics. The situation is reversed in the lower-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, where the significant finite-size boundary drift pushes the putative many-body localized regime up to the greater disorder strengths. We utilize the algebraic projection method to make a connection linking the disordered Bose-Hubbard model in the lower-energy section to an intricate disordered spin chain model. This issue of the finite-size drift could hence be analogous to what happens in the disordered Heisenberg chain. Both trends might be traced back to the particles' intrinsic or emergent Fermi statistics.

Title: Discovery of intertwined spin and charge density waves in a layered altermagnet
Authors: Christopher Candelora, Muxian Xu, Siyu Cheng, Alessandro De Vita, Davide Romanin, Chiara Bigi, My Bang Petersen, Alexander LaFleur, Matteo Calandra, Jill Miwa, Younghun Hwang, Ziqiang Wang, Federico Mazzola, Ilija Zeljkovic
Abstract: Altermagnets recently came into the spotlight as a new class of magnetic materials, arising as a consequence of specific crystal symmetries. They are characterized by a spin-polarized electronic band structure similar to ferromagnets, but with net zero magnetization, and touted as a promising platform to host a slew of exotic properties, many of which are yet to be explored. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spin-polarized STM, we discover intertwined spin and charge density waves in a layered triangular lattice altermagnet, Co-intercalated NbSe$_2$. STM topographs and differential conductance maps in the altermagnetic state show tri-directional modulations with a 2$a_0$ wave length that are robustly present and non-dispersive in a wide range of imaging biases, suggesting a charge ordering origin of the modulations. Spin-polarized STM measurements further reveal that the amplitude of the charge modulations is sensitive to the spin polarization of the tip. This observation demonstrates an additional spin modulation associated with the density wave modulations. Our work uncovers the first density wave instability involving both charge and spin degrees of freedom in an altermagnetic system, accomplished by providing elusive atomic-scale insights. Our experiments thus set the foundation for the studies of correlated electronic states in altermagnets, and motivate comprehensive explorations of intercalated quasi-2D transition metal dichalcogenides in the search for novel phenomena in altermagnets.

Title: Evaluating Compression and Nanoindentation in FCC Nickel: A Methodology for Interatomic Potential Selection
Authors: K. Cichocki, F. J. Dominguez-Gutierrez, L. Kurpaska, K. Muszka
Abstract: We performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanical response of face-centered cubic (FCC) nickel under uniaxial compression and nanoindentation using traditional interatomic potentials, including the Embedded Atom Method (EAM) and Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM). By calculating the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE), we analyzed the dissociated slip paths responsible for stacking fault formation and partial Shockley dislocations during mechanical loading. Our findings highlight the critical importance of selecting appropriate interatomic potentials to model compression and nanoindentation tests accurately, aligning simulations with experimental observations. We propose a practical methodology for identifying empirical interatomic potentials suitable for mechanical testing of single-element materials. This approach establishes a benchmark for FCC nickel simulations and provides a basis for extending these methods to more complex Ni-based alloys, facilitating comparisons with experimental results such as those from electron microscopy.

Title: Quantum effects on pyrochlore higher-rank U(1) spin liquids: pinch-line singularities, spin nematics, and connections to oxide materials
Authors: Lasse Gresista, Daniel Lozano-Gómez, Matthias Vojta, Simon Trebst, Yasir Iqbal
Abstract: Motivated by the magnetism of pyrochlore oxides, we consider the effect of quantum fluctuations in the most general symmetry-allowed nearest-neighbor Kramers exchange Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice. At the classical level, this Hamiltonian exhibits a rich landscape of classical spin liquids and a variety of non-conventional magnetic phases. In contrast, much remains unclear for the quantum model, where quantum fluctuations have the potential to alter the classical landscape and stabilize novel magnetic phases. Employing state-of-the-art pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group (pf-FRG) calculations for the spin-$1/2$ model, we determine the quantum phase diagram at relevant cross-sections, where the classical model hosts an algebraic nodal rank-2 spin liquid and a spin nematic order. We find large regions in parameter space where dipolar magnetic order is absent and, based on known fingerprints in the correlation functions, suggest that this non-conventional region is composed of an ensemble of distinct phases stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Our results hint at the existence of a spin nematic phase, and we identify the quantum analogue of the classical rank-2 spin liquid. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of assessing the subtle interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations in reconciling the experimental findings on the nature of magnetic order in Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Integrating Predictive and Generative Capabilities by Latent Space Design via the DKL-VAE Model
Authors: Boris N. Slautin, Utkarsh Pratiush, Doru C. Lupascu, Maxim A. Ziatdinov, Sergei V. Kalinin
Abstract: We introduce a Deep Kernel Learning Variational Autoencoder (VAE-DKL) framework that integrates the generative power of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with the predictive nature of Deep Kernel Learning (DKL). The VAE learns a latent representation of high-dimensional data, enabling the generation of novel structures, while DKL refines this latent space by structuring it in alignment with target properties through Gaussian Process (GP) regression. This approach preserves the generative capabilities of the VAE while enhancing its latent space for GP-based property prediction. We evaluate the framework on two datasets: a structured card dataset with predefined variational factors and the QM9 molecular dataset, where enthalpy serves as the target function for optimization. The model demonstrates high-precision property prediction and enables the generation of novel out-of-training subset structures with desired characteristics. The VAE-DKL framework offers a promising approach for high-throughput material discovery and molecular design, balancing structured latent space organization with generative flexibility.

Title: Hidden memory and stochastic fluctuations in science
Authors: Keisuke Okamura
Abstract: Understanding the statistical laws governing citation dynamics remains a fundamental challenge in network theory and the science of science. Citation networks typically exhibit in-degree distributions well approximated by log-normal distributions, yet they also display power-law behaviour in the high-citation regime, presenting an apparent contradiction that lacks a unified explanation. Here, we identify a previously unrecognised phenomenon: the variance of the logarithm of citation counts per unit time follows a power law with respect to time since publication, scaling as $t^{H}$. This discovery introduces a new challenge while simultaneously offering a crucial clue to resolving this discrepancy. We develop a stochastic model in which latent attention to publications evolves through a memory-driven process incorporating cumulative advantage. This process is characterised by the Hurst parameter $H$, derived from fractional Brownian motion, and volatility. Our framework reconciles this contradiction by demonstrating that anti-persistent fluctuations ($H<\tfrac{1}{2}$) give rise to log-normal citation distributions, whereas persistent dynamics ($H>\tfrac{1}{2}$) favour heavy-tailed power laws. Numerical simulations confirm our model's explanatory and predictive power, interpolating between log-normal and power-law distributions while reproducing the $t^{H}$ law. Empirical analysis of arXiv e-prints further supports our theory, revealing an intrinsically anti-persistent nature with an upper bound of approximately $H=0.13$. By linking memory effects and stochastic fluctuations to broader network dynamics, our findings provide a unifying framework for understanding the evolution of collective attention in science and other attention-driven processes.

Title: Chiral Vibrational Modes in Small Molecules
Authors: Jichen Feng, Ethan Abraham, Joseph Subotnik, Abraham Nitzan
Abstract: The development of quantitative methods for characterizing molecular chirality can provide an important tool for studying chirality induced phenomena in molecular systems. Significant progress has been made in recent years toward understanding the chirality of molecular normal vibrational modes, mostly focusing on vibrations of helical molecular structures. In the present study, we examine the applicability two methodologies previously used for helical structures for the quantification of the chirality of molecular normal modes across a range of small, not necessarily helical, molecules. The first approach involves the application of the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) to each normal mode by associating the mode with a structure formed by imposing the corresponding motion about a common origin. The second approach assigns to each normal mode a pseudoscalar defined as the product of atomic linear and angular momentum summed over all atoms. In particular, using the CCM also as a measure of the chirality of the underlying molecular structure, we establish the existence of correlation between the chirality of molecular normal modes and that of the underlying molecular structure. Furthermore, we find that normal modes associated with different frequency ranges of the molecular vibrational spectrum exhibit distinct handedness behavior.

Title: Unification of Stochastic and Quantum Thermodynamics in Scalar Field Theory via a Model with Brownian Thermostat
Authors: T. Koide, F. Nicacio
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure to derive a quantum master equation for thermal relaxation in real scalar field theory, expanding on the method proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.

Title: Quantum Magic in Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Qiaofeng Liu, Ian Low, Zhewei Yin
Abstract: In quantum computing, non-stabilizerness -- the magic -- refers to the computational advantage of certain quantum states over classical computers and is an essential ingredient for universal quantum computation. Employing the second order stabilizer Rényi entropy to quantify magic, we study the production of magic states in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) via 2-to-2 scattering processes involving electrons and muons. Considering all 60 stabilizer initial states, which have zero magic, the angular dependence of magic produced in the final states is governed by only a few patterns, both in the non-relativistic and the ultra-relativistic limits. Some processes, such as the low-energy $e^-\mu^-\to e^-\mu^-$ and Bhabha scattering $e^-e^+\to e^-e^+$, do not generate magic at all. In most cases the largest magic generated is significantly less than the maximal possible value of $\log (16/7) \approx 0.827$. The only instance where QED is able to generate maximal magic is the low-energy $\mu^-\mu^+\to e^-e^+$, in the limit $m_e/m_\mu \to 0$, which is well approximated in nature. Our results suggest QED, although capable of producing maximally entangled states easily, may not be an efficient mechanism for generating quantum advantages.

Title: Temporal CW polarization-tomography of photon pairs from the biexciton radiative cascade: theory and experiment
Authors: Noam Tur, Ismail Nassar, Ido Schwartz, Joseph Avron, Dan Dalacau, Philip J. Poole, David Gershoni
Abstract: We study, experimentally and theoretically, temporal correlations between the polarization of photon pairs emitted during the biexciton-exciton radiative cascade from a single semiconductor quantum dot, optically excited by a continuous-wave light source. The system is modeled by a Lindbladian coupled to two Markovian baths: One bath represents the continuous light source, and a second represents the emitted radiation. Very good agreement is obtained between the theoretical model that we constructed and a set of 36 different time resolved, polarization correlation measurements between cascading photon pairs.

Title: Bicircular Light Induced Multi-State Geometric Current
Authors: Zhichao Guo, Zhuocheng Lu, Hua Wang, Kai Chang
Abstract: We investigate the photocurrent induced by bicircular light (BCL) in materials, with a focus on its multi-state geometric nature. BCL, a combination of left- and right-circularly polarized light, can generate both injection and shift currents, originating from the geometric properties of gauge-invariant shift vectors, quantum geometric tensors, and triple-phase products. Crucially, the real parts of the quantum geometric tensors and triple-phase products remain nonzero in centrosymmetric systems, facilitating photocurrent generation in contrast to the traditional shift current bulk photovoltaic effect. Using a diagrammatic approach, we systematically analyze the BCL-induced photocurrents and demonstrate the multi-state geometric nature within a one-dimensional three-site Rice-Mele model. Our findings provide a quantum geometric understanding of BCL-induced photocurrents, underscoring the importance of considering multi-band contributions in real materials.

Title: Genuine Quantum effects in Dicke-type Models at large atom numbers
Authors: Kai Müller, Walter T. Strunz
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of genuine quantum effects and beyond mean-field physics in the balanced and unbalanced open Dicke model with a large, yet finite number of atoms $N$. Such driven and dissipative quantum many-body systems have recently been realized in experiments involving ultracold gases inside optical cavities and are known to obey mean-field predictions in the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$. Here we show quantum effects that survive for large but finite $N$, by employing a novel open-system dynamics method that allows us to obtain numerically exact quantum dynamical results for atom numbers up to a mesoscopic $N\approx 1000$. While we find that beyond-mean-field effects vanish quickly with increasing $N$ in the balanced Dicke model, we are able to identify parameter regimes in the unbalanced Dicke model that allow genuine quantum effects to persist even for mesoscopic $N$. They manifest themselves in a strong squeezing of the steady state and a modification of the steady-state phase diagram that cannot be seen in a mean-field description. This is due to the fact that the steady-state limit $t\rightarrow \infty$ and thermodynamic limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ do not commute.

Title: Entanglement generation and scaling from noisy quenches across a quantum critical point
Authors: R. Jafari, J. Naji, A. Langari, Vahid Karimipour, Henrik Johannesson
Abstract: We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.

Title: Compact Superconducting Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers with On-chip rf Components
Authors: Logan Howe, Andrea Giachero, Michael Vissers, Jordan Wheeler, Jason Austermann, Johannes Hubmayr, Joel Ullom
Abstract: Quantum computing systems and fundamental physics experiments using superconducting technologies frequently require signal amplification chains operating near the quantum limit of added noise. Both Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) and traveling wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have been used as first-stage amplifiers to enable readout chains operating within a few quanta or less of the quantum limit. These devices are also presently entering the commercial industry. However, nearly all demonstrations and existing products require bulky external microwave components for interconnection and application of requisite biases. These components -- cabling interconnects, bias tees, directional couplers, and diplexers -- increase the overall amplifier footprint, installation complexity, and reduce already limited available cryogenic volumes. Additionally, these components introduce loss and reflections which impact the measurement efficiency and readout system noise performance; thus making it more difficult to operate near the quantum limit. Here we present the design and validation of microfabricated bias tees and directional couplers for operating three-wave mixing kinetic inductance TWPAs (KITs). We report the performance of KITs integrated with the microfabricated rf components. Using these devices we demonstrate reduction in the amplifier installation footprint by a factor of nearly five and elimination of all external, lossy microwave components previously required to operate a KIT. Our device displays a 2.8 GHz 3 dB bandwidth with a median true gain of 17.5 dB and median system noise of 3.4 quanta. These efforts represent the first full integration of all rf components mandatory for TWPA operation on-chip. Our results mark significant progress towards the miniaturization and simplification of parametric amplifier setups and will aid in their more widespread applicability.

Title: Modelling of the dewetting of ultra-thin liquid films on chemically patterned substrates: linear spectrum and deposition patterns
Authors: Tilman Richter, Paolo Malgaretti, Jens Harting
Abstract: Liquid films of nanometric thickness are prone to spinodal dewetting driven by disjoining pressure, meaning that a non-wetting liquid film of homogeneous thickness in the range of tens of nanometers will spontaneously break into droplets. The surface energy of the underlying solid substrate heavily influences the dynamics and resulting droplet configurations. Here, we study the dewetting of thin liquid films on physically flat but chemically heterogeneous substrates using the thin film equation. We use linear stability analysis (LSA) to describe and predict the system's behavior until the film ruptures and compare it to numerical simulations. Based on our calculations, we propose a potential method for measuring surface energy patterns. Furthermore, we study the non-linear dynamics and the eventually formed droplet pattern by numerical simulations.

Title: A model for boundary-driven tissue morphogenesis
Authors: Daniel S. Alber, Shiheng Zhao, Alexandre O. Jacinto, Eric F. Wieschaus, Stanislav Y. Shvartsman, Pierre A. Haas
Abstract: Tissue deformations during morphogenesis can be active, driven by internal processes, or passive, resulting from stresses applied at their boundaries. Here, we introduce the Drosophila hindgut primordium as a model for studying boundary-driven tissue morphogenesis. We characterize its deformations and show that its complex shape changes can be a passive consequence of the deformations of the active regions of the embryo that surround it. First, we find an intermediate characteristic triangular shape in the 3D deformations of the hindgut. We construct a minimal model of the hindgut primordium as an elastic ring deformed by active midgut invagination and germ band extension on an ellipsoidal surface, which robustly captures the symmetry-breaking into this triangular shape. We then quantify the 3D kinematics of the tissue by a set of contours and discover that the hindgut deforms in two stages: an initial translation on the curved embryo surface followed by a rapid breaking of shape symmetry. We extend our model to show that the contour kinematics in both stages are consistent with our passive picture. Our results suggest that the role of in-plane deformations during hindgut morphogenesis is to translate the tissue to a region with anisotropic embryonic curvature and show that uniform boundary conditions are sufficient to generate the observed nonuniform shape change. Our work thus provides a possible explanation for the various characteristic shapes of blastopore-equivalents in different organisms and a framework for the mechanical emergence of global morphologies in complex developmental systems.

Title: Batch Discovery of New Metal Superhydrides via Chemical Template Theory and Machine Learning
Authors: Yuanhui Sun, Maosheng Miao
Abstract: Metal superhydrides, known for their high hydrogen content and polyhedral hydrogen cages, are promising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity. Recent research has emphasized "chemical pre-compression," enabling hydrogen metallization at lower pressures and facilitating the discovery of superconductors with near-room temperature transitions. Despite extensive studies on binary metal superhydrides, there remains a vast, unexplored chemical space, particularly regarding non-integer hydrogen-to-metal ratios. By integrating the "chemical template effect" with machine learning algorithms, we developed a specialized structure discovery workflow that significantly enhances the efficiency of predicting stable superhydrides. Our method led to the identification of 13 new structural prototypes and 31 stable metal superhydrides, representing a 25% increase in discoveries. The 3D hydrogen clathrates in these compounds are strongly correlated with high superconducting transition temperatures, and our approach achieves a remarkable 70% increase. Most of these structures contain over 50 atoms per primitive cell, with the I4/m M10H84 prototype having the largest unit cell, containing 94 atoms. Additionally, 19 of the newly identified superhydrides exhibit superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) exceeding 100 K, highlighting the potential for higher Tc materials within the 3D hydrogen clathrate structures. The method also shows good potential to search for ternary superhydrides on a large scale.

Title: Surface Tension Between Coexisting Phases of Active Brownian Particles
Authors: Longfei Li, Zihao Sun, Mingcheng Yang
Abstract: The confliction between the stable interface in phase-separated active Brownian particles and its negative surface tension, obtained mechanically via the active pressure, has sparked considerable debate about the formula of active surface tension. Based on the intrinsic pressure of active system, we here derive a new mechanical expression of active surface tension by calculating the work required to create a differential interface area, while remaining the interfacial profiles of intensive quantities invariant (not considered previously). Our expression yields a significantly positive surface tension that increases with the particle activity, which is further supported by mechanical stability analysis of both steady-state droplet and fluctuating interface. Our work is thus promising to resolve the contradiction related to active surface tension.

Title: Precision reconstruction of rational CFT from exact fixed point tensor network
Authors: Gong Cheng, Lin Chen, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Ling-Yan Hung
Abstract: The novel concept of entanglement renormalization and its corresponding tensor network renormalization technique have been highly successful in developing a controlled real space renormalization group (RG) scheme. Numerically approximate fixed-point (FP) tensors are widely used to extract the conformal data of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT) describing critical phenomena. In this paper, we present an explicit analytical construction of the FP tensor for 2D rational CFT. We define it as a correlation function between the "boundary-changing operators" (BCO) on triangles. Our construction fully captures all the real-space RG conditions. We also provide concrete examples, such as Ising, Yang-Lee and Tri-critical Ising models to compute the scaling dimensions explicitly based on the corresponding FP tensor. The BCO descendants turn out to be an optimal basis such that truncation in bond dimensions naturally produces comparable accuracies with the leading existing FP algorithms. Interestingly, our construction of FP tensors is closely related to a strange correlator, where the holographic picture naturally emerges. Our results also open a new door towards understanding CFT in higher dimensions.

Title: Estimating predictability of depinning dynamics by machine learning
Authors: Valtteri Haavisto, Marcin Mińkowski, Lasse Laurson
Abstract: Predicting the future behaviour of complex systems exhibiting critical-like dynamics is often considered to be an intrinsically hard task. Here, we study the predictability of the depinning dynamics of elastic interfaces in random media driven by a slowly increasing external force, a paradigmatic complex system exhibiting critical avalanche dynamics linked to a continuous non-equilibrium depinning phase transition. To this end, we train a variety of machine learning models to infer the mapping from features of the initial relaxed line shape and the random pinning landscape to predict the sample-dependent staircase-like force-displacement curve that emerges from the depinning process. Even if for a given realization of the quenched random medium the dynamics are in principle deterministic, we find that there is an exponential decay of the predictability with the displacement of the line as it nears the depinning transition from below. Our analysis on how the related displacement scale depends on the system size and the dimensionality of the input descriptor reveals that the onset of the depinning phase transition gives rise to fundamental limits to predictability.

Title: Three-band extension for the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model
Authors: Konstantin V. Grigorishin
Abstract: By analogy with the Ginzburg-Landau theory of multi-band superconductors with inner (interband) Josephson couplings we formulate the three-band Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model with weak Josephson couplings between strongly asymmetrical condensates of scalar (Higgs) fields. Unlike usual single-band model, we found three Higgs bosons corresponding to three generations of particles, moreover the heaviest of them corresponds to the already discovered H-boson and decays into fermions of only the third generation through Yukawa interaction. The other two decay into fermions of the first and second generations accordingly, but they are difficult to observe due to very poor conditions for production. We found two sterile ultra-light Leggett bosons, the Bose condensates of which form the dark halos of galaxies and their clusters (i.e so called "dark matter"). The masses of the Leggett bosons are determined by the coefficient of the interband coupling and can be arbitrarily small ($\sim 10^{-20}\mathrm{eV}$) due to non-perturbativeness of the interband coupling. Since propagation of Leggett bosons is not accompanied by current, these bosons are not absorbed by gauge fields unlike the common-mode Goldstone bosons. Three coupled condensates of the scalar fields are related to the existence of three generations of leptons, where each generation interacts with the corresponding condensate getting mass. The interflavour mixing between the generations of active neutrinos and sterile right-handed neutrinos in the three-band system causes the existence of mass states of neutrino without interaction with the Higgs condensates.

Title: Blue repulsive potential for dysprosium Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Niccolò Preti, Nicolò Antolini, Giulio Biagioni, Andrea Fioretti, Giovanni Modugno, Luca Tanzi, Carlo Gabbanini
Abstract: Short-wavelength repulsive potentials for quantum gases allow to realize new systems and to study new phenomena. Here we report the realization of repulsive optical potentials for dysprosium atoms in the blue region of the spectrum, at wavelengths close to 400 nm. We employ a spectrallyfiltered diode laser system to measure both scalar and tensorial components of the polarizability of dysprosium, which we find in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. We demonstrate the implementation of potential strengths appropriate to manipulate Bose-Einstein condensates, with scattering-limited lifetimes exceeding one second. This type of optical potentials opens interesting directions for the study of dipolar superfluids and supersolids.

Title: Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons
Authors: Zeno Bacciconi, Hernan Xavier, Iacopo Carusotto, Titas Chanda, Marcello Dalmonte
Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.

Title: Electric-Field Control of Magnetic Skyrmion Chirality in a Centrosymmetric 2D van der Waals Magnet
Authors: Myung-Geun Han, Joachim Dahl Thomsen, John P. Philbin, Junsik Mun, Eugene Park, Fernando Camino, Lukáš Děkanovský, Chuhang Liu, Zdenek Sofer, Prineha Narang, Frances M. Ross, Yimei Zhu
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals magnets hosting topological magnetic textures, such as skyrmions, show promise for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Electrical control of these topological spin textures would enable novel devices with enhanced performance and functionality. Here, using electron microscopy combined with in situ electric and magnetic biasing, we show that the skyrmion chirality, whether left-handed or right-handed, in insulating Cr2Ge2Te6, is controlled by external electric field direction applied during magnetic field cooling process. The electric-field-tuned chirality remains stable, even amid variations in magnetic and electric fields. Our theoretical investigation reveals that nonzero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between the nearest neighbors, induced by the external electric field, change their sign upon reversing the electric field direction, thereby facilitating chirality selection. The electrical control of magnetic chirality demonstrated in this study can be extended to other non-metallic centrosymmetric skyrmion-hosting magnets, opening avenues for future device designs in topological spintronics and quantum computing.

Title: Detecting Phase Coherence of 2D Bose Gases via Noise Correlations
Authors: Shinichi Sunami, Vijay P. Singh, Erik Rydow, Abel Beregi, En Chang, Ludwig Mathey, Christopher J. Foot
Abstract: We measure the noise correlations of two-dimensional (2D) Bose gases after free expansion, and use them to characterize the in-situ phase coherence across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. The noise-correlation function features a characteristic spatial oscillatory behavior in the superfluid phase, which gives direct access to the superfluid exponent. This oscillatory behavior vanishes above the BKT critical point, as we demonstrate for both single-layer and decoupled bilayer 2D Bose gases. Our work establishes noise interferometry as an important general tool to probe and identify many-body states of quantum gases, extending its application to previously inaccessible correlation properties in multimode systems.

Title: Frustrated phonon with charge density wave in vanadium Kagome metal

Abstract: The formation of a star of David CDW superstructure, resulting from the coordinated displacements of vanadium ions on a corner sharing triangular lattice, has garnered significant attention to comprehend the influence of electron phonon interaction within geometrically intricate lattice of Kagome metals, specifically AV3Sb5 (where A represents K, Rb, or Cs). However, understanding of the underlying mechanism behind CDW formation, coupled with symmetry protected lattice vibrations, remains elusive. Here, from femtosecond time resolved X ray scattering experiments, we reveal that the phonon mode, associated with Cs ions out-of-plane motion, becomes frustrated in the CDW phase. Furthermore, we observed the photoinduced emergence of a metastable CDW phase, facilitated by alleviating the frustration. By not only elucidating the longstanding puzzle surrounding the intervention of phonons but introducing the phononic frustration, this research offers fresh insights into the competition between phonons and periodic lattice distortions, a phenomenon widespread in other correlated quantum materials including layered high TC superconductors.

Title: Magnon Spectra of Cuprates beyond Spin Wave Theory
Authors: Jiahui Bao, Matthias Gohlke, Jeffrey G. Rau, Nic Shannon
Abstract: The usual starting point for understanding magnons in cuprate antiferromagnets such as La$_2$CuO$_4$ is a spin model incorporating cyclic exchange, which descends from a one-band Hubbard model, and has parameters taken from fits based on non-interacting spin wave theory. Here we explore whether this provides a reliable description of experiment, using matrix product states (MPS) to calculate magnon spectra beyond spin wave theory. We find that analysis based on low orders of spin wave theory leads to systematic overestimates of exchange parameters, with corresponding errors in estimates of Hubbard $t/U$. Once these are corrected, the ''standard'' model provides a good account of magnon dispersion and lineshape in La$_2$CuO$_4$, but fails to fully capture the continuum observed at high energies. The extension of this analysis to CaCuO$_2$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ is also discussed.

Title: Local analysis of a single impurity on a graphene Josephson Junction
Authors: Ignazio Vacante, Francesco M.D. Pellegrino, G.G.N. Angilella, Giuseppe A. Falci, Elisabetta Paladino
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the local effects of a single short-range impurity on the electron system of a short ballistic graphene Josephson Junction. Within the Dirac-Bogoliubov-De Gennes approach, we systematically analyze the local density states, whose subgap energy dependence enables us to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes and identify the magnetic nature of the impurity. Furthermore, we observe that the spatial dependence of the local density of states is a sensitive probe of the microscopic processes resulting in subgap impurity-induced bound states. The Fourier analysis evidences the wavevectors related to the momenta of the high transmissive channels in ballistic graphene.

Title: Distinguishing between topological Majorana and trivial zero modes via transport and shot noise study in an altermagnet heterostructure
Authors: Debashish Mondal, Amartya Pal, Arijit Saha, Tanay Nag
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transport and shot noise properties of a one-dimensional semiconducting nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling~(SOC) placed in closed proximity to a bulk $s$-wave superconductor and an altermagnet with $d$-wave symmetry. Such heterostructure with vanishing net magnetization manifests itself as an alternative route to anchor Majorana zero modes~(MZMs) characterized by appropriate topological index~(winding number $W$). Interestingly, this system also hosts accidental zero modes~(AZMs) emerged with vanishing topological index indicating their non-topological nature. Furthermore, by incorporating three terminal setup, we explore the transport and shot noise signatures of these zero modes. At zero temperature, we obtain zero bias peak (ZBP) in differential conductance to be quantized with value $|W|\times 2 e^{2}/h$ for MZMs. On the other hand, AZMs exhibit non-quantized value at zero bias. Moreover, zero temperature shot noise manifests negative~(positive) value for MZMs~(AZMs) within the bulk gap. At finite temperature, shot noise exhibits negative value~(negative to positive transition) concerning MZMs~(AZMs). Thus, the obtained signatures clearly distinguish between the MZMs and non-topological AZMs. We extend our analysis by switching on the next to nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and SOC. Our conclusion remains unaffected for this case as well. Hence, our work paves the way to differentiate between emergent MZMs and AZMs in a semiconductor/ superconductor/ altermagnet heterostructure.

Title: Influence of Media Disorder on DNA Melting: A Monte Carlo Study
Authors: Debjyoti Majumdar
Abstract: We explore the melting of a lattice DNA in the presence of atmospheric disorder, which mimics the crowded environment inside the cell nucleus, using Monte Carlo simulations. The disorder is modeled by randomly retaining lattice sites with probability $p$ while diluting the rest, rendering them unavailable to the DNA. By varying the disorder over a wide range from $p=1$ (zero disorder) up to the percolation critical point $p_c=0.3116$, we show the melting temperature $(T_m)$ to increase nearly linearly with disorder up to $p\approx 0.6$, while strong non-linearity enters for $p\lesssim 0.6$. Associated changes in the bubble statistics have been investigated, showing a substantial change in the bubble size exponents at corresponding melting points for $p\leq 0.5$. Based on these findings two distinct disorder regimes showing weak and strong effects on melting are identified. For simulations, we use the pruned and enriched Rosenbluth method in conjunction with a depth-first implementation of the Leath algorithm to generate the underlying disorder.

Title: Signature of preformed pairs in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
Authors: Klemen Kovač, Alberto Nocera, Andrea Damascelli, Janez Bonča, Mona Berciu
Abstract: We use density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and variational exact diagonalization (VED) to calculate the single-electron removal spectral weight for the Hubbard-Holstein model at low electron densities. Tuning the strength of the electron-phonon coupling and of the Hubbard repulsion allows us to contrast the results for a liquid of polarons versus a liquid of bipolarons. The former shows spectral weight up to the Fermi energy, as expected for a metal. The latter has a gap in its spectral weight, set by the bipolaron binding energy, although this is also a (strongly correlated) metal. This difference suggests that angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy could be used to identify liquids of pre-formed pairs. Furthermore, we show that the one-dimensional liquid of incoherent bipolarons is well approximated by a "Bose sea" of bosons that are hard-core in momentum space, occupying the momenta inside the Fermi sea but otherwise non-interacting. This new proposal for a strongly-correlated many-body wavefunction opens the way for studying various other properties of incoherent (non-superconducting) liquids of pre-formed pairs in any dimension.

Title: Tuning the mechanical behaviour of additively manufactured metamaterials with twinning and meta-harmonics
Authors: David McArthur, PJ Tan, Chu Lun Alex Leung
Abstract: Body-Centred Cubic (BCC) lattices with twinned meta-crystal architecture inspired by the strengthening of bulk metals have significantly improved mechanical performance; however, their deformation behaviour and underlying strengthening mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we reveal that twinning causes a transition from bending to stretch-dominated behaviour in BCC lattices, eliciting vast improvements in stiffness (+162%) and strength (+95%) without changing nodal connectivity. We designed meta-harmonic lattices by controlling a heterogenous distribution of twinned grain boundaries, inspired by bimodal harmonic microstructure, and we amplified the axial strain energy at location specific sites to further enhance the stiffness of BCC lattices by 206%. Our lattice design philosophy unleashes the potential of cellular materials for high-performance engineering applications.

Title: Autoionization-enhanced Rydberg dressing by fast contaminant removal
Authors: Alec Cao, Theodor Lukin Yelin, William J. Eckner, Nelson Darkwah Oppong, Adam M. Kaufman
Abstract: Rydberg dressing is a powerful tool for entanglement generation in long-lived atomic states. While already employed effectively in several demonstrations, a key challenge for this technique is the collective loss triggered by blackbody-radiation-driven transitions to contaminant Rydberg states of opposite parity. We demonstrate the rapid removal of such contaminants using autoionization (AI) transitions found in alkaline-earth-like atoms. The AI is shown to be compatible with coherent operation of an array of optical clock qubits. By incorporating AI pulses into a stroboscopic Rydberg dressing (SRD) sequence, we enhance lifetimes by an order of magnitude for system sizes of up to 144 atoms, while maintaining an order of magnitude larger duty cycle than previously achieved. To highlight the utility of our approach, we use the AI-enhanced SRD protocol to improve the degree of spin-squeezing achieved during early-time dressing dynamics. These results bring Rydberg dressing lifetimes closer to fundamental limits, opening the door to previously infeasible dressing proposals.

Title: Real space quantum metric of solids
Authors: Lucas A. Oliveira, Wei Chen
Abstract: By applying the projector to the filled lattice eigenstates on a specific position, or applying the local electron annihilation operator on the many-body ground state, one can construct a quantum state localized around a specific position in a solid. The overlap of two such local states at slightly different positions defines a quantum metric in real space, which manifests even in systems as simple as particles in a box. For continuous systems like electron gas, this metric weighted by the density gives the momentum variance of electrons, which is readily measurable by ARPES. The presence of disorder curves the real space manifold and gives rise to various differential geometrical quantities like Riemann tensor and Ricci scalar, indicating the possibility of engineering differential geometrical properties by disorder, as demonstrated by lattice models of 2D metals and topological insulators.

Title: Lattice dynamics and phonon dispersion of van der Waals layered ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2
Authors: Xia Chen, Xi Zhang, Wenjie He, Yu Li, Jiating Lu, Dinghua Yang, Deren Li, Li Lei, Yong Peng, Gang Xiang
Abstract: Despite the tremendous progress in spintronic studies of van der Waals (vdW) room-temperature ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2, much less effort has been spent on its lattice dynamics and possible interaction with spintronic degrees of freedom. In this work, by combining Raman spectroscopy in a wide range of pressure (atmospheric pressure~19.5 GPa) and temperature (80~690 K) with first-principles calculation, we systematically studied the lattice dynamics and phonon dispersion of Fe3GaTe2. Our results show that the phonon energies of Fe3GaTe2 located at 126.0 cm-1 and 143.5 cm-1 originate from the anharmonic and harmonic vibration modes, respectively. Furthermore, the first room-temperature spin-phonon coupling in vdW ferromagnet is observed with strength of ~0.81 cm-1 at 300 K, by identifying Raman anomalies in both phonon energy and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of below Curie temperature of Fe3GaTe2. Our findings are valuable for fundamental and applied studies of vdW materials under variable conditions.

Title: Emptiness Instanton in Quantum Polytropic Gas
Authors: Alexander G. Abanov, Dimitri M. Gangardt
Abstract: The emptiness formation problem is addressed for a one-dimensional quantum polytropic gas characterized by an arbitrary polytropic index $\gamma$, which defines the equation of state $P \sim \rho^\gamma$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\rho$ is the density. The problem involves determining the probability of the spontaneous formation of an empty interval in the ground state of the gas. In the limit of a macroscopically large interval, this probability is dominated by an instanton configuration. By solving the hydrodynamic equations in imaginary time, we derive the analytic form of the emptiness instanton. This solution is expressed as an integral representation analogous to those used for correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. Prominent features of the spatiotemporal profile of the instanton are obtained directly from this representation.

Title: Magnetic Metastability driven Anomalous Hall Effect in Fe$_{x}$TaS$_2$
Authors: Mohamad Numan, Prasanta Chowdhury, Sanat Adhikary, Saurav Giri, Jhuma Sannigrahi, Matthias Gutmann, Souvik Chatterjee, Subham Majumdar
Abstract: We report here the observation of robust thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) in Fe-intercalated TaS$_2$ single crystal Fe$_{x}$TaS$_2$, which develops upon cooling under a moderate magnetic field of 500 Oe or higher. The thermoremanence is found to exist in a zero magnetic field up to a temperature as high as 160 K, which is well above the ferromagnetic Curie point ($T_C =$ 90 K) of the sample. The TRM in this compound can be traced back to the strong Ising character and the quasi-two-dimensional nature of the spins. The analysis of the magnetization data indicates the presence of short-range magnetic correlation in the form of a Griffiths singularity above $T_C$ to a temperature as high as 2$T_C$. The TRM is further manifested in the form of a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in zero magnetic field. In contrast to TRM, which exists well above $T_C$, the thermoremanent Hall effect vanishes as soon as the sample is heated above $T_C$. This may be an indication that a long-range ordered phase is essential for the emergence of AHE.

Title: Molecular details and free energy barriers of ion de-coordination at elevated salinity and pressure and their consequences for membrane separations
Authors: Nathanael S. Schwindt, Razi Epsztein, Anthony P. Straub, Shuwen Yue, Michael R. Shirts
Abstract: Ion dehydration has been hypothesized to strongly influence separation performance in membrane systems and ion transport in nanoscale channels. However, the molecular details of ion dehydration in membranes are not well understood, in particular under the high pressures and concentrations required for brine treatment. In this study, we define \textit{de-coordination} as the process by which an ion decreases its total coordination number, including both water molecules and counterions. We estimate the de-coordination free energies in bulk solution for a range of different ions at high pressure and salinity relevant to brine treatment using molecular simulation. We also propose alternatives to the coordination number as the size constraint for traversing nanoscale constrictions, such as the maximum cross-sectional area of the complexed ion. We show that high operating pressures do not significantly change cation hydration shell stability nor the shell size, while high ionic concentrations lower the free energy barrier to reduce the cation coordination number. We find that anion de-coordination free energies are largely unaffected by elevated salinity and pressure conditions. Finally, we discuss the implications on ion-ion selectivity in separations membranes (e.g. extracting lithium from salt-lake brines) due to the effects of elevated pressure and salinity on ion de-coordination.

Title: Momentum distribution of He-3 in one dimension
Authors: Massimo Boninsegni
Abstract: The one-particle density matrix of a one-dimensional system of fermions featuring a hard-core repulsive interaction at short distances can be computed (numerically) exactly by means of the continuous-space Worm Algorithm, without any sign instability. We present here results for this quantity, and the related momentum distribution, for a helium-three fluid. It is shown that effects of quantum statistics are observable in the fully polarized system, but are suppressed in the unpolarized one, atoms being essentially distinguishable in the latter case.

Title: Evidence of the matrix effect on a compositionally graded oxide thin film
Authors: J. Scola, F. Jomard, E. Loire, J. Wolfman, B. Negulescu, G. Z. Liu, M.-A. Pinault-Thaury
Abstract: A heterostructure of Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3$/La$_{1.1}$Sr$_{0.9}$NiO$_3$ /SrTiO$_3$ has been analysed by magnetic sector secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The stoichiometry parameter $x$ of the top layer was made varying continuously from 0 to 1 along the width of the sample by combinatorial pulsed laser deposition. Prior to SIMS analysis, the composition gradient of Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3$ was quantitatively characterized by chemical characterizations including wavelength and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopies. Even if the Ti content is constant into Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3${}, its ionic yield exhibits an increasing trend as Ba is substituted by Sr. Such a phenomenon can be explained by the variation of the neighbouring atoms chemistry which affects the ionization probability of titanium during the sputtering process. In addition to the continuously varying composition, the oxide multilayer sample features sharp interfaces hence the in-depth resolution under our analysing conditions has been investigated too. The modelling of the interface crossing profiles reveals that the instrumental contribution to the profile broadening is as low as 5 nm.

Title: Z-basis measurements using mixed parity and direct readout
Authors: Pieter Thijs Eendebak, Önder Gül
Abstract: Many architectures for quantum information processing rely on qubits dedicated for the readout of a larger quantum register. These ancilla readout qubits present a physical overhead not contributing to the computational resource. A common implementation in spin qubit architectures is the readout schemes based on Pauli exclusion of charges confined in a double quantum dot, with one dot serving as the ancilla qubit. Here, using a three-qubit spin register and a Pauli exclusion-based readout, we present z-basis measurements of the entire register constructed with tomography, eliminating the physical overhead. We validate our approach with simulations which provide insight into potential sources of errors in the reconstruction. We also demonstrate our reconstruction by performing quantum state tomography on a GHZ state of a spin-qubit based device.

Title: Comment on 2501.17230 and 2502.00103 "Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO3 via the generalized Frohlich and deformation potential mechanisms" and "Theory of ab initio downfolding with arbitrary range electron-phonon coupling"
Authors: Jonathan Ruhman
Abstract: This comment critically examines the claims made in arXiv papers arXiv:2501.17230 and arXiv:2502.00103, which argue that a multiplicity of polar optical phonons can generate a long-range attractive interaction via a generalized Frohlich coupling. I identify a fundamental flaw in their derivation, showing that their result relies on an unphysical assumption--specifically, neglecting the intermode Coulomb interactions between different polar optical phonons. By restoring these missing interactions I show the screened Coulomb interaction is always repulsive in the static limit.

Title: Possible quantum spin liquid state of CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$

Abstract: CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ is a recently found two-dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet without showing magnetic order. We grew high-quality CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ single crystals and studied the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and thermal conductivity. The dc magnetic susceptibility and magnetization reveal its nature of effective spin-1/2, easy axis anisotropy, and antiferromagnetic spin coupling. The ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility and specific heat data indicate the absence of any phase transition down to 20 mK. The ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) at zero magnetic field exhibits a non-zero residual term $\kappa_0/T =$ 0.0056 W/K$^2$m. Although the magnetic field dependence of $\kappa$ is rather weak, the 14 T thermal conductivity shows an essential zero residual term. All these results point to a possible ground state of quantum spin liquid.

Title: Efficient shortcuts-to-adiabaticity for loading an ultracold Fermi gas into higher orbital bands of one-dimensional optical lattice
Authors: Hang Yu, Haoyi Zhang, Bolong Jiao, Qinxuan Peng, Liao Sun, Jiaming Li, Le Luo
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to load ultracold Fermi gases from the ground orbital band of a one-dimensional optical lattice into the first excited orbital band. Unlike the narrow momentum distribution of a Bose-Einstein Condensate, Fermi gases exhibit a broad momentum distribution. To address this, we define the average loading efficiency across all quasi-momentum states and theoretically perform the loading operation simultaneously for each Bloch state. Using a multiparameter global optimization method, we determine the loading efficiency at various lattice depths. We can enhance the loading efficiency by adjusting the phase of the lattice, which leverages the different symmetries of Bloch wavefunctions in various optical lattice orbitals. We also identified that the primary factor hindering higher loading efficiency in the Fermi gas is the multiple occupancy of the quasi-momentum states. Our simulations of various occupancies revealed a decreasing trend in mean loading efficiency as the number of occupied quasi-momentum states increases. Finally, we compare our method with other loading techniques and assess its experimental feasibility.

Title: Spin injection and detection in all-van der Waals 2D devices
Authors: Jan Bärenfänger, Klaus Zollner, Lukas Cvitkovich, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Stefan Hartl, Jaroslav Fabian, Jonathan Eroms, Dieter Weiss, Mariusz Ciorga
Abstract: In this work we report efficient out-of-plane spin injection and detection in an all-van der Waals based heterostructure using only exfoliated 2D materials. We demonstrate spin injection by measuring spin-valve and Hanle signals in non-local transport in a stack of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and graphene layers. FGT flakes form the spin aligning electrodes necessary to inject and detect spins in the graphene channel. The hBN tunnel barrier provides a high-quality interface between the ferromagnetic electrodes and graphene, eliminating the conductivity mismatch problem, thus ensuring efficient spin injection and detection with spin injection efficiencies of up to $P=40$\%. Our results demonstrate that FGT/hBN/graphene heterostructures form a promising platform for realizing 2D van der Waals spintronic devices.

Title: Large-Angle Convergent-Beam Electron Diffraction Patterns via Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Joseph J. Webb, Richard Beanland, Rudolf A. Römer
Abstract: We show how generative machine learning can be used for the rapid computation of strongly dynamical electron diffraction directly from crystal structures, specifically in large-angle convergent-beam electron diffraction (LACBED) patterns. We find that a conditional generative adversarial network can learn the connection between the projected potential from a cubic crystal's unit cell and the corresponding LACBED pattern. Our model can generate diffraction patterns on a GPU many orders of magnitude faster than existing direct simulation methods. Furthermore, our approach can accurately retrieve the projected potential from diffraction patterns, opening a new approach for the inverse problem of determining crystal structure.

Title: Quantum-limited amplification without instability
Authors: A. Metelmann, O. Lanes, T-Z. Chien, A. McDonald, I. Tsiamis, M. Hatridge, A. A. Clerk
Abstract: Quantum parametric amplifiers typically generate by operating in proximity to a point of dynamical instability. We consider an alternate general strategy where quantum-limited, large-gain amplification is achieved without any proximity to a dynamical instability. Our basic mechanism (involving dynamics that conserves the number of squeezed photons) enables the design of a variety of one and two mode amplifiers that are not limited by any fundamental gain-bandwidth constraint. We focus on a particular realization that allows us to realize an ideal single-mode squeezing operation in transmission, and which has zero reflection. We present both a thorough theoretical analysis of this system (including pump-depletion effects), and also discuss results of an experimental superconducting quantum circuit implementation.

Title: Dicke superradiant enhancement of the heat current in circuit QED
Authors: Gian Marcello Andolina, Paolo Andrea Erdman, Frank Noé, Jukka Pekola, Marco Schirò
Abstract: Collective effects, such as Dicke superradiant emission, can enhance the performance of a quantum device. Here, we study the heat current flowing between a cold and a hot bath through an ensemble of $N$ qubits, which are collectively coupled to the thermal baths. We find a regime where the collective coupling leads to a quadratic scaling of the heat current with $N$ in a finite-size scenario. Conversely, when approaching the thermodynamic limit, we prove that the collective scenario exhibits a parametric enhancement over the non-collective case. We then consider the presence of a third uncontrolled {\it parasitic} bath, interacting locally with each qubit, that models unavoidable couplings to the external environment. Despite having a non-perturbative effect on the steady-state currents, we show that the collective enhancement is robust to such an addition. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of realizing such a Dicke heat valve with superconducting circuits. Our findings indicate that in a minimal realistic experimental setting with two superconducting qubits, the collective advantage offers an enhancement of approximately $10\%$ compared to the non-collective scenario.

Title: Metastability and time scales for parabolic equations with drift 2: the general time scale
Authors: Claudio Landim, Jungkyoung Lee, Insuk Seo
Abstract: Consider the elliptic operator given by \[ \mathscr{L}_\epsilon f=b\cdot\nabla f+\epsilon\Delta f \] for some smooth vector field $b:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\epsilon>0$, and the initial-valued problem on $\mathbb{R}^d$ \[ \left\{\begin{aligned}&\partial_t u_\epsilon=\mathscr{L}_\epsilon u_\epsilon,\\ &u_\epsilon(0,\,\cdot)=u_0(\cdot), \end{aligned} \right. \] for some bounded continuous function $u_0$. Under the hypothesis that the diffusion on $\mathbb{R}^d$ induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$ has a Gibbs invariant measure of the form $\exp \{-U(x)/\epsilon\}dx$ for some smooth Morse potential function $U$, we provide the complete characterization of the multi-scale behavior of the solution $u_\epsilon$ in the regime $\epsilon\to0$. More precisely, we find the critical time scales $1\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(1)}\ll\cdots\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(q)}$ as $\epsilon\to0$, and the kernels $R_t^{(p)}:M_0\times M_0\to\mathbb{R}_+$, where $M_0$ denotes the set of local minima of $U$, such that \[ \lim_{\epsilon\to0}u_\epsilon(t\theta_\epsilon^{(p)},\,x)=\sum_{m'\in M_0}R_t^{(p)}(m,\,m')u_0(m'), \] for all $t>0$ and $x$ in the domain of attraction of $m$ for the dynamical system $\dot{x}(t)=b(x(t))$. We then complete the characterization of the solution $u_\epsilon$ by computing the exact asymptotic limit of the solution between time scales $\theta_\epsilon^{(p)}$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(p+1)}$ for each $p$, where $\theta_\epsilon^{(0)}=1$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(q+1)}=\infty$. Our proof relies on the full tree-structure characterization of the metastable behavior in different time-scales of the diffusion induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$. This result can be regarded as the precise refinement of Freidlin-Wentzell theory which was not known for more than a half century.

Title: Emergent Continuous Time Crystal in Dissipative Quantum Spin System without Driving
Authors: Shu Yang, Zeqing Wang, Libin Fu, Jianwen Jie
Abstract: Time crystals are a nonequilibrium phase of matter that extend fundamental spontaneous symmetry breaking into the temporal dimension, typically requiring external driving for their realization. Here, we explore the nonequilibrium phase diagram of a two-dimensional dissipative Heisenberg spin system without external coherent or incoherent driving. Through numerical analysis of spin dynamics, we identify nonstationary steady states, some of which are limit cycles with persistent periodic oscillations, while others exhibit chaotic, aperiodic behavior. The emergence of limit cycle steady states breaks the continuous time-translation symmetry of this time-independent many-body system, classifying them as continuous time crystals. We further validate these oscillatory behaviors by testing their stability against local perturbations and assess the robustness of the emergent continuous time crystals by introducing isotropic Gaussian white noise. This work provides insights into the intricate interplay between the dissipation and spin interaction, and opens possibilities for realizing dissipation-induced, heating-immune time crystals.

Title: Complete Active Space Iterative Coupled Cluster Theory
Authors: Robin Feldmann, Max Mörchen, Jakub Lang, Michał Lesiuk, Markus Reiher
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the possibility of improving multireference-driven coupled cluster (CC) approaches with an algorithm that iteratively combines complete active space (CAS) calculations with tailored CC and externally corrected CC. This is accomplished by establishing a feedback loop between the CC and CAS parts of a calculation through similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian with those CC amplitudes that are not encompassed by the active space. We denote this approach the complete active space iterative coupled cluster (CASiCC) ansatz. We investigate its efficiency and accuracy in the singles and doubles approximation by studying the prototypical molecules H4, H8, H2O, and N2. Our results demonstrate that CASiCC systematically improves on the single-reference CCSD and the ecCCSD methods across entire potential energy curves, while retaining modest computational costs. However, the tailored coupled cluster method shows superior performance in the strong correlation regime suggesting that its accuracy is based on error compensation. We find that the iterative version of externally corrected and tailored coupled cluster methods converge to the same results.

Title: Optical control of electrons in a Floquet topological insulator
Authors: Daniel M. B. Lesko, Tobias Weitz, Simon Wittigschlager, Weizhe Li, Christian Heide, Ofer Neufeld, Peter Hommelhoff
Abstract: Light-dressed materials hold enormous potential for generating new electronic properties. The band structure resulting from light-dressing can exhibit starkly different quantum and topological phenomena. So far, optical control of charge within a light-dressed band structure has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate optical control of electrons in light-dressed graphene. By focusing circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses at 1550 nm on monolayer graphene, we generate a Floquet topological insulator (FTI). With a phase-locked second harmonic field, we dynamically control electrons in this FTI state. For the first time, we observe photocurrent circular dichroism, the all-optical anomalous Hall effect, and FTI valley-polarized currents. The photocurrents show strong sub-cycle phase-sensitivity, opening the door to ultrafast control within topologically protected electronics (topotronics), spectroscopy, and attosecond physics in novel quantum materials.

Title: Plasmonic Time Crystals
Authors: Joshua Feinberg, David E. Fernandes, Boris Shapiro, Mario G. Silveirinha
Abstract: We study plasmonic time crystals, an extension of dielectric-based photonic time crystals to plasmonic media. Remarkably, we demonstrate that such systems may amplify both longitudinal and transverse modes. In particular, we show that plasmonic time crystals support \emph{collective resonances} of longitudinal modes, which occur independently of the wave vector $k$, even in the presence of significant dissipation. These resonances originate from the coupling between the positive- and negative-frequency branches of the plasmonic dispersion relation of the unmodulated system and from the divergence of the density of states near the plasma ($\varepsilon$-near zero) frequency $\omega_p$. The strongest resonance arises at a modulation frequency $\Omega = 2 \omega_p$, corresponding to a direct interband transition. We demonstrate these resonances for various periodic modulation profiles and provide a generic perturbative formula for resonance widths in the weak modulation limit. Furthermore, we propose transparent conducting oxides as promising platforms for realizing plasmonic time crystals, as they enable significant modulation of the electron effective mass while maintaining moderate dissipation levels. Our findings provide new insights into leveraging time-modulated plasmonic media to enhance optical gain and control wave dynamics at the nanoscale.

Title: Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning
Authors: Li-Li Ye, Ying-Cheng Lai
Abstract: Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.

Galli, Minna Patanen, Daniela Rupp
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established phase retrieval algorithms. In this work, we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored to X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) single-shot single-particle diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.

Title: Surface tension-driven boundary growth in tumour spheroids
Authors: D. Riccobelli
Abstract: Growing experimental evidence highlights the relevant role of mechanics in the physiology of solid tumours, even in their early stages. While most of the mathematical models describe tumour growth as a volumetric increase of mass in the bulk, in vitro experiments on tumour spheroids have demonstrated that cell proliferation occurs in a thin layer at the boundary of the cellular aggregate. In this work, we investigate how elasticity and surface tension interact during the development of tumour spheroids. We model the spheroid as a hyperelastic material undergoing boundary accretion, where the newly created cells are deformed by the action of surface tension. This growth leads to a frustrated reference configuration, resulting in the appearance of residual stress. Our theoretical framework is validated using experimental results from the literature. Like fully developed tumours, spheroids open when subjected to radial cuts. Remarkably, this behaviour is observed even in newly formed spheroids, which lack residual stress. Through both analytical solutions and numerical simulations, we show that this phenomenon is driven by elastocapillary interactions, where the residual stress developed in grown spheroids amplifies the tumour opening. Our model's outcomes align with experimental observations and allow us to estimate the surface tension acting on tumour spheroids.

Title: Lattice Chern-Simons-Maxwell Theory and its Chirality
Authors: Ze-An Xu, Jing-Yuan Chen
Abstract: We define and solve the $\text{U(1)}$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, with an emphasis on the chirality of the theory. Realizing Chern-Simons theory on lattice has been a problem of interest for decades, and over the years it has gradually become clear that there are two key points: 1) Some non-topological term, such as a Maxwell term, is necessary -- this is true even in the continuum, but more manifestly on the lattice; 2) the $\text{U(1)}$ gauge field should be implemented in the Villainized form to retain its topological properties. Putting the two ideas together seriously, we show all interesting properties of a chiral Chern-Simons theory are reproduced in an explicitly regularized manner on the lattice. These include the bosonic and fermionic level quantization, the bulk and chiral edge spectrum, the Wilson loop flux attachment (with point-split framing or geometric framing depending on the Maxwell coupling), the Wilson loop spin, the ground state degeneracy, and, most non-trivially, the chiral gravitational anomaly.

Title: Phase transition on superfluid vortices in Higgs-Confinement crossover
Authors: Tomoya Hayata, Yoshimasa Hidaka, Dan Kondo
Abstract: We propose a novel method to distinguish states of matter by identifying spontaneous symmetry breaking on extended objects, such as vortices, even in the absence of a bulk phase transition. As a specific example, we investigate the phase transition on superfluid vortices in the Higgs-confinement crossover using a $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{gauge} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ model. This model exhibits superfluidity of $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ symmetry and allows for a crossover between the Higgs and confinement regimes by varying the gauge coupling constant from weak to strong. We demonstrate that, on vortices, spontaneous breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flavor symmetry occurs in the weak coupling (Higgs) regime, while it does not in the strong coupling (confinement) regime. We also confirm that those regimes are separated by a second-order phase transition through Monte Carlo simulations, whose universality class corresponds to the two-dimensional Ising model.

Title: Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Aiichi Iwazaki
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. By comparing the axion effect with thermal effect on the width $\Delta B$, we have shown the dominance of the axion effect over thermal effect at low temperature less than $50$mK. The dominance of the axion effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.

Title: Chiral phase transition: effective field theory and holography
Authors: Yanyan Bu, Zexin Yang
Abstract: We consider the chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but with vanishing baryon density. Presumably, the chiral phase transition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the transition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low-energy effective field theory for the system, in which fluctuations and dissipations are systematically captured. The dynamical variables involve the chiral charge densities and order parameter (chiral condensate). Via the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique, the effective action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model. With higher-order terms suitably neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the effective field theory resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the effective field theory, we briefly discuss the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and Goldstone modes.

Title: Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention for Adaptive Dynamics in Transformers
Authors: Markus J. Buehler
Abstract: We present an approach to modifying Transformer architectures by integrating graph-aware relational reasoning into the attention mechanism, merging concepts from graph neural networks and language modeling. Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.

Title: Investigating the Bouncing Barrier with Collision Simulations of Compressed Dust Aggregates
Authors: Haruto Oshiro, Misako Tatsuuma, Satoshi Okuzumi, Hidekazu Tanaka
Abstract: The collision outcomes of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks dictate how planetesimals form. Experimental and numerical studies have suggested that bouncing collisions occurring at low impact velocities may limit aggregate growth in the disks, but the conditions under which bouncing occurs have yet to be fully understood. In this study, we perform a suite of collision simulations of moderately compact dust aggregates with various impact velocities, aggregate radii, and filling factors ranging between 0.4 and 0.5. Unlike previous simulations, we generate compact aggregates by compressing more porous ones, mimicking the natural processes through which compact aggregates form. We find that the compressed aggregates bounce above a threshold mass, which decreases with impact velocity. The threshold mass scales with impact velocity as the $-4/3$ power, consistent with the findings of previous experiments. We also find that the threshold aggregate mass for bouncing depends strongly on filling factor, likely reflecting the strong filling-factor dependence of the compressive strength of compressed aggregates. Our energy analysis reveals that nearly 90\% of the initial impact energy is dissipated during the initial compression phase, and over 70\% of the remaining energy is dissipated during the subsequent stretching phase, regardless of whether the collision results in sticking or bouncing. Our results indicate that dust aggregates with a filling factor of 0.4 cease to grow beyond 100 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ as a result of the bouncing barrier.

Title: Characterizing dynamical behaviors in topological open systems with boundary dissipations
Authors: Zhen-Yu Zheng, Xueliang Wang, Shu Chen
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with boundary dissipations described by Lindblad master equations and unravel distinct dynamical features in the topologically different phases of the underlying Hamiltonian. By examining the long-time damping dynamics, we uncover a dynamical duality phenomenon between the weak and strong dissipation region, which exists only in the topologically non-trivial phase, linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectra,particularly the stripe closest to the steady state. When dissipation is confined to a single boundary, the dynamical duality phenomenon still exists. Under this condition, the Liouvillian gap fulfills an exponential size scaling relation in the topologically non-trivial phase and a power-law size scaling relation in the topologically trivial phase. Within the topologically non-trivial region, we identify the existence of boundary-localized dark states in the thermodynamical limit, which is responsible for the exponential size decay of Liouvillian gap.

Title: Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees
Authors: Jernej Rudi Finžgar, Simone Notarnicola, Madelyn Cain, Mikhail D. Lukin, Dries Sels
Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.
