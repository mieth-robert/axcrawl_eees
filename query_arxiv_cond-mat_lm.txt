Title: Large-scale portfolio optimization with variational neural annealing
Authors: Nishan Ranabhat, Behnam Javanparast, David Goerz, Estelle Inack
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a routine asset management operation conducted in financial institutions around the world. However, under real-world constraints such as turnover limits and transaction costs, its formulation becomes a mixed-integer nonlinear program that current mixed-integer optimizers often struggle to solve. We propose mapping this problem onto a classical Ising-like Hamiltonian and solving it with Variational Neural Annealing (VNA), via its classical formulation implemented using autoregressive neural networks. We demonstrate that VNA can identify near-optimal solutions for portfolios comprising more than 2,000 assets and yields performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Mosek, while exhibiting faster convergence on hard instances. Finally, we present a dynamical finite-size scaling analysis applied to the S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 3000 indices, revealing universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling of the VNA algorithm on portfolio optimization problems.

Title: Majorana edge reconstruction and the $ν=5/2$ non-Abelian thermal Hall puzzle
Authors: Tevž Lotrič, Taige Wang, Michael P. Zaletel, Steven H. Simon, S. A. Parameswaran
Abstract: Pioneering thermal transport measurements on two-dimensional electron gases in high magnetic fields have demonstrated that the quantized Hall state at filling factor $\nu=5/2$ has a thermal Hall conductance $\kappa$ quantized in half-integer multiples of $\kappa_0 = {\pi^2 k_B^2 T}/{3h}$. Half-integer $\kappa/\kappa_0$ is a signature of neutral Majorana edge modes, in turn linked to the presence of non-Abelian anyon excitations in the bulk. However, the experimentally observed value of $\kappa$ corresponds to the 'PH-Pfaffian' state, in tension with numerical studies which instead favor either the Pfaffian or the AntiPfaffian. A variety of mechanisms have been invoked to explain this discrepancy, but have been either ruled out by further experiments or else involve fine-tuning. Building on density-matrix-renormalization group studies of physically realistic edges and analytic calculations of edge structure, we propose an alternative resolution of this puzzle involving an 'edge reconstruction' solely involving the neutral Majorana sector of the theory. Such a Majorana edge reconstruction can "screen'' a Pfaffian or AntiPfaffian bulk, so that transport signatures become indistinguishable from those of the PH-Pfaffian. We argue that this physically natural scenario is consistent with experiment.

Title: Finite-temperature criticality through quantum annealing
Authors: Gianluca Teza, Francesco Campaioli, Marco Avesani, Oren Raz
Abstract: Critical phenomena at finite temperature underpin a broad range of physical systems, yet their study remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks near phase transitions. Quantum annealers have attracted significant interest as a potential tool for accessing finite temperature criticality beyond classical reach, but their utility in precisely resolving criticality has remained limited by noise, hardware constraints, and thermal fluctuations. Here we overcome these challenges, showing that careful calibration and embedding allow quantum annealers to capture the full finite-temperature critical behavior of the paradigmatic two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet. By tuning the energy scale of the system and mitigating device asymmetries, we sample effective Boltzmann distributions and extract both the critical temperature and the associated critical exponents. Our approach opens the study of equilibrium and non-equilibrium critical phenomena in a broad class of systems at finite temperature.

Title: Confined and deconfined chaos in classical spin systems
Authors: Hyeongjin Kim, Robin Schäfer, David M. Long, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Anushya Chandran
Abstract: Weakly perturbed integrable many-body systems are typically chaotic and thermal at late times. However, there are distinct relationships between the timescales for thermalization and chaos. The typical relationship is confined chaos: when trajectories are still confined to regions in phase space with constant conserved quantities (actions), the conjugate angle variables are already unstable. Confined chaos thus far precedes thermalization. In a different relationship, which we term deconfined chaos, chaotic instabilities and thermalization occur on the same timescale. We investigate these two qualitatively distinct scenarios through numerical and analytical studies of two perturbed integrable classical spin models: the Ishimori spin chain (confined chaos), and the central spin model with XX interactions (deconfined chaos). We analytically establish (super)-integrability in the latter model in a microcanonical shell. Deconfined chaos emerges through the separation of phase space into large quasi-integrable regions and a thin chaotic manifold. The latter causes chaos and thermalization on the fastest possible timescale, which is proportional to the inverse perturbation strength. This behavior is reminiscent of the quantum SYK models and strange metals.

Title: Triplet Exciton-driven Topological Mott insulator at Finite Temperature
Authors: Peizhi Mai
Abstract: Motivated by experiments in which the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) charge gap greatly exceeds the Curie temperature, we apply determinantal quantum Monte Carlo to two complementary lattice models with different geometries: the checkerboard quantum-spin-Hall-Hubbard model and the generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. In both cases an incompressible QAH phase with total Chern number $C=\pm 1$ emerges at quarter filling well above the Curie temperature. Each spin channel carries its own nonquantized Chern number while remaining only partly filled, revealing a topological Mott insulator where Mottness opens the charge gap before magnetic order appears. Charge excitations bind triplet excitons that suppress net magnetization, a many-body dynamical effect absent in mean-field theory. The concurrence of these results on two very different models shows that coupling Mottness with band topology generically yields a high-temperature QAH insulator whose charge excitations are dressed by triplet excitons.

Title: Correlated quantum shift vector of particle-hole excitations
Authors: Xu Yang, Ajit Srivastava, Justin C. W. Song
Abstract: Excitons are a prime example of how electron interactions affect optical response and excitation. We demonstrate that, beyond its spectra, the bound nature of an exciton's electron-hole pair produces a correlated quantum geometry: excitonic excitations possess a quantum shift vector that is independent of light polarization. We find this counterintuitive behavior has dramatic consequences for geometric response: e.g., in noncentrosymmetric but non-polar materials, vertical excitonic transitions possess vanishing shift vector zeroing their shift photocurrent; this contrasts with finite and strongly light polarization dependent shift vectors for non-interacting delocalized particle-hole excitations. This dichotomy makes shift vector a sharp diagnostic of the pair localization properties of particle-hole excitations and demonstrates the non-perturbative effects of electron interactions in excited state quantum geometric response.

Title: Antisymmetric Raman response
Authors: Mattia Udina, Indranil Paul
Abstract: We develop the theory of antisymmetric Raman response, defined as the difference between the Raman signals of two scattering geometries related by an exchange of mutually perpendicular incoming and the outgoing photon polarizations. Such responses, finite in orthorhombic or lower symmetry systems, are related to cross-susceptibilities of two Raman operators and are characterized by the absence of intraband terms. This is in contrast to standard Raman responses which measure auto-susceptibilities where both intra- and interband processes contribute. We illustrate the theory with examples from the charge density wave rare-earth tritellurides and the excitonic insulator Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$. Our theory establishes antisymmetric Raman response as a unique tool to probe microscopic features such as interband energy scales and to detect reflection symmetry breaking.

Title: Generic and intrinsic negative longitudinal magnetoresistance at weak fields in non-magnetic metals with inversion symmetry
Authors: Rhonald Burgos Atencia, Antonio Vecchione, Denys Makarov, Carmine Ortix
Abstract: Negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR) is a decrease in the electrical resistivity of a material when the driving electric field and an external magnetic field are collinear. In the semiclassical weak field regime, the NLMR of non-magnetic metals is activated in the presence of substantial concentrations of Berry curvature (BC). This restricts the appearance of a semi-classical NLMR to metals with acentric crystalline arrangements, including Weyl semimetals. Here, we show a previously unidentified mechanism of semi-classical NLMR that can be present in strongly spin-orbit coupled non-magnetic metals even if the crystal possess bulk inversion symmetry. A Zeeman-activated BC directly couples to the orbital motion of Bloch electrons to generate a negative MR that scales with the relaxation time precisely as the Drude resistivity. Importantly, the Zeeman-activated BC is \emph{independent} of the external magnetic field strength. It is instead related to the degree of non-parabolicity of the spin-orbit coupled electronic bands. We show that this NLMR mechanism, which is independent of the Landé $g$-factor, is generic and appears in \emph{all} centrosymmetric point groups and can occur both in topological and conventional conductors.

Title: Short-wavelength mesophases in the ground states of core-softened particles in two-dimensions
Authors: Rômulo Cenci, Lucas Nicolao, Alejandro Mendoza-Coto
Abstract: We describe the formation of short-wavelength mesophases in a two-dimensional core-softened particle system. By proposing a series of specific ansatz for each relevant phase, we performed a variational analysis to obtain the ground-state phase diagram. Our results reveal a variety of cluster lattice phases with distinct cluster orientations, alongside traditional two-dimensional Bravais lattices such as square, triangular, oblique, and rectangular structures, as well as other non-Bravais arrangements including honeycomb and kagome phases. We characterize in detail the ground-state phase transitions and identify coexistence regions between competing phases, capturing both first-order and continuous transitions. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of the competing length scales introduced by the hard-core repulsion in shaping the rich landscape of mesophases, emphasizing the interplay between intra-cluster structure and inter-cluster organization. This study provides a systematic framework that could support future investigations of classical thermal melting behavior or quantum phase transitions in similar cluster-forming systems.

Title: 3D Atomic-Scale Metrology of Strain Relaxation and Roughness in Gate-All-Around (GAA) Transistors via Electron Ptychography
Authors: Shake Karapetyan, Steven E. Zeltmann, Glen Wilk, Ta-Kun Chen, Vincent D.-H. Hou, David A. Muller
Abstract: To improve transistor density and electronic performance, next-generation semiconductor devices are adopting three-dimensional architectures and feature sizes down to the few-nm regime, which require atomic-scale metrology to identify and resolve performance-limiting fabrication challenges. X-ray methods deliver three-dimensional imaging of integrated circuits but lack the spatial resolution to characterize atomic-scale features, while conventional electron microscopy offers atomic-scale imaging but limited depth information. We demonstrate how multislice electron ptychography (MEP), a computational electron microscopy technique with sub-Ångström lateral and nanometer-scale depth resolution, enables 3D imaging of buried features in devices. By performing MEP on prototype gate-all-around transistors we uncover and quantify distortions and defects at the interface of the 3D gate oxide wrapped around the channel. We find that the silicon in the 5-nm-thick channel gradually relaxes away from the interfaces, leaving only 60% of the atoms in a bulk-like structure. Quantifying the interface roughness, which was not previously possible for such small 3D structures but strongly impacts carrier mobility, we find that the top and bottom interfaces show different atomic-scale roughness profiles, reflecting their different processing conditions. By measuring 3D interface roughness simultaneously with strain relaxation and atomic-scale defects, from a single MEP dataset, we provide direct experimental values of these performance-limiting parameters needed for modeling and early fabrication optimization.

Title: Ordering According to Size of Disks in a Narrow Channel
Authors: Dan Liu, Michael Karbach, Gerhard Müller
Abstract: A long and narrow channel confines disks of two sizes. The disks are randomly agitated in a widened channel under moderate pressure, then jammed according to a tunable protocol. We present exact results that characterize jammed macrostates (volume, entropy, jamming patterns). The analysis divides jammed disk sequences into overlapping tiles out of which statistically interacting quasiparticles are constructed. The fractions of small and large disks are controlled by a chemical potential adapted to configurational statistics of granular matter. The results show regimes for the energy parameters (determined by the jamming protocol) that either enhance or suppress the mixing of disk sizes. Size segregation or size alternation driven by steric forces alone are manifestations of a broken symmetry.

Title: Exact Solutions for Bimodal Distributions under Stochastic Plasma Irradiation in Thin Films
Authors: Joel Saucedo, Uday Lamba, Hasitha Mahabaduge
Abstract: A persistent paradox complicates the study of plasma-irradiated thin films, where bimodal grain distributions and ambiguous scaling laws, roughly shifting between $\Phi^{-1/2}$ and $\Phi^{-1}$, or a general inverse dependence on plasma flux, are empirical yet remain theoretically unreconciled. Existing models fail to unify noise-driven evolution, defect saturation kinetics, and nucleation-loss balance within a single, self-consistent formalism. This work resolves these discrepancies by developing the first exact analytical theory for this system. We derive the closed-form steady-state grain area distribution, $P_{ss}(A)$, establish the precise dimensionless threshold for bimodality onset at $\Pi_c = 4/(3\sqrt{3})$, and demonstrate that defect saturation physics mandate a universal $\langle A \rangle \propto \kappa^2 \Phi^{-1} e^{+2E_b/k_B T_s}$ scaling law. The framework reveals how competition between stochastic impingement and deterministic growth triggers microstructure fragmentation, resolving long-standing ambiguities in irradiation-induced surface evolution and providing a predictive foundation for materials processing.

Title: A physics-informed neural network for modeling fracture without gradient damage: formulation, application, and assessment
Authors: Aditya Konale, Vikas Srivastava
Abstract: Accurate computational modeling of damage and fracture remains a central challenge in solid mechanics. The finite element method (FEM) is widely used for numerical modeling of fracture problems; however, classical damage models without gradient regularization yield mesh-dependent and usually inaccurate predictions. The use of gradient damage with FEM improves numerical robustness but introduces significant mathematical and numerical implementation complexities. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can encode the governing partial differential equations, boundary conditions, and constitutive models into the loss functions, offering a new method for fracture modeling. Prior applications of PINNs have been limited to small-strain problems and have incorporated gradient damage formulation without a critical evaluation of its necessity. Since PINNs in their basic form are meshless, this work presents a PINN framework for modeling fracture in elastomers undergoing large deformation without the gradient damage formulation. The PINN implementation here does not require training data and utilizes the collocation method to formulate physics-informed loss functions. We have validated the PINN's predictions for various defect configurations using benchmark solutions obtained from FEM with gradient damage formulation. The crack paths obtained using the PINN are approximately insensitive to the collocation point distribution. This study offers new insights into the feasibility of using PINNs without gradient damage and suggests a simplified and efficient computational modeling strategy for fracture problems. The performance of the PINN has been evaluated through systematic variations in key neural network parameters to provide guidance for future applications. The results provide motivation for extending PINN-based approaches to a broader class of materials and damage models in mechanics.

Title: Stabilization of the first-order phase transition character and Enhancement of the Electrocaloric Effect by NBT substitution in BaTiO$_3$ ceramics
Authors: M. Karakaya, I. Gurbuz, L. Fulanovic, U. Adem
Abstract: The electrocaloric properties of BaTiO$_3$-based lead-free ferroelectric materials have been widely investigated. One approach to achieving a large electrocaloric response is to exploit the substantial polarization change associated with the first-order phase transition at the Curie temperature. Following this strategy, we investigated the electrocaloric response of (1$-x$)BaTiO$_3$-$x$Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$ (BT-NBT) ceramics for x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30. In this BT-rich region of the solid solution, it is established that increasing the NBT content enhances the tetragonality of BaTiO$_3$. We show that this increase in tetragonality helps maintain the first-order nature of the phase transition and enables a correspondingly large electrocaloric response, despite the simultaneous enhancement of relaxor ferroelectric character with NBT substitution. A significantly large effective electrocaloric temperature change ($\Delta T_{\mathrm{eff}}$) of ~1.65 K was obtained for the x = 0.20 composition under an applied field of 40 kV/cm using direct electrocaloric measurements, in reasonable agreement with the indirect results.

Title: Thermodynamic Prediction Enabled by Automatic Dataset Building and Machine Learning
Authors: Juejing Liu, Haydn Anderson, Noah I. Waxman, Vsevolod Kovalev, Byron Fisher, Elizabeth Li, Xiaofeng Guo
Abstract: New discoveries in chemistry and materials science, with increasingly expanding volume of requisite knowledge and experimental workload, provide unique opportunities for machine learning (ML) to take critical roles in accelerating research efficiency. Here, we demonstrate (1) the use of large language models (LLMs) for automated literature reviews, and (2) the training of an ML model to predict chemical knowledge (thermodynamic parameters). Our LLM-based literature review tool (LMExt) successfully extracted chemical information and beyond into a machine-readable structure, including stability constants for metal cation-ligand interactions, thermodynamic properties, and other broader data types (medical research papers, and financial reports), effectively overcoming the challenges inherent in each domain. Using the autonomous acquisition of thermodynamic data, an ML model was trained using the CatBoost algorithm for accurately predicting thermodynamic parameters (e.g., enthalpy of formation) of minerals. This work highlights the transformative potential of integrated ML approaches to reshape chemistry and materials science research.

Title: Local imperfect feedback control in non-equilibrium biophysical systems enabled by thermodynamic constraints
Authors: Carlos Floyd, Aaron R. Dinner, Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan
Abstract: Understanding how biological systems achieve robust control despite relying on imperfect local information remains a challenging problem. Here, we consider non-equilibrium models which are generically used to describe natural and synthetic biological processes, such as gene regulation and protein conformational dynamics, and investigate their capacity for effective control using imperfect local feedback mechanisms. We derive a thermodynamic constraint on the response of non-equilibrium steady-state properties to changes in the driving forces. We show that this constraint enables linear, local, and easily implementable feedback rules to achieve environmental tracking and adaptation without consideration of network topology. In particular, we demonstrate that local stability of these feedback dynamics implies global stability for systems with one or two chemical regulators, regardless of the network topology. For higher-dimensional systems, global stability is not guaranteed. However, in part due to simplifications in attractor landscapes implied by our thermodynamic constraint, we find the basin of attraction remains significantly larger than would be expected from linear approximation alone. Our findings provide insight into how biological and synthetically engineered systems can respond effectively to environmental changes given only minimal feedback, without highly engineered interactions or precise parameter tuning.

Title: Superheating and melting phenomena of a vibrated granular layer of cubic particles
Authors: Francisco López-González, Gustavo M. Rodríguez-Liñán, Fernando Donado, Felipe Pacheco Vázquez, Luis Fernando Elizondo-Aguilera
Abstract: We report the combined results of experiments and molecular dynamics simulations conducted to investigate superheating phenomena in vertically vibrated granular matter. Specifically, we consider a system of cubic particles densely packed in a square-lattice array and subjected to different shaking strengths, denoted by Gamma, approaching a critical value Gamma_c. Below Gamma_c, the superheated crystalline array remains indefinitely stable. Above Gamma_c, it transitions progressively into a granular liquid-like state over a Gamma-dependent timescale tau. We show that while an increase in frictional contacts significantly prolongs the lifetime of the superheated crystalline state, it does not play a major role in the scaling laws governing how that lifetime depends on shaking strength. Our findings also show that the transition from the superheated solid to the liquid state in the vibrated system is well described by a Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (KJMA) equation, which is commonly used to model phase transformations in thermal systems.

Title: Localization and top eigenvalue detection
Authors: Diego Tapias, Benedikt Grüger, Reimer Kühn, Peter Sollich
Abstract: The detection of the top eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector in ensembles of random matrices has significant applications across various fields. An existing method, based on the linear stability of a complementary set of cavity equations, has been successful in identifying the top eigenvalue when the associated eigenvector is extended. However, this approach fails when the eigenvector is localized. In this work, we adapt the real-valued cavity method to address this limitation by introducing a novel criterion that exploits the constraints of the cavity equations to detect the top eigenvalue in systems with a localized top eigenvector. Our results are validated using the Anderson model as a paradigmatic example.

Title: Origin of insulating-like behavior of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ under pressure: A first-principles study
Authors: Xin Du, Jian-Feng Zhang, Zhong-Yi Lu, Kai Liu
Abstract: Recent experimental study on Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ superconductors has revealed an unexpected quantum phase transition from superconducting state to insulatinglike state under pressure [Zhou et al., Nat. Phys. 18, 406 (2022)]. To better understand the physical origin of this pressure-induced phenomenon, here we have studied the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of undoped and O-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi2212) under pressures based on density-functional theory calculations. We first identified the crystal structure of undoped Bi2212 with the armchair distortions in the BiO layers and reproduced the insulating feature of the parent compound. Then we added an extra O atom to the parent compound to simulate the hole-doping effect and found that the structure with O dopant located in the van der Waals (vdW) gap is energetically the most stable. Further calculations on O-doped (0.125 holes/Cu) Bi2212 revealed that the pressure can induce charge redistributions between CuO$_2$ planes and BiO layers; specifically, Cu-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals gain electrons and Cu atoms rather than O atoms dominate around the Fermi level under high pressure. Along with the increasing pressure, the density of states at the Fermi level first reaches the maximum at $\sim$ 10 GPa and then shows a valley near the Fermi level above 20 GPa, which may be responsible for the insulatinglike state observed in recent experiments. We suggest that the competition among several factors, such as the increase of electrons in the CuO$_2$ plane, the variation of in-plane hopping due to the shortened Cu-O distance, and the enhanced Coulomb repulsion among the Cu-3$d$ electrons, could lead to the exotic transition under pressure. Our work provides an explanation of the high-pressure behaviors of Bi2212, which may facilitate a comprehensive understanding of cuprate superconductors.

Title: Way More Than the Sum of Their Parts: From Statistical to Structural Mixtures
Authors: James P. Crutchfield
Abstract: We show that mixtures comprised of multicomponent systems typically are much more structurally complex than the sum of their parts; sometimes, infinitely more complex. We contrast this with the more familiar notion of statistical mixtures, demonstrating how statistical mixtures miss key aspects of emergent hierarchical organization. This leads us to identify a new kind of structural complexity inherent in multicomponent systems and to draw out broad consequences for system ergodicity.

Title: Not even metastable: Cubic double-diamond in diblock copolymer melts
Authors: Micheal S. Dimitriyev, Benjamin R. Greenvall, Rejoy Matthew, Gregory M. Grason
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of continuous transformations between two canonical, cubic network phases of block copolymer melts: double-gyroid, an equilibrium morphology for many systems; and double-diamond, often thought to be a close competitor. We use a strong-segregation approach to compute the free energy of double network morphologies as a function of two structural parameters that convert between two limiting cubic cases; a tetragonal stretch of the unit cell in combination with fusion of pairs of trihedal gyroid nodes into tetrahedral diamond nodes. For the simplest case of conformationally symmetric diblock melts, we find that cubic double-diamond sits at an unstable saddle point that is continuously deformable into the lower free energy gyroid, as well as a second metastable, tetragonal network composed by trihedral nodes. We confirm the broad instability of double-diamond at finite segregation using self-consistent field studies and further show that it derives directly from the entropic free energy cost of chain packing in the tubular domains of tetrahedral nodes. Correspondingly, we demonstrate two factors that quench the entropic cost of packing in the tubular domain -- homopolymer blending and elastic asymmetry between the blocks -- promoting double-diamond to a metastable state by way of free energy barrier that separates it from double-gyroid.

Title: Biexciton-polariton coupling mediated by dark states

Bristow (1 and 2) ((1) Associate, Nanoscale Device Characterization Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA (2) Department of Physics and Astronomy, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA (3) Nanoscale Device Characterization Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)
Abstract: Multi-exciton correlations shape the photo-induced response of nanostructured materials, particularly when interactions are enhanced by light confinement. Here multidimensional coherent spectroscopy is used to quantify biexciton and exciton-polariton dynamics in a semiconductor microcavity. One- and two-quantum spectra, which are dominated by polariton-related contributions, also include a polarization-dependent biexciton feature whose magnitude and spectral coordinates depend on the detuning between the cavity mode and the exciton resonance. Comparison of spectra acquired using collinear and noncollinear experimental geometries indicates that excitation wavevector plays no significant role in this behavior. The measured energy dispersion and cavity enhancement are not compatible with uncoupled biexcitons or bipolaritons. To explain the measurements, an indirect biexciton-photon coupling model is introduced whereby biexcitons are formed from dark excitons that Coulomb couple to the bright-exciton fraction of the polaritons. The model addresses inconsistent observations of biexcitons previously reported in semiconductor microcavities and is generalizable to any material where optically dark excitons contribute to light-matter interaction. Our results suggest a mechanism to access long-lived dark excitons through multi-exciton correlations in strongly coupled systems.

Title: Advancing Quantum Transport Calculations: An Effective Medium Theory with Plane-Wave Basis and PAW Potentials in Eigenstates
Authors: Yi-Cheng Lin, Ken-Ming Lin, Yu-Chang Chen
Abstract: We present an effective medium theory based on density functional theory that is implemented in VASP using the PAW method with a plane wave basis set. The transmission coefficient is derived through three complementary approaches: the current density relation J=nqv, the field operator method, and the nonquilibrium Green's function formalism. We compare transmission coefficients calculated using EMT-PW with results from NEGF-DFT, based on the NanoDCAL package utilizing a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, for both periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions. The minor discrepancies observed are attributed to differences in basis sets, pseudopotentials, and the treatment of lead regions. Notably, the EMT-PW framework avoids the common issue of overcompleteness encountered in non-equilibrium transport theories and allows for the decomposition of the total transmission coefficient into contributions from individual eigenstates. Furthermore, when combined with an effective gate model, EMT-PW is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing current characteristics in nanodevices under applied gate voltages. By leveraging one-electron wavefunctions in eigenstates, this method provides a robust foundation for exploring the quantum statistics of electrons and current quantum correlations within the second quantization framework.

Title: High thermal conductivity dominated by thermal phonons with mean free paths exceeding hundred nanometer in three-dimensional covalent organic framework derivatives: a molecular dynamics study
Authors: Sungjae Kim, Taeyong Kim
Abstract: Thermal properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of fundamental interest owing to exceptional heat conduction properties. Recent studies have suggested that their thermal conductivities can be enhanced by multiple factors such as pore size, mass density, and degree of chain order. However, microscopic processes that govern heat conduction properties have been explored in only a limited number of COFs. Here, we report thermal transport properties of 3D COF derivatives using molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we have studied six different COF-102 derivatives with different organic linkers and topologies. Among the derivatives studied, we found that COF-102 derivatives with high mass density can exhibit thermal conductivity as high as ~ 27 W/mK, owing to suppressed chain rotation that leads to thermal phonons scattered by anharmonicity. Our results show that the observed orders of magnitude of increase in the thermal conductivity are primarily attributed to low frequency phonon modes that support hundreds of nanometer scale mean free path, which predominantly carry heat. Our study provides a theoretical framework that elucidates the structure-property relationship governing heat conduction in COFs, offering design strategies for thermal management applications.

Title: Hydrodynamic bend instability of motile particles on a substrate
Authors: Sameer Kumar, Niels de Graaf Sousa, Amin Doostmohammadi
Abstract: The emergence of hydrodynamic bend instabilities in ordered suspensions of active particles is widely observed across diverse living and synthetic systems, and is considered to be governed by dipolar active stresses generated by the self-propelled particles. Here, using linear stability analyses and numerical simulations, we show that a hydrodynamic bend instability can emerge in the absence of any dipolar active stress and solely due to the self-propulsion force acting on polar active units suspended in an incompressible fluid confined to a substrate. Specifically, we show analytically, and confirm in simulations, that a uniformly ordered state develops bend instability above a critical self-propulsion force. Numerical simulations show that a further increase in the self-propulsion strength leads the system towards a disorderly flow state. The results offer a new route for development of hydrodynamic instabilities in two-dimensional self-propelled materials that are in contact with a substrate, with wide implications in layers of orientationally ordered cells and synthetic active particles.

Title: Promising ferroelectric metal EuAuBi with switchable giant shift current
Authors: Guangrong Tan, Jinyu Zou, Gang Xu
Abstract: The coexistence of metallicity and ferroelectricity in ferroelectric (FE) metals defies conventional wisdom and enables novel functionalities in electronic and optoelectronic systems. However, intrinsic FE metals remain extremely rare and challenging. Here, using first-principles calculations, we identify that a huge spontaneous polarization of 16.6-20.2 $\mu\text{C}/\text{cm}^2$, a moderate switching barrier of 68.5 meV/f.u., and a low carrier concentration of $ \sim 2.5 \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ coexist in topological semimetal EuAuBi. Further electron-phonon coupling calculations reveal that the metallic carriers interact weakly with the FE phonon mode, consistent with the decoupled electron mechanism. Moreover, EuAuBi exhibits a pronounced bulk photovoltaic effect characterized by a giant polarization-dependent shift current with the magnitude of conductivity up to 370 $\mu\text{A}/\text{V}^2$. Thus, a feasible FE metal verification setup is proposed based on the shift current measurement. These results not only demonstrate that EuAuBi is a promising FE metal, but also propose a practical route for FE metals identification, which could promote the FE metals study greatly.

Title: Observation of superconductivity-induced leading-edge gap in Sr-doped $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films
Authors: Wenjie Sun, Zhicheng Jiang, Bo Hao, Shengjun Yan, Hongyi Zhang, Maosen Wang, Yang Yang, Haoying Sun, Zhengtai Liu, Dianxiang Ji, Zhengbin Gu, Jian Zhou, Dawei Shen, Donglai Feng, Yuefeng Nie
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bulk $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ has ignited significant interest in nickelate superconductors. Unlike cuprates, where superconductivity predominantly originates from the $\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, nickelates exhibit additional complexities involving contributions from the $\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$ orbital, prompting fundamental questions about their pairing mechanisms. Despite recent progress in stabilizing superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films at ambient pressure, direct spectroscopic evidence of the superconducting gap opening remains elusive. Here, we present an in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of Sr-doped superconducting $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films. Fermi surface mapping reveals Ni-$\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-derived $\alpha$ and $\beta$ pockets, with orbital fillings of 0.11$\pm$0.02 electrons and 0.66$\pm$0.03 holes per Ni, respectively, resulting in a total of 0.45$\pm$0.04 electrons for each Ni. These bands exhibit moderate electron correlations, characterized by a band renormalization factor of 3-4. Notably, both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands exhibit leading-edge shifts across the superconducting transition, with gap magnitude of ~1-2 meV at Fermi momenta along the Brillouin zone diagonal and slightly away from the zone diagonal, deviating from the conventional $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap structure. Additionally, the Ni-$\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$-derived $\gamma$ band lies ~75 meV below the Fermi level, indicating a $\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-dominated fermiology in this compound.

Abstract: We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full $2^N \times 2^N$ Markov flow, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-Lévy.

Title: Anomaly diagnosis via symmetry restriction in two-dimensional lattice systems
Authors: Kyle Kawagoe, Wilbur Shirley
Abstract: We describe a method for computing the anomaly of any finite unitary symmetry group $G$ acting by finite-depth quantum circuits on a two-dimensional lattice system. The anomaly is characterized by an index valued in the cohomology group $H^4(G,U(1))$, which generalizes the Else-Nayak index for locality preserving symmetries of quantum spin chains. We show that a nontrivial index precludes the existence of a trivially gapped symmetric Hamiltonian; it is also an obstruction to ``onsiteability" of the symmetry action. We illustrate our method via a simple example with $G=\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$. Finally, we provide a diagrammatic interpretation of the anomaly formula which hints at a higher categorical structure.

Title: Large unconventional anomalous Hall effect far above room temperature in epitaxial Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films
Authors: Jing Meng, Huali Yang, Yu Shen, Kun Zheng, Hongru Wang, Yuhao Wang, Keqi Xia, Bocheng Yu, Xiaoyan Zhu, Baiqing Lv, Yaobo Huang, Jie Ma, Dariusz Jakub Gawryluk, Toni Shiroka, Zhenzhong Yang, Yang Xu, Qingfeng Zhan, Tian Shang
Abstract: Noncoplanar spin textures usually exhibit a finite scalar spin chirality (SSC) that can generate effective magnetic fields and lead to additional contributions to the Hall effect, namely topological or unconventional anomalous Hall effect (UAHE). Unlike topological spin textures (e.g., magnetic skyrmions), materials that exhibit fluctuation-driven SSC and UAHE are rare. So far, their realization has been limited to either low temperatures or high magnetic fields, both of which are unfavorable for practical applications. Identifying new materials that exhibit UAHE in a low magnetic field at room temperature is therefore essential. Here, we report the discovery of a large UAHE far above room temperature in epitaxial Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films, where the fluctuation-driven SSC stems from the field-induced transverse-conical-spiral phase. Considering their epitaxial nature and the large UAHE stabilized at room temperature in a low magnetic field, Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films represent an exciting, albeit rare, case of a promising candidate material for spintronic devices.

Title: Topological electronic structures of non-collinear magnetic phases in a multi-orbital Hubbard model with spin-orbit interactions
Authors: Ying-Lin Li, Po-Hao Chou, Chung-Yu Mou
Abstract: We explore topological electronic structure of magnetic phases in a multi-orbital Hubbard model with spin-orbit interactions. To account for more general antiferromagnetic orders that go beyond the collinear Néel order, two different spin-orbit interactions, Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit interactions, are considered. By performing the canonical transformation, we derive the corresponding generalized t-J model. At half filling, employing self-consistent magnetic order calculations, we find distinctive spin arrangements under Dresselhaus or Rashba spin-orbit interactions. For the Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction, the spin configuration exhibits collinear antiferromagnetic order. On the other hand, Rashba interaction results in spins antiferromagnetically aligning in xy-plane and a small interaction controlled by hopping parameter induces spin tilting, causing antiferromagnetic alignment in xy-plane but ferromagnetic alignment in z-direction. We categorize topological properties of these phases for low doping in the generalized t-J model.: for 3D collinear antiferromagnetic order, the system possesses a modified time-reversal symmetry, characterized by the Z2 index. In contrast, for systems with tilted antiferromagnetic orders, it is protected by inversion symmetry and characterized by the Z4 index. We further examine the bulk-edge correspondence for non-collinear magnetic phases, revealing that the surface state becomes gapless when the surface is parallel to the ferromagnetic component of tilted antiferromagnetic order; otherwise, the surface state exhibits a gap. Our findings offer a comprehensive topological characterization for doped and canted antiferromagnetic insulators with spin-orbit interactions, providing valuable insights into the interplay between spin arrangements, symmetries, and topological properties in systems governed by the multi-orbital Hubbard model.

Title: Enhanced Quantum behavior on frustrated Ising model: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm study
Authors: Seunghan Lee, Hunpyo Lee
Abstract: We investigated the quantum effects of a frustrated Ising model on a two-dimensional square lattice using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). While strong spin frustration is known to induce quantum fluctuations at low temperatures, previous classical approaches restricted to binary (up or down) spin configurations have been insufficient to fully capture the quantum contributions of frustration. In this study, we introduced a quantitative metric to evaluate the quantum effects arising from frustration and employed QAOA to differentiate between classical and quantum regimes. Notably, we found that in the weakly frustrated region, QAOA measurements rarely capture first excited states, as they are energetically well separated from the ground state. In contrast, near the quantum phase transition point, excited states appear more frequently in QAOA measurements, highlighting the increased role of quantum fluctuations.

Title: Common topological origin of longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance in Fe3GeTe2
Authors: Alapan Bera, Soumik Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: In this work, we reveal the coexistence and correlation of a topological cusp anomaly in the planar Hall signal and a spin-flip scattering dominated positive longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) across the entire temperature range below the Curie point in Fe3GeTe2. This correlation dies out exponentially as the magnetic field is directed away from the ab-plane, resulting in unusually sharp polar angle dependence of longitudinal MR and the Hall response.

Title: Breakdown of the conventional spin-wave dynamics and its double-constraint modification in the spin-$\mathbf{\frac{1}{2}}$ triangular-prism Heisenberg antiferromagnet
Authors: Shoji Yamamoto, Jun Ohara
Abstract: Spontaneous magnon decays in an $S=\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the equilateral triangular prism are investigated in terms of modified magnon Green's functions. In one dimension, the so-called infrared divergence prevents us from calculating any -- whether static or dynamic -- structure factor within the conventional spin-wave theory even at zero temperature. The well-known modified spin-wave theory initiated by Takahashi completely fails to treat anharmonicities to cause transverse-to-longitudinal coupling which are quite characteristic of noncollinear antiferromagnets. We propose imposing a double-constraint condition on spin waves to solve all these difficulties and get a full view of the nonlinear spin-wave dynamics in one-dimensional frustrated noncollinear antiferromagnets. We reveal a novel instability of the single-particle spectrum in the absence of any well-defined magnetically ordered ground state.

Title: In-situ SHG microscopy investigation of the domain-wall-conductivity enhancement procedure in lithium niobate
Authors: Iuliia Kiseleva, Boris Koppitz, Elke Beyreuther, Matthias Roeper, Samuel D. Seddon, Lukas M. Eng
Abstract: Conductive domain walls (CDWs) in the uniaxial ferroelectric lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) have attracted a lot of interest as potential elements in 2D nanoelectronics, due to their orders-of-magnitude larger electronic AC and DC conductivities as compared to the host material. On the way towards generating standardized CDWs into z-cut bulk LN crystals with controllable geometry and electrical properties, we have encountered setbacks recently: Although the first preparation step, i.e., the established UV-light-assisted liquid-electrode poling, reliably creates fully penetrating hexagonal domains with the DWs being aligned almost parallel to the polarization axis, the second step in the DW 'conductivity-enhancement' process through post-growth voltage ramping, resulted in randomly-shaped DWs as reflected in their different current-voltage (I-V) characteristics even after having applied the same process parameters. To clarify this phenomenon, we present here an \textit{in-situ} and time-resolved second-harmonic-generation (SHG) microscopy investigation of DW samples of different sizes, monitoring the DW evolution during that critical voltage ramping, which allowed us to reconstruct the 3D DW shapes both prior to and after the enhancement process. As a result, we are able to map the temporal changes of the local DW inclination angle $\alpha$, and to quantify the DW velocity. As a consequence, we need to re-assess and re-think the origin of the DW conductivity (DWC) in LN: The hitherto assumed simple connection between $\alpha$ and the DWC can not be generalized, since point defects accumulating along DWs act as extra sources for charge carrier trapping/release, significantly contributing to the DW current.

Title: Mass-transport-limited reaction rates and molecular diffusion in the van der Waals gap beneath graphene
Authors: Hossein Mirdamadi, Jiří David, Rui Wang, Tianle Jiang, Yanming Wang, Karel Vařeka, Michal Dymáček, Petr Bábor, Tomáš Šikola, Miroslav Kolíbal
Abstract: The confinement of molecules within the van der Waals (vdW) gap between a two-dimensional 2D material and a catalytic substrate offers a promising route toward the development of molecule-selective catalysts with increased reaction rates. However, identifying the kinetic limitations of such confined reactions remains challenging. Here, we employ an inverted wedding-cake configuration of multilayer graphene on platinum to study the dynamics of graphene etching in the vdW gap by various molecules (O2, H2, and CO), using in situ scanning electron microscopy. Under the experimental conditions explored (up to p = 1.4x10-3 Pa and T = 1000 °C), the etching reaction rates are limited by mass transport within the confined space. This limitation persists even for CO, despite its anomalously enhanced transport resulting from a significant lifting of the vdW gap. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations further reveal multiple etching pathways for CO, enabled by confinement within the vdW space. Once mass-transport limitations are overcome, the vdW gap acts as an effective nanoreactor, facilitating reaction pathways that would be otherwise inaccessible on a pristine surface without spatial confinement.

Title: Vestigial Order Melting of a Chiral Atomic Superfluid in a Double-Valley Optical Lattice
Authors: Zhongcheng Yu, Chengyang Wu, Chi Zhang, Xiaopeng Li, Xiaoji Zhou
Abstract: Quantum simulations of vestigial orders in multi-orbital superfluids have been attracting continuous research interests in both cold atoms and condensed matter systems, as it provides valuable insights into the high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we experimentally investigate thermal phase transitions in a Floquet-engineered double-valley bandstructure realized with ultracold bosonic atoms in a shaken optical lattice. The system exhibits both U(1) and time-reversal $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and in the ground state, it forms a chiral superfluid with the Bose-Einstein condensation at a single this http URL tuning the temperature, we observe a vestigial order melting of the chiral superfluid: first into a paramagnetic superfluid, and then into a normal phase. We measure the superfluid and Ising transition temperatures across a range of driving frequencies, and find that the critical temperature of the superfluid transition is always higher than that of Ising transition within the studied frequency range. As the frequency approaches the resonance, the Ising transition temperature decreases, while the superfluid transition temperature remains almost unaffected. The two phase transitions merge into a single transition at far detuning. Our experimental results imply rich quantum many-body physics as an interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations in periodically driven quantum systems.

Title: Pseudogap in a crystalline insulator doped by disordered metals
Authors: Sae Hee Ryu, Minjae Huh, Do Yun Park, Chris Jozwiak, Eli Rotenberg, Aaron Bostwick, Keun Su Kim
Abstract: A key to understand how electrons behave in crystalline solids is the band structure that connects the energy of electron waves to their wavenumber (k). Even in the phase of matter with only short-range order (liquid or amorphous solid), the coherent part of electron waves still possesses a band structure. Theoretical models for the band structure of liquid metals were formulated more than 5 decades ago, but thus far, bandstructure renormalization and pseudogap induced by resonance scattering have remained unobserved. Here, we report the observation of this unusual band structure at the interface of a crystalline insulator (black phosphorus) and disordered dopants (alkali metals). We find that a conventional parabolic band structure of free electrons bends back towards zero k with the pseudogap of 30-240 meV from the Fermi level. This is k renormalization caused by resonance scattering that leads to the formation of quasi-bound states in the scattering potential of alkali-metal ions. The depth of this potential tuned by different kinds of alkali metal (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) allows to classify the pseudogap of p-wave and d-wave resonance. Our results may provide a clue to the puzzling spectrum of various crystalline insulators doped by disordered dopants, such as the waterfall dispersion in cuprates.

Title: Electronic rotons and Wigner crystallites in a two-dimensional dipole liquid
Authors: Soobin Park, Minjae Huh, Chris Jozwiak, Eli Rotenberg, Aaron Bostwick, Keun Su Kim
Abstract: A key concept proposed by Landau to explain superfluid liquid helium is the elementary excitation of quantum particles called rotons. The irregular arrangement of atoms in a liquid forms the aperiodic dispersion of rotons that played a pivotal role in understanding fractional quantum Hall liquid (magneto-rotons) and the supersolidity of Bose-Einstein condensates. Even for a two-dimensional electron or dipole liquid in the absence of a magnetic field, their repulsive interactions were predicted to form a roton minimum that can be used to trace the transition to Wigner crystals and superconductivity, but it has not been observed. Here, we report the observation of such electronic rotons in a two-dimensional dipole liquid of alkali-metal ions doping charges to surface layers of black phosphorus. Our data reveal a striking aperiodic dispersion of rotons characterized by a local minimum of energy at a finite momentum. As the density of dipoles decreases, where interactions dominate over kinetic energy, the roton gap reduces to 0 as in crystals, signalling Wigner crystallisation. Our model shows the importance of short-range order arising from repulsion between dipoles, which can be viewed as the formation of Wigner crystallites (bubbles or stripes) floating in the sea of Fermi liquids. Our results reveal that the primary origin of electronic rotons (and the pseudogap) is strong correlations.

Title: Dark states of electrons in a quantum system with two pairs of sublattices

Abstract: A quantum state of matter that is forbidden to interact with photons and is therefore undetectable by spectroscopic means is called a dark state. This basic concept can be applied to condensed matter where it suggests that a whole band of quantum states could be undetectable across a full Brillouin zone. Here we report the discovery of such condensed matter dark states in palladium diselenide as a model system that has two pairs of sublattices in the primitive cell. By using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find valence bands that are practically unobservable over the whole Brillouin zone at any photon energy, polarisation, and scattering plane. Our model shows that two pairs of sublattices located at half-translation positions and related by multiple glide-mirror symmetries make their relative quantum phases polarised into only four kinds, three of which become dark due to double destructive interference. This mechanism is generic to other systems with two pairs of sublattices, and we show how the phenomena observed in cuprates, lead-halide perovskites, and density wave systems can be resolved by the mechanism of dark states. Our results suggest that the sublattice degree of freedom, which has been overlooked so far, should be considered in the study of correlated phenomena and optoelectronic characteristics.

Title: Phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry breaking in the renormalized Ginzburg-Landau theory
Authors: Feulefack Ornela Claire, Tsague Fotio Carlos, Keumo Tsiaze Roger Magloire
Abstract: In this study, we present theoretical investigations of phase transitions and critical phenomena in materials through the lens of second-order Ginzburg-Landau theory, in conjunction with considerations of symmetry groups and thermal fluctuations. By addressing the residual effects after a renormalization process, a small number of macroscopic degrees of freedom can effectively replace the infinite number of microscopic degrees of freedom, emphasizing the significant role of dimensionality and the intrinsic characteristics of the system in understanding and analyzing transitions. We highlight several non-universal characteristics of continuous phase transitions near the transition temperature, including the non-monotonic relationship between the critical temperature and dimensionality, as well as the enhancement or disappearance of the specific heat jump in complex superconductors. While the resulting expressions for thermodynamic quantities are complex for one-dimensional systems, obeying Mermin-Wagner's theorem, they are considerably simplified for two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems.

Title: Evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity in a bilayer $t$-$J$ model
Authors: Yuan Yang, Xin Lu, Yuan Wan, Wei-Qiang Chen, Shou-Shu Gong
Abstract: Motivated by the bilayer cuprate superconductors and nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity based on a bilayer two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_{\bot}$ model, where $t$ is the in-plane electron hopping, $J$ is the in-plane spin interaction, and $J_{\bot}$ is the inter-plane spin interaction. By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $\delta = 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.

Abstract: Multiferroics exhibit significant potential for low-power spintronic devices due to magnetoelectric coupling. Here, we discuss an emerging class of altermagnetic multiferroics, a system demonstrating distinct advantages including zero net magnetization (eliminating stray fields), momentum-dependent spin splitting (enabling electric-field control of spin currents), and intrinsic strong magnetoelectric coupling originating from spin-space symmetry.

Title: Strain-Stabilized Interfacial Polarization Tunes Work Function Over 1 eV in RuO2/TiO2 Heterostructures
Authors: Seung Gyo Jeong, Bonnie Y.X. Lin, Mengru Jin, In Hyeok Choi, Seungjun Lee, Zhifei Yang, Sreejith Nair, Rashmi Choudhary, Juhi Parikh, Anand Santhosh, Matthew Neurock, Kelsey A. Stoerzinger, Jong Seok Lee, Tony Low, Qing Tu, James M. LeBeau, Bharat Jalan
Abstract: Interfacial polarization-charge accumulation at the heterointerface-is a well-established tool in semiconductors, but its influence in metals remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that interfacial polarization can robustly modulate surface work function in metallic rutile RuO2 layers in epitaxial RuO2/TiO2 heterostructures grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. Using multislice electron ptychography, we directly visualize polar displacements of transition metal ions relative to oxygen octahedra near the interface, despite the conductive nature of RuO2. This interfacial polarization enables over 1 eV modulation of the RuO2 work function, controlled by small thickness variation (2-4 nm) as measured by Kelvin probe probe microscopy, with a critical thickness of 4 nm - corresponding to the transition from fully strained to relaxed film. These results establish interfacial polarization as a powerful route to control electronic properties in metals and have implications for designing tunable electronic, catalytic, and quantum devices through interfacial control in polar metallic systems.

Title: Nodeless superconductivity in 4H$_{b}$-TaS$_{2}$ with broken time reversal symmetry
Authors: Yuwei Zhou, Fanyu Meng, Yanen Huang, Jiawen Zhang, Jin Zhan, Ye Chen, Yu Liu, Hechang Lei, Michael Smidman, Huiqiu Yuan
Abstract: The transition metal dichalcogenide 4H$_{b}$-TaS$_{2}$ exhibits characteristics of topological edge modes and two-component superconductivity with time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). The nature of the superconducting order parameter is a crucial issue that requires experimental investigation. Here, we report measurements of the magnetic penetration depth using a tunnel-diode-oscillator based technique, as well as the specific heat. Both the specific heat and the change in magnetic penetration depth ($\Delta$$\lambda$(T)) display an exponentially-activated temperature dependence, providing evidence for nodeless superconductivity in 4H$_{b}$-TaS$_{2}$. Moreover, the deduced superfluid density can be well described by a two-gap $s$-wave model, and such multigap superconductivity is consistent with there being multiple bands crossing the Fermi energy. These results constrain the possible pairing symmetries of 4H$_{b}$-TaS$_{2}$.

Title: Master equations for continuous-time random walks with stochastic resetting
Authors: Fausto Colantoni, Gianni Pagnini
Abstract: We study a general continuous-time random walk (CTRW), by including non-Markovian cases and Lévy flights, under complete stochastic resetting to the initial position with an arbitrary law, which can be power-lawed as well as Poissonian. We provide three linked results. First, we show that the random walk under stochastic resetting is a CTRW with the same jump-size distribution of the non-reset original CTRW but different counting process. Later, we derive the condition for a CTRW with stochastic resetting to be a meaningful displacement process at large elapsed times, i.e., the probability to jump to any site is higher than the probability to be reset to the initial position, and we call this condition the zero-law for stochastic resetting. This law joins with the other two laws for reset random walks concerning the existence and the non-existence of a non-equilibrium stationary state. Finally, we derive master equations for CTRWs when the resetting law is a completely monotone function.

Title: The equilibrium distribution function for strongly nonlinear systems
Authors: Jialin Zhang, Yong Zhang, Hong Zhao
Abstract: The equilibrium distribution function determines macroscopic observables in statistical physics. While conventional methods correct equilibrium distributions in weakly nonlinear or near-integrable systems, they fail in strongly nonlinear regimes. We develop a framework to get the equilibrium distributions and dispersion relations in strongly nonlinear many-body systems, incorporating corrections beyond the random phase approximation and capturing intrinsic nonlinear effects. The theory is verified on the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak model, and the FPUT-beta model, demonstrating its accuracy across distinct types of nonlinear systems. Numerical results show substantial improvements over existing approaches, even in strong nonlinear regimes. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for equilibrium statistical properties in strongly nonlinear systems.

Title: Emergent QED$_3$ at the bosonic Laughlin state to superfluid transition
Authors: Taige Wang, Xue-Yang Song, Michael P. Zaletel, T. Senthil
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions between topologically ordered and symmetry-broken phases lie beyond Landau theory. A prime example is the conjectured continuous transition from the bosonic $\nu = 1/2$ Laughlin state to a superfluid, proposed to be governed by a QED$_3$--Chern--Simons (CS) critical point whose stability remains uncertain. We study half-filled bosons in the lowest Landau level subject to a lattice potential. Infinite-cylinder DMRG reveals a single continuous Laughlin--to--superfluid transition. Adiabatic flux insertion collapses the many-body gap and exposes massless Dirac quasiparticles, while momentum-resolved correlation lengths show that three lattice-related density modes share the same critical exponent, evidencing an emergent $SO(3)$ symmetry. The joint appearance of Dirac dispersion and symmetry enlargement provides microscopic support for a stable QED$_3$--CS fixed point. Our numerical strategy also offers a blueprint for exploring Landau-forbidden transitions in fractional Chern insulators and composite Fermi liquids realised in moire and cold-atom systems.

Title: First-principles analysis of the effect of magnetic states on the oxygen vacancy formation energy in doped La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$ perovskite
Authors: Wei Wei, Florian Fuchs, Andreas Zienert, Xiao Hu, Jörg Schuster
Abstract: Oxygen vacancies are critical for determining the electrochemical performance of fast oxygen ion conductors. The perovskite La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$, known for its excellent mixed ionic-electronic conduction, has attracted significant attention due to its favorable vacancy characteristics. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate the impact of 3$d$ transition-metal doping on the oxygen vacancy formation energies in the perovskite. Two magnetic states, namely the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states, are considered in our models to capture the influence of magnetic effects on oxygen vacancy energetics. Our results reveal that the oxygen vacancy formation energies are strongly dependent on both the dopant species and the magnetic state. Notably, the magnetic states alter the vacancy formation energy in a dopant-specific manner due to double exchange interactions, indicating that relying solely on the ferromagnetic ground state may result in misleading trends in doping behavior. These findings emphasise the importance of accounting for magnetic effects when investigating oxygen vacancy properties in perovskite oxides.

Title: Strain-tunable type-II to type-III & Gimbal nodal line transition in Imm2-phase of Cu$_2$SnS$_3$: An ab-initio study
Authors: Prakash Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: Topological nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) represent an intriguing quantum phase, opening new avenues in materials science for practical applications such as anisotropic transport devices, high-mobility conductors, unconventional thermoelectrics, and nonlinear optical devices. Recently, Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ has been theoretically proposed as a type-II NLSM, with its Fermi surface containing only one nodal ring. Here, we demonstrate how uniaxial, equi-biaxial, and equi-triaxial strains affect the nodal line state of the $Imm2$-phase of Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ by using state-of-the-art ab-initio calculations. Under the application of uniaxial compressive strain (UCS) along the a-direction, the plane of the nodal line evolves from the $k_x$-$k_z$ to $k_y$-$k_z$ for 6\%$\leq$UCS$\leq$8\%. In contrast, under uniaxial tensile strain (UTS), the nodal line remains in the ($k_x$-$k_z$) plane across the entire studied range of UTS. Interestingly, on the application of equi-biaxial tensile strain (EBTS) along a-b (a-c) directions, it hosts only one nodal ring below 8\% ($<$6\%), which further evolves into three (seven) nodal-ring for EBTS of 8\% (6\%$\leq$EBTS$\leq$8\%). Upon the application of EBTS along a-c directions, we found two sets of three mutually orthogonal, intersecting nodal loops (topological gimbals). Apart from this, under the application of equi-biaxial compressive strain (EBCS) along the a-b (a-c) directions, it exhibits only one nodal ring up to 8\% (7\%). Beyond this, the nodal line completely vanishes and does not reappear at higher values of EBCS. Under equi-triaxial tensile strain (ETTS), Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ exhibits only one nodal-ring $<$6\%, which subsequently transforms into five nodal-ring for 6\%$\leq$ETTS$\leq$8\%. However, under the application of equi-triaxial compressive strain (ETCS), as in EBCS, only one nodal line exists up to 6\% ETCS.

Title: Resilient cluster Mott states in layered Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ against pressure-induced symmetry breaking
Authors: Hongbin Qu, Xiaoqun Wang, Hai-Qing Li, ang Gang Li
Abstract: In this work, by combining density-functional theory (DFT) with dynamical mean-field calculations (DMFT), we compare the crystal and electronic structures of the prototype cluster Mott insulator Nb$_{3}$Cl$_8$ at ambient and high-pressure. We explain the finite but significantly reduced charge gap experimentally observed at $P=9.7$ GPa. We reveal a local symmetry breaking of the Nb$_{3}$ trimer under pressure, reducing its symmetry from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{s}$. This leads to a strong bandwidth enhancement and a lift of band degeneracy. Crucially, despite the significant change of band details, the cluster Mott insulating state is robust against local symmetry breaking. We show that the experimental observed gap under pressure is still a cluster Mott gap and its reduced value stems from both increased bandwidth and reduced Coulomb interactions under pressure. Our study provides the first systematic theoretical elucidation of how pressure-induced symmetry breaking dictates the cluster Mott state, establishing a robust foundation for understanding the intricate relationship between symmetry, local/non-local correlations, and emergent quantum states in correlated cluster compounds.

Title: Geometry-Dependent Adhesion in Transparent, Monodomain Liquid Crystal Elastomers
Authors: Aidan Street, Devesh Mistry, Johan Mattsson, Helen F. Gleeson
Abstract: Elastomeric pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) form adhesive bonds under light pressure. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are exciting PSA candidates as they can impart both anisotropy and temperature-dependence to adhesion, but the full potential of their anisotropic adhesion is unexplored. Here, identical side-chain LCEs, produced as transparent isotropic or nematic films are investigated; the latter aligned in homeotropic or planar geometries. Their room-temperature adhesion, determined through a 90-degree peel test, is consistent with theoretical predictions and strongest in a planar geometry (peeled parallel to the director) with adhesive force per unit length of 0.67 Nmm-1. In contrast, adhesion of the planar perpendicular, isotropic and homeotropic films is 62.5%, 38.5% and 23.0% lower, respectively. The surface contribution to adhesion is identical for all films, confirming that the variation in adhesion is determined solely by the bulk LCE alignment controlled during film preparation. A temperature-dependent adhesion factor is determined from 0 Celsius to 80 Celsius using dynamic mechanical analysis, and found to be in excellent agreement with the peel data at room temperature. Molecular relaxations active above the glass transition temperature are dominant in determining LCE adhesion. The results show that side-chain LCEs can function as transparent, tunable, broad-temperature smart PSAs

Title: Summing Real Time Feynman Paths of Lattice Polaron with Matrix Product States
Authors: Qi Gao, Yuan Wan
Abstract: We study numerically the real time dynamics of lattice polarons by combining the Feynman path integral and the matrix product state (MPS) approach. By constructing and solving a flow equation, we show that the integrand, viewed as a multivariable function of polaron world line parameters, can be compressed as a low bond dimension MPS, thereby allowing for efficient evaluation of various dynamical observables. We establish the effectiveness of our method by benchmarking the calculated polaron spectral function in one dimension against available results. We further demonstrate its potential by presenting the polaron spectral function in two dimensions and simulating polaron diffusion in both one and two dimensions.

Title: Pressure induced ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition in transition metal chalcogenide Cr$_{3}$Te$_4$
Authors: Asish Kumar Mishra, Souvick Chakraborty, Bidisha Mukherjee, Mrinmay Sahu, Suvashree Mukherjee, Shubham Purwar, Harekrishna Bhunia, S. Thirupathaiah, Peter Liermann, Satyabrata Raj, Goutam Dev Mukherjee
Abstract: We have carried out a detailed high-pressure investigation on the strongly correlated transition metal chalcogenide $Cr_{3}Te_4$ using Raman spectroscopy and XRD, which is ferromagnetic and metallic at ambient conditions. We find that the monoclinic structure remains stable up to 30 GPa, the highest pressure studied. The Cr-Te bond length and octahedral volume decrease drastically up to 7.6 GPa pressure. The $A_{1g}$ Raman mode shows a red shift up to 7.6 GPa, and the $E_g$ Raman mode shows a sudden drop around the same pressure. Further low-temperature Raman spectroscopic investigation shows that the Raman modes soften at the ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition. This suggests a change in the magnetic ordering at high pressure. Our Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations reveal the change in magnetic ground state from ferromagnetic state to antiferromagnetic state above 7.6 GPa pressure, corroborating our experimental result.

Authors: Taras Bryk, Giancarlo Ruocco, Jean-François Wax, Noël Jakse
Abstract: Collective longitudinal and transverse propagating modes in molten Carbon at $T=5500$~K and pressure range $10$-$40$ GPa are reported from {\it ab initio} based as well as machine learned molecular dynamics. A striking exotic feature in collective dynamics is the two-peak shape of the current spectral functions of the single-component liquid, which makes evidence of a second branch of longitudinal propagating modes in the wave number range $k>1$Å$^{-1}$. It is shown that time correlation functions reflecting the out-of-phase motion of particles and their cages of nearest neighbors results in the same frequencies of the exotic low-frequency branch of vibrations. A theoretical framework of generalized collective modes is applied to recover the time dependence of density-density, imaginary part of susceptibility and longitudinal current-current correlations.

Title: A comprehensive study of bond bipolaron superconductivity in triangular lattice
Authors: Chao Zhang
Abstract: We employ the diagrammatic Monte Carlo method with a lattice path-integral formulation for both electron and phonon degrees of freedom to investigate the formation and properties of bond polarons and bipolarons on a two-dimensional triangular lattice. In the adiabatic regime ($\omega/t < 1.0$), single polarons remain light with a small effective mass, while bipolarons remain compact and lightweight, resulting in a high superfluid transition temperature $T_c$. We systematically study the dependence of $T_c$ on electron-phonon coupling strength and on-site interaction in the bond bipolaron model. Our results show that a moderate on-site repulsion enhances $T_c$ by stabilizing compact yet lightweight bipolarons, leading to high-$T_c$ superconductivity in the dilute limit. Notably, the triangular lattice sustains relatively high $T_c$ across a wide range of phonon frequencies, outperforming square lattice geometry. This enhancement arises from the higher coordination number and the bond-centered nature of the electron-phonon coupling. These findings suggest that triangular lattice geometry offers a promising platform for realizing high-$T_c$ bipolaronic superconductivity.

Title: Universal Spin Models are Universal Approximators in Machine Learning
Authors: Tobias Reinhart, Gemma De les Coves
Abstract: One of the theoretical pillars that sustain certain machine learning models are universal approximation theorems, which prove that they can approximate all functions from a function class to arbitrary precision. Independently, classical spin models are termed universal if they can reproduce the behavior of any other spin model in their low energy sector. Universal spin models have been characterized via sufficient and necessary conditions, showing that simple models such as the 2d Ising with fields are universal. In this work, we prove that universal spin models are universal approximators of probability distributions. As a consequence, the characterization of the former gives rise to universal approximation theorems for the latter. This allows us to derive new proofs of universal approximation theorems for restricted and deep Boltzmann machines, as well as deep belief networks. This work illustrates that independently discovered universality statements may be intimately related, enabling the transfer of results.

Title: Extracting Nonlinear Dynamical Response Functions from Time Evolution
Authors: Atsushi Ono
Abstract: We develop a general framework based on the functional derivative to extract nonlinear dynamical response functions from the temporal evolution of physical quantities, without explicitly computing multipoint correlation functions. We validate our approach by calculating the second- and third-order optical responses in the Rice-Mele model and further apply it to a many-body interacting system using a tensor network method. This framework is broadly applicable to any method that can compute real-time dynamics, offering a powerful and versatile tool for investigating nonlinear responses in dynamical systems.

Title: Temporal modulation of second harmonic generation in ferroelectrics by a pulsed electric field
Authors: Atsushi Ono
Abstract: We revisit the relationship between electric polarization modulation $\Delta P$ in ferroelectrics induced by a low-frequency pulsed electric field and the corresponding second harmonic intensity modulation $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Using nonlinear response theory, we derive their time-domain expressions linear in the pulse amplitude, revealing that not only the electric field but also its time derivative contributes to $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Furthermore, even when the time-derivative component is negligible, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can be in antiphase with the pulsed field and thus with $\Delta P$. These theoretical predictions are further supported by real-time simulations of a model for electronic ferroelectrics. Our results demonstrate that the commonly assumed relation $\Delta P \propto \Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can break down under certain conditions, reflecting the complex-valued and frequency-dependent nature of nonlinear dynamical susceptibilities.

Title: Quench spectroscopy for Lieb-Liniger bosons in the presence of harmonic trap
Authors: Jiachen Yu, Yuanzhe Hu, Wenhan Chen, Jianing Yang, Xuzong Chen, Hepeng Yao
Abstract: Quench spectroscopy has emerged as a novel and powerful technique for probing the energy spectrum of various quantum phases for quantum systems from out-of-equilibrium dynamics. While its efficacy has been demonstrated in the homogeneous systems theoretically, most experimental setups feature a confining potential, such as a harmonic trap, which complicates the practical implementations. In this work, we experimentally probe the quench spectroscopy for one-dimensional bosons in optical lattices with the presence of a harmonic trap, and comparing our results with the density matrix renormalization group simulation. For the Mott insulator phase, although a gap is still observed, the band signal is broadened along the frequency space and cut at the half Brillouin zone, which can be explained by the excitations under harmonic confinement. Comparing with the superfluid spectrum, we can see a clear distinction between the two phases and find the inverse quench with larger amplitude yields the clearest spectrum. Our work offers pivotal insights into conducting quench spectroscopy effectively in practical systems.

Title: Crossing over from flat band superconductivity to conventional superconductivity
Authors: M. Thumin, G. Bouzerar
Abstract: Over the past ten years, flat band (FB) or geometric superconductivity has become a major issue in condensed matter physics due to the significant technological benefits it could offer. Observations of this unconventional form of superconductivity are unfortunately still very limited, and significant efforts are being made to search for candidate materials. Most existing theoretical studies focus on systems with strictly non-dispersive bands, which, from an experimental point of view, represents an extremely difficult technological constraint to achieve. It is therefore crucial to understand to what extent this constraint can be relaxed. In other words, to what extent can superconductivity in flat bands survive weak perturbations? The main objective of the present study is precisely to answer this essential question in detail.

Title: Superlubricity of Borophene: Tribological Properties in Comparison to hBN
Authors: Antoine Hinaut, B. Sena Tömekçe, Shuyu Huang, Yiming Song, Ernst Meyer, Antonio Cammarata, Willi Auwärter, Thilo Glatzel
Abstract: The tribological performance of 2D materials makes them good candidates toward a reduction of friction at the macroscale. Superlubricity has been observed for graphene, MoS\textsubscript{2} and MXenes and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is used to reduce or tune friction, but other materials are investigated as potential candidates for low-lubricity applications. Specifically, borophene is predicted to have ultra-low friction. Here, we experimentally investigate frictional properties of borophene and use a borophene-hBN lateral heterostructure to directly compare the tribological properties of the two complementary 2D materials. In particular, we investigate the friction between a sliding tip and (i) the weakly corrugated $\mathcal{X}_6$-borophene layer on Ir(111) or (ii) the hBN/Ir(111) superlattice structures with a strongly corrugated moiré reconstruction. Our experimental study performed in ultra-high vacuum at room temperature combined with a Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model calculation confirms the superlubricity predicted for borophene, while hBN, which exhibits a higher friction, is nevertheless confirmed as a low friction material. Ab initio calculations show that the lower friction of $\mathcal{X}_6$-borophene with respect to hBN can be rationalized by weaker tip/surface interactions. In addition, we assess structural and electrical properties of borophene and hBN by using scanning probe techniques and compare their dissipation under the oscillating tip to investigate the possible path of energy dissipation occurring during friction. Our study demonstrates the low frictional properties of borophene and the potential of lateral heterostructure investigations to directly compare the properties of these 2D materials.

Title: In situ impedance spectroscopy tests of Li$_{4-x}$Ge$_{1-x}$P$_x$O$_4$ as potential solid state electrolyte for Micro Li ion Batteries
Authors: Mohammadhossein Montazerian, Kyle J. Stephens, Vladimir Roddatis, Christof Vockenhuber, Arnold Müller, Anders J. Barlow, Thomas Lippert, Nick A. Shepelin, Daniele Pergolesi
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries employing solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are emerging as a safer and more compact alternative to conventional batteries using liquid electrolytes, especially for miniaturized energy storage systems. However, the industry-standard SSE, LiPON, imposes limitations due to its incompatibility with high-temperature processing. In this study, we investigate Li$_{4-x}$Ge$_{1-x}$P$_x$O$_4$ (LGPO), a LISICON-type oxide, as a promising alternative thin-film SSE. LGPO thin films are fabricated using pulsed laser deposition under four distinct deposition conditions, with in situ impedance spectroscopy enabling precise conductivity measurements without ambient exposure. We systematically correlate deposition temperature, background pressure, chemical composition, crystallinity, and morphology with ionic transport properties. Polycrystalline LGPO films grown at high temperature (535 $^\circ$C) and low oxygen pressure (0.01 mbar) exhibited the highest room-temperature ionic conductivity ($\sim 1.2 \times 10^{-5}$ S cm$^{-1}$), exceeding that of LiPON by an order of magnitude, with an activation energy of 0.46 eV. In contrast, amorphous films show significantly lower conductivity ($\sim 5.2 \times 10^{-8}$ S cm$^{-1}$) and higher activation energy (0.72 eV). The results reveal that crystallinity, chemical composition, and grain boundary density critically affect ion transport, highlighting the importance of microstructural control. This work establishes LGPO as a viable, high-performance oxide SSE compatible with high-temperature processing for next-generation microbattery architectures.

Title: Muonium as a probe of point defects in type-Ib diamond
Authors: K. Yokoyama, J.S. Lord, H. Abe, T. Ohshima
Abstract: Muonium (Mu), a bound state of a positively charged muon and an electron, can diffuse through crystal lattices and interact with defect centers in insulators and semiconductors. We demonstrate that this Mu's diffusive property can be used to probe defects in a diamond crystal lattice; specifically, substitutional nitrogen atoms (N$_\text{s}^0$) and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in type-Ib diamond. Upon interaction with these defects, Mu can exchange its electron's spin or change its charge state, which result in muon spin relaxation. However, muons in diamond (and semiconductors in general) can be in a few distinctive muonium states, with each state contributing to the muon signal. In addition, these states can undergo site and charge exchange interaction, forming a dynamic network. Hence, to study the Mu interaction with point defects, the muon data have to be deconvoluted to isolate signals from the diffusing species. To achieve this goal, we have modeled the Mu state exchange dynamics and numerically simulated the time evolution of muon spin polarization by the density matrix method. With a global curve fit to a set of longitudinal field scan data, one can extract the Mu transition rates that involve interaction with the defect centers. The diffusing tetrahedral interstitial Mu was found to interact with the paramagnetic N$_\text{s}^0$ center via electron spin exchange. In contrast, they are converted to form a diamagnetic center upon interaction with the negatively charged NV center.

Title: A Semi-Empirical Descriptor for Open Circuit Voltage
Authors: Sourav Baiju, Mark Huijben, Payam Kaghazhi
Abstract: Layered transition metal oxides (TMO) are widely used as cathode materials in Na/Li batteries. The open-circuit voltage (OCV), which determines the energy density (together with capacity), is among the key physical and chemical factors influencing the performance of cathodes. The shape of the voltage profile is also influenced by the formation energy of intermediate phases during cycling. From a theoretical perspective, the formation energy (and voltage) are defined as internal energy differences between phases. Therefore, an accurate prediction of internal energy is crucial for the calculation of OCV. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that decomposes the internal energy of a given TMO into distinct contributions with clear physical significance. Specifically, we break down the energy into parameters that can be more easily calculated (compared to DFT) and obtained from experimental databases. From these parameters, we define a potential term that can be calculated for different compositions, and can be used for calculation of voltage profile

Title: Energy Efficient p-Circuits for Generative Neural Networks
Authors: Lakshmi A. Ghantasala, Ming-Che Li, Risi Jaiswal, Archisman Ghosh, Behtash Behin-Aein, Joseph Makin, Shreyas Sen, Supriyo Datta
Abstract: A p-circuit comprising a network of $N$ p-bits can generate samples from a probability distribution with $2^N$ possibilities just like a network of q-bits, though there are interesting fundamental differences. A p-bit is essentially a binary stochastic neuron used in Boltzmann machines which involve the repeated application of a specific elementary operation, whereby each p-bit looks at the state of 'n' other p-bits, computes the probability for being $0$ or $1$, and chooses its next state accordingly. We argue that the energy cost, $\epsilon(n)$, of this elementary operation is an important metric and we use our ASIC to extract it for our implementation, to serve as model and benchmark for other implementations. We further argue that the same elementary operation can be used in generative AI replacing the standard continuous or multi-bit digital neurons with p-bits. It might appear that this would introduce significant errors, but we show that by averaging a small number (say $1 \ to \ 100$) samples, the image quality can be restored.

Title: Temporal and spatial separations between spin glass and short-range order
Authors: Margarita G. Dronova, Feng Ye, Zachary J. Morgan, Yishu Wang, Yejun Feng
Abstract: Broken-symmetry-induced order parameters account for many phenomena in condensed matter physics. For spin glasses, such a framework dictates its theoretical construction, whereas experiments have only established dynamical behaviors such as frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility and aging but not the thermodynamic phase. Experimental techniques have limitations when the spin glass is probed as an isolated state. To resolve this conundrum, we create an evolution from long-range order using a well-controlled tuning of the disorder on a spinel's sublattice. Cross-referencing a series of specimens at both long (milliseconds to seconds) and short (picosecond) time scales illustrates the relationship between spin glass and long- and short-range orders. The dynamics of short- and long-range order formations are not affected by disorder, as revealed by neutron magnetic diffuse scattering, however the ranges of these orderings are changed by the introduced disorder. Across all specimens, the inflection point of the correlation length's temperature dependence fully matches with the peak in heat capacity, while spin glass can freeze either below or well above this characteristic temperature of spin order formation. Our results identify an uncorrelated coexistence of the two and attribute components of the spin glass to individual spins at domain walls between spin clusters.

Title: Reversible local strain engineering of $\mathrm{WS}_2$ using a micro-mechanical spring
Authors: Eric Herrmann, Zhixiang Huang, Sai Rahul Sitaram, Ke Ma, S M Jahadun Nobi, Xi Wang
Abstract: Local strain engineering is a promising technique to tune the properties of two-dimensional materials at the nanoscale. However, many existing methods are static and limit the systematic exploration of strain-dependent material behavior. Here, we demonstrate dynamic and reversible control of local strain distributions in suspended trilayer tungsten disulfide ($\mathrm{WS}_2$) via nanoindentation using a micro-mechanical spring patterned with nanoscale probes. Micro-photoluminescence measurements reveal that indentation using a ring-shaped probe induces a nearly uniform biaxial strain distribution accompanied by a reversible redshift of the neutral exciton peak, consistent with simulated strain magnitudes. We further show that the in-plane strain distribution is spatially programmable by engineering the probe geometry and present designs for inducing point-like, uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial strain distributions. The presented platform enables substrate-free, repeatable local strain engineering in suspended 2D materials and provides a versatile tool for streamlining the investigation of strain-dependent phenomena.

Title: Fundamental of CO2 Adsorption and Diffusion in Sub-nanoporous Materials: Application to CALF-20
Authors: André de Freitas Gonçalves, Emerson Parazzi Lyra, Sayali Ramdas Chavan, Philip Llewellyn, Luis Fernando Mercier Franco, Yann Magnin
Abstract: We propose a theoretical approach for predicting thermodynamics and kinetics of guest molecules in nanoporous materials. This statistical mechanical-based method requires a minimal set of physical parameters that may originate from experiments or numerical simulations. We applied it to CO2 molecules in the recently highlighted CALF-20 metal-organic framework for adsorption and molecular self-diffusion at different temperatures. All the physical parameters of the model are extracted from one CO$_2$ isotherm analyzed by the adsorption energy distribution method. The model is then used to approximate isotherms at different temperatures, Henry's constant, saturation density, as well as enthalpies of adsorption at infinite dilution. We then express molecular kinetics through the transition state theory allowing to predict molecular diffusion in part from the prior knowledge of thermodynamics, and further compared self-diffusion coefficients to one from molecular dynamics used as a numerical experiment. The approach proposed allows to express molecular adsorption and diffusion based on a fitting procedure allowing to get physical parameters with a view on thermodynamics and kinetics mechanisms at play in the system.

Title: Hyperuniformity at the Absorbing State Transition: Perturbative RG for Random Organization
Authors: Xiao Ma, Johannes Pausch, Gunnar Pruessner, Michael E. Cates
Abstract: Hyperuniformity, where the static structure factor obeys $S(q)\sim q^{\varsigma}$ with $\varsigma> 0$, emerges at criticality in systems having multiple, symmetry-unrelated, absorbing states. Important examples arise in periodically sheared suspensions and amorphous solids; these lie in the random organisation (RO) universality class, for which analytic results for $\varsigma$ are lacking. Here, using Doi-Peliti field theory and perturbative RG about a Gaussian model, we find $\varsigma = 0^+$ and $\varsigma= 2\epsilon/9 + O(\epsilon^2)$ in dimension $d>d_c=4$ and $d=4-\epsilon$ respectively. Our calculations assume that renormalizability is sustained via a certain pattern of cancellation of strongly divergent terms. These cancellations allow the upper critical dimension to remain $d_c = 4$, as is known for RO, while generic perturbations (e.g., those violating particle conservation) would typically flow to a fixed point with $d_c=6$. The assumed cancellation pattern is closely reminiscent of a long-established one near the tricritical Ising fixed point. (This has $d_c=3$, although generic perturbations flow towards the Wilson-Fisher fixed point with $d_c = 4$.) We show how hyperuniformity in RO emerges from anticorrelation of strongly fluctuating active and passive densities. Our calculations also yield the remaining exponents to order $\epsilon$, surprisingly without recourse to functional RG. These exponents coincide as expected with the Conserved Directed Percolation (C-DP) class which also contains the Manna Model and the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson (q-EW) model. Importantly however, our $\varsigma$ differs from one found via a mapping to q-EW. That mapping neglects a conserved noise in the RO action, which we argue to be dangerously irrelevant. Thus, although other exponents are common to both, the RO and C-DP universality classes have different exponents for hyperuniformity.

Title: Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order
Authors: Sanket Kumawat, Mohit Sharma, Ujjwal Kumar Nandi, Indrajit Tah, Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya
Abstract: A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs or medium range crystalline order (MRCO). In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse-graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale $L_{max}$ that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse-grained over $L_{max}$ exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in MRCO-free models like KALJ by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.

Title: The effect of fiber plasticity on domain formation in soft biological composites -- Part I: a bifurcation analysis
Authors: Michalis Agoras, Fernanda F. Fontenele, Nikolaos Bouklas
Abstract: The main objective of this work is to shed light on the effect of fiber plasticity on the macroscopic response and domain formation in soft biological composites. This goal is pursued by analyzing the plane-strain response of two-phase laminates. In the context of this problem, the effect of fiber plasticity is accounted for by allowing the elastically stiffer layers (``fiber'' phase) to also yield plastically and by taking the soft layers (``matrix'' phase) to be purely elastic solids. The analysis is carried out at finite elastic and plastic strains, but it is restricted to unidirectional, non-monotonic loading paths, applied by initially increasing the macroscopic stretch along the direction of the layers up to a prescribed maximum value and then decreasing the same stretch down to a minimum value. A simple expression is derived for the critical conditions at which the homogenized behavior of the laminate loses strong ellipticity for the first time along the loading path. The relevance of this result stems from the fact that the loss of macroscopic ellipticity of these composites is known to coincide with the onset of bifurcations of the long-wavelength type. It follows from this result that, just like hyperelastic laminates, elastoplastic laminates may lose macroscopic ellipticity whenever their incremental strength in shear perpendicular to the layers vanishes for the first time. For situations in which loss of macroscopic ellipticity does take place, a corresponding post-bifurcation solution for the homogenized behavior of the laminate is computed. The deformed state of the material described by this solution is characterized by twin lamellar domains that are formed at a length scale much larger than the width of the original, microscopic layers, but still much smaller than the overall dimensions of the macroscopic specimen under consideration.

Title: Modulation of PEDOT properties via cobalt ferrite nanoparticles: morphology, conjugation length, doping level, structure, and electrical conductivity
Authors: Gabriel Paciaroni, María Ana Castro, Carlos Acha, Paula Soledad Antonel
Abstract: Composite materials based on Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and CoFe$_2$O$_4$ magnetic nanoparticles (NP) were synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization with varying monomer and surfactant (DBSA) concentrations, and were compared to PEDOT samples synthesized without NP. Electrical conductivity measurements were performed, which revealed that the composites are more conductive than the pure PEDOT samples, with this effect depending on EDOT and DBSA contents. Characterizations by SEM and TEM microscopies, UV-Vis, FTIR and Raman spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction and dynamic light scattering were carried out in order to associate the morphology and structure of these materials to their electrical conductivity, and to explain how EDOT and DBSA concentrations, and also the presence of NP, affects those properties. It was found that the NP play a significant role in the polymerization of EDOT, influencing the formation and arrangement of polymer chains, as well as their conjugation length, oxidation state, and resonant structures. These effects are also dependent on the DBSA content. To describe the conductivity of the composites, a two-phase model based on general effective media theory was introduced. The analysis revealed that, at low reactant concentrations, the NP increase the conductivity of the adjacent PEDOT by over two orders of magnitude.

Title: Instability in Ostwald ripening processes
Authors: Michael Wilkinson
Abstract: There is a dimensionless parameter which enters into the equation for the evolution of supersaturation in Ostwald ripening processes. This parameter is typically a large number. Here it is argued that the consequent stiffness of the equation results in the evolution of the supersaturation being unstable. The instability is evident in numerical simulations of Ostwald ripening.

Title: Temperature Dependent Optical Response Of High- Tc Yba2cu3o7-δ (Ybco) Thin Films
Authors: Vivek Khichar, V. A. Chirayath, Jonathan Asaadi, Nader Hozhabri, Benjamin J. P. Jones, Ali R. Koymen, Iakovos Tzoka, Pratyanik Sau
Abstract: We report on the temperature-dependent optical response of thin films of YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} (YBCO) in the visible spectral range under cryogenic conditions. Specifically, we observe an increase in transmittance near the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), which saturates within a few kelvins below Tc. The increase in transmittance is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in reflectance as the temperature drops below Tc, and both quantities track the superconducting phase transition. Changes in transmittance are found to be wavelength dependent, with the maximum variation occurring at 633 nm and minimal at 450 nm. These observations establish a correlation between the variation in optical response and the superconducting phase transition, even in the visible regime. The results of our experiment highlight the potential for using non-contact optical measurements to determine Tc. The effect can be explained using the two-fluid model, which can account for the observed temperature and wavelength dependence of the transmittance of the superconducting thin films.

Title: Excess Observables Reveal Nonreciprocity in Integrated Covariance
Authors: Timur Aslyamov, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: Near equilibrium, the symmetric part of the time-integrated steady-state covariance, i.e., the time integral of correlation functions, is governed by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, while the antisymmetric part vanishes due to Onsager reciprocity. Far from equilibrium, where these principles no longer apply, we develop a unified formalism for both symmetric and antisymmetric components of integrated covariances. We derive exact, computationally tractable expressions for these quantities, valid in arbitrary nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes. Both components are expressed in terms of excess observables, a notion central to both statistical physics and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we establish thermodynamic upper bounds for these covariances in terms of entropy production, dynamical activity, and cycle affinities.

Title: Membrane-mediated force transduction: Stick-slip motion of vesicles with fluid membranes
Authors: Paula Magrinya, Arin Escobar Ortiz, Juan L. Aragones, Laura R. Arriaga
Abstract: How internal forces are transduced into motion through soft, fluid membranes remains a fundamental question in the study of active systems. To investigate this coupling, we develop a minimal system consisting of a single ferromagnetic particle encapsulated within a lipid vesicle with controlled membrane composition and phase behavior. An external rotating magnetic field actuates the particle, which rotates and translates along the inner membrane leaflet. This motion generates local slip in the membrane; near a substrate, the slip creates a shear gradient across the lubrication gap that propels the vesicle forward. Propulsion is intermittent and strongest when the particle moves near the vesicle bottom, where stress transmission is most effective. We find that the coupling between internal flows and vesicle motion is highly sensitive to membrane elasticity, excess area, and phase coexistence. Local membrane deformation and flow dissipate part of the stress, limiting the efficiency of force transduction. Additionally, membrane fluctuations and external boundaries reduce particle mobility, and in phase-separated membranes, line tension at domain boundaries deflects the particle and gradually reorients membrane structure. These results demonstrate that lipid membranes not only transmit internal stresses but also remodel themselves in response, actively shaping the dynamics of force transduction and motion in active systems.

Title: Shaping Magnetic Order by Local Frustration for Itinerant Fermions on a Graph
Authors: Revathy B S, Shovan Dutta
Abstract: Kinetic magnetism is an iconic and rare example of collective quantum order that emerges from the interference of paths taken by a hole in a sea of strongly interacting fermions. Here the lattice topology plays a fundamental role, with odd loops frustrating ferromagnetism, as seen in recent experiments. However, the resulting magnetic order on a general graph has remained elusive. Here we systematically establish, using exact diagonalization, that local frustration centers on a grid strongly bind singlets while sharing a delocalized hole. This collective effect generalizes to random graphs, producing sharp and predictable variation with tunable frustration measures. Our findings demonstrate that one can shape the spin order as well as tune the net magnetization by embedding geometric frustration, opening up new avenues for spatially resolved quantum control of many-body systems. We outline a protocol to realize some of the key findings in existing cold-atom setups.

Title: Pseudoperiodic Spherical Boundary Conditions: Efficient And Isotropic 3D Particle Simulations Without Lattice Artifacts
Authors: Manuel Dedola, Ludovico Cademartiri
Abstract: Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC) introduce well-known lattice artifacts. We present a novel Pseudoperiodic Spherical Boundary Condition (SBC) that is perfectly isotropic. Through detailed comparative simulations, we demonstrate that SBC eliminates the structural and dynamic anisotropy inherent to PBC. For the crowded systems where these artifacts are most prominent, our method is also computationally more efficient than standard Minimum Image Convention implementations. This establishes SBC as a powerful, high-fidelity alternative for simulating isotropic matter.

Title: Graphene Heterostructure-Based Non-Volatile Memory Devices with Top Floating Gate Programming
Authors: Gabriel L. Rodrigues, Ana B. Yoshida, Guilherme S. Selmi, Nickolas T.K.B de Jesus, Igor Ricardo, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Rafael F. de Oliveira, Victor Lopez-Richard, Alisson R. Cadore
Abstract: We present a graphene-based memory platform built on dual-gated field-effect transistors (GFETs). By integrating a lithographically defined metal patch directly atop the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)-graphene channel, the device functions simultaneously as a top gate, floating gate (FG) reservoir, and active reset contact. This architecture forms an ultrathin van der Waals heterostructure with strong capacitive coupling to the back-gate, confirmed by a dynamic model, enabling a tunable and wide memory window that scales with back-gate voltage and is further enhanced by reducing hBN thickness or increasing FG area. Our devices demonstrate reversible, high-efficiency charge programming, robust non-volatile behavior across 10 to 300 K and a wide range of operation speeds, and endurance beyond 9800 cycles. Importantly, a grounded top electrode provides on-demand charge erasure, offering functionality that is absent in standard FG designs. These results position hBN/graphene-based GFETs as a compact, energy-efficient platform for next-generation 2D flash memory, with implications for multilevel memory schemes and cryogenic electronics.

Title: Edge State Selective Measurement of Quantum Hall Dispersions
Authors: Henok Weldeyesus, Taras Patlatiuk, Qianqian Chen, Christian P. Scheller, Amir Yacoby, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Ken W. West, Dominik M. Zumbühl
Abstract: Edge states reflect the key physical properties yet are difficult to probe individually, particularly when several states are present at an edge. We present momentum resolved tunneling spectroscopy between a quantum well and a quantum wire to extract the dispersions of the quantum Hall edge states. Momentum and energy selective tunneling allows to separately address the different states even if they are spatially overlapping. This delivers the edge state velocities over broad ranges of magnetic field and density, in excellent agreement with a hard-wall model. This technique provides a basis for future edge state selective spectroscopy on quantum materials.

Title: A statistical physics framework for optimal learning
Authors: Francesca Mignacco, Francesco Mori
Abstract: Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected decisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting. Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded in statistical physics.

Title: Chiral superconductivity near a fractional Chern insulator
Authors: Taige Wang, Michael P. Zaletel
Abstract: Superconductivity arising from fully spin-polarized, repulsively interacting electrons can host intrinsically chiral Cooper pairs and Majorana zero modes, yet no concrete microscopic route to such a state has been established. Motivated by recent observations in twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, where fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) appear adjacent to spin-valley-polarized superconductors, we investigate a minimal model: spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level subject to a tunable moire potential. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations show that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate phases emerge before a metallic state forms. A chiral $f+if$ superconductor and a commensurate $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) differ in energy by less than $1\%$, reproducing the distinct superconducting and re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases experimentally observed near the FCI regime. The superconducting dome remains robust against realistic Coulomb screening, light doping, and variations in lattice geometry. Melting the FCI therefore provides a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral superconductivity and RIQH order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger twist angles will develop a superconducting dome even at filling $\nu = 2/3$, and suppressing this superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the system into an RIQH state.

Title: Phase Stability and Transformations in Lead Mixed Halide Perovskites from Machine Learning Force Fields
Authors: Xia Liang, Johan Klarbring, Aron Walsh
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites (APbX$_3$) offer tunable optoelectronic properties but feature an intricate phase-stability landscape. Here we employ on-the-fly data collection and an equivariant message-passing neural-network potential to perform large-scale molecular dynamics of three prototypical perovskite systems: CsPbX$_3$, MAPbX$_3$, and FAPbX$_3$. Integrating these simulations with the PDynA analysis toolkit, we resolve both equilibrium phase diagrams and dynamic structural evolution under varying temperature and halide-mixing conditions. Our findings reveal that the A-site cation strongly modulates octahedral tilt modes and phase pathways: MA$^+$ effectively "forbids" the beta-to-gamma transition in MAPbX$_3$ by requiring extensive molecular rearrangements and crystal rotation, whereas the debated low-temperature phase in FAPbX$_3$ is best represented as an Im$\bar{3}$ cubic phase with $a^+a^+a^+$ tilts. Additionally, small changes in halide composition and arrangement $\unicode{x2013}$ from uniform mixing to partial segregation $\unicode{x2013}$ alter tilt correlations. Segregated domains can even foster anomalous tilting modes that impede uniform phase transformations. These results highlight the multi-scale interplay between cation environment and halide distribution, offering a rational basis for tuning perovskite architectures toward improved phase stability.

Title: Finite-time and Finite-size scalings of coercivity in dynamic hysteresis
Authors: Miao Chen, Xiu-Hua Zhao, Yu-Han Ma
Abstract: The coercivity panorama for characterizing the dynamic hysteresis in interacting systems across multiple timescales is proposed by Chen et al. in a companion paper. For the stochastic $\phi^4$ model under periodic driving of rate $v_H$, the coercivity landscape $H_c(v_H)$ exhibits plateau features at a characteristic rate $v_P$ with the corresponding coercivity $H_P$. Below this plateau ($v_H<v_P$), the $H_c\sim v_H$ scaling obtained in the near-equilibrium regime becomes inaccessible in the thermodynamic limit. Above the plateau ($v_H>v_P$), scaling in the fast-driving regime, $H_c\sim v_H^{1/2}$, is completely different from that, $H_c-H_P\sim (v_H-v_P)^{2/3}$, in the post-plateau slow-driving regime. The emergence of the plateau with a finite-size scaling reflects the competition between the thermodynamic limit and the quasi-static limit. In this paper, we provide detailed analytical proofs and numerical evidence supporting these results. Moreover, to demonstrate the coercivity panorama in concrete physical systems, we study the magnetic hysteresis in the Curie-Weiss model and analyze its finite-size effects. We reveal that finite-time coercivity scaling shows model-specific behavior only in the fast-driving regime, while exhibiting universal characteristics elsewhere.

Title: A c-theorem for the effective central charge in the R=1 replica limit, and applications to systems with measurement-induced randomness
Authors: Rushikesh A. Patil, Andreas W. W. Ludwig
Abstract: We present a general theorem demonstrating non-perturbatively the decrease of the "effective central charge" $c_{\text{eff}}=(d c/dR)|_{R=1}$ under renormalization group (RG) flow in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit of a $R$-copy $2D$ conformal field theory (CFT) action $S_{*}$ perturbed by a replica interaction of the form $$-\mathbb{S}=-\sum_{a=1}^{R}S_{*}^{(a)}+\Delta\int d^2 x \sum_{\substack{a,b=1\\ a\neq b}}^{R}\varphi^{(a)}(x)\varphi^{(b)}(x).$$ Here $\varphi$ is a scaling field belonging to the CFT with action $S_*$ and the coupling $\Delta$ is relevant in the RG sense. We show that the infrared value of $c_{\text{eff}}$ is always $\textit{less}$ than the central charge $c$ of the unperturbed CFT $S_{*}$. We refer to this result as the "$c$-effective theorem". As an application of this theorem, we consider replica field theories in the limit of $R \to 1$ replicas of the form above, shown by Nahum and Jacobsen [arXiv:2504.01264] to describe $2D$ classical monitored systems, where measurements introduce a form of quenched randomness via Bayes' theorem. Lastly, we discuss a possible relationship of our theorem with the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}=(dc/dR)|_{R=0}$ for the above replica action in the different $R\rightarrow0$ replica limit, which is of relevance to systems with generic uncorrelated impurity-type quenched disorder, as opposed to measurements.

Title: Spin-only dynamics of the multi-species nonreciprocal Dicke model
Authors: Joseph Jachinowski, Peter B. Littlewood
Abstract: The Hepp-Lieb-Dicke model is ubiquitous in cavity quantum electrodynamics, describing spin-cavity coupling which does not conserve excitation number. Coupling the closed spin-cavity system to an environment realizes the open Dicke model, and by tuning the structure of the environment or the system-environment coupling, interesting spin-only models can be engineered. In this work, we focus on a variation of the multi-species open Dicke model which realizes mediated nonreciprocal interactions between the spin species and, consequently, an interesting dynamical limit-cycle phase. In particular, we improve upon adiabatic elimination and, instead, employ a Redfield master equation in order to describe the effective dynamics of the spin-only system. We assess this approach at the mean-field level, comparing it both to adiabatic elimination and the full spin-cavity model, and find that the predictions are sensitive to the presence of single-particle incoherent decay. Additionally, we clarify the symmetries of the model and explore the dynamical limit-cycle phase in the case of explicit parity-time-symmetry breaking, finding a region of phase coexistence terminating at an codimension-two exceptional point. Lastly, we go beyond mean-field theory by exact numerical diagonalization of the master equation, appealing to permutation symmetry in order to increase the size of accessible systems. We find signatures of phase transitions even for small system sizes.

Abstract: Cavities provide a means to manipulate the optical and electronic responses of quantum materials by selectively enhancing light-matter interaction at specific frequencies and momenta. While cavities typically involve external structures, exfoliated flakes of van der Waals (vdW) materials can form intrinsic self-cavities due to their small finite dimensions, confining electromagnetic fields into plasmonic cavity modes, characterized by standing-wave current distributions. While cavity-enhanced phenomena are well-studied at optical frequencies, the impact of self-cavities on nonlinear electronic responses--such as photogalvanic currents--remains largely unexplored, particularly in the terahertz regime, critical for emerging ultrafast optoelectronic technologies. Here, we report a self-cavity-induced Purcell enhancement of photogalvanic currents in the vdW semimetal WTe$_2$. Using ultrafast optoelectronic circuitry, we measured coherent near-field THz emission resulting from nonlinear photocurrents excited at the sample edges. We observed enhanced emission at finite frequencies, tunable via excitation fluence and sample geometry, which we attribute to plasmonic interference effects controlled by the cavity boundaries. We developed an analytical theory that captures the cavity resonance conditions and spectral response across multiple devices. Our findings establish WTe$_2$ as a bias-free, geometry-tunable THz emitter and demonstrate the potential of self-cavity engineering for controlling nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum materials.

Title: Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter: the space-frequency domain
Authors: R. Martínez von Dossow, Eduardo Barredo-Alamilla, Maxim A. Gorlach, Luis F. Urrutia
Abstract: The electromagnetic response of isotropic chiral matter, as described by Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, arises in distinct physical contexts ranging from condensed matter systems to Lorentz-violating extensions of high-energy physics. Here, we derive exact expressions for the circularly polarized electromagnetic fields that contribute independently to Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter. Each spectral energy distribution is gauge-invariant and positive, yielding radiation that emerges at a characteristic angle, akin to the standard case. Furthermore, we identify specific frequency ranges that permit zero, one, or two Cherenkov cones for a given setup. Remarkably, one sector of the model allows for the existence of threshold-free Cherenkov radiation arising from slowly-moving charges.

Title: Unconventional Materials for Light Dark Matter Detection
Authors: Yonit Hochberg, Dino Novko, Rotem Ovadia, Antonio Politano
Abstract: We propose the use of several unconventional materials as detectors for dark matter with mass beneath the MeV scale. These include the transition-metal dichalcogenide TiSe$_2$ hosting a low-energy plasmon in the charge-density-wave phase, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ containing a low-energy acoustic demon mode, and hole-doped diamond with tunable optical and acoustic plasmon frequencies. We perform first-principles density functional theory computations of their loss functions at non-vanishing momenta and establish their reach into light dark matter parameter space. We show that due to intense low-energy plasmon modes -- of different microscopic origin in each -- the reach of detectors based on these materials could surpass existing proposals by several orders of magnitude for both dark matter scattering and absorption on electrons. The anisotropic response of these materials, which enables directional detection, renders them exceptionally strong detector candidates, motivating the design and fabrication of future devices.

Title: Magic phase transitions in monitored gaussian fermions
Authors: Emanuele Tirrito, Luca Lumia, Alessio Paviglianiti, Guglielmo Lami, Alessandro Silva, Xhek Turkeshi, Mario Collura
Abstract: Monitored quantum systems, where unitary dynamics compete with continuous measurements, exhibit dynamical transitions as the measurement rate is varied. These reflect abrupt changes in the structure of the evolving wavefunction, captured by complementary complexity diagnostics that include and go beyond entanglement aspects. Here, we investigate how monitoring affects magic state resources, the nonstabilizerness, of Gaussian fermionic systems. Using scalable Majorana sampling techniques, we track the evolution of stabilizer Rényi entropies in large systems under projective measurements. While the leading extensive (volume-law) scaling of magic remains robust across all measurement rates, we uncover a sharp transition in the subleading logarithmic corrections. This measurement-induced complexity transition, invisible to standard entanglement probes, highlights the power of magic-based diagnostics in revealing hidden features of monitored many-body dynamics.

Title: Lindbladian versus Postselected Non-Hermitian Topology
Authors: Alexandre Chaduteau, Derek K. K. Lee, Frank Schindler
Abstract: The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes. Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal (opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.

Title: Introduction to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model: A Strongly Correlated System Perspective
Authors: Rishabh Jha
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model delivers an analytically tractable framework for exotic strongly correlated phases where conventional paradigms like Landau's Fermi liquid theory collapse. This review offers a pedagogical introduction to the SYK physics, highlighting its unique capacity to model \textit{strange metals} -- systems exhibiting linear-in-temperature resistivity, Planckian dissipation, and quasiparticle breakdown. We systematically construct both Majorana and complex fermion variants, transforming them into training grounds for modern many-body physics techniques, for instance, (1) large-$N$ formulations via disorder averaging and replica symmetry, (2) Schwinger-Dyson and Kadanoff-Baym equations, (3) imaginary time Matsubara formulation, (4) real-time dynamics via Keldysh formalism, and the associated (5) non-perturbative Keldysh contour deformations. These tools lay the foundation for equilibrium thermodynamics, quantum chaos, quench dynamics, and transport in the thermodynamic limit -- all within a solvable, chaotic quantum system. Designed as a self-contained resource, the review bridges advanced technical machinery to physical insights, with computational implementations provided. Though principally treating the SYK model as a condensed matter laboratory, we also highlight its profound connection to quantum gravity -- woven throughout this work -- underscoring how this solvable chaotic fermionic model serves as a lens onto black hole thermodynamics and holographic duality.

Title: A Study of Non-linear Flows and Shear Banding in Wormlike Micelles Under Varying Elasticity, Flow Curvature, and Surfactant Chemistry
Authors: Alfredo Scigliani, Hadi Mohammadigoushki
Abstract: We report the flow dynamics of two shear-banding wormlike micellar solutions with distinct surfactant chemistries in a Taylor-Couette (TC) setup following a startup shear. The solutions, formulated with CTAB/NaSal and CPyCl/NaSal, exhibit comparable bulk rheology and equilibrium microstructural properties. By varying the TC gap size, we systematically examine elasticity number over a range of 128000-4470000, while flow curvature spans from 0.022 to 0.171. Under a step shear into the stress plateau, both solutions exhibit a pronounced stress overshoot that intensifies with increasing elasticity number and flow curvature, followed by the development of growing flow heterogeneities. Beyond a critical threshold of elasticity number and curvature, the CTAB/NaSal solution exhibits transient flow reversal, whereas the CPyCl/NaSal solution, despite developing similar heterogeneities, does not undergo flow reversal under any tested conditions. We hypothesize that this difference arises from the stronger electrostatic repulsions between CPyCl head groups due to their larger size, coupled with the higher dissociation rate of Cl counterions. Additionally, the quasi-steady velocity profiles are significantly influenced by elasticity number and flow curvature. Wall slip at the outer cylinder exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on these parameters: it is negligible at low values of elasticity number and flow curvature, peaks at intermediate values, and diminishes at high values. Our findings highlight how surfactant chemistry, elasticity number, and flow curvature control shear-banding flows in wormlike micelles.

Title: Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation for energy eigenstates of SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems
Authors: Jae Dong Noh, Aleksander Lasek, Jade LeSchack, Nicole Yunger Halpern
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is a fundamental result in statistical mechanics. It stipulates that, if perturbed out of equilibrium, a system responds at a rate proportional to a thermal-equilibrium property. Applications range from particle diffusion to electrical-circuit noise. To prove the FDT, one must prove that common thermal states obey a symmetry property, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation. Energy eigenstates of certain quantum many-body systems were recently proved to obey the KMS relation. The proof relies on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which explains how such systems thermalize internally. This KMS relation contains a finite-size correction that scales as the inverse system size. Non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH, so a non-Abelian ETH was proposed recently. Using it, we derive a KMS relation for SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems' energy eigenstates. The finite-size correction scales as usual under certain circumstances but can be polynomially larger in others, we argue. We support the ordinary-scaling result numerically, simulating a Heisenberg chain of 16-24 qubits. The numerics, limited by computational capacity, indirectly support the larger correction. This work helps extend into nonequilibrium physics the effort, recently of interest across quantum physics, to identify how non-Abelian symmetries may alter conventional thermodynamics.

Title: Deterministic simplicial complexes
Authors: S. N. Dorogovtsev, P. L. Krapivsky
Abstract: We investigate simplicial complexes deterministically growing from a single vertex. In the first step, a vertex and an edge connecting it to the primordial vertex are added. The resulting simplicial complex has a 1-dimensional simplex and two 0-dimensional faces (the vertices). The process continues recursively: On the $n$-th step, every existing $d-$dimensional simplex ($d\leq n-1$) joins a new vertex forming a $(d+1)-$dimensional simplex; all $2^{d+1}-2$ new faces are also added so that the resulting object remains a simplicial complex. The emerging simplicial complex has intriguing local and global characteristics. The number of simplices grows faster than $n!$, and the upper-degree distributions follow a power law. Here, the upper degree (or $d$-degree) of a $d$-simplex refers to the number of $(d{+}1)$-simplices that share it as a face. Interestingly, the $d$-degree distributions evolve quite differently for different values of $d$. We compute the Hodge Laplacian spectra of simplicial complexes and show that the spectral and Hausdorff dimensions are infinite. We also explore a constrained version where the dimension of the added simplices is fixed to a finite value $m$. In the constrained model, the number of simplices grows exponentially. In particular, for $m=1$, the spectral dimension is $2$. For $m=2$, the spectral dimension is finite, and the degree distribution follows a power law, while the $1$-degree distribution decays exponentially.

Title: General purpose models for the chemical sciences
Authors: Nawaf Alampara, Anagha Aneesh, Martiño Ríos-García, Adrian Mirza, Mara Schilling-Wilhelmi, Ali Asghar Aghajani, Meiling Sun, Gordan Prastalo, Kevin Maik Jablonka
Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models, general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process. While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the coming years.

Title: NNQS-AFQMC: Neural network quantum states enhanced fermionic quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: Zhi-Yu Xiao, Bowen Kan, Huan Ma, Bowen Zhao, Honghui Shang
Abstract: We introduce an efficient approach to implement neural network quantum states (NNQS) as trial wavefunctions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). NNQS are a recently developed class of variational ansätze capable of flexibly representing many-body wavefunctions, though they often incur a high computational cost during optimization. AFQMC, on the other hand, is a powerful stochastic projector approach for ground-state calculations, but it normally requires an approximate constraint via a trial wavefunction or trial density matrix, whose quality affects the accuracy. Recent progress has shown that a broad class of highly correlated wavefunctions can be integrated into AFQMC through stochastic sampling techniques. In this work, we present a direct integration of NNQS with AFQMC, allowing NNQS to serve as high-quality trial wavefunctions for AFQMC with manageable computational cost. We test the NNQS-AFQMC method on the challenging nitrogen molecule (N$_2$) at stretched geometries. Our results demonstrate that AFQMC with an NNQS trial wavefunction can attain near-exact total energies, highlighting the potential of AFQMC with NNQS to overcome longstanding challenges in strongly correlated electronic structure calculations. We also outline future research directions for improving this promising methodology.

Title: Phase-Space Framework for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Optical Neural Networks
Authors: Stanisław Świerczewski, Wouter Verstraelen, Piotr Deuar, Barbara Piętka, Timothy C. H. Liew, Michał Matuszewski, Andrzej Opala
Abstract: Quantum optical neural networks (QONNs) enable information processing beyond classical limits by exploiting the advantages of classical and quantum optics. However, simulation of large-scale bosonic lattices remains a significant challenge due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space required to describe a quantum network accurately. Consequently, previous theoretical studies have been limited to small-scale systems, leaving the behaviour of multimode QONNs largely unexplored. This work presents an efficient computational framework based on the phase-space positive-P method for simulating bosonic neuromorphic systems. This approach provides a view to previously inaccessible regimes, allowing the validation of large-scale bosonic networks in various quantum machine learning tasks such as quantum state classification and quantum state feature prediction. Our results show that the performance of a large quantum reservoir does not improve monotonously with the number of bosonic modes, instead following a complex dependence driven by the interplay of nonlinearity, reservoir size, and the average occupation of the input mode. These findings are essential for designing and optimising optical bosonic reservoirs for future quantum neuromorphic computing devices.

Title: Astrocyte-Mediated Higher-Order Control of Synaptic Plasticity
Authors: Gustavo Menesse, Ana P. Millán, Joaquín J. Torres
Abstract: The dynamics of higher-order topological signals are increasingly recognized as a key aspect of the activity of complex systems. A paradigmatic example are synaptic dynamics: synaptic efficacy changes over time driven by different mechanisms. Beyond traditional node-driven short-term plasticity mechanisms, the role of astrocyte modulation through higher-order interactions, in the so-called tripartite synapse, is increasingly recognized. However, the competition and interplay between node-driven and higher-order mechanisms have yet to be considered. Here, we introduce a simple higher-order model of the tripartite synapse accounting for astrocyte-synapse-neuron interactions in short-term plasticity. In the model, astrocyte gliotransmission and pre-synaptic intrinsic facilitation mechanisms jointly modulate the probability of neurotransmitter release at the synapse, generalizing previous short-term plasticity models. We investigate the implications of such mechanisms in a minimal recurrent motif -- a directed ring of three excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons -- where one neuron receives external stimulation that propagates through the circuit. Due to its strong recurrence, the circuit is highly prone to self-sustained activity, which can make it insensitive to external input. By introducing higher-order interactions among different synapses through astrocyte modulation, we show that higher-order modulation robustly stabilizes circuit dynamics and expands the parameter space that supports stimulus-driven activity. Our findings highlight a plausible mechanism by which astrocytes can reshape effective connectivity and enhance information processing through higher-order structural interactions -- even in the simplest recurrent circuits.

Title: Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Inference of Liquid Structure from Scattering Data
Authors: Harry W. Sullivan, Brennon L. Shanks, Matej Cervenka, Michael P. Hoepfner
Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian framework to infer radial distribution functions from experimental scattering measurements with uncertainty quantification using non-stationary Gaussian processes. The Gaussian process prior mean and kernel functions are designed to mitigate well-known numerical challenges with the Fourier transform, including discrete measurement binning and detector windowing, while encoding fundamental yet minimal physical knowledge of liquid structure. We demonstrate uncertainty propagation of the Gaussian process posterior to unmeasured quantities of interest. The methodology is applied to liquid argon and water as a proof of principle. The full implementation is available on GitHub at this https URL.

Title: Sum Rules in Quantum Liquids
Authors: Riccardo Fantoni
Abstract: We review the linear response theory in the horizontal quantum liquids framework spanning from Coulomb liquids to Atomic gases. There are several well known references about this subject, like the onset of the Kramers-Kronig relations and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. For the Coulomb systems we show the connection between the linear response function and the dielectric function which settles a parallelism between statistical mechanics and electrostatic properties. For (very degenerate, dilute, trapped, two dimensional) Atomic (Bose) gases we will prove, in full generality, how the response properties of the gas depend from the frequency of the harmonic trap.

Title: Learning to control non-equilibrium dynamics using local imperfect gradients
Authors: Carlos Floyd, Aaron R. Dinner, Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan
Abstract: Standard approaches to controlling dynamical systems involve biologically implausible steps such as backpropagation of errors or intermediate model-based system representations. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that "imperfect" feedback of errors during training can yield test performance that is similar to using full backpropagated errors, provided that the two error signals are at least somewhat aligned. Inspired by such methods, we introduce an iterative, spatiotemporally local protocol to learn driving forces and control non-equilibrium dynamical systems using imperfect feedback signals. We present numerical experiments and theoretical justification for several examples. For systems in conservative force fields that are driven by external time-dependent protocols, our update rules resemble a dynamical version of contrastive divergence. We appeal to linear response theory to establish that our imperfect update rules are locally convergent for these conservative systems. Finally, we show that similar local update rules can also solve dynamical control problems for non-conservative systems, and we illustrate this in the non-trivial example of active nematics. Our updates allow learning spatiotemporal activity fields that pull topological defects along desired trajectories in the active nematic fluid. These imperfect feedback methods are information efficient and in principle biologically plausible, and they can help extend recent methods of decentralized training for physical materials into dynamical settings.

Title: Short-wave magnons with multipole spin precession detected in the topological bands of a skyrmion lattice
Authors: Ping Che, Riccardo Ciola, Markus Garst, Volodymyr Kravchuk, Priya R. Baral, Arnaud Magrez, Helmuth Berger, Thomas Schönenberger, Henrik M. Rønnow, Dirk Grundler
Abstract: Topological magnon bands enable uni-directional edge transport without backscattering, enhancing the robustness of magnonic circuits and providing a novel platform for exploring quantum transport phenomena. Magnetic skyrmion lattices, in particular, host a manifold of topological magnon bands with multipole character and non-reciprocal dispersions. These modes have been explored already in the short and long wavelength limit, but previously employed techniques were unable to access intermediate wavelengths comparable to inter-skyrmion distances. Here, we report the detection of such magnons with wavevectors $|{\bf q}|\simeq 48$ rad $\mu$m$^{-1}$ in the metastable skyrmion lattice phase of the bulk chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ using Brillouin light scattering microscopy. Thanks to its high sensitivity and broad bandwidth various multipole excitation modes could be resolved over a wide magnetic field regime. Besides the known counterclockwise, breathing and clockwise modes with dipole character, quantitative comparison of frequencies and spectral weights to theoretical predictions enabled the additional identification of a quadrupole mode and, possibly, a sextupole mode. Our work highlights the potential of skyrmionic phases for the design of magnonic devices exploiting topological magnon states at GHz frequencies.

Title: Fermi-surface diagnosis for topological superconductivity with $s$-wave-like pairing symmetries
Authors: Zhongyi Zhang, Ken Shiozaki, Chen Fang, Seishiro Ono
Abstract: Theoretical prediction of topological superconductivity is key to their discovery. Recently, it is proved that in 199 out of 230 space groups, topological superconductivity coexists with an $s$-wave-like pairing symmetry, raising the hope of finding more candidates for this exotic phase. However, a comprehensive and efficient method for diagnosing topological superconductivity in realistic materials remains elusive. Here, we derive Fermi-surface formulas for gapped and gapless topological phases of time-reversal symmetric superconductors with $s$-wave-like pairing symmetries in all layer and space groups, applicable to thin-film and bulk materials. Our diagnosis uses only the sign of the pairing and the Fermi velocity at several Fermi points, and yields complete (partial) diagnosis for gapped topological superconductivity in 159 (40) out of the 199 space groups. This provides a fundamental basis for the first-principles prediction of new topological superconductors.

Title: Thermal Conductivity Predictions with Foundation Atomistic Models
Authors: Balázs Póta, Paramvir Ahlawat, Gábor Csányi, Michele Simoncelli
Abstract: Advances in machine learning have led to the development of foundation models for atomistic materials chemistry, enabling quantum-accurate descriptions of interatomic forces across chemically diverse compounds at reduced computational cost. Hitherto, the accuracy and utility of these models have been assessed relying on descriptors based on formation energies or idealized harmonic atomic vibrations. Yet, the rigorous and physically interpretable quantification of their capability to describe both realistic anharmonic atomic dynamics and technologically relevant observables remains a pressing problem. Here, we address this problem, leveraging the Wigner formulation of heat transport and the Grüneisen approach to thermal expansion to connect the atomic-physics awareness of foundation models to their utility in predicting experimentally observable thermomechanical properties, presenting standards and fine-tuning protocols needed to achieve first-principles accuracy. We apply our framework to a database of 103 solids with diverse compositions and structures, demonstrating that it overcomes the major bottlenecks of current methods for designing heat-management materials -- high cost, limited transferability, or lack of physics awareness -- and its potential to discover materials for next-gen technologies ranging from thermal insulation to neuromorphic computing.

Title: Josephson effect and self-trapping in helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with optical lattices
Authors: Sumaita Sultana, Golam Ali Sekh
Abstract: We consider matter-wave bright solitons in helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices with a view to study Josephson-type oscillation and self-trapping of population imbalance between two pseudo-spin states. For fixed values of nonlinear interaction and lattice parameters, the population imbalance executes Josephson-type oscillation and the frequency of oscillation decreases with the increase of helicoidal gauge potential. The frequency of oscillation, however, increases in presence of nonlinear optical lattices. We find that the population imbalance can oscillate about a non-zero value and result self-trapping for proper choices of parameters of the system. The self-trapping can be enhanced by the increase of helicoidal gauge potential and by properly tuning the lattice parameters.

Title: Length scales in electrolytes
Authors: Ioannis Skarmoutsos, Stefano Mossa
Abstract: The elusive presence of an anomalously increasing screening length at high ionic concentrations hampers a complete picture of interactions in electrolytes. Theories which extend the diluted Debye-Huckel framework to higher concentrations predict, in addition to the expected decreasing Debye length, an increasing significant scale of the order of at most a few ionic diameters. More recent surface force balance experiments with different materials succeeded in measuring increasing length scales which, however, turn out to extend over tenths or even hundreds of ionic diameters. While simulation work has managed to characterize the former, the latter still avoid detection, generating doubts about its true origin. Here we provide a step forward in the clarification of such a conundrum. We have studied by extensive Molecular Dynamics simulation the properties of a generic model of electrolyte, lithium tetrafluoroborate dissolved in ethylene-carbonate, in a vast range of salt concentrations continuously joining the Debye non-interacting limit to the opposite over-charged solvent-in-salt states. On one side, we have accurately determined the macroscopic concentration-induced structural, dielectric and transport modifications, on the other we have quantified the resulting nano-scale ions organization. Based only on the simulation data, without resorting to any uncontrolled hypothesis or phenomenological parameter, we identify a convincing candidate for the measured anomalously increasing length, whose origin has been possibly misinterpreted.

Title: Bose-Hubbard simulator with long-range hopping
Authors: Camille Lagoin, Corentin Morin, Kirk Baldwin, Loren Pfeiffer, Francois Dubin
Abstract: Enriching condensed-matter systems with quantum optical phenomena currently drives intense research efforts, particularly to introduce collective quantum correlations. Here we access this paradigm, by confining dipolar excitons in a nanoscopic lattice where long-range tunneling, and nearest-neighbour dipolar repulsions, dress the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Long-range tunneling is evidenced by the spontaneous buildup of many-body sub-radiance, signalled by an algebraic slowdown of excitons radiative dissipation. In addition, we observe a threshold increase of temporal coherence for dipolar quantum solids only. It suggests that excitons condense in a single sub-radiant state for Mott-like phases. These combine then spatial order and extended phase coherence, in a single degree of freedom. Our sudy unveils that nanoscopic exciton arrays provide a unique platform to design new frontiers of strongly-correlated lattice models with long-range correlations.

Title: Optically active Higgs and Leggett modes in multiband pair-density-wave superconductors with Lifshitz invariant
Authors: Raigo Nagashima, Titouan Mouilleron, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: Lifshitz invariant is a symmetry invariant composed of multiple order parameters that contain a single spatial derivative in a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy, which may induce a nonuniform configuration of the order parameters. In multiband superconductors, we find phase transitions from a uniform superconducting state to qualitatively distinct two pair-density-wave (PDW) states with small and large momenta $\boldsymbol{q}$ based on the GL theory. The former is induced by the Lifshitz invariant, while the latter originates from the drag effect. In the PDW states, the Higgs and Leggett modes (i.e., collective amplitude and relative phase oscillations of the order parameters) are shown to couple to electromagnetic fields linearly. We construct microscopic models of multiband superconductors with Lifshitz invariant that exhibit PDW states, and calculate the linear optical conductivity using the diagrammatic approach. We find optically active Higgs and Leggett modes in the small $\boldsymbol{q}$ PDW state, indicating that the PDW state is a suitable platform to explore collective modes of multiband superconductors in the linear response regime.

Title: Coulomb interactions in systems of generalized semi-Dirac fermions
Authors: Mohamed M. Elsayed, Bruno Uchoa, Valeri N. Kotov
Abstract: Interactions have strong effects in systems with flat bands. We examine the role of Coulomb interactions in two dimensional chiral anisotropic quasiparticles that disperse linearly in one direction and have relatively flat bands near the neutrality point in the other direction, dispersing with an arbitrary positive even power law $2n\geq2$. As in the conventional semi-Dirac case $(n=1$), we show using renormalization group that strong logarithmic divergences in the self-energy of generalized semi-Dirac fermions resum and lead to a restoration of linearity in the spectrum for arbitrary $n$ over a sizable energy window in the perturbative regime. We discuss those results in light of previous non-perturbative large $N_{f}$ results and address the implications for physical observables.

Title: Non-adiabatic phonon self-energy due to electrons with finite linewidths
Authors: Cheol-Hwan Park
Abstract: We develop the theory of the non-adiabatic phonon self-energy arising from coupling to electrons with finite linewidths using the spectral representation of Green's functions. Our formalism naturally includes the contribution from the intra-band electronic transitions (as well as the inter-band ones) at all electron wavevectors to the phonon linewidths, which is forbidden for zone-center optical phonons if infinitesimal electron linewidths are used. As a proof of principle, we use the theory to calculate the linewidth of the double-degenerate, zone-center optical $E_{\rm 2g}$ phonons of graphene as a function of the chemical potential. The calculated phonon linewidths obtained with finite electron linewidths differ significantly from those obtained with infinitesimal electron linewidths even at low temperatures. Intra-band electronic transitions play an important role in making this difference. Moreover, only the results accounting for the finite electron linewidths are in quantitative agreement with the available experimental data. The presented formalism is suitable for first-principles calculations.

Title: Synchronization and exceptional points in nonreciprocal active polar mixtures
Authors: Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp
Abstract: Many active matter systems consist of different particle types that interact via nonreciprocal couplings. Such nonreciprocal couplings can lead to the spontaneous emergence of time-dependent states that break parity-time symmetry. On the field-theoretical level, the transition to these states is marked by so-called exceptional points. However, their precise impact on observable particle dynamics remains poorly understood. In this study, we address this gap by providing a scale-bridging view of a minimal active mixture with nonreciprocal polar interactions. We find that nonreciprocity induces chiral motion on the particle level, yet no full, homogeneous synchronization. Instead, we observe various behaviors, ranging from fully synchronized clusters to chimera-like states. The nonreciprocity-induced spontaneous chirality increases with the degree of nonreciprocity and peaks at coupling strengths associated with exceptional points.

Title: Active phase separation: new phenomenology from non-equilibrium physics
Authors: M. E. Cates, C. Nardini
Abstract: In active systems, whose constituents have non-equilibrium dynamics at local level, fluid-fluid phase separation is widely observed. Examples include the formation of membraneless organelles within cells; the clustering of self-propelled colloidal particles in the absence of attractive forces, and some types of ecological segregation. A schematic understanding of such active phase separation was initially borrowed from what is known for the equilibrium case, in which detailed balance holds at microscopic level. However it has recently become clear that in active systems the absence of detailed balance, although it leave phase separation qualitatively unchanged in some regimes (for example domain growth driven by interfacial tension via Ostwald ripening), can in other regimes radically alter its phenomenology at mechanistic level. For example, microphase separation can be caused by reverse Ostwald ripening, a process that is hard to imagine from an equilibrium perspective. This and other new phenomena arise because, instead of having a single, positive interfacial tension like their equilibrium counterparts, the fluid-fluid interfaces created by active phase separation can have several distinct interfacial tensions governing different properties, some of which can be negative. These phenomena can be broadly understood by studying continuum field theories for a single conserved scalar order parameter (the fluid density), supplemented with a velocity field in cases where momentum conservation is also present. More complex regimes arise in systems described by multiple scalar order parameters (especially with nonreciprocal interactions between these); or when an order parameter undergoes both conserved and non-conserved dynamics; or in systems that support orientational long-range order in one or more of the coexisting phases.

Title: Effects of Molecular Composition and Chain Length on the Interfacial and Thermodynamic Properties of Cyclic and Linear Polymer Blends
Authors: Oluwatumininu Emmanuel Ayo-Ojo, Nkosinathi Dlamini
Abstract: This research paper comprehensively explores the effects of molecular weight and chain architecture on the interfacial and thermodynamic properties of cyclic and linear polymer blends. Utilizing the Kremer-Grest bead-spring model, the study meticulously investigates how these polymers behave at the polymer-wall interface, with a specific emphasis on their adsorption characteristics and thermal attributes. By showing the heat capacity and thermal stability of polymeric fluids, the research not only advances the understanding of these critical factors within polymer systems but also highlights the broader environmental implications associated with polymer degradation. The study examines the intricate interaction between molecular design parameters and functionality, revealing how variations in polymer architecture can lead to significant changes in performance and stability. Furthermore, it examines the potential for enhancing the lifecycle performance of polymers, with an eye toward the development of more sustainable materials capable of minimizing environmental impact. Through this exploration, it aims to provide valuable insights that contribute to the ongoing discourse on the optimization of polymer formulations for a greener future, setting the stage for innovations in material science aimed at sustainable applications. The insights gained from this investigation have the potential to inform future research directions and material design strategies, ultimately supporting the creation of polymers that not only perform effectively but are also environmentally friendly. By integrating a thorough understanding of these relationships, this work aspires to lay the groundwork for the evolution of polymer science, encouraging advancements that align with both technological needs and ecological stewardship.

Title: Wannier interpolation of spin accumulation coefficient
Authors: Atsuo Shitade, Emi Minamitani
Abstract: The spin Hall (SH) effect is widely understood as a phenomoenon in which spin current flows perpendicular to an electric field. In the presence of a spin-orbit coupling, however, spin current is ambiguous, and the SH conductivity depends on the definition of spin current. In this article, we develop an \textit{ab initio} computational scheme for the spin accumulation coefficient, which characterizes the spin accumulation and would be an alternative indicator of the SH effect. The proposed method has been implemented into an open-source software Wannier90 and serves high-precision \textit{ab initio} research on the SH effect.

Title: Multicomponent one-dimensional quantum droplets across the mean-field stability regime
Authors: I. A. Englezos, P. Schmelcher, S. I. Mistakidis
Abstract: The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.

Title: Transverse vortices induced by modulated granular shear flows of elongated particles
Authors: Sára Lévay, Philippe Claudin, Ellák Somfai, Tamás Börzsönyi
Abstract: We perform discrete element method (DEM) simulations of elongated grains in a shear cell for various particle aspect ratios and contact frictions, with an additional heterogeneous force perturbation in the flow direction. For a perturbation in the form of a single Fourier mode, we show that the response of the system consists of transverse secondary flows that average onto a pattern of four vortices. We also theoretically studied this phenomenon by generalizing the granular rheology $\mu(I)$ to the case of elongated grains and computing the linear response to such a perturbation. Even if the agreement between theory and simulations remains qualitative only, we can reproduce and understand the inversion of the vortex pattern when the cell aspect ratio is increased from a vertically to a horizontally elongated cell shape, emphasizing the key role of the second normal stress difference as well as the cell geometry.

Title: Fluorescent molecular rotor-based polymer materials for local microviscosity mapping in microfluidic channels
Authors: Dharshana Nalatamby, Florence Gibouin, Maxime Zitouni, Julien Renaudeau, Gérald Clisson, Pierre Lidon, Simon Harrisson, Yaocihuatl Medina-Gonzalez
Abstract: A viscosity-sensitive monomer consisting of a methacrylate-functionalized julolidone-based molecular rotor (MECVJ) was synthesized and used to obtain viscosity-sensitive polymers (poly(DMA-\textit{s}-MECVJ)). The qualitative properties of the molecular rotor were preserved after its inclusion in the new polymer, in particular the effect of the viscosity of the surrounding medium on the fluorescence lifetime of the rotor. By grafting these polymers onto glass slides, viscosity-sensitive surfaces were obtained, showing good robustness in time after successive use and washing. As proof of concept, these surfaces were used to assemble a microfluidic chip capable of mapping viscosity of fluids flowing inside the channel.

Title: String Formation and Arrested Ordering Kinetics in Nematics Induced by Polar Particles
Authors: Pawan Kumar Mishra, Partha Sarathi Mondal, Pratikshya Jena, Shradha Mishra
Abstract: Our study explores the mixture of polar particles in apolar environment. We employ a coarse-grained approach to model the mixture, where polar particles are in minority. The interaction between polar and apolar components is incorporated via a coupling term in the free energy. Coupling generates local interaction in the system which results in the formation of string like structures connecting a pair of half integer topological defects. The increase in the coupling strength or the density of polar particles results in the: Sharper strings with larger probability of connecting the topological defects of same charge and the enhanced dynamics of topological defects. However, the ordering kinetics of the system shows the delayed coarsening for larger coupling or polar density. Our results can be used to develop controlled kinetics as well as to detect the impurities in liquid crystals.

Title: Statistical physics analysis of graph neural networks: Approaching optimality in the contextual stochastic block model
Authors: O. Duranthon, L. Zdeborová
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to process data associated with graphs. They are finding an increasing range of applications; however, as with other modern machine learning techniques, their theoretical understanding is limited. GNNs can encounter difficulties in gathering information from nodes that are far apart by iterated aggregation steps. This situation is partly caused by so-called oversmoothing; and overcoming it is one of the practically motivated challenges. We consider the situation where information is aggregated by multiple steps of convolution, leading to graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We analyze the generalization performance of a basic GCN, trained for node classification on data generated by the contextual stochastic block model. We predict its asymptotic performance by deriving the free energy of the problem, using the replica method, in the high-dimensional limit. Calling depth the number of convolutional steps, we show the importance of going to large depth to approach the Bayes-optimality. We detail how the architecture of the GCN has to scale with the depth to avoid oversmoothing. The resulting large depth limit can be close to the Bayes-optimality and leads to a continuous GCN. Technically, we tackle this continuous limit via an approach that resembles dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with constraints at the initial and final times. An expansion around large regularization allows us to solve the corresponding equations for the performance of the deep GCN. This promising tool may contribute to the analysis of further deep neural networks.

Title: Dynamical scaling study for the estimation of dynamical exponent $z$ of three-dimensional XY spin glass model
Authors: Yusuke Terasawa, Yukiyasu Ozeki
Abstract: To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.

Title: Towards Excitations and Dynamical Quantities in Correlated Lattices with Density Matrix Embedding Theory
Authors: Shuoxue Li, Chenghan Li, Huanchen Zhai, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: Density matrix embedding theory (DMET) provides a framework to describe ground-state expectation values in strongly correlated systems, but its extension to dynamical quantities is still an open problem. We show one route to obtaining excitations and dynamical spectral functions by using the techniques of DMET to approximate the matrix elements that arise in a single-mode inspired excitation ansatz. We demonstrate this approach in the 1D Hubbard model, comparing the neutral excitations, single-particle density of states, charge, and spin dynamical structure factors to benchmarks from the Bethe ansatz and density matrix renormalization group. Our work highlights the potential of these ideas in building computationally efficient approaches for dynamical quantities.

Title: Observation of Fermi acceleration with cold atoms
Authors: G. Barontini, V. Naniyil, J. P. Stinton, D. Reid, J. M. F. Gunn, H. M. Price, A. B. Deb, D. Caprioli, V. Guarrera
Abstract: Cosmic rays are deemed to be generated by a process known as ``Fermi acceleration", in which charged particles scatter against magnetic fluctuations in astrophysical plasmas. The process itself is however universal, has both classical and quantum formulations, and is at the basis of dynamical systems with interesting mathematical properties, such as the celebrated Fermi-Ulam model. Despite its effectiveness in accelerating particles, Fermi acceleration has so far eluded unambiguous verifications in laboratory settings. Here, we realize the first fully controllable Fermi accelerator by colliding ultracold atoms against engineered movable potential barriers. We demonstrate that our Fermi accelerator, which is only 100 um in size, can produce ultracold atomic jets with velocities above half a meter per second. Adding dissipation, we also experimentally test Bell's general argument for the ensuing energy spectra, which is at the basis of any model of cosmic ray acceleration. On the one hand, our work effectively opens the window to the study of high energy astrophysics with cold atoms, offering new capabilities for the understanding of phenomena such as diffusive acceleration at collisionless shocks. On the other, the performance of our Fermi accelerator is competitive with those of best-in-class accelerating methods used in quantum technology and quantum colliders, but with substantially simpler implementation and virtually no upper limit.

Title: Slow magnetic quantum oscillations in the c-axis magnetoresistance of UTe$_2$
Authors: Freya Husstedt, Motoi Kimata, Sajal Naduvile Thadathil, Beat Valentin Schwarze, Markus König, Gerard Lapertot, Jean-Pascal Brison, Georg Knebel, Dai Aoki, J. Wosnitza, Toni Helm
Abstract: Details of the electronic band structure in unconventional superconductors are key to the understanding of their fundamental ground state. The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.

Title: Exact anisotropic properties of hard spheres in narrow cylindrical confinement
Authors: Ana M. Montero, Andrés Santos
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) system of hard spheres confined within a cylindrical pore so narrow that only nearest-neighbor interactions occur. By mapping this Q1D system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse mixture of nonadditive hard rods, we obtain exact thermodynamic and structural properties, including the radial distribution function, which had remained elusive in previous studies. We derive analytical results for limiting cases, such as small pore diameters, virial expansions, and the high-pressure regime. In particular, we identify a crossover in the anisotropic pressure components: at high densities, the transverse pressure overtakes the longitudinal one when the pore diameter exceeds a critical threshold. We also examine spatial correlations in particle arrangements and radial fluctuations, shedding light on the emergence of ordering in confined systems.

Title: Ab initio screening for BCS-type superconductivity in ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type compounds
Authors: Tom Ichibha, Ryo Maezono, Kenta Hongo
Abstract: In this study, we applied ab initio $T_\mathrm{c}$ calculations to compounds with the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type structure to search for BCS superconductor candidates. From the 1883 compounds registered in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, we excluded those whose chemical compositions would inhibit the emergence of BCS-type superconductivity by giving rise to magnetism or heavy-fermionic behavior. We then focused on 66 compounds confirmed to be dynamically stable through phonon calculations. Among these, for the 24 systems with experimentally reported $T_\mathrm{c}$ values, we verified that the ab initio $T_\mathrm{c}$ calculations exhibit excellent predictive reliability. For the remaining 42 compounds lacking experimental $T_\mathrm{c}$ values, our predictions identified several new BCS-type superconductor candidates, including SrPb$_2$Al$_2$ $\left(T_c^\mathrm{calc}=2.2\,\mathrm{K}\right)$.

Title: Bio-Derived Graphite from Pterocarpus marsupium Leaves for rGO-MoO$_3$ Nanocomposites with Enhanced Photocatalytic Efficiency
Authors: P. Princeya Mary, M. Kumaresavanji, P. Sundara Venkatesh, N. Kannan, V. Vasumathi
Abstract: This study presents a sustainable approach to synthesize bio-graphite from Pterocarpus marsupium (Indian Kino) leaves without using chemical catalysts, activating agents, or organic solvents. The resulting bio-graphite was used to produce reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a modified Hummers method. The bio-graphite derived rGO was further incorporated with orthorhombic structured MoO$_3$ at different percentages (1, 3, and 6 wt.%) using ultrasonication. Structural, morphological, and functional characterizations were conducted using XRD, FESEM, FTIR, and UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy, revealing a bandgap of 2.82 eV for the rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ composite. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated via methylene blue degradation under natural sunlight. The rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ nanocomposite showed superior performance, achieving 90% degradation in 150 minutes when compared to 65% by pure MoO$_3$. The Scavenger tests confirmed superoxide radicals $(\cdot O_2^-)$ as the main reactive species. This work highlights the potential of bio-graphite derived rGO-MoO$_3$ nanocomposites as efficient, eco-friendly photocatalysts for wastewater treatment.

Title: Finding local integrals of motion in quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit
Authors: J. Pawlowski, J. Herbrych, M. Mierzejewski
Abstract: Local integrals of motion (LIOMs) play a key role in understanding the long-time properties of closed macroscopic systems. They were found for selected integrable systems via complex analytical calculations. The existence of LIOMs and their structure can also be studied via numerical methods, which, however, involve exact diagonalization of Hamiltonians, posing a bottleneck for such studies. We show that finding LIOMs in translationally invariant lattice models or unitary quantum circuits can be reduced to a problem for which one may numerically find an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit. We develop a simple algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency by calculating LIOMs and bounds on correlations (the Mazur bounds) for infinite integrable spin chains and unitary circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach identifies slow modes in nearly integrable spin models and estimates their relaxation times.

Title: Microscopic lattice model for quartic semi-Dirac fermions in two dimensions
Authors: Mohamed M. Elsayed, Valeri N. Kotov
Abstract: We propose a lattice model for the realization of exotic quartic semi-Dirac fermions, i.e. quasiparticles exhibiting a dispersion with quartic momentum dependence in a given direction, and a linear dependence in the perpendicular direction. A tight binding model is employed, allowing for hopping between up to fourth nearest neighbors and anisotropic hopping parameters. In addition, we introduce short range electron-electron interactions which are necessary to stabilize the quartic semi-Dirac phase. Without interactions, or in the presence of long range correlations, the lattice is unstable towards formation of either anisotropic Dirac cones, or simple (quadratic) semi-Dirac phase.

Title: Dynamics of charge states at the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle in a liquid crystal

Abstract: The liquid crystal with suspended ferroelectric nanoparticles is an interesting object for fundamental research of the long-range dipole-dipole interactions; as well as it is promising for optical, optoelectronic and electrochemical applications. Such suspensions can serve as basic elements for advanced nonvolatile memory cells and energy storage devices. The work studies the cells filled with a nematic liquid crystal 5CB and the cells containing 5CB with 0.5 wt.% and 1 wt.% of BaTiO3 nanoparticles with an average size of 24 nm. We analyzed the time dependences of the current flowing through the cells at constant applied voltage and the voltage dynamics in the no-load mode. The time dependences of the current and voltage show a slowing down decay rate. For the cells with BaTiO3 nanoparticles, the decrease in the decay time is characteristic. A possible physical reason for the retarding decay time rate is the indirect effect of screening charges, which cover ferroelectric nanoparticles, and slow ionic transport in the liquid crystal. To explain the dynamics of current and voltage, the finite element modeling of the polarization distribution, domain structure dynamics, and charge state of nanoparticles in a liquid crystal is performed using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach. Theoretical results confirmed the leading role of screening charges, because the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle adsorbs an ionic-electronic charge that partially screens its spontaneous polarization in single-domain and/or poly-domain states. When an electric field is applied to the liquid crystal with nanoparticles, it can release part of the screening charge (mainly due to the change in the polarization of the nanoparticle), which will lead to a decrease in decay time rate of the current and voltage dependences.

Title: Anomaly, Class Division, and Decoupling in Wealth Dynamics
Authors: Jaeseok Hur, Meesoon Ha, Hawoong Jeong
Abstract: Economic inequality is driven by the structure of agent networks, interactions among agents, and the abilities of individual agents. We provide a comprehensive picture of anomalous diffusion, economic class division, and bimodal wealth distribution in an agent-based model, where heterogeneous agent abilities and growth rates are tuned on sparse regular networks. In particular, we focus on the statistical characteristics of logarithmic scaled normalized wealth distributions with two ability parameters, assortativity $\mathcal{A}$ and concentration $\mathcal{R}$. For the set of $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{R})$, temporal behaviors of log-wealth distributions reveal that the decoupling between different ability groups depends primarily on $\mathcal{R}$ and long-term inequality depends mainly on $\mathcal{A}$. In other words, class division and decoupling are driven by $\mathcal{R}$, while the super-diffusive nature in the leading class is driven by $\mathcal{A}$. Our findings highlight that hierarchical segregation of abilities, rather than ability differences alone, is a key driver of economic class stratification. Finally, our model provides a minimal, yet powerful framework for understanding the bimodal global income distribution observed over the past half century and highlights the critical role of network-level segregation in shaping economic inequality.

Title: Combine effect of site dilution and long-range interaction on magnetic and transport properties in the half-filled Hubbard model
Authors: Sudip Mandal, Sourav Chakraborty, Kalpataru Pradhan
Abstract: We investigate the magnetotransport properties of a diluted half-filled one-band Hubbard model with second-nearest-neighbor hopping on a simple cubic lattice, aiming to explore the possibility of metallicity in diluted antiferromagnetic systems. Our semiclassical Monte Carlo calculations reveal an antiferromagnetic metallic regime in diluted correlated materials. This unexpected metallic regime naturally leads to a central question: how does the introduction of dilution into an antiferromagnetic material, especially with long-range magnetic interactions, induce metallicity -- a feature not commonly associated with antiferromagnets? To address this question, we demonstrate that when the on-site repulsive Hubbard interaction strength is set to zero on a percentage of the sites (site dilution), the insulating state weakens due to percolative conduction among the diluted sites at low temperatures. Remarkably, this occurs without any significant alteration to the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic ordering in the system, thereby providing a pathway to realize antiferromagnetic metals. In addition, we show how the sublattice-dependent hopping can be exploited to engineer spin-polarized half-metallic antiferromagnets. Overall, our numerical results collectively provide a basis for understanding the combined effect of site dilution and competing interactions, which will assist in the design of new antiferromagnetic metals for future spintronic applications.

Title: Superconductivity via paramagnon and magnon exchange in a 2D near-ferromagnetic full metal and ferromagnetic half-metal
Authors: Zachary M Raines, Andrey V Chubukov
Abstract: We study superconductivity in paramagnetic and ferromagnetically-ordered phases in a two-dimensional electron system with parabolic fermionic dispersion and short-range repulsive interaction. In the paramagnetic phase, we find that a weak momentum dependence of a paramagnon propagator parametrically reduces the onset temperature for the pairing compared to that in phenomenological theories which assume a strong dispersion of a paramagnon and also changes the topology of the gap function. In the ferromagnetic phase, we show that the order instantly polarizes low-energy fermionic excitations. We derive the fully renormalized pairing interaction between low-energy fermions, mediated by two transverse Goldstone modes and show that it is attractive in a spatially-odd channel. The pairing temperature in the ferromagnetic phase is found to be a fraction of the Fermi energy, significantly larger than in the paramagnetic phase near the transition. Our results are relevant for understanding superconductivity in proximity to itinerant ferromagnetism in multi-valley graphene systems, particularly the ones with full valley and spin polarization.

Title: Testing the spin-bath view of self-attention: A Hamiltonian analysis of GPT-2 Transformer
Authors: Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Seung-Cheol Lee
Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians, we obtain analytic \textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. In this work, we utilize the context-field lens, which provides physics-grounded interpretability and motivates the development of novel generative models bridging theoretical condensed matter physics and artificial intelligence.

Title: Solving the Hubbard model with Neural Quantum States
Authors: Yuntian Gu, Wenrui Li, Heng Lin, Bo Zhan, Ruichen Li, Yifei Huang, Di He, Yantao Wu, Tao Xiang, Mingpu Qin, Liwei Wang, Dingshun Lv
Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.

Title: Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with Quantic Tensor Trains: Ground States and Nonlinear Dynamics
Authors: Qian-Can Chen, I-Kang Liu, Jheng-Wei Li, Chia-Min Chung
Abstract: We develop a tensor network framework based on the quantic tensor train (QTT) format to efficiently solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which governs Bose-Einstein condensates under mean-field theory. By adapting time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) and gradient descent methods, we accurately handle the GPE's nonlinearities within the QTT structure. Our approach enables high-resolution simulations with drastically reduced computational cost. We benchmark ground states and dynamics of BECs--including vortex lattice formation and breathing modes--demonstrating superior performance over conventional grid-based methods and stable long-time evolution due to saturating bond dimensions. This establishes QTT as a powerful tool for nonlinear quantum simulations.

Title: Exciton transport driven by spin excitations in an antiferromagnet
Authors: Florian Dirnberger, Sophia Terres, Zakhar A. Iakovlev, Kseniia Mosina, Zdenek Sofer, Akashdeep Kamra, Mikhail M. Glazov, Alexey Chernikov
Abstract: A new class of optical quasiparticles called magnetic excitons recently emerged in magnetic van der Waals materials. Akin to the highly effective strategies developed for electrons, the strong interactions of these excitons with the spin degree of freedom may provide innovative solutions for long-standing challenges in optics, such as steering the flow of energy and information. Here, we demonstrate transport of excitons by spin excitations in the van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Key results of our study are the observations of ultrafast, nearly isotropic exciton propagation substantially enhanced at the Neel temperature, transient contraction and expansion of the exciton clouds at low temperatures, as well as superdiffusive behavior in bilayer samples. These signatures largely defy description by commonly known exciton transport mechanisms and are related to the currents of incoherent magnons induced by laser excitation instead. We propose that the drag forces exerted by these currents can effectively imprint characteristic properties of spin excitations onto the motion of excitons. The universal nature of the underlying exciton-magnon scattering promises driving of excitons by magnons in other magnetic semiconductors and even in non-magnetic materials by proximity in heterostructures, merging the rich physics of magneto-transport with optics and photonics.

Title: Electron Ptychography Reveals Correlated Lattice Vibrations at Atomic Resolution
Authors: Anton Gladyshev, Benedikt Haas, Thomas C. Pekin, Tara M. Boland, Marcel Schloz, Peter Rez, Christoph T. Koch
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an electron ptychography reconstruction framework, CAVIAR -- Correlated Atomic Vibration Imaging with sub-Angstrom Resolution -- that reveals an entirely new channel of information: spatial correlations in atomic displacements at the atomic scale. We show reconstructions of a symmetric $\Sigma$9 grain boundary in silicon from realistically simulated data and experimental data for hexagonal boron nitride. By reconstructing the object as an ensemble of multiple states we are able to observe correlations between movements of atoms in the range of 10-20 pm at room temperature in agreement with the expectation. Moreover, using only the masses of the atomic species and the temperature as input, we obtain average frequencies of $10.8\pm0.1$, $13.6\pm0.6$, $18.0\pm0.2$, $25.5\pm1.5$ THz for the longitudinal and transversal acoustic and optic phonons, respectively, in agreement with inelastic neutron scattering, albeit from just a few nm$^3$ volume. This ability to spatially resolve correlated atomic motion makes CAVIAR a unique tool to explore atom dynamics at the finest scale with the potential to be instrumental in the development of phononic devices, in studying phonon-based decoherence in quantum systems, or other emerging phonon-based applications.

Title: Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling
Authors: Avishek Das, Pieter Rein ten Wolde
Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We use our exact technique to demonstrate that commonly used approximate methods to compute transfer entropies incur large systematic errors and high computational costs. As an application, we use TE-PWS in linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.

Title: On Marginal Stability in Low Temperature Spherical Spin Glasses
Authors: Mark Sellke
Abstract: We show marginal stability of near-ground states in spherical spin glasses is equivalent to full replica symmetry breaking at zero temperature near overlap $1$. This connection has long been implicit in the physics literature, which also links marginal stability to the performance of efficient algorithms. For even models, we prove the Hessian has no outlier eigenvalues, and obtain geometric consequences for low temperature Gibbs measures in the case that marginal stability is absent. Our proofs rely on interpolation bounds for vector spin glass models. For generic models, we give another more conceptual argument that full RSB near overlap $1$ implies marginal stability at low temperature.

Title: Measuring vacancy-type defect density in monolayer MoS$_2$
Authors: Aleksandar Radic, Nick von Jeinsen, Vivian Perez, Ke Wang, Min Lin, Boyao Liu, Yiru Zhu, Ismail Sami, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, David Ward, Andrew Jardine, Akshay Rao, Manish Chhowalla, Sam Lambrick
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are being widely researched for their interesting electronic properties. Their optoelectronic, mechanical and thermal properties can be finely modulated using a variety of methods, including strain, passivation, doping, and tuning of defect density. However, measuring defect densities, such as those associated with vacancy-type point defects, is inherently very difficult in atomically thin materials. Here we show that helium atom micro-diffraction can be used to measure defect density in ~15x20$\mu$m monolayer MoS$_2$, a prototypical 2D semiconductor, quickly and easily compared to standard methods. We present a simple analytic model, the lattice gas equation, that fully captures the relationship between atomic Bragg diffraction intensity and defect density. The model, combined with ab initio scattering calculations, shows that our technique can immediately be applied to a wide range of 2D materials, independent of sample chemistry or structure. Additionally, favourable signal scaling with lateral resolution makes wafer-scale characterisation immediately possible.

Title: Pseudoentanglement from tensor networks
Authors: Zihan Cheng, Xiaozhou Feng, Matteo Ippoliti
Abstract: Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].

Title: Thermalization and hydrodynamic long-time tails in a Floquet system
Authors: Anne Matthies, Nicolas Dannenfeld, Silvia Pappalardi, Achim Rosch
Abstract: We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. We study both numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subjected to stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates that conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamic field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to the corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially and which decay with a hydrodynamic long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators that can be defined on four neighboring sites. All operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially, while the others show a slow hydrodynamic decay. While most hydrodynamic power laws seem to follow the analytical predictions, we also discuss cases where there is an apparent discrepancy between analytics and the finite-size numerical data.

Title: The Aharonov-Casher phase is geometrical and not topological
Authors: Igor Kuzmenko, Y. B. Band, Yshai Avishai
Abstract: It is demonstrated that the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase is a geometric phase that, in general, depends on the details of the closed path taken by a particle with a magnetic moment that is subject to an electric field. Consequently, it is not a topological phase. The proof of this statement is obtained by developing a counterexample that elucidates the dependence of the AC phase on the details of the path. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the particular example considered here, paths having an Abelian AC phase factor, also have an AC phase that is path-independent, whereas paths having a non-Abelian AC phase factor may have an AC phase that is path-dependent (i.e., not topological).

Title: Non-positive energy quasidistributions in coherent collision models
Authors: Marco Pezzutto, Gabriele De Chiara, Stefano Gherardini
Abstract: We determine the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution associated to the stochastic instances of internal energy variations for the quantum system and environment particles in coherent Markovian collision models. In the case the interactions between the quantum system and the particles do not conserve energy, the KDQ of the non-energy-preserving stochastic work is also derived. These KDQ distributions can account for non-commutativity, and return the unperturbed average values and variances for a generic interaction-time, and generic local initial states of the quantum system and environment particles. Using this nonequilibrium-physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environment particles.

Title: Noise equals control
Authors: Eric De Giuli
Abstract: Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical mapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action functional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin dynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump processes, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $\pi$ as the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem in the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $\pi$ evolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that steers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is constantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and specifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control mapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why probabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.

Title: Open quantum systems with particle and bath driven by time-dependent fields
Authors: Daniele Gamba, Bingyu Cui, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) where the AC field plays an explicit role. The modified FDR is non-Markovian even if the undriven particle-bath system is Markovian without the external field. We provide an illustration of the usefulness of these results and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.

Title: Fuzzy permutation time irreversibility for nonequilibrium analysis of complex system
Authors: Wenpo Yao
Abstract: Permutation time irreversibility is an important method to quantify nonequilibrium characteristics of complex systems; however, ordinal pattern is a coarse-graining alternative of temporal structure and cannot accurately represent detailed structural information. This study aims to propose a fuzzy permutation time irreversibility (fpTIR) by measuring the difference between vector elements based on a negative exponential function. The amplitude permutation of vector is constructed and its membership degree is calculated; then, the difference in probability distribution between the forward and backward sequences is measured for fpTIR. To compare and measure the system's complexity, the Shannon entropy is calculated as the average amount of information in the fuzzy permutation probability distribution, i.e., fuzzy permutation entropy (fPEn). According to the surrogate theory, mode series are generated using logistic, Henon, and first-order autoregressive systems to verify the fpTIR, which is then used to analyze the heartbeats of patients with congestive heart failure and healthy elderly and young participants from the PhysioNet database. Results suggest that the fpTIR effectively measures the system's nonequilibrium characteristics, thus improving the accuracy of heartbeat analysis. However, in analyzing probability distributions, the fpTIR and fPEn exhibit discrepancies in the chaotic series and even opposite results in the heartbeats, wherein the results of fpTIR are consistent with the theory of complexity loss in aging and disease. Overall, the fpTIR accurately characterizes the structure of the sequences and enhances the accuracy of the nonequilibrium analysis of complex systems, providing a theoretical basis for exploring complex systems from the perspectives of nonequilibrium dynamics and entropy complexity.

Title: Large-scale quantization of trace I: Finite propagation operators
Authors: Matthias Ludewig, Guo Chuan Thiang
Abstract: Inspired by parallel developments in coarse geometry in mathematics and exact macroscopic quantization in physics, we present a family of general trace formulae which are universally quantized and depend only on large-scale geometric features of the input data. They generalize, to arbitrary dimensions, formulae found by Roe in his partitioned manifold index theorem, as well as the Kubo and Kitaev formulae for 2D Hall conductance used in physics.
