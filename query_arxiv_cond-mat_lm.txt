Title: Structural and mechanical characterisation of nylon fibre aggregates
Authors: L. Gey, R. Guenin, P. Le Gal, G. Verhille
Abstract: The study of fibre networks is of great importance due to their appearance in a wide range of natural and industrial processes. These networks are particularly complex because their properties depend not only on the characteristics of individual fibres but also on their collective arrangements within the network. In this study, we investigate the case of nylon fibre aggregates that were generated in a turbulent von Karman flow. The key properties of these aggregates are characterized, including their three-dimensional structures, analysed through X-ray tomography, and their mechanical responses. The results are compared with those observed for aegagropilae, a natural fibre aggregate commonly found on the Mediterranean sea shore

Title: Statistical density of particles in one dimensional interaction and Jellium Model
Authors: Mohamed Bouali
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional gas of $n$ charged particles confined by a potential and interacting through the Riesz potential or a more general potential. In equilibrium, and for symmetric potential the particles arrange themselves symmetrically around the origin within a finite region. Various models will be studied by modifying both the confining potential and the interaction potential. Focusing on the statistical properties of the system, we analyze the position of the rightmost particle, $x_{\text{max}}$, and show that its typical fluctuations are described by a limiting distribution different from the Tracy-Widom distribution found in the one-dimensional log-gas. We also derive the large deviation functions governing the atypical fluctuations of $x_{\text{max}}$ far from its mean.

Title: Hartree-Fock approximation for bosons with symmetry-adapted variational wave functions
Authors: B. R. Que, J. M. Zhang, H. F. Song, Y. Liu
Abstract: The Hartree-Fock approximation for bosons employs variational wave functions that are a combination of permanents. These are bosonic counterpart of the fermionic Slater determinants, but with the significant distinction that the single-particle orbitals used to construct a permanent can be arbitrary and do not need to be orthogonal to each other. Typically, the variational wave function may break the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, resulting in qualitative and quantitative errors in physical observables. A straightforward method to restore symmetry is projection after variation, where we project the variational wave function onto the desired symmetry sector. However, a more effective strategy is variation after projection, which involves first creating a symmetry-adapted variational wave function and then optimizing its parameters. We have devised a scheme to realize this strategy and have tested it on various models with symmetry groups ranging from $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\text{C}_L$, to $\text{D}_L$. In all the models and symmetry sectors studied, the variational wave function accurately estimates not only the energy of the lowest eigenstate but also the single-particle correlation function, as it approximate the target eigenstate very well on the wave function level. We have applied this method to study few-body bound states, superfluid fraction, and Yrast lines of some Bose-Hubbard models. This approach should be valuable for studying few-body or mesoscopic bosonic systems.

Title: Electrostatics in semiconducting devices I : The Pure Electrostatics Self Consistent Approximation
Authors: A. Lacerda-Santos, Xavier Waintal
Abstract: In quantum nanoelectronics devices, the electrostatic energy is the largest energy scale at play and, to a large extend, it determines the charge distribution inside the devices. Here, we introduce the Pure Electrostatic Self consistent Approximation (PESCA) that provides a minimum model that describes how to include a semiconductor in an electrostatic calculation to properly account for both screening and partial depletion due to e.g. field effect. We show how PESCA may be used to reconstruct the charge distribution from the measurement of pinch-off phase diagrams in the gate voltages space. PESCA can also be extended to account for magnetic field and calculate the edge reconstruction in the quantum Hall regime. The validity of PESCA is controlled by a small parameter $\kappa = C_g/C_q$, the ratio of the geometrical capacitance to the quantum capacitance, which is, in many common situations, of the order of 1%, making PESCA a quantitative technique for the calculation of the charge distribution inside devices.

Title: Photo-assisted shot noise probes multiple charge carriers in quantum Hall edges
Authors: Kishore Iyer, Flavio Ronetti, Benoît Grémaud, Thierry Martin, Thibaut Jonckheere, Jérôme Rech
Abstract: Fractional charges in the fractional quantum Hall effect were first observed via DC shot noise measurements of anyons tunneling at a quantum point contact (QPC). However, in scenarios with simultaneous tunneling of different types of charges at the QPC, the connection between DC shot noise and tunneling charge is less transparent. Photo-assisted shot noise (PASN), induced by periodic AC voltage, offers a promising alternative. Here, we investigate PASN in the hierarchical states of the fractional quantum Hall effect, where different types of charges are expected to tunnel concurrently at QPCs. In the particular case of the fractional quantum Hall state $\nu = 2/3$, our analysis demonstrates that PASN can be employed as a robust tool to detect different tunneling charges, even when the tunneling amplitude of one type is significantly smaller compared to the other. We show that the features predicted by our calculations are still visible for typical values of temperature and frequency achieved in state-of-the-art experiments. Our general formalism can be used to compute PASN for general Abelian quantum Hall systems with multiple edge modes and charge types.

Title: Nonvolatile Electric Control of Antiferromagnet CrSBr
Authors: Junhyeon Jo, Samuel Mañas-Valero, Eugenio Coronado, Fèlix Casanova, Marco Gobbi, Luis E. Hueso
Abstract: van der Waals magnets are emerging as a promising material platform for electric field control of magnetism, offering a pathway towards the elimination of external magnetic fields from spintronic devices. A further step is the integration of such magnets with electrical gating components which would enable nonvolatile control of magnetic states. However, this approach remains unexplored for antiferromagnets, despite their growing significance in spintronics. Here, we demonstrate nonvolatile electric field control of magnetoelectric characteristics in van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. We integrate a CrSBr channel in a flash-memory architecture featuring charge trapping graphene multilayers. The electrical gate operation triggers a nonvolatile 200 % change in the antiferromagnetic state of CrSBr resistance by manipulating electron accumulation/depletion. Moreover, the nonvolatile gate modulates the metamagnetic transition field of CrSBr and the magnitude of magnetoresistance. Our findings highlight the potential of manipulating magnetic properties of antiferromagnetic semiconductors in a nonvolatile way.

Title: Topological Computation by non-Abelian Braiding in Classical Metamaterials
Authors: Liyuan Chen, Matthew Fuertes, Bolei Deng
Abstract: We propose a realization of the one-dimensional Kitaev topological superconductor in classical mechanical metamaterials. By designing appropriate braiding protocols, we demonstrate that the system's mid-gap vibrational modes, termed classical Majorana zero modes (MZMs), accurately reproduce the braiding statistics predicted by quantum theory. Encoding four MZMs as a classical analog of a qubit, we implement all single-qubit Clifford gates through braiding, enabling the simulation of topological quantum computation in a classical system. Furthermore, we establish the system's topological protection by demonstrating its robustness against mechanical defects. This work provides a novel framework for exploring topological quantum computation using classical metamaterials and offers a pathway to realizing stable vibrational systems protected by topology.

Title: Proximity-Induced Nodal Metal in an Extremely Underdoped CuO$_2$ Plane in Triple-Layer Cuprates
Authors: Shin-ichiro Ideta, Shintaro Adachi, Takashi Noji, Shunpei Yamaguchi, Nae Sasaki, Shigeyuki Ishida, Shin-ichi Uchida, Takenori Fujii, Takao Watanabe, Wen O. Wang, Brian Moritz, Thomas P. Devereaux, Masashi Arita, Chung-Yu Mou, Teppei Yoshida, Kiyohisa Tanaka, Ting-Kuo Lee, Atsushi Fujimori
Abstract: ARPES studies have established that the high-$T_c$ cuprates with single and double CuO$_2$ layers evolve from the Mott insulator to the pseudogap state with a Fermi arc, on which the superconducting (SC) gap opens. In four- to six-layer cuprates, on the other hand, small hole Fermi pockets are formed in the innermost CuO$_2$ planes, indicating antiferromagnetism. Here, we performed ARPES studies on the triple-layer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ over a wide doping range, and found that, although the doping level of the inner CuO$_2$ plane was extremely low in underdoped samples, the $d$-wave SC gap was enhanced to the unprecedentedly large value of $\Delta_0\sim$100 meV at the antinode and persisted well above $T_{c}$ without the appearance of a Fermi arc, indicating a robust ``nodal metal''. We attribute the nodal metallic behavior to the unique local environment of the inner clean CuO$_2$ plane in the triple-layer cuprates, sandwiched by nearly optimally-doped two outer CuO$_2$ planes and hence subject to strong proximity effect from both sides. In the nodal metal, quasiparticle peaks showed electron-hole symmetry, suggesting $d$-wave pairing fluctuations. Thus the proximity effect on the innermost CuO${_2}$ plane is the strongest in the triple-layer cuprates, which explains why the $T_c$ reaches the maximum at the layer number of three in every multi-layer cuprate family.

Title: Tunable magnon band topology and magnon orbital Nernst effect in noncollinear antiferromagnets
Authors: D. Quang To, Dai Q. Ho, Joshua M. O. Zide, Lars Gundlach, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch, Garnett W. Bryant, Anderson Janotti, Matthew F. Doty
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the intrinsic magnon orbital Nernst effect (ONE) in noncollinear antiferromagnets with Kagomé spin systems. Our analysis reveals that an externally applied magnetic field induces topological phase transitions in the magnonic system, characterized by the closing and reopening of the band gap between distinct magnon bands. These transitions enable tunable control of the magnon orbital Nernst effect with applied magnetic field, with a pronounced enhancement in magnon orbital Nernst conductivity near the phase transition points. This tunability presents a promising direction for experimental detection of the magnon ONE.

Title: Site-selective observation of spin dynamics of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in frustrated Heisenberg chains
Authors: Diep Minh Nguyen, Azimjon A. Temurjonov, Daigorou Hirai, Zenji Hiroi, Oleg Janson, Hiroshi Yasuoka, Taku Matsushita, Yoshiaki Kobayashi, Yasuhiro Shimizu
Abstract: Low-energy spin dynamics is investigated by $^{35}$ Cl NMR measurements in a frustrated antiferromagnet Ca$_3$ReO$_5$Cl$_2$. The local spin susceptibility measured with the Knight shift behaves as a one-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet and remains constant down to low temperatures, as expected in a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ demonstrates a slowing down of atomic motions and a power-law evolution of spin correlation. The Luttinger parameter is enhanced in a site-selective manner depending on the form factor of dynamical spin susceptibility. The strong anisotropy of $T_1^{-1}$ reflects the strong spin-orbit coupling through Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The ground state exhibits an incommensurate antiferromagnetic ordering with low-lying magnon excitations.

Title: $d$-Wave Polarization-Spin Locking in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets
Authors: Zhao Liu, Nikhil V. Medhekar
Abstract: We report the emergence of an uncharted phenomenon, termed $d$-wave polarization-spin locking (PSL), in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets. This phenomenon arises from nontrivial Berry connections, resulting in perpendicular electronic polarizations in the spin-up and spin-down channels. Symmetry-protected $d$-wave PSL occurs exclusively in $d$-wave altermagnets with tetragonal layer groups. To identify 2D altermagnets capable of exhibiting this phenomenon, we propose a symmetry-eigenvalue-based criterion, and a rapid method by observing the spin-momentum locking. Using first-principles calculations, monolayer Cr$_2$X$_2$O (X = Se, Te) characterizes promising candidates for $d$-wave PSL, driven by the unusual charge order in these monolayers. This unique polarization-spin interplay leads to spin-up and spin-down electrons accumulating at orthogonal edges, enabling potential applications as spin filters or splitters in spintronics. Furthermore, $d$-wave PSL introduces an unexpected spin-driven ferroelectricity in conventional antiferromagnets. Such magnetoelectric coupling positions $d$-wave PSL as an ideal platform for fast antiferromagnetic memory devices. Our findings not only expand the landscape of altermagnets, complementing conventional collinear ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, but also highlight tantalizing functionalities in altermagnetic materials, potentially revolutionizing information technology.

Title: Effect of Particle Shape on Stratification in Drying Films of Binary Colloidal Mixtures
Authors: Binghan Liu, Gary S. Grest, Shengfeng Cheng
Abstract: The role of particle shape in evaporation-induced auto-stratification in dispersed colloidal suspensions is explored with molecular dynamics simulations of mixtures of solid spheres, aspherical particles, and hollow spheres. A unified framework is proposed for the stratification phenomena in systems that feature size or shape dispersity on the basis of two processes: diffusion and diffusiophoresis. In general, diffusion favors the accumulation of particles that diffuse more slowly at the evaporation front. However, particles with larger surface areas have larger diffusiophoretic mobilities and are more likely to be driven away from the evaporation front by the concentration gradients of other particles with smaller surface areas. In the case of a bidisperse colloidal suspension containing small and large solid spheres studied in most of the work reported in the literature, the competition between the two leads to the so-called "small-on-top" stratification when the suspension is rapidly dried, as diffusiophoresis dominates near the interface. Here we employ a computational model of composite particles that mimics the Rouse model of polymers, where the diffusion coefficient of a particle is inversely proportional to its mass. For a mixture of solid spheres and aspherical particles or hollow spheres with similar masses, the diffusion contrast is reduced and the solid spheres are always enriched at the evaporation front, as they have the smallest surface area for a given mass and therefore the lowest diffusiophoretic mobility. The unified framework is further corroborated with a case study of a mixture of solid and hollow spheres having the same outer radius and thus the same surface area. In this case, the diffusiophoretic contrast is suppressed and the solid spheres, which have a larger mass and thus a smaller diffusion coefficient, are found to accumulate at the evaporation front.

Title: The surface binding and energy issues in rational design of the separation membrane of Li||S batteries
Authors: Shuyu Cheng, Lijing Wang Chao Wu, Sheng Yang, Yang Liu, Yi Zhao, Dandan Cui, Shaowei Zhang, Shixue Dou, Hongfang Du, Liangxu Lin
Abstract: Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) represent one of the most promising next-generation energy storage technologies, offering exceptionally high energy densities. However, their widespread adoption remains hindered by challenges such as sluggish conversion reactions and the dissolution of lithium polysulfides, which lead to poor cycling stability and reduced performance. While significant efforts have been made to address these limitations, the energy storage capabilities of LSBs in practical devices remain far from achieving their full potential. This report delves into recent advancements in the rational design of separation membranes for LSBs, focusing on addressing fundamental issues related to surface binding and surface energy interactions within materials science. By examining the functionalization and optimization of separation membranes, we aim to highlight strategies that can guide the development of more robust and efficient LSBs, bringing them closer to practical implementation.

Title: Valley resolved dynamics of phonon bottleneck in semiconductor molybdenum ditelluride
Authors: Zhong Wang, Yijie Shi, Yu Pan, Min Li, Xi Wang, Zheng Zhang, Xiangyu Zhu, Fuyong Hua, Qian You, Chunlong Hu, Junjie He, Yu Ye, Wenxi Liang
Abstract: Semiconductor molybdenum ditelluride (2H-MoTe2) possess multiple valleys in the band structure, enriching its physical properties and potentials in applications. The understanding of its multivalley nature of fundamental processes involving population and relaxation of carriers and phonons is still evolving; particularly, the possible phonon bottleneck has not yet been addressed. Here, we investigate the carrier intra- and intervalley scattering and the phonon dynamics in different valleys in photoexcited few-layer 2H-MoTe2, by using the time resolved measurements of optical absorption and electron diffraction, together with the density functional theory calculation and molecular dynamics simulation. The pathways and timescales of carrier relaxation, accompanied with the emissions of optical phonons at the Brillouin zone center and acoustic phonons at the zone border are revealed. We present a couple of approaches to estimate the population of different phonon modes based on the results of optical and electron diffraction measurements, hence quantitatively identify the occurrences of phonon bottleneck located in different valleys. Our findings make possible to construct a comprehensive picture of the complex interactions between carriers and phonons in 2H-MoTe2 with the valley degree of freedom resolved.

Title: Klein Tunneling and Fabry-Pérot Resonances in Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Ayoub Bahlaoui, Youness Zahidi
Abstract: The paper discusses the Klein tunneling and Fabry-Pérot resonances of charge carriers through a rectangular potential barrier in twisted bilayer graphene. Within the framework of the low-energy excitations, the transmission probability and the conductance are obtained depending on the parameters of the problem. Owing to the different chirality in twisted bilayer graphene, the propagation of charge carriers exhibits an anisotropic behavior in transmission probability and Fabry-Pérot resonances. Moreover, we show that the anisotropy of the charge carriers induces asymmetry and deflection in the Fabry-Pérot resonances and Klein tunneling, and they are extremely sensitive to the height of the potential applied. Additionally, we found that the conductance is strongly sensitive to the barrier height but weakly sensitive to the barrier width. Therefore, it is possible to control the maxima and minima of the conductance of charge carriers in twisted bilayer graphene. With our results, we gain an in-depth understanding of tunneling properties in twisted bilayer graphene, which may help in the development and designing of novel electronic nanodevices based on anisotropic 2D materials.

Title: Multistate Control of Nonlinear Photocurrents in Optoferroelectrics via phase manipulation of light field
Authors: Ali Kazempour, Esmaeil Taghizadeh Sisakht, Mahmut Sait Okyay, Xiao Jiang, Shunsuke Sato, Noejung Park
Abstract: Ultrafast optical control of ferroelectricity based on short and intense light can be utilized to achieve accurate manipulations of ferroelectric materials, which may pave a basis for future breakthrough in nonvolatile memories. Here, we demonstrate that phase manipulation of electric field in the strong field sub-cycle regime induces a nonlinear injection current, efficiently coupling with the topology of band structure and enabling dynamic reversal of both current and polarization. Our time-dependent first-principles calculations reveal that tuning the phase of linearly or circularly polarized light through time-varying chirp, or constant carrier envelop phases within sub-laser-cycle dynamics effectively breaks the time-reversal symmetry, allowing the control over current and electronic polarization reversal over multi-ferroelectric states. Our time- and momentum-resolved transverse current analysis reveal the significance of Berry curvature higher order poles in the apparent association between the odd (even) orders of Berry curvature multipoles to odd (even) pseudo-harmonics in driving polarization dynamics reversal. We suggest that these phase manipulations of short pulse waveform may lead to unprecedented accurate control of nonlinear photocurrents and polarization states, which facilitate the development of precise ultrafast opto-ferroelectric devices.

Title: Stabilized biskyrmion states in annealed CoFeB bilayer with different interfaces
Authors: W. Al Saidi, S. Amara, M. T. Zar Myint, S. Al Harthi, G. Setti, R. Sbiaa
Abstract: This study investigates the stability of skyrmions and biskyrmions in perpendicular magnetic tunneling junctions with a thick CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB free layer. The samples showed a magnetoresistance of ~ 41% when annealed at 230 °C. Magnetic force microscopy revealed the existence of skyrmions and biskyrmions at room temperature in the as-deposited state and under an external magnetic field. Annealing at 330 °C enhanced interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and crystallinity, enabling the spontaneous coexistence of these topological structures. Micromagnetic simulations using MuMax3 explored the interplay between DMI strength, sign, and skyrmion chirality. Skyrmions exhibited repulsive interactions, while biskyrmions displayed attractive interactions due to the difference in helicities. The study highlights the influence of multilayer structure and varying Ta layer thicknesses on the DMI charility, which modulates the formation of complex spin textures. These results provide an understanding of skyrmion and biskyrmion dynamics and their potential for spintronic applications, including racetrack memory and data storage technologies.

Title: Harnessing Nonlinearity to Tame Wave Dynamics in Nonreciprocal Active Systems
Authors: Sayan Jana, Bertin Many Manda, Vassos Achilleos, Dimitrios J. Frantzeskakis, Lea Sirota
Abstract: We present a mechanism to generate unidirectional pulse-shaped propagating waves, tamed to exponential growth and dispersion, in active systems with nonreciprocal and nonlinear couplings. In particular, when all bulk modes are exponentially localized at one side of the lattice (skin effect), it is expected that wave dynamics is governed by amplification or decay until reaching the boundaries, even in the presence of dissipation. Our analytical results, and experimental demonstrations in an active electrical transmission line metamaterial, reveal that nonlinearity is a crucial tuning parameter in mediating a delicate interplay between nonreciprocity, dispersion, and dissipation. Consequently, undistorted unidirectional solitonic pulses are supported both for low and high nonreciprocity and pulse amplitude strength. The proposed mechanism facilitates robust pulse propagation in signal processing and energy transmission applications.

Title: Multi-component altermagnet: A general approach to generating multi-component structures with two-dimensional altermagnetism
Authors: Hongjie Peng, Sike Zeng, Ji-Hai Liao, Chang-Chun He, Xiao-Bao Yang, Yu-Jun Zhao
Abstract: Altermagnetism, as an unconventional antiferromagnetism, exhibits collinear-compensated magnetic order in real space and spin-splitting band structure in reciprocal space. In this work, we propose a general approach to generating multi-component structures with two-dimensional altermagnetism, based on symmetry analysis. Specifically, by analyzing the space group of the crystal structures and their subgroups, we systematically categorize equivalent atomic positions and arrange them into orbits based on symmetry operations. Chemical elements are then allowed to occupy all atomic positions on these orbits, generating candidate structures with specific symmetries. We present a general technique for generating collinear-compensated magnetic order, characterized by the symmetrical interconnection between opposite-spin sublattices, and employ first-principles calculations to determine magnetic ground states of multi-component materials. This approach integrates symmetry analysis with the screening of altermagnetic configurations to evaluate the likelihood of candidates possessing altermagnetism. To verify the methodology, we provide examples of previously unreported 2D altermagnets, such as Cr2Si2S3Se3, Fe2P2S3Se3, and V2O2BrI3, and evaluate their dynamical stability by calculating the phonon spectrum. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in generating stable multi-component structures with two-dimensional altermagnetism. Our research has significantly enriched the candidate materials for 2D altermagnet and provided a reference for experimental synthesis.

Title: Scaling of many-body localization transitions: Quantum dynamics in Fock space and real space
Authors: Thibault Scoquart, Igor V. Gornyi, Alexander D. Mirlin
Abstract: Many-body-localization (MBL) transitions are studied in a family of single-spin-flip spin-$\frac12$ models, including the one-dimensional (1D) chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, the quantum dot (QD) model with all-to-all pair interactions, and the quantum random energy model (QREM). We investigate the generalized imbalance that characterizes propagation in Fock space out of an initial basis state and, at the same time, can be efficiently probed by real-space measurements. For all models considered, the average imbalance and its quantum and mesoscopic fluctuations provide excellent indicators for the position of the MBL transition $W_c(n)$, where $n$ is the number of spins. Combining these findings with earlier results on level statistics, we determine phase diagrams of the MBL transitions in the $n$-$W$ plane. Our results provide evidence for a direct transition between the ergodic and MBL phases for each of the models, without any intermediate phase. For QREM and QD model, $W_c(n)$ grows as a power law of $n$ (with logarithmic corrections), in agreement with analytical predictions $W_c^{\rm QREM}(n) \sim n^{1/2} \ln n$ and $W_c^{\rm QD}(n) \gtrsim n^{3/4} \ln^{1/2} n$. This growth is in stark contrast to the 1D model, where $W_c(n)$ is essentially independent of $n$, consistent with the analytic expectation $W_c^{\rm 1D}(n\to \infty)= {\rm const}$. We also determine the scaling of the transition width $\Delta W (n) / W_c(n)$ and estimate the system size $n$ needed to study the asymptotic scaling behavior. While these values of $n$ are not accessible to exact simulations on a classical computer, they are within the reach of quantum simulators. Our results indicate feasibility of experimental studies of $n$-$W$ phase diagrams and scaling properties of MBL transitions in models of 1D and QD type and in their extensions to other spatial geometry or distance-dependent interactions.

Title: Accelerating Combinatorial Electrocatalyst Discovery with Bayesian Optimization: A Case Study in the Quaternary System Ni-Pd-Pt-Ru for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction
Authors: F. Thelen, R. Zehl, R. Zerdoumi, J. L. Bürgel, L. Banko, W. Schuhmann, A. Ludwig
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance electrocatalysts is crucial for advancing sustainable energy technologies. Compositionally complex solid solutions comprising multiple metals offer promising catalytic properties, yet their exploration is challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible compositions. In this work, we combine combinatorial sputtering of thin-film materials libraries and their high-throughput characterization with Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the quaternary composition space Ni-Pd-Pt-Ru for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. Using this method, the global activity optimum of pure Ru was identified after covering less than 20% of the complete composition space with six materials libraries. Six additional libraries were fabricated to validate the activity trend. The resulting dataset is used to formulate general guidelines for the efficient composition space exploration using combinatorial synthesis paired with Bayesian optimization.

Title: Geometric origin of supercurrents in Berry phase: Formula for computing currents from wavefunctions with correlation and particle number variation
Authors: B. Q. Song, J. D. H. Smith, J. Wang
Abstract: The complexity of itinerant and many-body nature in Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) wavefunctions has traditionally led to the use of coarse-grained order parameters for describing currents in superconductors (SC), rather than directly utilizing wavefunctions. In this work, we introduce a phase-based formula that enables the direct computation of currents from microscopic wavefunctions, accounting for correlation and particle number variations. Interestingly, the formulation draws parallels with insulators, suggesting a unified framework for understanding (intra-band) charge transport across two extremes of conductivity. A group velocity current $J_{band}{\propto}\frac{1}{\hbar}{\partial}_kE(k)$ is derived from Berry phase, independent of wave package dynamics, robust against correlation. Additionally, we identify a correlation-driven contribution, $J_{corr}$, which reveals that the pairing correlations ${\langle}c_kc_{-k}{\rangle}$ among dancing partners provide a current component beyond the velocity operator.

Title: Polarization of photoluminescence by optically driven orbital reconstruction in magnetically ordered CrCl3
Authors: Lanqing Zhou, Marjana Ležaić, Yuriy Mokrousov, Minh N. Bui, Renu Rani, Detlev Grützmacher, Beata E. Kardynał
Abstract: In this paper, we show that photoluminescence from CrCl3 bulk crystal exhibits a preferential polarization direction when films are magnetically ordered or strained. We verify the magnetization as responsible for the polarization by measuring the signal as a function of the temperature in Voigt configuration while applying the in-plane magnetic field. We show that phonon coupling contributing to vibronic transitions depolarizes the signal compared with zero phonon lines. We explain the data using DFT calculations, which reveal a magnetization-selective occupation of the low energy d-orbital triplet state of Cr3+ upon photon absorption. In addition, the calculations find that the excitation of one electron results in the excited state acquiring out-of-plane components of spin and very large orbital magnetic moments, in addition to a lattice deformation.

Title: Sampling through Algorithmic Diffusion in non-convex Perceptron problems
Authors: Elizaveta Demyanenko, Davide Straziota, Carlo Baldassi, Carlo Lucibello
Abstract: We analyze the problem of sampling from the solution space of simple yet non-convex neural network models by employing a denoising diffusion process known as Algorithmic Stochastic Localization, where the score function is provided by Approximate Message Passing. We introduce a formalism based on the replica method to characterize the process in the infinite-size limit in terms of a few order parameters, and, in particular, we provide criteria for the feasibility of sampling. We show that, in the case of the spherical perceptron problem with negative stability, approximate uniform sampling is achievable across the entire replica symmetric region of the phase diagram. In contrast, for the binary perceptron, uniform sampling via diffusion invariably fails due to the overlap gap property exhibited by the typical set of solutions. We discuss the first steps in defining alternative measures that can be efficiently sampled.

Title: A comprehensive study of out-of-equilibrium Kondo effect and Coulomb blockade
Authors: Matthieu Jeannin, Yuriel Núñez-Fernández, Thomas Kloss, Olivier Parcollet, Xavier Waintal
Abstract: We present a comprehensive set of numerically exact results for the Anderson model of a quantum dot coupled to two electrodes in non-equilibrium regime. We use a high order perturbative expansion in power of the interaction $U$, coupled to a cross-extrapolation method to long time and large interaction. The perturbative series is computed up to $20-25$ orders, using tensor cross-interpolation. We calculate the full Coulomb diamond bias voltage - gate voltage map, including its Kondo ridge, that forms the standard experimental signature of the Coulomb blockage and the Kondo effect. We present current-voltage characteristics that spans three orders of magnitude in bias voltage and display five different regimes of interest from probing the Kondo resonance at small bias to saturation at very high bias. Our technique also naturally produces time-resolved interaction quenches which we use to study the dynamics of the formation of the Kondo cloud. Finally, we predict several qualitatively new physical features that should be within reach of existing or upcoming experiments.

Title: Realization of discretized response in rare-earth vanadates accessed by AC susceptibility and magnetocaloric methods
Authors: Yuntian Li, Linda Ye, Mark P. Zic, Matthias S. Ikeda, Arkady Shekhter, Ian R. Fisher
Abstract: This report presents a new technique to probe the quantitative dynamical response of the magnetic field induced heating/cooling process in rare-earth vanadium materials. The approach combines AC susceptibility and AC caloric measurements to reveal the intrinsic timescale associated with the magnetic relaxation process of rare-earth ions at low temperatures. Utilizing the well-known crystal field effect in YbVO4, we prove and demonstrate a discretized thermal analysis through a common spin-lattice relaxation phenomenon. The demonstration experiment presented in this study provides a general approach to quantitatively address multiple measured quantities in one unified discretized thermal circuit analysis. It can be extended to study other magnetic, dielectric, and elastic materials exhibiting a complex response to an external driving field in the presence of intrinsic interactions and fluctuations, particularly when an energy dissipation process is within an accessible frequency regime.

Title: Observation of spin splitting in the surface electronic structure of antiferromagnet NdBi

Abstract: Spin splitting in electronic band structures via antiferromagnetic orders is a new route to control spin-polarized carriers that is available for spintronics applications. Here, we investigated the spin degree of freedom in the electronic band structures of the antiferromagnet NdBi using laser-based spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (laser-SARPES). Our laser-SARPES experiments revealed that the two surface bands that appear in the antiferromagnetic state are spin-polarized in opposite directions as a counterpart of the spin splitting. Moreover, we observed that the spin polarization is antisymmetric to the electron momentum, indicating that spin degeneracy is lifted due the breaking of inversion symmetry at the surface. These results are well reproduced by our density functional theory calculations with the single-q magnetic structure, implying that the spin-split surface state is determined by the breaking of inversion symmetry in concert with the antiferromagnetic order.

Title: Skyrmion Crystal in a Microwave Field
Authors: D. A. Garanin, E. M. Chudnovsky
Abstract: Temperature and field dependences of the frequencies of uniform modes of the skyrmion lattice in a 2D ferromagnetic film with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, as well as their damping, are computed within the model of classical spins. We show that the magnetization of the film exhibits Rabi-like oscillations when subjected to the microwave field at resonance with the low-frequency mode. Melting of the skyrmion lattice by resonant microwaves is investigated in terms of the time dependence of the orientational and translational order parameters. A distinct single-stage melting transition has been observed.

Abstract: Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has been used to create high-quality, large-scale two-dimensional van der Waals (2D vdW) materials. However, due to the strong adhesion between the substrate and deposited materials, the peel-off and dry transfer of MBE-grown vdW films onto other substrates has been challenging. This limits the study and use of MBE films for heterogeneous integration including stacked and twisted heterostructures. In this work, we develop a polymer-assisted dry transfer method and successfully perform full-film transfer of various MBE-grown 2D vdW materials including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), topological insulators (TI) and 2D magnets. In particular, we transfer air-sensitive 2D magnets, characterize their magnetic properties, and compare them with as-grown materials. The results show that the transfer technique does not degrade the magnetic properties, with the Curie temperature and hysteresis loops exhibiting similar behaviors after the transfer. Our results enable further development of heterogeneous integration of 2D vdW materials based on MBE growth.

Title: Topological descriptors for the electron density of inorganic solids
Authors: Nathan J. Szymanski, Alexander Smith, Prodromos Daoutidis, Christopher J. Bartel
Abstract: Descriptors play an important role in data-driven approaches for materials design. While most descriptors of inorganic crystalline materials emphasize structure and composition, they often neglect the electron density - a complex yet fundamental quantity that governs material properties. In this work, we introduce Betti curves as topological descriptors that compress the electron density into compact representations. Derived from persistent homology, Betti curves capture bonding characteristics by encoding components, cycles, and voids across varied electron density thresholds. Machine learning models trained on Betti curves outperform those trained on raw electron densities by an average of 33 percentage points in classifying structure prototypes, predicting thermodynamic stability, and distinguishing metals from non-metals. Shannon entropy calculations reveal that Betti curves retain comparable information content to electron density while requiring two orders of magnitude less data. By combining expressive power with compact representation, Betti curves highlight the potential of topological data analysis to advance the modeling and design of inorganic materials.

Title: Charge-state dependent spin-orbit coupling and quantum phase transitions in Ir-Ru oxides
Authors: Kuldeep Kargeti, Bidyut Mallick, Vladislav Borisov, Sk. Soyeb Ali, Johan Hellsvik, Olle Eriksson, S. K. Panda
Abstract: The competition between kinematic, relativistic and Coulombic interactions in iridium-based oxides has spurred intense experimental and theoretical investigations regarding the electronic structure and magnetism. We argue here that the Iridium-Ruthenium triple perovskites, Ba$_3$MRuIrO$_9$ (M = Li, Mg and In), are of particular interest in this regard. We show here, using ab-initio theory, that the nominal charge states of Ir can be tuned from +6 to +4 by choosing non-magnetic 'M' ions as Li (+1), Mg(+2) and In (+3). This variation modulates the influence of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) which is found here to be negligible in Ba$_3$LiRuIrO$_9$, moderate in Ba$_3$MgRuIrO$_9$ and determining in Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$. Our analysis classifies Ba$_3$LiRuIrO$_9$ as a band-insulator, Ba$_3$MgRuIrO$_9$ as a SOC and correlation driven insulator and Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$ as $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ Mott-Hubbard insulator. As reported here, correlated electronic structure theory results in sizeable magnetic moments of both Ru and Ir atoms in these systems and atomistic spin-dynamics simulations capture the experimental Néel temperature for Ba$_3$LiRuIrO$_9$ and Ba$_3$MgRuIrO$_9$ and provide evidence for a phase transition for Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$ when T $\to$ 0 K, to a multi-valley magnetic state with strong magnetic frustration. The theory identifies the presence of Kitaev interaction among the iridium atoms in Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$. The realization of such strong anisotropic interactions helps to stabilize a particularly complex energy landscape of Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$, that opens up for exotic magnetic quantum phases.

Title: Perfect spin-triplet pairing in two-dimensional Ising superconductors purified by indirect excitons
Authors: Chuanyi Zhang, Yu Li, Ping Cui, Zhenyu Zhang
Abstract: Much research effort has been devoted to interfacial or two-dimensional (2D) superconductors, but the underlying pairing mechanisms and pairing symmetries are highly controversial in most cases. Here we propose an innovative approach to probe the pairing symmetry of 2D superconductors, based on a van der Waals heterostructure consisting of a prototypical 2D Ising superconductor coupled with a 2D hole gas through an insulating spacer. We first show that, by tuning the Coulomb attraction between the superconducting and hole layers, the gap of the corresponding indirect exciton insulators is tuned as well, resulting in contrasting manifestations of the distinct superconducting channels with spin-singlet (s-, extended s-, and d-wave) and spin-triplet (p- and f-wave) pairings. Strikingly, we find that the application of in-plane magnetic fields can suppress all other channels while selecting the spin-triplet p-wave channel to be the pure superconducting state, thus providing an ideal and practical platform for realizing highly desirable topological superconductivity. Such an approach can also be readily extended to other types of superconducting systems, offering unprecedented opportunities to probe the microscopic mechanisms of unconventional superconductivity.

Title: Inversion-asymmetric itinerant antiferromagnets by the space group symmetry
Authors: Changhee Lee, P. M. R. Brydon
Abstract: We investigate the appearance of an inversion-asymmetric antiferromagnetism due to an itinerant mechanism in nonsymmorphic systems with magnetic ions at Wyckoff position of multiplicity 2. The key symmetries which underpin the existence of such phases are established, and we derive a Landau free energy from a general microscopic electronic Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals that the stable antiferromagnetic order is largely determined by the symmetries of Wyckoff position, the nature of the nesting between electronic bands, and the presence of anisotropy or nesting in high-symmetry planes of the Brillouin zone. We illustrate our conclusions with specific microscopic models.

Title: Correlated Dephasing in a Piezoelectrically Transduced Silicon Phononic Waveguide
Authors: Oliver A. Hitchcock, Felix M. Mayor, Wentao Jiang, Matthew P. Maksymowych, Sultan Malik, Amir H. Safavi-Naeini
Abstract: Nanomechanical waveguides offer a multitude of applications in quantum and classical technologies. Here, we design, fabricate, and characterize a compact silicon single-mode phononic waveguide actuated by a thin-film lithium niobate piezoelectric element. Our device directly transduces between microwave frequency photons and phonons propagating in the silicon waveguide, providing a route for coupling to superconducting circuits. We probe the device at millikelvin temperatures through a superconducting microwave resonant matching cavity to reveal harmonics of the silicon waveguide and extract a piezoelectric coupling rate $g/2\pi= 1.1$ megahertz and a mechanical coupling rate $f/2\pi=5$ megahertz. Through time-domain measurements of the silicon mechanical modes, we observe energy relaxation timescales of $T_{1,\text{in}} \approx 500$ microseconds, pure dephasing timescales of $T_\phi \approx {60}$ microseconds and dephasing dynamics that indicate the presence of an underlying frequency noise process with a non-uniform spectral distribution. We measure phase noise cross-correlations between silicon mechanical modes and observe detuning-dependent positively-correlated frequency fluctuations. Our measurements provide valuable insights into the dynamics and decoherence characteristics of hybrid piezoelectric-silicon acoustic devices, and suggest approaches for mitigating and circumventing noise processes for emerging quantum acoustic systems.

Title: Long-Range Spin-Orbit-Coupled Magnetoelectricity in Type-II Multiferroic NiI$_2$
Authors: Weiyi Pan, Zefeng Chen, Dezhao Wu, Weiqin Zhu, Zhiming Xu, Lianchuang Li, Junsheng Feng, Bing-Lin Gu, Wenhui Duan, Changsong Xu
Abstract: Type-II multiferroics, where spin order induces ferroelectricity, exhibit strong magnetoelectric coupling. However, for the typical 2D type-II multiferroic NiI$_2$, the underlying magnetoelectric mechanism remains unclear. Here, applying generalized spin-current model, together with first-principles calculations and a tight-binding approach, we build a comprehensive magnetoelectric model for spin-induced polarization. Such model reveals that the spin-orbit coupling extends its influence to the third-nearest neighbors, whose contribution to polarization rivals that of the first-nearest neighbors. By analyzing the orbital-resolved contributions to polarization, our tight-binding model reveals that the long-range magnetoelectric coupling is enabled by the strong $e_g$-$p$ hopping of NiI$_2$. Monte Carlo simulations further predict a Bloch-type magnetic skyrmion lattice at moderate magnetic fields, accompanied by polar vortex arrays. These findings can guide the discovery and design of strongly magnetoelectric multiferroics.

Title: Turbulence-Induced Fluctuating Interfaces in Heterogeneously-Active Suspensions
Authors: Siddhartha Mukherjee, Kunal Kumar, Samriddhi Sankar Ray
Abstract: We investigate the effects of heterogeneous (spatially varying) activity in a hydrodynamical model for dense bacterial suspensions, confining ourselves to experimentally realizable, simple, quenched, activity patterns. We show that the evolution of the bacterial velocity field under such activity patterning leads to the emergence of hydrodynamic interfaces separating spatially localized turbulence from jammed frictional surroundings. We characterise the intermittent and multiscale fluctuations of this interface and also investigate how heterogeneity influences mixing via the residence times of Lagrangian tracers. This work reveals how naturally occurring heterogeneities could decisively steer active flows into more complex configurations than those typically studied, opening up parallels to droplet dynamics, front propagation and turbulent mixing layers.

Title: Quantum metric non-linear Hall effect in an antiferromagnetic topological insulator thin-film EuSn2As2
Authors: Hung-Ju Tien, Hsin Lin, Liang Fu, Tay-Rong Chang
Abstract: The quantum geometric structure of electrons introduces fundamental insights into understanding quantum effects in materials. One notable manifestation is the non-linear Hall effect (NLHE), which has drawn considerable interest for its potential to overcome the intrinsic limitations of semiconductor diodes at low input power and high frequency. In this study, we investigate NLHE stemming from the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, specifically the quantum metric, in an antiferromagnetic topological material, EuSn2As2, using density functional theory. Our calculations predict a remarkable NLHE arising from a symmetry-protected, single Type-II surface Dirac cone in the even-numbered-layer two-dimensional slab thin-film, yielding a non-linear Hall conductivity exceeding 20 mA/V2-an order of magnitude larger than previously reported. This single Dirac band dispersion represents the simplest model for generating NLHE, positioning the EuSn2As2 thin-film as a hydrogen atom for NLHE systems. Additionally, we observe NLHE from band-edge states near the Fermi level. Our findings also reveal that 30% phosphorus (P) doping can double the non-linear Hall conductivity. With its substantial and tunable NLHE, EuSn2As2 thin-films present promising applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics and rectification devices.

Title: Curved crack paths are predicted by elastic-charges
Authors: Oran Szachter, Emmanuel Siefert, Mokhtar Adda-Bedia, Eran Sharon, Michael Moshe
Abstract: Predicting crack trajectories in brittle solids remains an open challenge in fracture mechanics due to the non-local nature of crack propagation and the way cracks modify their surrounding medium. Here, we develop a framework for analytically predicting crack trajectories, similar to predicting the motion of charged particles in external fields within Newtonian mechanics. We demonstrate that a crack can be described as a distribution of elastic charges, and within the framework of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), its interaction with the background stress can be approximated by a singular geometric charge at the crack tip. The cracks motion is then predicted as the propagation of this singular charge within the unperturbed stress field. We apply our approach to study crack trajectories near defects and validate it through experiments on flat elastomer sheets containing an edge dislocation. The experimental results show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, including the convergence of curved crack trajectories toward a single focal point. We discuss future extension of our theory to the motion of multiple interacting cracks. Our findings highlight the potential of the elastic-charges approach to significantly advance classical fracture mechanics by enabling analytical solutions to problems traditionally requiring numerical methods.

Title: Spontaneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Polydisperse Achiral Near-Rigid Nematogens
Authors: William S. Fall, Henricus H. Wensink
Abstract: Understanding chirality transfer from the molecular to the macroscopic scale poses a significant challenge in soft and biological condensed matter physics. Many nanorods of biological origin not only have chiral molecular features but also exhibit a spread in contour length leading to considerable size dispersity. On top of this, random backbone fluctuations are ubiquitous for non-rigid particles but their role in chirality transfer remains difficult to disentangle from that of their native chirality imparted by their effective shape or surface architecture. We report spontaneous entropy-driven chiral symmetry breaking from molecular simulations of cholesteric liquid-crystals formed from achiral bead-spring rods with a continuous spread in contour length and marginal chain bending. The symmetry-breaking is caused by long-lived chiral conformations of long rods undergoing chiral synchronization leading to a homochiral twisted nematic. A simple theory demonstrates that even without chiral synchronization, the presence of shape-persistent configurational fluctuations along with length-dispersity can be harnessed to generate non-zero chirality at moderate polydispersity.

Title: Ultrashort 30-fs laser photoablation for high-precision and damage-free diamond machining
Authors: Maksym Rybachuk, Bakhtiar Ali, Igor V. Litvinyuk
Abstract: A 30-fs, 800 nm, 1 kHz femtosecond was used to photoablate diamond across radiant energy doses of 1 - 500 kJ/cm^2, with fluences of 10 - 50 J/cm^2 and, pulse counts from 100 to 10,000. The objective was to maximise material removal while minimising surface roughness (Ra) by operating above the photoablation threshold. Results demonstrate that 30-fs laser photoablation achieves Ra <0.1 \mum, meeting both high- and ultra-high-precision machining standards, while maintaining surface integrity and preventing heat-affected zone (HAZ) damage. At 1 kJ/cm^2 (10 J/cm^2 fluence, 100 pulses), an Ra of 0.09 \mum was achieved, satisfying ultra-high precision criteria (Ra <0.1 \mum). Additionally, doses below 10 kJ/cm^2 consistently met high-precision machining requirements (Ra <0.2 \mum). Photoablation efficiency peaked below 50 kJ/cm^2, after which material removal diminished, indicating non-linear process limitations. The sp3-diamond phase remained intact, as confirmed by the unchanged T2g Raman mode at 1332 cm^-1, with no detectable Raman G or D modes, confirming the absence of sp2-related graphitization, structural disorder, of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre annealing. These findings establish 30 fs laser processing as a high-precision, damage-free approach for diamond machining, with promising applications in NV centre-containing quantum materials and advanced tooling.

Title: Lifted TASEP: long-time dynamics,generalizations, and continuum limit
Authors: Fabian H.L. Essler, Jeanne Gipouloux, Werner Krauth
Abstract: We investigate the lifted TASEP and its generalization, the GL-TASEP. We analyze the spectral properties of the transition matrix of the lifted TASEP using its Bethe ansatz solution, and use them to determine the scaling of the relaxation time (the inverse spectral gap) with particle number. The observed scaling with particle number was previously found to disagree with Monte Carlo simulations of the equilibrium autocorrelation times of the structure factor and of other large-scale density correlators for a particular value of the pullback $\alpha_{\rm crit}$. We explain this discrepancy. We then construct the continuum limit of the lifted TASEP, which remains integrable, and connect it to the event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The critical pullback $\alpha_{\rm crit}$ then equals the system pressure. We generalize the lifted TASEP to a large class of nearest-neighbor interactions, which lead to stationary states characterized by non-trivial Boltzmann distributions. By tuning the pullback parameter in the GL-TASEP to a particular value we can again achieve a polynomial speedup in the time required to converge to the steady state. We comment on the possible integrability of the GL-TASEP.

Title: Tunable electron-electron interaction and anomalous enhancement of large-momentum scattering in moiré superlattices
Authors: Taiki Sato, Hiroaki Ishzuka
Abstract: Using a microscopic model, we show that the electron-electron interaction of flat bands deviates significantly from the Coulomb interaction. In particular, we find that large-momentum scattering is enhanced at $\theta\lesssim4^\circ$, with a non-monotonic momentum dependence appearing near the magic angle. For $\theta \gtrsim 1.2^\circ$, the enhanced large-momentum scattering can be attributed to the compact Wannier function. On the other hand, for $\theta\lesssim1.2^\circ$, the nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the interaction matrix cannot be explained by a simple Wannier orbital, indicating a nontrivial modification to the el-el interaction. Notably, the range of angles $\theta$ where the large-momentum scattering is enhanced differs from the magic angles at which nearly-flat bands emerge, suggesting that the angle dependence of material properties provides information about the effect of interaction. The results highlight unusual features of the interaction in moiré graphene.

Title: Field-Modulated Crystal Transport in Altermagnetic Topological materials
Authors: Xiuxian Yang, Jingming Shi, Shifeng Qian, Xiaodong Zhou, Yinwei Li
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), a recently proposed third type of collinear magnetic phase, has garnered significant attention due to its extraordinary features, including nonrelativistic alternating spin-splitting, spin-degenerate nodal topology, and anisotropic crystal transport. Here, we explore the role of inherent altermagnetic topology in crystal transport phenomena (such as crystal Hall, Nernst, and thermal Hall effects) in several room-temperature altermagnets, including tetragonal \textit{X}V$_2$\textit{Y}$_2$O (\textit{X} = K, Rb, Cs; \textit{Y} = S, Se, Te), RuO$_2$, MnF$_2$, as well as hexagonal CrSb and MnTe. Notably, in \textit{X}V$_2$\textit{Y}$_2$O, the first experimentally realized layered altermagnets, crystal transport is governed by altermagnetic pseudonodal surfaces, emphasizing the purely topological contributions to crystal transport. Furthermore, crystal transport exhibits strong anisotropy relative to the N{é}el vector. Interestingly, we demonstrate that spin-canting, a unique method for selectively controlling the altermagnetic topology and crystal transport, can substantially enhance the magnitude of these phenomena while preserving the alternating spin characteristics in both real and momentum space. Our findings provide an effective strategy for manipulating crystal transport in altermagnets, offering valuable insights for their potential applications in spintronics and spin caloritronics.

Title: Discovery of High-Temperature Superconducting Ternary Hydrides via Deep Learning
Authors: Xiaoyang Wang, Chengqian Zhang, Zhenyu Wang, Hanyu Liu, Jian Lv, Han Wang, Weinan E, Yanming Ma
Abstract: The discovery of novel high-temperature superconductor materials holds transformative potential for a wide array of technological applications. However, the combinatorially vast chemical and configurational search space poses a significant bottleneck for both experimental and theoretical investigations. In this study, we employ the design of high-temperature ternary superhydride superconductors as a representative case to demonstrate how this challenge can be well addressed through a deep-learning-driven theoretical framework. This framework integrates high-throughput crystal structure exploration, physics-informed screening, and accurate prediction of superconducting critical temperatures. Our approach enabled the exploration of approximately 36 million ternary hydride structures across a chemical space of 29 elements, leading to the identification of 144 potential high-Tc superconductors with predicted Tc > 200 K and superior thermodynamic stability at 200 GPa. Among these, 129 compounds spanning 27 novel structural prototypes are reported for the first time, representing a significant expansion of the known structural landscape for hydride superconductors. This work not only greatly expands the known repertoire of high-Tc hydride superconductors but also establishes a scalable and efficient methodology for navigating the complex landscape of multinary hydrides.

Abstract: Cloaking is a method of making obstacles undetectable. Here we cloak unit cells of a magnetic pattern squeezed into an otherwise periodic pattern from a magnetically driven colloidal flow. We apply a time-periodic external magnetic field loop to an ensemble of paramagnetic colloidal particles on the deformed periodic magnetic pattern. There exist topological loops where the particles avoid to trespass the cloaked regions by robustly traveling around the cloak. Afterwards the ensemble of particles continues with a motion identical to the motion as if the distorted region were nonexistent and the ensemble would have trespassed the undeformed region. We construct the cloak by continuously squeezing new conformally mapped unit cells between those of the originally undeformed and periodic pattern. We find a cloaking/decloaking transition as a function of the size and shape of the newly squeezed-in region. A cloak is scalable to arbitrary size if the biholomorphic map from the undistorted periodic lattice to the region outside the cloak locally rotates by less than an angle of forty five degrees. The work generalizes cloaking from waves toward particles.

Title: Spin-charge Kondo effect for a quantum dot with side coupled Majorana zero mode
Authors: Haojie Shen, Wei Su, Mengnan Chen, Xiaoqun Wang
Abstract: We investigate a minimal system consisting of a quantum dot coupled to a Majorana zero mode and a normal lead. We identify the underlying screening process as a novel spin-charge Kondo effect, where the low-energy spin and charge degrees of freedom of the Majorana zero mode-quantum dot subsystem are fully screened by those in the normal lead, resulting in the formation of a spin-charge singlet. An effective low-energy model is derived, with charge fluctuations appropriately accounted for. This spin-charge Kondo effect is found to be consistent with the spin-dependent Andreev/normal boundary conditions induced by the Majorana zero mode. We demonstrate that the anomalous substructure in the spectrum and thermodynamic properties is closely tied to the proportion of the charge component in the screening cloud. The spin-charge screening cloud exhibits scaling behavior analogous to that of traditional Kondo systems, though the sub-leading even-odd effect is subtly modified by the boundary conditions. These findings enhance our understanding of Kondo physics and resolve key debates on quantum dot nanostructures with Majorana zero modes.

Title: Loop-current order through the kagome looking glass
Authors: Rafael M. Fernandes, Turan Birol, Mengxing Ye, David Vanderbilt
Abstract: In loop-current states, interacting electronic degrees of freedom collectively establish interatomic currents, in a rare example of magnetism in which spin degrees of freedom do not play the primary role. The main impact of such states on the electronic spectrum is not via the standard Zeeman term, but via the kinetic energy, in which hopping parameters develop non-trivial phases that break time-reversal symmetry. The recent proposal of loop-current states in kagome superconductors has stimulated renewed interest in this exotic type of magnetism. In this perspective, we use kagome materials as a scaffolding to frame the basic phenomenology of loop-current states. We provide an overview of the group-theoretical properties of loop currents, as well as of relevant microscopic models and ab initio methods. Particular emphasis is given to the comparison with spin-density waves in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, as well as to the anharmonic coupling with charge-density waves, which is present in systems with threefold rotational symmetry. We also provide a brief overview of the current status of loop-current order in kagome metals and discuss open challenges including their experimental detection and interplay with other orders.

Title: X-ray Thomson scattering studies on spin-singlet stabilization of highly compressed H-like Be ions heated to two million degrees Kelvin
Authors: M. W. C. Dharma-wardana, Dennis. D. Klug (NRC-Canada)
Abstract: Experiments at the US National Ignition Facility (NIF) [Döppner et al., Nature {\bf 618}, 270-275 (2023)] have created highly compressed hot hydrogen-like Be plasmas. Published analyses of the the NIF experiment have used finite-$T$ multi-atom density-functional theory (DFT) with Molecular dynamics (MD), and Path-Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations. These methods are very expensive to implement and often lack physical transparency. Here we (i) relate their results to simpler first-principles average-atom results, (ii) establish the feasibility of rapid data analysis, with good accuracy and gain in physical transparency, and (iii) show that the NIF experiment reveals high-$T$ spin-singlet pairing of hydrogen-like Be ions with near neighbours. Our analysis predicts such stabilization over a wide range of compressed densities for temperatures close to two million Kelvin. Calculations of structure factors $S(k)$ for electrons or ions, the Raleigh weight and other quantities of interest to X-ray Thomson scattering are presented. We find that the NIF data at the scattering wavevector $k_{sc}$ of 7.89 Å$^{-1}$ are more consistent with a density of $20\pm2$ g/cm$^3$, mean ionization $\bar{Z}=$3.25, at a temperature of $\simeq$ 1,800,000 K than the 34 g/cm$^3, \bar{Z}=3.4$ proposed by the NIF team. The relevance of ion-electron coupled-modes in studying small $k_{sc}$ data is indicated.

Title: Modulation of superconductivity across a Lifshitz transition in alternating-angle twisted quadrilayer graphene
Authors: Isabelle Y. Phinney, Andrew Zimmerman, Zeyu Hao, Patrick J. Ledwith, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Ashvin Vishwanath, Philip Kim
Abstract: We report electric field-controlled modulation of the Fermi surface topology and explore its effects on the superconducting state in alternating-angle twisted quadrilayer graphene (TQG). The unique combination of flat and dispersive bands in TQG allows us to simultaneously tune the band structure through carrier density, $n$, and displacement field, $D$. From density-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations and Hall measurements, we quantify the $D$-dependent bandwidth of the flat and dispersive bands and their hybridization. In the high $|D|$ regime, the increased bandwidth favors the single particle bands, which coincides exactly with the vanishing of the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, showing that superconductivity in TQG is strongly bound to the symmetry-broken state. For a range of lower $|D|$ values, a Lifshitz transition occurs when the flat and dispersive band Fermi surfaces merge within the $\nu=+2$ symmetry-broken state. The superconducting state correspondingly shows an enhanced $T_c$, suggesting that the superconducting condensate is strongly dependent on the Fermi surface topology and density of states within this symmetry-broken state.

Title: Callan-Rubakov effects in topological insulators
Authors: Yusuke O. Nakai, Reuel Dsouza, Daichi Nakamura, Shu Hamanaka, Andreas P. Schnyder, Masatoshi Sato
Abstract: The Callan-Rubakov effect describes monopole-catalyzed proton decay. While this effect is fundamental for quantum field theories, its experimental observation has remained far from reality. Here, we reveal a similar, but experimentally reachable, defect-catalysis of the quantum anomaly in topological materials. In particular, surface Dirac fermions on topological insulators develop a distinct localized state at the position of dislocations or $\pi$-fluxes, which mediates spin-flip time-reversal breaking scattering or absorption of electrons. Despite the Hermiticity of topological insulators, a non-Hermitian topological number guarantees the robust existence of the localized state. Our finding implies that non-magnetic defects may behave like magnetic impurities on surfaces of topological insulators. Using the K-theory classification, we generalize this condensed-matter version of the Callan-Rubakov effect to other classes of topological materials.

Title: Unraveling Enhanced Superconductivity in Single-layer FeSe through Substrate Surface Terminations
Authors: Qiang Zou, Gi-Yeop Kim, Jong-Hoon Kang, Basu Dev Oli, Zhuozhi Ge, Michael Weinert, Subhasish Mandal, Chang-Beom Eom, Si-Young Choi, Lian Li
Abstract: Single-layer FeSe films grown on (001) SrTiO3 substrates have shown a significant increase in superconducting transition temperature compared to bulk FeSe. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain such enhancement, including electron doping, interfacial electron-phonon coupling, and strong electron correlations. To pinpoint the primary driver, we grew FeSe films on SrTiO3 substrates with coexisting TiO2 and SrO surface terminations. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed a larger superconducting gap of 17 meV for FeSe on TiO2 compared to 11 meV on SrO. Tunneling spectroscopy also showed a larger work function on SrO, leading to reduced charge transfer, as confirmed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed distinctive interfacial atomic-scale structures, with the Se-Fe-Se tetrahedral angle changing from 109.9° on SrO to 105.1° on TiO2. Compared to dynamical mean field theory calculations, these results suggest optimal electron correlations in FeSe/TiO2 for enhancing high-temperature superconductivity.

Title: Symmetry-breaking effects on spin-orbit torque switching in ferromagnetic semiconductors with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
Authors: Apu Kumar Jana, Sanghoon Lee
Abstract: This study explores the mechanisms of spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching in ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMS) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), emphasizing the impact of symmetry-breaking. Using micromagnetic simulations based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, we examine several symmetry-breaking factors, including bias field misalignment, interlayer exchange coupling, out-of-plane spin polarization, and tilted magnetic anisotropy. The results reveal that bias field misalignment relative to the film plane significantly distorts the SOT switching hysteresis. Additionally, intrinsic symmetry-breaking effects, such as internal coupling fields, out-of-plane spin polarization, and tilted anisotropy, facilitate field-free SOT (FF-SOT) switching without external bias fields. Each type of FF-SOT switching exhibits distinct characteristics, including hysteresis shifts, switching ratios, and saturated magnetization. This work emphasizes the role of symmetry-breaking in FF-SOT switching and offers fundamental information for interpreting FF-SOT switching observed from FMS films in experiments, contributing to the optimization of SOT efficiency and the advancement of spintronics technologies.

Title: Room-temperature field-tunable radiofrequency rectification in epitaxial SrIrO3 films
Authors: Liang Zhou, Zongzheng Du, Jinhua Wang, Pingbo Chen, Bicong Ye, Tao Feng, Jiahao Yang, Zehao Xiao, Meng Yang, Junxue Li, Wenqing Zhang, Hai-zhou Lu, Hongtao He
Abstract: Although significant advancements have been made in wireless technologies and portable devices, it remains a challenge for high-frequency and nanowatt-level radiofrequency rectification. In this work, we report a pronounced radiofrequency rectification up to 37 GHz in nominally centrosymmetric SrIrO3 epitaxial films, with the minimum detectable power as low as ~300 nanowatts. Strikingly, the SrIrO3 rectifier is highly field-tunable and exhibits a strong in-plane field anisotropy, thus showing a unique advantage in broad-band radiofrequency rectification. The rectification effect can persist up to at least 360 K and shows a sensitive temperature dependence including a sign inversion. By a systematic study of the nonlinear transport properties of SrIrO3, it is further revealed that the radiofrequency rectification originates from the nonlinear Hall effect with the dominant contribution from field-induced Berry curvature dipole. Our work demonstrates the superior performance of the field-tunable SrIrO3 rectifiers, unleashing the great application potential of centrosymmetric materials in harvesting and detecting ambient electromagnetic energy.

Title: Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Magnetic Transitions in Sr3Ru2O7 films
Authors: R. Choudhary, A. Rajapitamahuni, S. Guo, Qi. Jiang, J.-H. Chu, K. A. Mkhoyan, B. Jalan
Abstract: In scientific research, both positive and negative results play crucial role in advancing the field. Negative results provide valuable insights that can guide future experiments and prevent repeated failures. Here we present our growth attempts of Sr3Ru2O7 thin films using the hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. X-ray diffraction suggests nominally phase-pure films. A combination of magnetoresistance and magnetization measurements exhibits an onset of ferromagnetism at 170 K and 100 K, along with a metamagnetic-like transition at 40 K. These results could initially be interpreted as intrinsic behavior of strain-engineered Sr3Ru2O7 films. However, detailed microstructural analysis reveals intergrowths of Sr2RuO4, Sr4Ru3O10, and SrRuO3 phases, dispersed throughout the film. Our findings suggest that the Sr3Ru2O7 films are likely paramagnetic, with the observed ferromagnetism arising from the Sr4Ru3O10 and SrRuO3 phases. Our results highlight the need for detailed microstructural analysis when interpreting new material properties influenced by strain and microstructure.

Title: Anti-aligning Self-propelled Model of Two Species: Emergence of \textit{Self-organized Heterogeneous Aligned and Clustered Order}
Authors: Takahiro Oki, Tetsuhiro S. Hatakeyama, Seiya Nishikawa, Shuji Ishihara, Toshinori Namba
Abstract: Self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions generally do not form a polar order. However, in this Letter, we show that when multiple types of such particles coexist and interact through aligning interactions between different species, a global polar order can emerge through the formation of elongated clusters with alternating domains of each species. By developing a mean-field theory, we reveal the conditions for cluster formation and characterize the resulting patterns. Our findings highlight the critical role of inter-species interactions in the emergence of complex ordered states.

Authors: Karthik R, Yiwen Zheng, Rajesh Kumar Sahu, Punathil Raman Sreeram, Soma Banik, Aniruddh Vashisth, Chandra Sekhar Tiwary
Abstract: The efficiency of thermoelectric devices can be significantly enhanced by maintaining a stable temperature gradient, which can be achieved through localized heating. Radio waves serve as an ideal heat source for this purpose. In this study, we demonstrate the enhancement of thermoelectric performance in earth-abundant natural ore Galena (PbS) through localized radio frequency (RF) heating. RF heating experiments conducted at frequencies between \SI{35}{MHz} and \SI{45}{MHz} induced substantial localized heating in PbS, generating a temperature gradient of \SI{32}{K}. This resulted in a Seebeck voltage of \SI{-5.8}{mV/K}, approximately 13 times greater than the conventional Seebeck coefficient of PbS (\SI{440}{\micro V/K}). Additionally, a power factor of \SI{151}{mWm^{-1}K^{-2}} and an overall RF to thermoelectric conversion efficiency of 15\% were achieved. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate the experimental findings, providing insights into the mechanism of thermal transport and RF-induced heating in PbS. These results highlight the potential of localized RF heating as an effective strategy for enhancing thermoelectric performance, with promising implications for ambient thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.

Title: Carrier Emission and Capture Competition mediated A(n)BC Recombination Model in Semiconductors with Multi-Level Defects
Authors: Shanshan Wang, Menglin Huang, Su-Huai Wei, Xin-Gao Gong, Shiyou Chen
Abstract: The ABC model has been widely used to describe the carrier recombination rate, in which the rate of non-radiative recombination assisted by deep-level defects is assumed to depend linearly on excess carrier density $\Delta n$, leading to a constant recombination coefficient A. However, for multi-level defects that are prevalent in semiconductors, we demonstrate here that the rate should depend nonlinearly on $\Delta n$. When $\Delta n$ varies, the carrier capture and emission of defects can change the defect density distribution in different charge states, which can further change the carrier capture and emission rates of the defects and thus make the recombination rate depend non-linearly on $\Delta n$, leading to an $A(n)$ function. However, in many recent calculation studies on carrier recombination rate of multi-level defects, only carrier capture was considered while carrier emission from defect levels was neglected, causing incorrect charge-state distribution and misleading linear dependence of the rate on $\Delta n$. For $\text{V}_{\text{Ga}}$-$\text{O}_{\text{N}}$ in GaN and $\text{Pb}_\text{I}$ in CsPbI$_3$, our calculations showed that neglecting the carrier emission can cause the recombination rate underestimation by more than 8 orders of magnitude when $\Delta n$ is $10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our findings suggest that the recent studies on carrier recombination assisted by multi-level defects should be revisited with carrier emission considered, and the widely-used $ABC$ model should be reformed into the $A(n)BC$ model.

Title: Optimization and Performance Evaluation of Cs2CuBiCl6 Double Perovskite Solar Cell for Lead-Free Photovoltaic Applications
Authors: Syeda Anber Urooj Wasti, Sundus Naz, Ammara Sattar, Asad Yaqoob, Ateeq ul Rehman, Fawad Ali, Shahbaz Afzal
Abstract: In the previous decade, there has been a significant advancement in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), characterized by a notable increase in efficiency from 3.8% to 25%. Nonetheless, PSCs face many problems when we commercialize them because of their toxicity and stability. Consequently, lead-PSCs need an alternative solar cell with high performance and low processing cost; lead-free inorganic perovskites have been explored. Recent research showcased Cs2CuBiCl6, a lead-free inorganic double perovskite material with remarkable photoelectric characteristics and exceptional environmental robustness. To investigate the potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 material, the solar cell structure FTO/ETL/Cs2CuBiCl6/HTL/Au was used and analyzed through a solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). CeO2 is used as the Electron transport layer (ETL), and CuI is the Hole transport layer (HTL). Furthermore, the research examined the optimization of different parameters of the absorber layer (AL), such as thickness, defect density, electron affinity, band gap, and operational temperature. In the end, it has been noticed that by setting the temperature at 300 K and an electron affinity of 4.3 eV of the absorber layer, the PSCs achieve the highest efficiency of 24.51 %, FF of 43.01 %, Voc of 1.73V, and Jsc of 32.82mA/cm2. This is the highest Cs2CuBiCl6 double PSCs efficiency we've reached yet. In theoretical studies, 17.03% of PCE was achieved using Cs2CuBiCl6 as an active layer. The analysis underscores the significant potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 as an absorbing layer in developing highly efficient lead-free all-inorganic PSCs.

Title: Critical Dynamics of the Anderson Transition on Small-World Graphs
Authors: Weitao Chen, Ignacio García-Mata, John Martin, Jiangbin Gong, Bertrand Georgeot, Gabriel Lemarié
Abstract: The Anderson transition on random graphs draws interest through its resemblance to the many-body localization (MBL) transition with similarly debated properties. In this Letter, we construct a unitary Anderson model on Small-World graphs to characterize long time and large size wave-packet dynamics across the Anderson transition. We reveal the logarithmically slow non-ergodic dynamics in the critical regime, confirming recent random matrix predictions. Our data clearly indicate two localization times: an average localization time that diverges, while the typical one saturates. In the delocalized regime, the dynamics are initially non-ergodic but cross over to ergodic diffusion at long times and large distances. Finite-time scaling then allows us to characterize the critical dynamical properties: the logarithm of the average localization time diverges algebraically, while the ergodic time diverges exponentially. Our results could be used to clarify the dynamical properties of MBL and could guide future experiments with quantum simulators.

Title: Emergent Dynamical Ising Transition in Diffusive Sandpiles
Authors: Armin Makani, Morteza Nattagh Najafi
Abstract: Minimally stable site (MSS) clusters play a dominant role in shaping avalanches in the self-organized critical (SOC) systems. The manipulation of MSS clusters through local smoothings (diffusion) alter the MSS landscape, suppressing rare avalanches and postponing them until they manifest as spanning avalanches. By leveraging the Inverse Ising problem, we uncover a duality between diffusive sandpiles and equilibrium statistical physics. Our analysis reveals an emergent magnetic instability in the dual Ising model, coinciding with the formation of spanning avalanches and marking a transition to a correlated percolation regime. At this point, the MSS loop soups exhibit fractal self-similarity and power-law distributions, while the effective pairwise interactions in the dual system vanish, signaling a magnetic transition characterized by abrupt changes in magnetization and spin susceptibility. Crucially, we show that diffusion fundamentally reshapes avalanche dynamics: the spatial anti-correlations of MSSs in standard SOC systems transform into positive correlations when diffusion is introduced. These findings bridge self-organized criticality, percolation theory, and equilibrium phase transitions, shedding new light on emergent criticality and large-scale correlations in non-equilibrium systems.

Title: Quantum dot-based device for high-performance magnetic microscopy and spin filtering in the Kondo regime
Authors: Pierre Lombardo, Imam Makhfudz, Steffen Schäfer, Roland Hayn
Abstract: We propose a nanoscale device consisting of a double quantum dot with a full exchange and pair hopping interaction. In this design, the current can only flow through the upper dot, but is sensitive to the spin state of the lower dot. The system is immersed in a highly inhomogeneous magnetic field, and only the bottom dot feels a substantial magnetic field, while the top dot experiences only a residual one. We show that our device exhibits very interesting magnetic field-dependent transport properties at low temperatures. The Kondo effect partially survives the presence of the magnetic field and allows to obtain conductances that differ by several orders of magnitude for the two spin types across the top dot. Interestingly, as a function of the magnetic field, our two-dot device changes from a spin singlet state to a spin triplet state, in which the amplitudes of the spin-dependent conductances are reversed. Our device is able to discriminate between positive and negative magnetic fields with a high sensitivity and is therefore particularly interesting for imaging the surface of anti-ferromagnetic (AF) insulating materials with alternated surface magnetic field, as well as for spin filtering applications.

Title: Dynamics of soft interacting particles on a comb
Authors: Davide Venturelli, Pierre Illien, Aurélien Grabsch, Olivier Bénichou
Abstract: We study the dynamics of overdamped Brownian particles interacting through soft pairwise potentials on a comb-like structure. Within the linearized Dean-Kawasaki framework, we characterize the coarse-grained particle density fluctuations by computing their one- and two-point correlation functions. For a tracer particle constrained to move along the comb backbone, we determine the spatial correlation profile between its position and the density of surrounding bath particles. Furthermore, we derive the correction to the diffusion coefficient of the tracer due to interactions with other particles, validating our results through numerical simulations.

Title: Unconventional topological Weyl-dipole phonon
Authors: Jianhua Wang, Yang Wang, Feng Zhou, Wenhong Wang, Zhenxiang Cheng, Shifeng Qian, Xiaotian Wang, Zhi-Ming Yu
Abstract: A pair of Weyl points (WPs) with opposite Chern numbers ${\cal{C}}$ can exhibit an additional higher-order $Z_2$ topological charge, giving rise to the formation of a $Z_2$ Weyl dipole. Owing to the nontrivial topological charge, $Z_2$ Weyl dipoles should also appear in pairs, and the WPs within each $Z_2$ Weyl dipole can not be annihilated when meeting together. As a novel topological state, the topological Weyl-dipole phase (TWDP) has garnered significant attention, yet its realization in crystalline materials remains a challenge. Here, through first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the existence of the Weyl-dipole phase in the phonon spectra of the $P6_3$ type Y(OH)$_3$. Particularly, the Weyl dipole in this system is protected by a quantized quadrupole moment, and it distinguished from conventional Weyl dipole, as it comprises an unconventional charge-3 WP with ${\cal{C}}=-3$ and three conventional charge-1 WPs with ${\cal{C}}=1$. Consequently, the Weyl-dipole phase in Y(OH)$_3$ features unique two-dimensional (2D) sextuple-helicoid Fermi-arc states on the top and bottom surfaces, protected by the Chern number, as well as one-dimensional (1D) hinge states that connect the two Weyl dipoles along the side hinges, guaranteed by the quantized quadrupole moment. Our findings not only introduce a novel higher-order topological phase, but also promote Y(OH)$_3$ as a promising platform for exploring multi-dimensional boundaries and the interaction between first-order and second-order topologies.

Title: Quantum effects in charge control of semiconductor surfaces as elucidated by ab initio calculations a review
Authors: Stanisław Krukowski, Pawel Kempisty, Pawel Strak
Abstract: Recent progress in the investigations of the charge role in semiconductor surfaces is reviewed. This is based on ab intio investigations. That include elucidation of Coulomb interaction of the separated subsystems, such as slab copies or far distant adsorbate and the slab, the bonding in the bulk and on the surface, standard and resonant. The quantum nature of the bonding leads to emergence of the external surface dipole, which was well recognized prior to these investigations. The role of the external dipole layer in the thermalization of the adsorbate is proposed and formulated. The internal dipole charge well known to exist at the surface were supplemented by new finding including the simulation of these dipole fields within slab model, pinning the Fermi level at the surface and the role of bulk and surface charge. of the bonding states. This could also occur at the activated complex point where the energy of these states could be increased into the vicinity of Fermi level or even higher so that this affects the energy barrier for diffusion. Therefore the explicit incorporation of quantum effects in the charge role in the semiconductor surfaces changes their properties considerably as described in this review.

Title: Pinch-line spin liquids as layered Coulomb phases
Authors: Naïmo Davier, Flavia A. Gómez Albarracín, H. Diego Rosales, Pierre Pujol, Ludovic D. C. Jaubert
Abstract: Spin liquids form fluctuating magnetic textures which have to obey certain rules imposed by frustration. These rules can often be written in the form of a Gauss law, indicating the local conservation of an emergent electric field. In reciprocal space, these emergent Gauss laws appear as singularities known as pinch points, that are accessible to neutron-scattering measurements. But more exotic forms of electromagnetism have been stabilized in spin liquids, and in a few rare instances, these zero-dimensional singularities have been extended into one-dimensional pinch lines. Here we propose a simple framework for the design of pinch-line spin liquids in a layered structure of two-dimensional algebraic spin liquids. A plethora of models can be build within this framework, as exemplified by two concrete examples where our theory is confirmed by simulations, and where the rank of the tensorial gauge field is continuously varied along the pinch line, opening new avenues in fractonic matter. We conclude our letter with guidelines for experimental realizations.

Title: Active Learning for Conditional Inverse Design with Crystal Generation and Foundation Atomic Models
Authors: Zhuoyuan Li, Siyu Liu, Beilin Ye, David J. Srolovitz, Tongqi Wen
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming materials science, enabling both theoretical advancements and accelerated materials discovery. Recent progress in crystal generation models, which design crystal structures for targeted properties, and foundation atomic models (FAMs), which capture interatomic interactions across the periodic table, has significantly improved inverse materials design. However, an efficient integration of these two approaches remains an open challenge. Here, we present an active learning framework that combines crystal generation models and foundation atomic models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of inverse design. As a case study, we employ Con-CDVAE to generate candidate crystal structures and MACE-MP-0 FAM as one of the high-throughput screeners for bulk modulus evaluation. Through iterative active learning, we demonstrate that Con-CDVAE progressively improves its accuracy in generating crystals with target properties, highlighting the effectiveness of a property-driven fine-tuning process. Our framework is general to accommodate different crystal generation and foundation atomic models, and establishes a scalable approach for AI-driven materials discovery. By bridging generative modeling with atomic-scale simulations, this work paves the way for more accurate and efficient inverse materials design.

Title: Stable time rondeau crystals in dissipative many-body systems
Authors: Zhuocheng Ma, Jin Yan, Hongzheng Zhao, Liang-You Peng
Abstract: Driven systems offer the potential to realize a wide range of non-equilibrium phenomena that are inaccessible in static systems, such as the discrete time crystals. Time rondeau crystals with a partial temporal order have been proposed as a distinctive prethermal phase of matter in systems driven by structured random protocols. Yet, heating is inevitable in closed systems and time rondeau crystals eventually melt. We introduce dissipation to counteract heating and demonstrate stable time rondeau crystals, which persist indefinitely, in a many-body interacting system. A key ingredient is synchronization in the non-interacting limit, which allows for stable time rondeau order without generating excessive heating. The presence of many-body interaction competes with synchronization and a de-synchronization phase transition occurs at a finite interaction strength. This transition is well captured via a linear stability analysis of the underlying stochastic processes.

Title: High second harmonic generation in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals by doping with optimally oriented chromophores
Authors: J. Ortega, C.L. Folcia, T. Sierra
Abstract: We report on the second harmonic generation performance of a ferroelectric nematic fluid consisting of the prototype ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal, RM734 mixed with the classical chromophore Dispersed-Orange 3 at 5 %wt. The mixture exhibits an interesting mesomorphic behavior with a wide temperature range of the ferroelectric mesophase, high nematic order parameter and ease of alignment in cells. In the study, two fundamental wavelengths (1064 nm and 1574 nm) have been used in order to account for the second harmonic generation performance in transparent and absorbing regimens. The results have been very outstanding and are among the highest for liquid crystals so far. Specifically, second order susceptibility tensor components of up to 25 pmV-1 and 8.5 pmV-1 have been obtained in the absorbing and transparent regimens, respectively. The mixing of chromophores with ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals is then stablished as a promising strategy in the search of high-performance nonlinear-optical mesogens.

Title: Phase coherence of charge-$6e$ superconductors via a frustrated Kagome XY antiferromagnet
Authors: Feng-Feng Song, Guang-Ming Zhang
Abstract: Recent experimental evidence for the charge-$6e$ condensed phase in kagome superconductors has generated significant interest. We investigate the unconventional superconductivity in the kagome superconductor $\mathrm{CsV_3Sb_5}$, focusing on the emergence of charge-$6e$ superconductivity (SC) at temperatures higher than the conventional charge-$2e$ SC state. By modeling the phase coherence of the SC order parameter using a frustrated antiferromagnetic XY model on an emergent kagome lattice, we show that the condensation of fractional vortices with $1/3$ vorticity stabilizes phase coherence in $\exp(i3\theta)$, giving rise to the charge-$6e$ SC state. Using a tensor network approach tailored for frustrated spin systems, we identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T_c/J \simeq 0.075$, where the unbinding of $1/3$ fractional vortex-antivortex pairs transforms the system from the charge-$6e$ SC phase to the normal phase. Below $T_c$, the $1/3$ fractional vortex correlations exhibit power-law decay, while the integer vortex correlations decay exponentially, reflecting the dominance of charge-$6e$ SC in the absence of charge-$2e$ SC. Our results provide a theoretical understanding of the charge-$6e$ SC in two-dimensional kagome superconductors, emphasizing the interplay between fractional vortices, frustration, and topology in stabilizing this exotic SC phase.

Title: Investigating the relation between elastic and relaxation properties of dry, frictional granular media during shear deformation
Authors: Aurélien Rigotti, Véronique Dansereau, Jérôme Weiss
Abstract: Using discrete element simulations based on molecular dynamics, we investigate the mechanical behavior of sheared, dry, frictional granular media in the "dense" and "critical" regimes. We find that this behavior is partitioned between transient stages and a final stationary stage. While the later is macroscopically consistent with the predictions of the viscous, $\mu(I)$ rheology, both the macroscopic behavior during the transient stages and the overall microscopic behavior suggest a more complex picture. Indeed, the simulated granular medium exhibits a finite elastic stiffness throughout its entire shear deformation history, although topological rearrangements of the grains at the microscale translate into a partial degradation of this stiffness, which can be interpreted as a form of elastic damage. The relaxation of stresses follows a compressed exponential, also highlighting the role of elastic interactions in the medium, with residual stresses that depend on the level of elastic damage. The established relations between elastic and relaxation properties point to a complex rheology, characterized by a damage-dependent transition between a visco-elasto-plastic and a viscous behavior.

Title: Random Transverse Field Effects on Magnetic Noise in Spin Systems
Authors: Yufei Pei, Claudio Castelnovo, Roderich Moessner
Abstract: Motivated by experimental developments in non-Kramers spin ice materials and the unclear role of disorder therein, we study the impact of random transverse fields on the dynamics of correlated magnetic systems. We model the effect of dilute, randomly placed transverse fields on quantities such as magnetic noise/susceptibility and the diffusivity of topological excitations. We consider a random ferromagnetic Ising chain (RTFIC) as well as three-dimensional spin ice. At low temperatures, both exhibit (sub-)diffusive defect dynamics, i.e., of domain walls and magnetic monopoles, respectively. Introducing sparse transverse fields leads to the emergence of an additional timescale on the order of the single-spin flip time. We develop a Lindbladian framework that combines Monte Carlo simulations and exact diagonalization which allows us to characterize the dynamics and develop an analytical understanding of the phenomenon. This framework can be benchmarked in detail for the RTFIC. Our findings provide insights into the magnetization dynamics of disordered non-Kramers oxides, such as oxygen-diluted Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, and offer a framework for interpreting experimental observations in these systems.

Title: Interstitials as a key ingredient for P segregation to grain boundaries in polycrystalline $α$-Fe
Authors: Amin Reiners-Sakic, Alexander Reichmann, Christoph Dösinger, Lorenz Romaner, David Holec
Abstract: The segregation of solutes to grain boundaries can significantly influence material behavior. Most previous computational studies have concentrated on substitutional solute segregation, neglecting interstitial segregation due to its increased complexity. The site preference, interstitial or substitutional, for P segregation in $\alpha$-Fe still remains under debate. In this work, we investigate the full GB-segregation spectrum for both substitutional and interstitial GB sites in a polycrystalline atomistic structure of ferrite with the aid of classical interatomic potentials combined with machine learning techniques. The method is qualitatively tested for H and Ni, where the segregation behavior in $\alpha$-Fe is well understood. Our findings for P show that segregation to both types of GB sites is possible, with a preference for the substitutional sites based on the mean segregation energy. However, due to the much larger number of interstitial sites, interstitial segregation significantly contributes to the GB enrichment with P. This underscores the importance of considering interstitial P segregation in addition to the substitutional one. Furthermore, we also argue that equally important for quantitative predictions (that agree with experimental data) is to get a representative spectrum of the segregation energies.

Title: Status of Iron Based Superconductors: characteristics and relevant properties for applications
Authors: Kazumasa Iida
Abstract: Since the discovery of iron-based superconductors (IBSs) on LaFePO in 2006, many types of IBSs have been fabricated. IBSs have usually been compared to cuprates and MgB2, and the methodology of research developed by them have been implemented to IBSs. As a result, many similarities between IBSs and cuprates have been revealed, e.g., the parent compounds being antiferromagnets and grain boundaries being weak-links to some extent. On the other hands, the distinct features of IBSs are highlighted as multiband superconductors (i.e., the 5 bands of Fe 3d orbital crossing Fermi level) and extended s-wave symmetry. Additionally, some of the IBSs are topological superconductors that can be possible platforms for quantum computing. In this paper, an overview of IBS research and development in the last 18 years will be reported, involving characteristics of IBSs as well as strategies of increasing the superconducting transition temperature and critical current density.

Title: Proximity Effects Between the Graphene Quasicrystaland Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Pedro Alcázar Guerrero, Viet-Hung Nguyen, Aron W. Cummings, Jean-Christophe Charlier, Stephan Roche
Abstract: We report a numerical study of graphene heterostructures comprised of three individual layers twisted by either the magic angle of $\sim$1.1$^\circ$, or $\sim$$30^\circ$, corresponding to the graphene quasicrystal. The heterostack is modeled using realistic structural and tight-binding models, while transport properties are calculated in both clean and disordered systems containing up to $\sim$8 million atoms. The weak interaction between different layers allows us to scrutinize the electronic mixing of flat bands and quasicrystalline states, which are altered differently in the low- and high-energy regimes and provide a new type of hybrid physics to be explored.

Title: Theory of Nonlocal Transport from Nonlinear Valley Responses
Authors: Jin Cao, Hui Wang, Shen Lai, Cong Xiao, Shengyuan A. Yang
Abstract: We develop a theory for the nonlocal measurement of nonlinear valley Hall effect. Different from the linear case where the direct and the inverse processes are reciprocal, we unveil that the nonlinear inverse valley Hall effect needed to generate nonlocal voltage signal must have a distinct symmetry character and involve distinct mechanisms compared to the nonlinear valley Hall response it probes. Particularly, it must be valley-even, in contrast to both linear and nonlinear valley Hall effects which are valley-odd. Layer groups that permit such nonlocal valley responses are obtained via symmetry analysis, and formulas for the nonlocal signals are derived. In the presence of both linear and nonlinear valley responses, we show that the different responses can be distinguished by their distinct scaling behaviors in the different harmonic components, under a low-frequency ac driving. Combined with first-principles calculations, we predict sizable nonlocal transport signals from nonlinear valley responses in bilayer $T_{d}$-WTe$_{2}$. Our work lays a foundation for nonlocal transport studies on the emerging nonlinear valleytronics.

Title: Mechanical non-reciprocity programmed by shear jamming in soft composite solids
Authors: Chang Xu, Shuaihu Wang, Hong Wang, Xu Liu, Zemin Liu, Yiqiu Zhao, Wenqi Hu, Qin Xu
Abstract: Mechanical non-reciprocity-manifested as asymmetric responses to opposing mechanical stimuli-has traditionally been achieved through intricate structural nonlinearities in metamaterials. However, continuum solids with inherent non-reciprocal mechanics remain underexplored, despite their promising potential for applications such as wave guiding, robotics, and adaptive materials. Here, we introduce a design principle by employing the shear jamming transition from granular physics to engineering non-reciprocal mechanics in soft composite solids. Through the control of the interplay between inclusion contact networks and matrix elasticity, we achieve tunable, direction-dependent asymmetry in both shear and normal mechanical responses. In addition to static regimes, we demonstrate programmable non-reciprocal dynamics by combining responsive magnetic profiles with the anisotropic characteristics of shear-jammed systems. This strategy enables asymmetric spatiotemporal control over motion transmission, a previously challenging feat in soft materials. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for designing non-reciprocal matter, bridging granular physics with soft material engineering to realize functionalities essential for mechano-intelligent systems.

Title: Sliding ferroelectric control of unconventional magnetism in stacked bilayers
Authors: Yongqian Zhu, Mingqiang Gu, Yuntian Liu, Xiaobing Chen, Yuhui Li, Shixuan Du, Qihang Liu
Abstract: The control of unconventional magnetism, which displays an antiferromagnetic configuration with ferromagnetism-like properties, has drawn intense attention for advancing antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, through symmetry analysis, we propose a general stacking rule, characterized by a connection operator linking two stacked bilayers, for controlling unconventional magnetism via sliding ferroelectricity. Such rule enables the simultaneous switching of both electric polarization and nonrelativistic spin splitting or anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets, a class of collinear unconventional magnets. By comprehensively surveying the 80 layer groups, we identify all the stacking orders that allow for such two types of simultaneous switching. Combined with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the sliding ferroelectric control of spin polarization and anomalous Hall effect in the altermagnetic AgF2 bilayer. Our work provides a symmetry strategy for achieving ferroelectric control of unconventional magnetism in bilayer systems and opens avenues for exploring new types of magnetoelectric coupling.

Title: Insights into Formation of Bicontinuous Emulsion Gels via in-situ (Ultra-)Small Angle X-ray Scattering
Authors: Meyer T. Alting, Dominique M.E. Thies-Weesie, Alexander M. van Silfhout, Mariska de Ruiter, Theyencheri Narayanan, Martin F. Haase, Andrei V. Petukhov
Abstract: Nanostructured materials formed via kinetically controlled self-assembly processes gather more interest nowadays. Bicontinuous emulsion gels stabilized by colloidal particles, called bijels, are attractive materials in soft-matter as they combine bulk properties of two immiscible liquids into an interwoven network structure. The limited understanding of the complex formation phenomena of bijels restricts the control over the synthesis, and so its applicability. In this work, in-situ (ultra-) small-angle X-ray scattering is applied to gain insight into the phase separation and self-assembly kinetics of bijels formed via solvent transfer induced phase separation. An X-ray compatible microfluidic setup allows accessing the process kinetics with a millisecond resolution. The formation of such bijels is shown to occur via three consecutive steps related to fluid mechanics, nanoparticle self-assembly and liquid-liquid phase separation. This time-resolved monitor technique offers valuable insights into the structural evolution of kinetically controlled materials and enhances our understanding of the formation of bicontinuous emulsion gels.

Title: Numerical study of synaptic behavior in amorphous HfO2-based ferroelectric-like FETs generated by voltage-driven ion migration
Authors: Juan Cuesta-Lopez, Mohit D. Ganeriwala, Enrique G. Marin, Alejandro Toral-Lopez, Francisco Pasadas, Francisco G. Ruiz, Andres Godoy
Abstract: The continuous effort in making artificial neural networks more alike to human brain calls for the hardware elements to implement biological synapse-like functionalities. The recent experimental demonstration of ferroelectric-like FETs promises low-power operation as compared to the conventional ferroelectric switching devices. This work presents an in-house numerical tool, which self-consistently solves the electrostatics and time-dependent electronic and ionic transport. The tool is exploited to analyze the effect that various physical parameters such as mobility and ion concentration could have on the design of the ferroelectric-like FETs. Their suitability in emulating different functions of the biological synapses is also demonstrated.

Title: Directional propagation of quantum Hall viscous fluid by nano-structural engineering
Authors: Hiroshi Funaki, Ai Yamakage, Ryotaro Sano, Mamoru Matsuo
Abstract: We present a microscopic theory of the viscous electron fluid in the quantum Hall state based on the nonequilibrium Green's function method and the von Neumann lattice representation. This approach permits the formulation of hydrodynamic equations in the strong field regime that accommodates arbitrary boundary conditions. We demonstrate nonreciprocal transport resulting from the interplay between magnetic field-induced viscosity and device geometry in a notched system. Our results will offer a powerful tool for studying the nonperturbative effects of magnetic fields on electron viscous fluids.

Title: Defects in the \b{eta}-Ga2O3(-201)/HfO2 MOS system and the effect of thermal treatments
Authors: Khushabu. S. Agrawal, Paolo LaTorraca, Jonas Valentijn, Roberta Hawkins, Adam A. Gruszecki, Joy Roy, Vasily Lebedev, Lewys Jones, Robert M. Wallace, Chadwin D. Young, Paul K. Hurley, Karim Cherkaoui
Abstract: We have investigated the properties of the \b{eta}-Ga2O3(-201)/HfO2/Cr/Au MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) system after annealing (450oC) in different ambient conditions (forming gas, N2 and O2). Defect properties have been analyzed using an approach combining experimental impedance measurements with physics-based simulations of the capacitance-voltage (C-V) and conductance-voltage (G-V) characteristics of \b{eta}-Ga2O3/HfO2 MOS capacitors. This approach enabled us to detect two defect bands in HfO2 characterized by thermal ionization energies of ~1.1eV (acceptor-like) and ~2eV (donor-like) attributed to a polaronic self-trapping state and an oxygen vacancy in HfO2, respectively. This study demonstrates how thermal treatments affect the energy distributions and densities of the observed defects. The adopted methodology also enabled the extraction of the spatial distribution of defects across the HfO2 thickness and Cr/HfO2 interface. The high concentration of oxygen vacancies close to the Cr/HfO2 interface extracted from experimental and simulated electrical data is confirmed by in-situ XPS analysis which shows how Cr is scavenging oxygen from the HfO2 and creating the donor band confined near the Cr/HfO2 interface. This donor band density is observed to be reduced after annealing as per simulation and unchanged for different annealing conditions. We speculate this may be due to the formation of dense films and polyforms of HfO2 under different ambient as revealed by high-resolution TEM images.

Title: Josephson vortex system in a flux-flow regime in electron doped high-Tc superconductor Nd(2-x)CexCuO4
Authors: T. B. Charikova, A. M. Bartashevich, V. N. Neverov, M. R. Popov, N. G. Shelushinina, A.A. Ivanov
Abstract: For an epitaxial film of an electron-doped superconductor Nd(2-x)CexCuO4 (x=0.145), in a mixed state, a well-defined step structure is observed on the dependence of the c-axis flux-flow resistance on the magnetic field parralel to CuO2 layers. It is shown that in the region of a free flow of Josephson vortices, the structure is periodic with a period of deltaB~Phi0/(lambdaablambdac). It is essential that the magnetic penetration depths in the ab-plane (lambdaab) and along the c-axis (lambdac) determine the sizes of the Josephson vortices in the Lawrence-Doniach model for an anisotropic layered superconductor.

Title: Electronic and structural properties of atomically thin metallenes
Authors: Kameyab Raza Abidi, Pekka Koskinen
Abstract: Although metallic elements favor three-dimensional (3D) geometries due to their isotropic, metallic bonding, experiments have reported metals also with two-dimensional (2D) allotropes, the so-called metallenes. And while bulk metals' electronic and structural properties are well known, the corresponding knowledge for atomically thin metallenes remains scattered. Therefore, in this work, we use density-functional theory to investigate the electronic and structural properties of 45 elemental metals with honeycomb, square, and hexagonal lattices, along with their buckled counterparts, resulting in a comprehensive catalog of 270 metallenes with their properties. We systematically present their structural, energetic, and electronic structure properties and discuss similarities and differences compared to their 3D counterparts. As a result, simple and noble metals exhibit similar characteristics and lack buckled hexagonal lattice. Apart from scattered exceptions, the trends in several properties, such as bond lengths, cohesion energies, and projected densities of states, are governed by coordination numbers and exhibit systematic patterns. This systematic reporting provides a necessary reference for the selection and categorization of metallenes for further experimental efforts to develop them for catalytic, sensing, plasmonic, and nanoelectronics applications.

Abstract: Asymmetries and anisotropies are widespread in biological systems, including in the structure and dynamics of cilia and eukaryotic flagella. These microscopic, hair-like appendages exhibit asymmetric beating patterns that break time-reversal symmetry needed to facilitate fluid transport at the cellular level. The intrinsic anisotropies in ciliary structure can promote preferential beating directions, further influencing their dynamics. In this study, we employ numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of a filament driven by a follower force at its tip to explore how intrinsic curvature and direction-dependent bending moduli impact filament dynamics. Our results show that while intrinsic curvature is indeed able to induce asymmetric beating patterns when filament motion is restricted to a plane, this beating is unstable to out of plane perturbations. Furthermore, we find that a 3D whirling state seen for isotropic filament dynamics can be suppressed when sufficient asymmetry or anisotropy are introduced. Finally, for bending moduli ratios as low as 2, we demonstrate that combining structural anisotropy with intrinsic curvature can stabilise asymmetric beating patterns, highlighting the crucial role of anisotropy in ciliary dynamics.

Title: Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the square lattice
Authors: M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ansätze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (SLAHM), where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions can be used to accurately study quantum many-body physics in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Highly correlated electronic state in a ferrimagnetic quadruple perovskite CuCu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$
Authors: A. I. Poteryaev, Z. V. Pchelkina, S. V. Streltsov, Y. Long, V. Yu. Irkhin
Abstract: Recently synthesized quadruple perovskite CuCu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$ possesses strong ferromagnetism and unusual electron properties, including enhanced electronic specific heat. Application of the first principles electronic structure approaches unambiguously shows importance of the many-body effects in this compound. While CuCu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$ is half-metallic ferrimagnet in the DFT+U method, in the density functional theory (DFT) combined with the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) it appears to be a metal. Strong correlations lead to a renormalization of electronic spectrum and formation of incoherent states close to the Fermi level. Electronic specific heat and magnetic properties obtained in the DFT+DMFT approach are in better agreement with available experimental data than derived by other band structure techniques.

Title: Universal charge and spin Drude weights in one-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: Jia-Jia Luo, Sagarika Basak, Han Pu, Xi-Wen Guan
Abstract: Drude weight (DW) is one of the most important quantities characterizing the quantum transport properties of many-body systems. Despite of intense studies of many decades, there still lacks rigorous understanding of transport behavior for various quantum phases at low temperatures. Here we report on universal properties of DWs in one-dimensional repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model with arbitrary magnetic fields. In addition to the usual charge and spin DWs, we also construct the cross DW that captures the cross influences between the two degrees of freedom in the transport dynamics, showing a subtle spin and charge coupling effect. Our analytical expressions of the DWs at different Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phases essentially establish general relations between the Luttinger parameters and the DWs. We further obtain explicit universal critical scaling laws for DWs across various phase boundaries and propose an experimental protocol to measure the this http URL find that the DWs obtained from the direct numerical simulation of this protocol show qualitatively good agreement with the Bethe ansatz results.

Title: Importance of ligand on-site interactions for the description of Mott-insulators in DFT+DMFT
Authors: Alberto Carta, Anwesha Panda, Claude Ederer
Abstract: Calculations combining density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for transition metal (TM) oxides and similar compounds usually focus on improving the description of the TM $d$ states. Here, we emphasize the importance of also accounting for corrections of the ligand $p$ states. We demonstrate that focusing exclusively on an improved description of the TM $d$ states results in difficulties to obtain the correct insulating behavior for a variety of materials, and requires to use values for the local interaction parameters that are inconsistent with values obtained using, e.g., the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). Importantly, these considerations not only apply to cases where the $p$ states are explicitly included in the DMFT low-energy subspace, but also to cases which only include so-called frontier bands with dominant TM $d$ character. We demonstrate that, to a large part, these inconsistencies arise from the use of local/semi-local DFT as starting point for computing interaction parameters within cRPA, and we show that applying a simple empirical correction to the O $p$ and other low energy states not included in the correlated subspace results in improved values for the interaction parameters that then allow to obtain the correct insulating behavior. For the cases where the ligand states are included in the DMFT subspace, we show that even an approximate but realistic Hartree-Fock-like correction applied to the O $p$ states leads to a correct and, most importantly, also a quantitatively consistent DFT+DMFT description of typical Mott insulators such as LaTiO$_3$, LaVO$_3$, or the perovskite rare-earth nickelates, $R$NiO$_3$.

Title: Training and re-training liquid crystal elastomer metamaterials for pluripotent functionality
Authors: Savannah D. Gowen, Elina Ghimire, Charlie A. Lindberg, Ingrid S. Appen, Stuart J. Rowan, Sidney R. Nagel
Abstract: Training has emerged as a promising materials design technique in which function can be acheived through repeated physical modification of an existing material rather than by direct chemical functionalization, cutting or reprocessing. This work investigates both the ability to train for function and then to erase that function on-demand in macroscopic metamaterials made from liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs). We first show that the Poisson's ratio of these disordered arrays can be tuned via directed aging to induce an auxetic response. We then show that the arrays can be reset and re-trained for another local mechanical function, allostery, thus demonstrating pluripotent functionality.

Title: Particle geometry space: An integrated characterization of particle shape, surface area, volume, specific surface, and size distribution
Authors: Priya Tripathi, Seung Jae Lee
Abstract: Particle size and shape are the key 3D particle geometry parameters that govern the complex behavior of granular materials. The effect of these geometry parameters has often been examined in isolation, e.g., through separate analysis of particle size distribution (PSD) and shape distribution, leading to an unaddressed knowledge gap. Beyond size and shape, 3D particle geometry also encompasses attributes such as surface area and volume (or collectively, the surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is also referred to as specific surface). To comprehensively understand the influence of particle geometry on the behavior of granular materials, it is important to integrate these parameters, ideally into a single analytical framework. To this end, this paper presents a new approach, Particle Geometry Space (PGS), formulated based on the principle that the four 3D particle geometry attributes - volume, surface area, size, and shape - can be uniformly represented as a function of specific surface. This space not only encompasses all 3D particle geometry attributes but also extends its scope by integrating the conventional PSD concept. This innovation enables engineers and researchers who are already familiar with PSD to perform a more systematic characterization of 3D particle geometries. The paper (i) discusses the limitations of existing methods for characterizing particle geometry, (ii) offers an overview of the PGS, (iii) proposes a method for integrating PSD into the PGS, and (iv) demonstrates its application with a set of 3D mineral particle geometry data.

Title: Stabilization of Fermi-liquid behavior by interactions in disordered metals
Authors: Arianna Poli, Simone Fratini, Jennifer Coulter, Andrew J. Millis, Sergio Ciuchi
Abstract: We study the interplay of electron-electron and electron-disorder scattering in correlated Fermi liquids by the disordered Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory with an IPT-CPA solver. We find significant violations of Matthiessen's rule (additivity of scattering mechanisms) which we explain in terms of the screening of the disorder potential by interactions, leading to a protection of the electron-electron inelastic scattering rate against disorder. We also show that large disorder can lead to a surprising enhancement of the electron-electron scattering that contrasts with the competition seen in the elastic channel. Our results compare positively with available resistivity data in the disordered Fermi liquid phase of the correlated organic metals $\kappa$-(ET)$_{2}$X, and rationalize the strong sample dependence of the $T^2$ coefficients observed in the resistivity of correlated perovskite oxides such as SrVO$_3$.

Title: Additional jamming transition in 2D bidisperse granular packings
Authors: Juan C. Petit, Matthias Sperl
Abstract: We present a jamming diagram for 2D bidisperse granular systems, capturing two distinct jamming transitions. The first occurs as large particles form a jammed structure, while the second, emerging at a critical small-particle concentration, $X_{\mathrm{S}}^{*} \approx 0.21$, and size ratio, $\delta^{*} \approx 0.25$, involves small particles jamming into the voids of the existing large-particle structure upon further compression. Below this threshold, small particles fill voids within the large-particle network, increasing packing density. Beyond this point, excess small particles disrupt efficient packing, resulting in looser structures. The alignment of these findings with 3D results suggests a general geometric mechanism governing the second jamming transition.

Title: Mechanism of Charge Transport in Mixed-Valence 2D Layered Hybrid Bronze Materials
Authors: Suchona Akter, Mohammad R. Momeni
Abstract: Two-dimensional layered bronze (HB) materials are a new class of mixed-valence hybrid organic-inorganic metal oxides that demonstrate great potential as advanced functional materials for next-generation electronics. Recently, new hybrid vanadium bronze materials, (EV)V8O20 and (MV)V8O20, EV = ethyl viologen and MV = methyl viologen, have been introduced, with EV having ~3 orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivity than the MV system. Given their identical inorganic V-O layers and similar reduction potentials, the observed large difference in electrical conductivities is puzzling. Here, through accurate first-principles calculations coupled with MACE machine learning molecular dynamics (MD) simulations validated by accurate ab initio MD simulations, we provide mechanistic molecular-level insights into dominant charge transport and electrical conductivity pathways in these materials. Our detailed structural and electronic properties data identifies factors contributing to this significant difference in electrical conductivities of these materials. Our findings in this work offer clues and provide valuable insights into improving the electrical conductivity of hybrid bronze and similar materials in order to guide the design of next-generation materials with enhanced properties for future electronic and thermoelectric applications.

Title: Time-dependent global sensitivity analysis of the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model
Authors: Elia Zonta, Ivana Jovanovic Buha, Michele Spinola, Christoph Weißinger, Hans-Joachim Bungartz, Andreas Jossen
Abstract: The Doyle-Fuller-Newman model is arguably the most ubiquitous electrochemical model in lithium-ion battery research. Since it is a highly nonlinear model, its input-output relations are still poorly understood. Researchers therefore often employ sensitivity analyses to elucidate relative parametric importance for certain use cases. However, some methods are ill-suited for the complexity of the model and appropriate methods often face the downside of only being applicable to scalar quantities of interest. We implement a novel framework for global sensitivity analysis of time-dependent model outputs and apply it to a drive cycle simulation. We conduct a full and a subgroup sensitivity analysis to resolve lowly sensitive parameters and explore the model error when unimportant parameters are set to arbitrary values. Our findings suggest that the method identifies insensitive parameters whose variations cause only small deviations in the voltage response of the model. By providing the methodology, we hope research questions related to parametric sensitivity for time-dependent quantities of interest, such as voltage responses, can be addressed more easily and adequately in simulative battery research and beyond.

Title: Spin noise reveals spin dynamics and recharging of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals
Authors: V. O. Kozlov, I. A. Smirnov, M. S. Kuznetsova, E. V. Kolobkova, G. G. Kozlov, V. S. Zapasskii, D. S. Smirnov, I. I. Ryzhov
Abstract: The lead halide perovskite nanocrystals embedded into a glass matrix exhibit strong interaction with light and demonstrate exceptional optical and spin related features along with long-term chemical and physical stability. We apply the spin noise spectroscopy technique which offers a number of specific opportunities to study the spin system of CsPbI$_3$ nanocrystals in a fluorophosphate glass matrix. A pronounced spin precession peak with an isotropic $g$-factor absolute value of 2.7 and record dephasing time of T$_{2\text{,e}}$ = 2.7 ns is ascribed to resident electrons in the perovskite nanocrystals. The experimentally observed Faraday rotation noise with no noise of ellipticity is explained by saturation of the inhomogeneously broadened optical transition. Increasing the probe intensity, we went beyond the non-perturbative regime and observed a number of light-induced effects. In particular, the illumination with shorter wavelength light gives rise to a persistent recharging of the quantum dots by holes ($|g|=0.17$ and T$^*_{2\text{,h}}$ = 1.4 ns, T$^*_{1\text{,h}}$ $\geq$ 30 ns), which remains stable over multiple cycles of heating to the room temperature and cooling. In addition, elliptically polarized light induced an "optical" magnetic field on the system due to the AC Stark effect. It is confirmed using a new modification of polarization noise spectroscopy with a small degree of circular polarization of the probe light added with different frequencies.

Title: From High-Entropy Alloys to Alloys with High Entropy: A New Paradigm in Materials Science and Engineering for Advancing Sustainable Metallurgy
Authors: Jose Manuel Torralba, Alberto Meza, S. Venkatesh Kumaran, Amir Mostafaei, Ahad Mohammadzadehd
Abstract: The development of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has marked a paradigm shift in alloy design, moving away from traditional methods that prioritize a dominant base metal enhanced by minor elements. HEAs instead incorporate multiple alloying elements with no single dominant component, broadening the scope of alloy design. This shift has led to the creation of diverse alloys with high entropy (AHEs) families, including high-entropy steels, superalloys, and intermetallics, each highlighting the need to consider additional factors such as stacking fault energy (SFE), lattice misfit, and anti-phase boundary energy (APBE) due to their significant influence on microstructure and performance. Leveraging multiple elements in alloying opens up promising possibilities for developing new alloys from multi-component scrap and electronic waste, reducing reliance on critical metals and emphasizing the need for advanced data generation techniques. With the vast possibilities offered by these multi-component feedstocks, modelling and Artificial Intelligence based tools are essential to efficiently explore and optimize new alloys, supporting sustainable progress in metallurgy. These advancements call for a reimagined alloy design framework, emphasizing robust data acquisition, alternative design parameters, and advanced computational tools over traditional composition-focused methodologies.

Abstract: Neutron diffraction experiments of TmFeO3 single crystals were performed in the external magnetic fields. The field along c-axis increases temperature of spin-reorientation transition TSR from phase {\Gamma}4 to {\Gamma}2. Application of the field along b-axis led to the decrease of TSR and to the formation of new phases. Based on the temperature and field dependence of the Bragg reflection intensity, the configuration of magnetically induced phases was proposed. The magneto-structural effects were observed.

Title: Exploring the Interaction of BeS Monolayer and Lung Disease Biomarkers: Potential Material for Biosensing Applications
Authors: Sudipta Saha, Md. Kawsar Alam
Abstract: Considerable attention has been directed towards the prognosis of lung diseases primarily due to their high prevalence. Despite advancements in detection technologies, current methods such as computed tomography, chest radiographs, bold proteomic patterns, nuclear magnetic resonance, and positron emission tomography still face limitations in detecting diseases related to the lungs. Consequently, there is a need for swift, non-invasive and economically feasible detection methods. Our study explores the interaction between BeS monolayer and breathe biomarkers related to lung disease utilizing the density functional theory (DFT) method. Through comprehensive DFT analysis, including electronic properties analysis, charge transfer evaluations, work function, optical properties assessment and recovery times, the feasibility and efficiency of BeS as a VOC (volatile organic compound) detection are investigated. Findings reveal significant changes in bandgap upon VOC adsorption, with notable alteration in work function for selective compounds. Optical property analyses demonstrate the potential for selective detection of biomarkers within specific wavelength ranges. Moreover, the study evaluates the impact of electric fields and strain on VOC-2D BeS interaction. Furthermore, the desorption of these VOCs from the BeS surface can be achieved through a heating process or under the illumination of UV light. This feature enables the reusability of the 2D material for biosensing applications. These findings highlight the potential of the BeS monolayer as a promising material for the sensitive and selective detection of breath biomarkers related to lung disease.

Title: Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition of MgSiN$_{2}$ thin films
Authors: Vijay Gopal Thirupakuzi Vangipuram, Chenxi Hu, Abdul Mukit Majumder, Christopher Chae, Kaitian Zhang, Jinwoo Hwang, Kathleen Kash, Hongping Zhao
Abstract: Orthorhombic-structured II-IV nitrides provide a promising opportunity to expand the material platform while maintaining compatibility with the wurtzite crystal structure of the traditional III-nitride material system. Among them, MgSiN$_{2}$ stands out due to its close compatibility with GaN and AlN and its theoretically predicted ultrawide direct band gap of 6.28 eV. In this work, the growth of MgSiN$_{2}$ thin films on GaN-on-sapphire and c-plane sapphire substrates was investigated using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). MOCVD growth conditions were correlated with film quality and crystallinity for samples grown on GaN-on-sapphire substrates. The effects of Mg:Si precursor molar flow rate ratios and growth pressure at two different temperatures, 745$^{\circ}$C and 850$^{\circ}$C, were studied comprehensively. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging confirmed the formation of high-quality, single-crystal MgSiN$_{2}$ films. Optical band gap extraction from transmittance measurements yielded direct band gap values ranging from 6.13 eV to 6.27 eV for samples grown under various conditions, confirming the realization of an ultrawide-band gap, III-nitride-compatible, II-IV-nitride material.

Title: Photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers featuring sharp excitonic lines and diverse grain structures
Authors: Mateusz Raczyński, Julia Kucharek, Kacper Oreszczuk, Aleksander Rodek, Tomasz Kazimierczuk, Rafał Bożek, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Wojciech Pacuski, Piotr Kossacki
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that using h-BN as a substrate for the growth of transition metal dichalcogenides can significantly reduce excitonic linewidths. However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.

Title: Fractional topological states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene modulated by kagome superlattice
Authors: Yanran Shi, Bo Xie, Fengfan Ren, Xinyu Cai, Zhongqing Guo, Qiao Li, Xin Lu, Zhongkai Liu, Jianpeng Liu
Abstract: Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects realized in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and multilayer-graphene-based moiré heterostructures have captured a tremendous growth of interest. In this work, we propose that rhombohedral multilayer graphene coupled with an artificial kagome superlattice potential is a new platform to realize various fractional topological phases. Taking Bernal bilayer graphene as the simplest example, when it is placed on top of a prepatterned SiO$_2$ substrate with periodic arrays of holes arranged into kagome lattice, the system would be subject to a tunable kagome superlattice potential once an electrostatic voltage drop between the top and bottom gates is applied. Then, we theoretically study the electronic band structures, topological properties, and quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states of Bernal bilayer graphene coupled with a realistic kagome superlattice potential, which is benchmarked by transport measurements in the weak superlattice-potential and large filling factor regime. We find that the system may exhibit nearly ideal topological flat bands in a substantial region of the parameter space spanned by superlattice constant and electrostatic potential strength. When these topological flat bands are fractionally filled, exact diagonalization calculations suggest that the system would exhibit rich fractional topological phases at 1/3, 2/3, 2/5, 3/5 and 1/2 fillings including both fractional Chern insulators and anomalous composite Fermi liquids under zero magnetic field.

Title: Electronic and Structural Properties of Lanthanide-Doped MoS$_2$: Impact of Ionic Size and Orbital Configuration Mismatch
Authors: Hyosik Kang, Raquel Queiroz, Lukas Muechler
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are crucial for quantum technologies such as quantum simulation, secure quantum communication, and precision measurements. Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising SPE candidates due to their atomically thin nature and efficient photon extraction. However, their emission wavelengths limit compatibility with existing telecommunication technologies. Lanthanide doping in TMDCs, such as \defect{MoS}{2}, offers a potential solution by introducing sharp, $f$-orbital derived emissions in the infrared range. Yet, the feasibility of introducing these dopants remains uncertain due to their large ionic radii of the lanthanides. We employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the structural and electronic properties of lanthanide-doped \defect{MoS}{2} monolayers (Ln=Ce, Er). By evaluating formation energies with up to three adjacent S vacancies, we assess how these vacancies mitigate lattice strain caused by the size mismatch of Ce and Er with Mo. Our results show that while \defect{Ln}{Mo} destabilizes the pristine lattice, S vacancies enhance thermodynamic stability. Charge state analysis indicates that defect states introduced by \defect{Ln}{Mo} localize near the valence band and remain stable across a wide Fermi energy range. Electronic structure analysis shows that Ce$^{4+}$ and Er$^{3+}$ maintain their oxidation states upon electron doping due to additional acceptor states from host-induced dangling bonds. These states arise from an orbital filling mismatch between dopants and Mo. Consequently, \defect{Ce}{Mo} is unlikely to exhibit infrared emissions due to its empty $f$-shell, whereas \defect{Er}{Mo} is expected to emit in the infrared. These findings demonstrate the potential of lanthanide-doped TMDCs as tunable SPEs and provide design strategies for optimizing their optical and electronic properties.

Title: An Explainable AI Model for Binary LJ Fluids
Authors: Israrul H Hashmi, Rahul Karmakar, Marripelli Maniteja, Kumar Ayush, Tarak K. Patra
Abstract: Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids serve as an important theoretical framework for understanding molecular interactions. Binary LJ fluids, where two distinct species of particles interact based on the LJ potential, exhibit rich phase behavior and provide valuable insights of complex fluid mixtures. Here we report the construction and utility of an artificial intelligence (AI) model for binary LJ fluids, focusing on their effectiveness in predicting radial distribution functions (RDFs) across a range of conditions. The RDFs of a binary mixture with varying compositions and temperatures are collected from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to establish and validate the AI model. In this AI pipeline, RDFs are discretized in order to reduce the output dimension of the model. This, in turn, improves the efficacy, and reduce the complexity of an AI RDF model. The model is shown to predict RDFs for many unknown mixtures very accurately, especially outside the training temperature range. Our analysis suggests that the particle size ratio has a higher order impact on the microstructure of a binary mixture. We also highlight the areas where the fidelity of the AI model is low when encountering new regimes with different underlying physics.

Title: Ancilla theory of twisted bilayer graphene I: topological Mott semimetal and symmetric pseudogap metal
Authors: Jing-Yu Zhao, Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that Mott physics in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) can be conveniently captured using the ancilla theory, originally proposed in the context of high-Tc cuprates [Zhang and Sachdev, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023172 (2020)]. In this framework, the Mott gap emerges as a band gap controlled by a hybridization order parameter $\Phi(\mathbf k)$ between the physical and ancilla bands. In TBG, the ancilla formalism allows us to calculate the upper and lower Hubbard bands directly in momentum space, both at and away from the magic angle. Projected to the active bands, we reveal a topological obstruction for $\Phi(\mathbf k)$ around the $\Gamma$ point, leading to a topological Mott semi-metal at $\nu=0$. At fillings $\nu=\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we obtain symmetric correlated insulators at large $U$, and also transitions to semi-metals at smaller $U$ or larger bandwidth. The new formalism also enables us to study the most intriguing density range, $\nu=-2-x$: we propose a symmetric pseudogap metal at small $x$, which hosts a small Fermi surface and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. Our theory works above the ordering temperature of a potential symmetry-breaking order. Alternatively, the symmetric pseudogap metal can survive to the zero-temperature limit when there is a sizable anti-Hund's coupling $J_A$. In our theory, the small Fermi surface of the pseudogap metal is primarily formed by ancilla fermions, which we interpret as composite polarons-consisting of a spin moment on an AA site bound to a hole in the nearest neighbor AA site. Within the active band subspace, the composite polaron at $\mathbf k=0$ is orthogonal to the single-particle state due to their differing angular momenta, and thus has vanishing spectral weight. We suggest that superconductivity emerges from the Cooper pairing of these composite fermions instead of single electrons.

Title: Mesons in a quantum Ising ladder
Authors: Yunjing Gao, Yunfeng Jiang, Jianda Wu
Abstract: When two transverse-field Ising chains (TFICs) with magnetic order are coupled, the original free excitations become confined, giving rise to meson-like bound states. In this work, we study such bound states systematically. The mesons are characterized by their fermion number parity and chain-exchanging properties, which lead to distinct sets of mesonic states. The meson masses are determined by solving the Bethe-Salpter equation. An interesting observation is the additional degeneracy in the chain-exchanging odd sectors. Beyond the two particle approximation, we exploit the truncated free fermionic space approach to calculate the spectrum numerically. Corrections to the meson masses are obtained, and the degeneracy is further confirmed. The characterization and degeneracy can be connected to the situation when each chain is tuned to be quantum critical, where the system is described by the Ising$_h^2$ integrable model, a sine-Gordon theory with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. Here we establish a clear correspondence between the particles in the bosonized form and their fermionic counterparts. Near this point, the stability of these particles is analyzed using the form factor perturbation scheme, where four particles are always present. Additionally, we calculate the evolution of the dominant dynamical structure factor for local spin operators, providing further insight into the low-energy excitations and their role in the system's behavior. The two-particle confinement framework as well as the parity classifications may inspire the study for other coupled bi-partite systems.

Title: High-Throughput Computational Screening and Interpretable Machine Learning of Metal-organic Frameworks for Iodine Capture
Authors: Haoyi Tan, Yukun Teng, Guangcun Shan
Abstract: The removal of leaked radioactive iodine isotopes in humid environments holds significant importance in nuclear waste management and nuclear accident mitigation. In this study, high-throughput computational screening and machine learning were combined to reveal the iodine capture performance of 1816 metal-organic framework (MOF) materials under humid air conditions. Firstly, the relationship between the structural characteristics of MOFs and their adsorption properties was explored, with the aim of identifying the optimal structural parameters for iodine capture. Subsequently, two machine learning regression algorithms - Random Forest and CatBoost, were employed to predict the iodine adsorption capabilities of MOFs. In addition to 6 structural features, 25 molecular features and 8 chemical features were incorporated to enhance the prediction accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Feature importance was assessed to determine the relative influence of various features on iodine adsorption performance, in which the Henry's coefficient and heat of adsorption to iodine were found the two most crucial chemical factors. Furthermore, four types of molecular fingerprints were introduced for providing comprehensive and detailed structural information of MOF materials. The top 20 most significant MACCS molecular fingerprints were picked out, revealing that the presence of six-membered ring structures and nitrogen atoms in the MOFs were the key structural factors that enhanced iodine adsorption, followed by the existence of oxygen atoms. This work combined high-throughput computation, machine learning, and molecular fingerprints to comprehensively elucidate the multifaceted factors influencing the iodine adsorption performance of MOFs, offering profound insightful guidelines for screening and structural design of advanced MOF materials.

Title: Ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe2 and WSe2 nanoflake assemblies for thermoelectric applications
Authors: B. Patil, C. Bernini, D. Marre', L. Pellegrino, I. Pallecchi
Abstract: The development of simple, scalable, and cost-effective methods to prepare Van der Waals materials for thermoelectric applications is a timely research field, whose potential and possibilities are still largely unexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe2 and WSe2 nanoflake assemblies, obtained by liquid phase exfoliation, and their characterization in terms of electronic and thermoelectric properties. The choice of optimal annealing temperature and time is crucial for preserving phase purity and stoichiometry and for removing dry residues of ink solvents at inter-flake boundaries, while maximizing the sintering of nanoflakes. An additional pressing is beneficial to improve nanoflake orientation and packing, thus enhancing electric conductivity. In nanoflake assemblies deposited by drop casting and pressed at 1 GPa, we obtained thermoelectric power factors at room temperature up to 2.2x10^-4 mW m^-1 K^-2 for SnSe2 and up to 3.0x10^-4 mW m^-1 K^-2 for WSe2.

Title: Finite-bias Coulomb blockade thermometry
Authors: Omid Sharifi Sedeh, Christian P. Scheller, Henok Weldeyesus, Taras Patlatiuk, Matthias Gramich, Jukka P. Pekola, Dominik M. Zumbühl
Abstract: Coulomb blockade thermometers (CBTs) are versatile and, in principle, primary thermometers operating down to the micro-Kelvin range but bias heating spoils the thermometry and the primary mode. Here, we introduce a method to extract the CBT electron temperature in the presence of heat created by an arbitrary bias voltage, and without assumptions on the heat flow mechanisms. The charging energy is extracted with high precision and without any other knowledge, thus making true primary thermometry possible. The experiment also reveals a subtle dependence of the charging energy on phonon temperature below 100 mK likely due to the amorphous AlO$_x$ tunnel junctions.

Title: Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in color superconducting quark matter
Authors: Virgil V. Baran, Jens Paaske
Abstract: The high-density region of the QCD phase diagram displays an intricate competition between color superconductivity and the QCD Kondo effect due to color exchange in quark matter containing a single heavy quark impurity. We explore the characteristic impurity-induced superconducting subgap states arising in such systems by generalizing the surrogate model solver, recently considered in the context of condensed matter physics [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023)]. The method consists of approximating the full superconducting bulk by only a small number of effective levels whose parameters are chosen so as to best reproduce the Matsubara frequency dependence of the impurity-bulk hybridization function. We numerically solve a surrogate QCD Kondo model describing a quantum impurity color-exchange coupled to a two-color two-flavor superconducting bulk. The results directly indicate the presence of multiple phase transitions as the coupling of the impurity to the bulk is increased, due to the interplay between various overscreened states. The methods introduced here are straightforward enough to be extended to more realistic QCD scenarios.

Title: A closed quantum system giving ergodicity
Authors: J.M. Deutsch
Abstract: [This is the unpublished supplemental information from 1989 to the paper: J.M. Deutsch, "Quantum statistical mechanics in a closed system." Phys. Rev. A, 43(4), 2046 (1991).] A closed quantum mechanical system does not necessarily give time averages in accordance with the microcanonical distribution. This question is investigated if the number of degrees of freedom N is large. For systems where the different degrees of freedom are uncoupled, experimental situations are discussed that show a violation of the usual statistical mechanical rules. It is shown that by applying a finite but very small perturbation to such systems, the results of quantum statistical mechanics can indeed be recovered. The form of the perturbation is that of a banded random matrix, which has been used previously to describe strongly chaotic systems in the semiclassical limit. The properties of energy eigenfunctions for this perturbed system are also discussed, and deviations from the microcanonical result are shown to become exponentially small in the limit of large N.

Title: Co-Designing Eigen- and Singular-value Transformation Oracles: From Algorithmic Applications to Hardware Compilation
Authors: Luke Bell, Yan Wang, Kevin C. Smith, Yuan Liu, Eugene Dumitrescu, S. M. Girvin
Abstract: We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To showcase the oracle's representation-theoretic power, and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. In doing so, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancilla qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of eigenstate preparation in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation -- applicable in both near-term and large-scale quantum processors -- expressing high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system, and we provide details for 1D and 2D examples. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions.

Title: Observation of mechanical kink control and generation via phonons
Authors: Kai Qian, Nan Cheng, Francesco Serafin, Kai Sun, Georgios Theocharis, Xiaoming Mao, Nicholas Boechler
Abstract: Kinks (or domain walls) are localized transitions between distinct ground states associated with a topological invariant, and are central to many phenomena across physics, from condensed matter to cosmology. While phonon (i.e., small-amplitude vibration) wave packets have been theorized to deterministically interact with kinks and initiate their movement, this interaction has remained elusive in experiments, where only uncontrollable stochastic kink motion generated by thermal phonons or dislocation glide by low-frequency quasi-static loading have been observed. This is partly because all physical systems that support kinks are, at some level, discrete, making deterministic phonon control of kinks extremely challenging due to the existence of Peierls-Nabarro (PN) barrier. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, experimental observation of phonon-mediated control and generation of mechanical kinks, which we enable using a topological metamaterial that constitutes an elastic realization of the Kane-Lubensky chain model. Our metamaterial overcomes the PN barrier by supporting a single, topologically protected kink that requires zero energy to form and move. Using simulations that show close agreement with our experimental observations, we also reveal unique dynamics of phonon interplay with highly discrete kinks, including long-duration motion and a continuous family of internal modes, features absent in other discrete nonlinear systems. This work introduces a new paradigm for topological kink control, with potential applications in material stiffness tuning, shape morphing, locomotion, and robust signal transmission.

Title: Convergence of body-orders in linear atomic cluster expansions
Authors: Apolinario Miguel Tan, Franco Pellegrini, Stefano de Gironcoli
Abstract: We study the convergence of a linear atomic cluster expansion (ACE) potential with respect to its basis functions, in terms of the effective two-body interactions of elemental Carbon systems. We build ACE potentials with descriptor sets truncated at body-orders $K=2,3,4$ trained on pure dimers, or on large datasets of different diversities but without any dimers. Potentials trained on a more diverse dataset fare better in validation and result in a nontrivial dimer curve, but still very far from the theoretical two-body interaction calculated by DFT. Moreover, dimer curves between descriptor sets clipped at different $K$ do not seem to converge to a universal function for a given dataset. We conclude that machine learning potentials employing atomic cluster expansions optimize losses at low $K$ but fail to generalize and converge properties described by two-body interactions.

Title: Advancing C-C Coupling of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction for C2+ Products
Authors: Guangyuan Liang, Sheng Yang, Chao Wu, Yang Liu, Yi Zhao, Liang Huang, Shaowei Zhang, Shixue Dou, Hongfang Du, Dandan Cui, Liangxu Lin
Abstract: The production of multicarbon (C2+) products through electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is crucial to addressing global environmental challenges and advancing sustainable energy solutions. However, efficiently producing these high-value chemicals via C-C coupling reactions is a significant challenge. This requires catalysts with optimized surface configurations and electronic properties capable of breaking the scaling relations among various intermediates. In this report, we introduce the fundamentals of electrocatalytic CO2RR and the mechanism of C-C coupling. We examine the effects of catalytic surface interactions with key intermediates and reaction pathways, and discuss emerging strategies for enhancing C-C coupling reactions toward C2+ products. Despite varieties of these strategies, we summarize direct clues for the proper design of the catalyst for the electrocatalytic CO2RR towards C2+ products, aiming to provide valuable insights to broad readers in the field.

Title: Co-evolution-based Metal-binding Residue Prediction with Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Sayedmohammadreza Rastegari, Sina Tabakhi, Xianyuan Liu, Wei Sang, Haiping Lu
Abstract: In computational structural biology, predicting metal-binding sites and their corresponding metal types is challenging due to the complexity of protein structures and interactions. Conventional sequence- and structure-based prediction approaches cannot capture the complex evolutionary relationships driving these interactions to facilitate understanding, while recent co-evolution-based approaches do not fully consider the entire structure of the co-evolved residue network. In this paper, we introduce MBGNN (Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network) that utilizes the entire co-evolved residue network and effectively captures the complex dependencies within protein structures via graph neural networks to enhance the prediction of co-evolved metal-binding residues and their associated metal types. Experimental results on a public dataset show that MBGNN outperforms existing co-evolution-based metal-binding prediction methods, and it is also competitive against recent sequence-based methods, showing the potential of integrating co-evolutionary insights with advanced machine learning to deepen our understanding of protein-metal interactions. The MBGNN code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Atomistic Theory of Plasmon-Induced Hot-carriers in Al Nanoparticles
Authors: Gengyue Dong, Simão João, Hanwen Jin, Johannes Lischner
Abstract: Hot electrons generated from the decay of localized surface plasmon (LSP) in metallic nanostructures have significant potential for applications in photocatalysis, photodetection, and other optoelectronic devices. Aluminum nanoparticles are promising for hot-carrier devices since aluminum is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust. However, a comprehensive understanding of hot-carrier generation in practical nanoparticles is still missing. In this study, we present theoretical predictions of hot-carrier generation rates in spherical aluminum nanoparticles with up to 315,75 atoms in different dielectric environments. These predictions are obtained from an approach, which combines a solution of Maxwell equation with large-scale atomistic tight-binding models. By changing the environmental dielectric constants, the LSP frequency can be adjusted over a wide range from deep ultraviolet at 9 eV to the visible spectrum at 2-2.75 eV. Meanwhile, by varying the sizes of nanoparticles, we observed that as the nanoparticle size increases to 10 nm, discrete hot-carrier energy level transitions converge to the continuous energy transitions of bulk metals, and no intraband transitions are observed, unlike in noble metal nanoparticles such as gold and silver.

Title: Turbulent-like flows in quasi two-dimensional dense suspensions of motile colloids
Authors: Rui Luo, Alexey Snezhko, Petia M. Vlahovska
Abstract: Dense bacterial suspensions exhibit turbulent-like flows at low Reynolds numbers, driven by the activity of the microswimmers. In this study, we develop a model system to examine these dynamics using motile colloids that mimic bacterial locomotion. The colloids are powered by the Quincke instability, which causes them to spontaneously roll in a random-walk pattern when exposed to a square-wave electric field. We experimentally investigate the flow dynamics in dense suspensions of these Quincke random walkers under quasi two-dimensional conditions, where the particle size is comparable to the gap between the electrodes. Our results reveal an energy spectrum scaling at high wavenumbers as $ \sim k^{-4}$, which holds across a broad range of activity levels -- controlled by the field strength -- and particle concentrations. We observe that velocity time correlations decay within a single period of the square-wave field, yet an anti-correlation appears between successive field applications, indicative of a dynamic structural memory of the ensemble.

Title: Commercial scanning nitrogen vacancy magnetometer in a closed-cycle cryostat
Authors: Clemens Schäfermeier, Christopher Kelvin von Grundherr, Patrick Ebermann, Dominik Irber, Khaled Karraï, Andrea Morales, Jan Rhensius, Gabriel Puebla-Hellmann
Abstract: The ability to measure magnetic fields on the nanometre scale at cryogenic temperatures is key to understand magnetism on the quantum level and to develop materials for new storage devices or quantum computers. Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in diamond have proven to be a robust means to harness quantum sensing for such applications. We have developed an instrument to measure the magnetic stray field of a sample with nanometre resolution from 2 K to 300 K and that accepts samples without additional preparation, especially the need to prepare a microwave line on the sample. The instrument features a software-interface for controlling and synchronising all included optical, mechanical and electronic devices and which analyses the acquired information in real time. We present the key features and measurement results achieved with atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips hosting an NV centre and a fully remote controllable microscope platform. The magnetometer is commercially available, and a first demonstrator has been installed in a research facility. We show micro Tesla per square root Hertz sensitivity, low noise AFM tip control and optically detected resonance scans in a closed-cycle cryostat.

Authors: Florian Herz, Riccardo Messina, Philippe Ben-Abdallah
Abstract: Thermal emission is naturally spatially incoherent and lacks directionality. Here, we demonstrate that by precisely controlling the spatial temperature distribution within a solid, directional thermal emission can be achieved across a broad spectral range. These anisothermal sources open new avenues for manipulating radiative heat flux at the microscale and hold promise for applications in thermal management and energy conversion, enabling more efficient and targeted thermal control.

Title: A Variational Principle for Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics: Heat Conducting Viscous Fluids
Authors: François Gay-Balmaz
Abstract: Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a theory that extends the classical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics by going beyond the local-equilibrium assumption. A notable example of this is the Maxwell-Cattaneo heat flux model, which introduces a time lag in the heat flux response to temperature gradients. In this paper, we develop a variational formulation of the equations of extended irreversible thermodynamics by introducing an action principle for a nonequilibrium Lagrangian that treats thermodynamic fluxes as independent variables. A key feature of this approach is that it naturally extends both Hamilton's principle of reversible continuum mechanics and the earlier variational formulation of classical irreversible thermodynamics. The variational principle is initially formulated in the material (Lagrangian) description, from which the Eulerian form is derived using material covariance (or relabeling symmetries). The tensorial structure of the thermodynamic fluxes dictates the choice of objective rate in the Eulerian description, leading to the introduction of nonequilibrium stresses arising from both viscous and thermal effects to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This framework naturally results in the Cattaneo-Christov model for heat flux. We also investigate the extension of the approach to accommodate higher-order fluxes and the general form of entropy fluxes. The variational framework presented in this paper has promising applications in the development of structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical methods. It is particularly relevant for modeling systems where entropy production is a delicate issue that requires careful treatment to ensure consistency with the laws of thermodynamics.

Title: Percolation thresholds and connectivity in quantum networks
Authors: Andrea De Girolamo, Giuseppe Magnifico, Cosmo Lupo
Abstract: We study entanglement percolation in qubit-based planar quantum network models of arbitrary topology, where neighboring nodes are initially connected by pure states with quenched disorder in their entanglement. To address this, we develop a physics-informed heuristic algorithm designed to find a sequence of entanglement swapping and distillation operations to connect any pair of distant nodes. The algorithm combines locally optimal percolation strategies between nodes at a maximum distance of one swapping operation. If this fails to produce a maximally entangled state, it looks for alternative paths surrounding intermediate states within the process. We analytically find and numerically verify thresholds in quantum percolation, which depend on the initial network configuration and entanglement, and are associated with specific percolation strategies. We classify these strategies based on the connectivity, a quantity that relates the entanglement in the final state and the level of integrity of the network at the end of the process. We find distinct regimes of quantum percolation, which are clearly separated by the percolation thresholds of the employed strategies and vastly vary according to the network topology.

Pop, Thomas Reisinger
Abstract: For practical superconducting quantum processors, orders of magnitude improvement in coherence is required, motivating efforts to optimize hardware design and explore new materials. Among the latter, the coherence of superconducting transmon qubits has been shown to improve by forming the qubit capacitor pads from $\alpha$-tantalum, avoiding the meta-stable $\beta$-phase that forms when depositing tantalum at room temperature, and has been previously identified to be a source of microwave losses. In this work, we show lumped element resonators containing $\beta$-phase tantalum in the form of inclusions near the metal-substrate interface with internal quality factors ($Q_\text{i}$) up to $(5.0 \pm 2.5) \times 10^6$ in the single photon regime. They outperform resonators with no sign of the $\beta$-phase in x-ray diffraction and thermal quasi-particle loss. Our results indicate that small concentrations of $\beta$-phase can be beneficial, enhancing critical magnetic fields and potentially, for improving coherence in tantalum based superconducting circuits.

Title: What is a chemostat? Insights from hybrid dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics
Authors: Benedikt Remlein, Massimiliano Esposito, Francesco Avanzini
Abstract: At the microscopic scale, open chemical reaction networks are described by stochastic reactions that follow mass-action kinetics and are coupled to chemostats. We show that closed chemical reaction networks -- with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics -- behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one accounting for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions, the other for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats. Finally, we illustrate our results for two prototypical examples.

Title: Advances in multiparameter quantum sensing and metrology
Authors: Luca Pezzè, Augusto Smerzi
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in understating the limitations imposed by quantum noise in precision measurements and devising techniques to reduce it. The attention is currently turning to the simultaneously estimation of several parameters of interest, driven by its promising potential across a wide range of sensing applications as well as fueled by experimental progress in various optical and atomic platforms. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of key research directions in multiparameter quantum sensing and metrology, highlighting both opportunities and challenges. We introduce the basic framework, discuss ultimate sensitivity bounds, optimal measurement strategies, and the role of quantum incompatibility, showing important differences with respect to single-parameter estimation. Additionally, we discuss emerging experimental implementations in distributed quantum sensing, including cutting-edge optimization techniques. This review aims to bridge the gap between theory and experiments, paving the way for the next-generation of quantum sensors and their integration with other quantum technologies.

Title: Probability distributions for kinetic roughening in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang growth with long-range temporal and spatial correlations
Authors: Zhichao Chang, Hui Xia
Abstract: We investigate numerically the effects of long-range temporal and spatial correlations based on the rescaled distributions of the squared interface width $W^2(L,t)$ and the interface height $h(x,t)$ in the (1+1)-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) growth system within the early growth regimes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we find that long-range temporally correlated noise could not significantly impact the distribution form of the interface width. Generally, $W^2(L,t)$ obeys approximately lognormal distribution when the temporal correlation exponent $\theta \ge 0$. On the other hand, the effects of long-range spatially correlated noise are evidently different from the temporally correlated case. Our results show that, when the spatial correlation exponent $\rho \le 0.20$, the distribution forms of $W^2(L,t)$ approach the lognormal distribution, and when $\rho > 0.20$, the distribution becomes more asymmetric, steep, and fat-tailed, and tends to an unknown distribution form. As a comparison, probability distributions of the interface height are also provided in the temporally and spatially correlated KPZ system, exhibiting quite different characteristics from each other within the whole correlated regimes. For the temporal correlation, the height distributions satisfy Tracy-Widom Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (TW-GOE) when $\theta \to 0$, and with increasing $\theta$, the height distributions crossover continously to an unknown distribution. However, for the spatial correlation, the height distributions gradually transition from the TW-GOE distribution to the standard Gaussian form.

Title: A language-inspired machine learning approach for solving strongly correlated problems with dynamical mean-field theory
Authors: Hovan Lee, Zelong Zhao, George Booth, Weifeng Ge, Cedric Weber
Abstract: We present SCALINN -- Strongly Correlated Approach with Language Inspired Neural Network -- as a method for solving the Anderson impurity model and reducing the computational cost of dynamical mean-field theory calculations. Inspired by the success of generative Transformer networks in natural language processing, SCALINN utilizes an in-house modified Transformer network in order to learn correlated Matsubara Green's functions, which act as solutions to the impurity model. This is achieved by providing the network with low-cost Matsubara Green's functions, thereby overcoming the computational cost of high accuracy solutions. Across different temperatures and interaction strengths, the performance of SCALINN is demonstrated in both physical observables (spectral function, Matsubara Green's functions, quasi-particle weight), and the mean squared error cost values of the neural network, showcasing the network's ability to accelerate Green's function based calculations of correlated materials.

Title: Phases and Exotic Phase Transitions of a Two-Dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model
Authors: Anika Götz, Martin Hohenadler, Fakher F. Assaad
Abstract: We study a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon model on a square lattice by means of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The addition of a symmetry-allowed interaction permits analytical integration over the phonons at the expense of discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich fields with imaginary-time correlations. Using single-spin-flip and global updates, we investigate the phase diagram at the O(4)-symmetric point as a function of hopping $t$ and phonon frequency $\omega_0$. For $t=0$, where electron hopping is boson assisted, the model maps onto an unconstrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. A key quantity is the emergent effective flux per plaquette, which equals $\pi$ in the assisted-hopping regime and vanishes for large $t$. Phases in the former regime can be understood in terms of instabilities of emergent Dirac fermions. Our results support a direct and continuous transition between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid (VBS) and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with increasing $\omega_0$. For large $t$ and small $\omega_0$, we find finite-temperature signatures, a disordered pseudogap phase, of a previously reported $(\pi,\pi)$ VBS ground state related to a nesting instability. With increasing $\omega_0$, AFM order again emerges.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the restricted Hilbert space of Rydberg atom arrays
Authors: Pranay Patil
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform to simulate a number of exotic quantum ground states and phase transitions. To verify these capabilities numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagomé link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.

Title: Fatigue Behavior of High-Entropy Alloys
Authors: Shiyi Chen, Xuesong Fan, Hugh Shortt, Baldur Steingrimsson, Weidong Li, Peter Liaw
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) refer to alloys composed of five or more elements in equal or near-equal amounts or in an atomic concentration range of 5 to 35 atomic percent (at%). Different elemental ratios will affect the microstructures of HEAs and provide them with unique properties. Based on past research, HEAs have exhibited superior performance, relative to most conventional alloys, with respect to many properties, such as strength, toughness, corrosion resistance, magnetic behavior, etc. Among them, fatigue behavior has been a topic of focus, due to its importance in industrial applications. In this article, we summarized the research progress in the HEA-fatigue behavior in the past ten years, including experimental results and theoretical studies in subdivisions, such as high-cycle fatigue, low-cycle fatigue, fatigue-crack growth, fatigue mechanisms, etc. The influence of the processing and test methods on HEAs is described. The accuracy of several commonly used prediction models is also outlined. Finally, unresolved issues and suggestions on the direction of future research efforts are presented.

Title: Topology-induced symmetry breaking demonstrated in antiferromagnetic magnons on a Möbius strip
Authors: Kuangyin Deng, Ran Cheng
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, where certain local symmetry preserved by the Hamiltonian is explicitly broken in the eigenmodes of excitation due to topologically nontrivial boundary conditions. We demonstrate this phenomenon by studying magnonic excitations on a Möbius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Even with a simple Hamiltonian respecting local rotational symmetry and all local curvature effects ignored, magnons exhibit linear polarization of the Néel vector devoid of chirality, forming two non-degenerate branches that cannot be smoothly connected to or be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons. Correspondingly, one branch undergoes a spectral shift and only admits standing waves of half-integer wavelength, whereas the other only affords standing waves of integer wavelength. The suppression of chirality in the order parameter dynamics, hence the pattern of standing waves, can be generalized to other elementary excitations on non-orientable surfaces. Under the Möbius boundary condition, we further identify an exotic phase hosting spontaneous antiferromagnetic order whilst all exchange couplings are ferromagnetic. Our findings showcase the profound influence of real-space topology on the physical nature of not just the ground state but also the quasiparticles.

Title: Inhomogeneous Floquet thermalization
Authors: Soumya Bera, Ishita Modak, Roderich Moessner
Abstract: How a closed system thermalizes, especially in the absence of global conservation laws but in the presence of disorder and interactions, is one of the central questions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We explore this for a disordered, periodically driven Ising chain. Our numerical results reveal inhomogeneous thermalization leading to a distribution of thermalization timescales within a single disordered sample, which we encode via a distribution of effective local temperatures. Using this, we find an excellent collapse $\textit{without}$ $\textit{any}$ $\textit{fitting}$ $\textit{parameters}$ of the local relaxation dynamics for the entire range of disorder values in the ergodic regime when adapting the disorder-averaged diagonal entanglement entropy as internal `time' of the system. This approach evidences a remarkably uniform parametrization of the dynamical many-body evolution of local temperature within the otherwise highly heterogeneous ergodic regime, independent of the strength of the disorder.

Title: Controlling the dynamics of atomic correlations via the coupling to a dissipative cavity
Authors: Catalin-Mihai Halati, Ameneh Sheikhan, Giovanna Morigi, Corinna Kollath
Abstract: We analyze the relaxation dynamics in an open system, composed by a quantum gas of bosons in a lattice interacting via both contact and global interactions. We report the onset of periodic oscillations of the atomic coherences exhibiting hallmarks of synchronization after a quantum quench. The dynamical behavior exhibits the many-body collapse and revival of atomic coherences and emerges from the interplay of the quantum dissipative nature of the cavity field and the presence of a (approximate) strong symmetry in the dissipative system. We further show that the approximate symmetry can dynamically self-organize. We argue that the approximate symmetry can be tailored to obtain long-lived coherences. These insights provide a general recipe to engineer the dynamics of globally-interacting systems.

Title: Higher Landau-Level Analogs and Signatures of Non-Abelian States in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$
Authors: Chong Wang, Xiao-Wei Zhang, Xiaoyu Liu, Jie Wang, Ting Cao, Di Xiao
Abstract: Recent experimental discovery of fractional Chern insulators at zero magnetic field in moiré superlattices has sparked intense interests in bringing Landau level physics to flat Chern bands. In twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers (tMoTe$_2$), recent theoretical and experimental studies have found three consecutive flat Chern bands at twist angle $\sim 2^\circ$. In this work, we investigate whether higher Landau level physics can be found in these consecutive Chern bands. At twist angles $2.00^\circ$ and $1.89^\circ$, we identify four consecutive $C = 1$ bands for the $K$ valley in tMoTe$_2$. By constructing Wannier functions directly from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a six-orbital model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands, with the orbitals forming a honeycomb lattice. Exact diagonalization on top of Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out with the Wannier functions. Especially, when the second moiré miniband is half-filled, signatures of non-Abelian states are found. Our Wannier-based approach in modelling moiré superlattices is faithful to DFT wave functions and can serve as benchmarks for continuum models. The possibility of realizing non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field also opens up a new pathway for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

Title: Patterns of active dipolar particles in external magnetic fields
Authors: Vitali Telezki, Stefan Klumpp
Abstract: Active particles with a (magnetic) dipole moment are of interest for steering self-propelled motion, but also result in novel collective effects due to their dipole-dipole interaction. Here systems of active dipolar particles are studied with Brownian dynamics simulations to systematically characterize the different patterns they form, specifically in the presence of an external (magnetic) field. The combination of three types of order - clustering, orientational alignment and chain formation - is used to classify the patterns observed in these systems. In the presence of an external field, oriented chains and bands are found to be dominant. These structures show some similarities with columnar cluster seen in (passive) ferrofluids and display columnar spacing and number of lanes per cluster that both decrease with increasing field strength.

Title: Orbital magnetization from interface reflections in a conductor with charge current
Authors: J. Voss, I. A. Ado, M. Titov
Abstract: We propose that a high-quality flat interface or boundary can serve as a long-range skew scatterer for charged quasiparticles in a metal. When an electric current flows parallel to the interface, the balance between clockwise and counterclockwise reflections is disrupted, leading to a net orbital magnetization. This magnetization is maximized at the interface and varies linearly in the direction perpendicular to it. We suggest that this effect can be detected using spatially resolved Kerr effect measurements at distances up to the electron phase coherence length from the interface. Unlike the orbital Hall and orbital Edelstein effects, the proposed phenomenon does not require inversion symmetry breaking in the bulk of the sample and is unrelated to Hall effect physics.

Title: Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid
Authors: Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.

Abstract: We study the Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions by means of mean-field approximations, spin-wave theory, and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. For the Hubbard model we use the auxiliary-field approach and for Heisenberg systems the stochastic series expansion algorithm and concentrate on bipartite lattices where the QMC simulations are free of the negative sign problem. The hyperbolic lattices have an extensive number of sites on the boundary, such that one has to distinguish between bulk and total density of states (DOS). The considered lattices are characterized by a Dirac-like total DOS, Schläfli indices $\{p,q\}=\{10,3\}$ and $\{8,3\}$, as well as by flat bands, $\{8,8\}$. The Dirac total DOS cuts off the logarithmic divergence of the staggered spin susceptibility and allows for a finite $U$ metal-to-insulator transition. This transition has the same mean-field exponents as for the Gross-Neveu transition in Euclidean space. We argue that this transition is induced by the open-boundary conditions and that it will be absent in the periodic case. In the presence of flat bands we observe the onset of magnetic ordering at any finite $U$. This conclusion holds even though the bulk DOS is constant at the Fermi energy for the three considered lattices. The magnetic state at intermediate coupling can be described as a global antiferromagnet. It breaks the $C_p$ rotational and time-reversal symmetries but remains invariant under combined $C_p \mathcal{T}$ transformations. The state is characterized by macroscopic ferromagnetic moments, that globally cancel. We observe that fluctuations on the boundary of the system are greatly enhanced: While spin-wave calculations predict the breakdown of antiferromagnetism on the boundary but not in the bulk, QMC simulations show a marked reduction of the staggered moment on the edge of the system.

Title: Universal spectrum of isolated three-body resonances
Authors: Ludovic Pricoupenko
Abstract: Using exact solutions of the three-body problem, the spectrum of isolated three-body resonances for two identical particles interacting with another one is derived in the regime of large scattering length. The universality of the problem is depicted by using a contact model parameterized by two three-body parameters and the scattering length.

Title: A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics
Authors: Maxwell J D Ramstead, Dalton A R Sakthivadivel, Karl J Friston
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.

Title: Capacitance-based Fermion parity read-out and predicted Rabi oscillations in a Majorana nanowire
Authors: Jay D. Sau, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: Recent experiments have measured flux dependent capacitance at radio frequencies leading to the potential for a fast parity read-out of a Majorana qubit. In this work we argue that the quantum dot used in the capacitance measurement can be reasonably approximated by a non-interacting weakly coupled orbital. We then predict the measured flux and parity dependent capacitance for several parameter regimes of the disordered Majorana nanowire model that are both topological and trivial. Following this we study how such a fast capacitance read-out can be used to characterize the quantum coherence of a Majorana nanowire-based qubit using Rabi oscillations. We additionally show that such measurements, if made possible by coherent inter-wire tunneling, would provide a valuable way of characterizing the low energy states in the frequency domain.

Title: Altermagnetism in Heavy Fermion Systems: Mean-Field study on Kondo Lattice
Authors: Miaomiao Zhao, Wei-Wei Yang, Xueming Guo, Hong-Gang Luo, Yin Zhong
Abstract: Recently, a novel collinear magnet, i.e. the altermagnet (AM), with spin-splitting energy band and zero net magnetization have attracted great interest due to its potential spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate AM-like phases in a microscopic Kondo lattice (KL) model with an alternating next-nearest-neighbor-hopping (NNNH). Such alternating NNNH take nonmagnetic atoms, neglected in usual antiferromagnetism study, into account when encountering real-life candidate AM materials. With the framework of fermionic parton mean-field theory, we find three different ground-states for the half-filling KL: 1) a $d$-wave AM state; 2) a coexistent phase with both $d$-wave AM and intrinsic Kondo screening effect; 3) a Kondo insulator. The AM-like states are characterized by their spin-splitting quasiparticle bands, Fermi surface, spin-resolved distribution function and conductivity. It is suggested that the magnetic quantum oscillation, scanning tunneling microscopy and charge transport measurement can detect those AM-like phases. We hope the present work may be useful for exploring AM-like phases in $f$-electron compounds such as CeNiAsO and Ce$_{4}$X$_{3}$(X=As,Sb,Bi).

Title: Measurement of total phase fluctuation in cold-atomic quantum simulators
Authors: Taufiq Murtadho, Federica Cataldini, Sebastian Erne, Marek Gluza, Mohammadamin Tajik, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Nelly H.Y. Ng
Abstract: Studying the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is often constrained by the limitations in probing relevant observables, especially in continuous systems. A powerful method to gain information about such systems is the reconstruction of local currents from the continuity equation. We show that this approach can be used to extract the total phase fluctuation of adjacent Bose gases. We validate our technique numerically and demonstrate its effectiveness by analyzing data from selected experiments simulating 1D quantum field theories through the phase difference of two parallel 1D Bose gases. This analysis reveals the previously hidden sector of the sum mode of the phase, which is important for studying long-time thermalization and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the system. Our method is general and can be applied to other cold atom systems with spatial phase gradients, thereby expanding the scope and capabilities of cold-atomic quantum simulators.

Title: Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic
Authors: Jacques K. Desmarais, Alessandro Erba, Giovanni Vignale, Stefano Pittalis
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.

Title: General collisionless kinetic approach to studying excitations in arbitrary-spin quantum atomic gases
Authors: M. Bulakhov, A.S. Peletminskii, Yu.V. Slyusarenko
Abstract: We develop a general kinetic approach to studying high-frequency collective excitations in arbitrary-spin quantum gases. To this end, we formulate a many-body Hamiltonian that includes the multipolar exchange interaction as well as the coupling of a multipolar moment with an external field. By linearizing the respective collisionless kinetic equation, we find a general dispersion equation that allows us to examine the high-frequency collective modes for arbitrary-spin atoms obeying one or another quantum statistics. We analyze some of its particular solutions describing spin waves and zero sound for Bose and Fermi gases.

Title: Efficiency of band edge optical transitions of 2D monolayer materials: A high-throughput computational study
Authors: A. F. Gómez-Bastidas, Karthik Sriram, A. C. Garcia-Castro, Oleg Rubel
Abstract: We performed high-throughput density functional theory calculations of optical matrix elements between band edges across a diverse set of non-magnetic two-dimensional monolayers with direct band gaps. Materials were ranked as potential optical emitters, leading to the identification of transition-metal nitrogen halides (ZrNCl, TiNBr, TiNCl) and bismuth chalcohalides (BiTeCl) with optical coupling comparable to or exceeding MoS$_2$. Despite strong in-plane dipole transitions, most two-dimensional materials underperform bulk semiconductors due to the absence of out-of-plane components. To elucidate interband transitions, we introduced the orbital overlap tensor and established a correlation between anomalous Born effective charges and optical coupling, linking charge redistribution to transition strength. We also identified chalcogen-mediated $d$-$d$ transition as a key mechanism enabling optical responses in transition-metal dichalcogenides. We derived an analytical radiative recombination model incorporating multi-valley effects and found that excitonic corrections are essential for accurate lifetime predictions. Some direct-gap materials exhibit dark excitons as their lowest-energy states, classifying them as quasi-direct band gap semiconductors, which is critical for tuning excitonic recombination dynamics.

Title: Majorana edge and end states in planar Josephson junctions
Authors: A. P. Garrido, P. A. Orellana, A. Matos-Abiague
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the localization properties of Majorana states (MSs) in proximitized, planar Josephson Junctions (JJs) oriented along different crystallographic orientations and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that two types of MSs may emerge when the junction transits into the topological superconducting state. In one case, referred to as end-like MSs, the Majorana quasiparticles are mainly localized inside the normal region at the opposite ends of the junction. In contrast, edge-like MSs extend along the opposite edges of the system, perpendicular to the junction channel. We show how the MSs can transit from end-like to edge-like and vice versa by tuning the magnetic field strength and/or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In the case of phase-unbiased JJs the transition may occur as the ground state phase difference self-adjusts its value when the Zeeman field is varied.

Title: Novel electronic state of honeycomb iridate Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ at high pressure
Authors: G. Fabbris, E. H. T. Poldi, S. Sinha, J. Lim, T. Elmslie, J. H. Kim, A. Said, M. Upton, M. Abramchuk, F. Bahrami, C. Kenney-Benson, C. Park, G. Shen, Y. K. Vohra, R. J. Hemley, J. J. Hamlin, F. Tafti, D. Haskel
Abstract: Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ has attracted recent interest due to its proximity to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state and the complex structural response observed at high pressures. We use x-ray spectroscopy and scattering as well as electrical transport techniques to unveil the electronic structure of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ at ambient and high pressures. Despite featuring a $\mathrm{Ir^{4+}}$ $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ state at ambient pressure, Ir $L_{3}$ edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering reveals broadened electronic excitations that point to the importance of Ir $5d$-Cu $3d$ interaction. High pressure first drives an Ir-Ir dimer state with collapsed $\langle \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S} \rangle$ and $\langle L_z \rangle/\langle S_z \rangle$, signaling the formation of $5d$ molecular orbitals. A novel $\mathrm{Cu \to Ir}$ charge transfer is observed at the onset of phase 5 above 30 GPa at low temperatures, leading to an approximate $\mathrm{Ir^{3+}}$ and $\mathrm{Cu^{1.5+}}$ valence, with persistent insulating electrical transport seemingly driven by charge segregation of Cu 1+/2+ ions into distinct sites. Concomitant x-ray spectroscopy and scattering measurements through different thermodynamic paths demonstrate a strong electron-lattice coupling, with $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ and $\mathrm{Ir^{3+}}$/$\mathrm{Cu^{1.5+}}$ electronic states occurring only in phases 1 and 5, respectively. Remarkably, the charge-transferred state can only be reached if Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ is pressurized at low temperature, suggesting that phonons play an important role in the stability of this phase. These results point to the choice of thermodynamic path across interplanar collapse transition as a key route to access novel states in intercalated iridates.

Title: Modeling glasses from first-principles using random structure sampling
Authors: Laszlo Wolf, Andrew Novick, Vladan Stevanović
Abstract: We present an approach to approximating static properties of glasses without experimental inputs rooted in the first-principles random structure sampling. In our approach, the glassy system is represented by a collection (composite) of periodic, small-cell (few 10s of atoms) local minima on the potential energy surface. These are obtained by generating a set of periodic structures with random lattice parameters and random atomic positions, which are then relaxed to their closest local minima on the potential energy surface using the first-principles methods. Using vitreous SiO2 as an example, we illustrate and discuss how well various atomic and electronic structure properties calculated as averages over the set of such local minima reproduce experimental data. The practical benefit of our approach, which can be rigorously thought of as representing an infinitely quickly quenched liquid, is in that it transfers the computational burden to linearly scaling and easy to converge averages of properties computed on small-cell structures, rather than simulation cells with 100s if not 1000s of atoms while retaining a good overall predictive accuracy. Because of this it enables the future use of high-cost/high-accuracy electronic structure methods thereby bringing modeling of glasses and amorphous phases closer to the state of modeling of crystalline solids.

Title: Temperature-Stable Tunneling Current in Serial Double Quantum Dots: Insights from Nonequilibrium Green Functions and Pauli Spin Blockade
Authors: David M T Kuo
Abstract: We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.

Title: Bulk electricity storage in 1-nm water channels

Abstract: Nanometer-scale solid-state confinement has been shown to change water's structure and dynamics, offering new horizons in energy storage. However, most current materials operate at the micrometer scale, missing the interfacial effects that occur at three orders of magnitude smaller dimensions. Here, we report a scalable energy storage device that uses ultraconfined water as its sole electrolyte, unlocking the advantages of nanoscale confinement. We use the polarizability and proton 'superconductivity' of water confined in few-molecular-diameters clay channels to build an all-water supercapacitor. The device fabricated from reconstructed clay, graphene, and water by a sustainable self-assembly process, operates at voltages up to 1.65 V, has competitive power and energy density, and maintains near 100% Coulombic efficiency over 60,000 charge-discharge cycles. These results demonstrate the application of unique properties of ultraconfined water for sustainable energy storage and provide a benchmark for a class of novel ultraconfined water energy systems, or 'blue devices'.

Title: Formulation of entropy through work by Carnot machine and direct derivation of law of entropy non-decrease from Kelvin-Planck principle
Authors: Yuki Izumida
Abstract: We derive the law of entropy non-decrease directly from the Kelvin-Planck principle for simple and compound systems without using the Clausius inequality. A key of the derivation is a formulation of entropy in terms of work by a Carnot machine operating between a system and a single heat reservoir, which is equivalent to Clausius entropy based on heat and Gyftopoulos-Beretta entropy based on work.

Title: Depletion interaction between cylindrical inclusions in polymer brushes
Authors: Ji Woong Yu, Daeseong Yong, Bae-Yeun Ha, Changbong Hyeon
Abstract: Inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent (depletion) attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the volume of depletion zones around the inclusions, thereby to maximize the entropy of the surrounding polymers. Here, we study the brush-induced depletion attraction between cylindrical inclusions using molecular dynamics simulations and the Asakura-Oosawa theory. Our considerations find that the correlation blobs defined in the brush environment serve as the fundamental units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the entropy of the overgrown polymer competes with the depletion attraction between the inclusions. As a result, the brush-induced depletion interaction displays non-monotonic variations with the brush height. Our study not only expands the repertoire of colloid-polymer mixtures to depletion interactions in brushes, but also suggests the brush-induced depletion interaction as a previously unappreciated mechanism for glycocalyx-induced protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.

Title: Theory of charge dynamics in bilayer electron system with long-range Coulomb interaction
Authors: Hiroyuki Yamase
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of charge excitations in a bilayer electron system in the presence of the long-range Coulomb interaction (LRC). Our major point is to derive formulae of the LRC that fully respect the bilayer lattice structure. This is an extension of the LRC obtained by Fetter in the electron-gas model 50 years ago and can now be applicable to any electron density. We then provide general formulae of the charge susceptibility in the random phase approximation and study them numerically. The charge ordering tendency is not found and instead we find two plasmon modes, w_{+} and w_{-} modes. Our second major point is to elucidate their spectral weight distribution and the effect of electron tunneling between the layers. The spectral weight of the w_{+-} modes does not have 2pi periodicity along the q_{z}c direction. The w_{+} mode loses spectral weight at inplane momentum q_{||}=(0,0) at q_{z}c=2n pi with n being integer whereas the w_{-} mode has no spectral weight at q_{z}c=0 for any q_{||} but acquires sizable spectral weight at q_{z}c=2n pi with n \ne 0. Both w_{+-} modes are gapped at q_{||}=(0,0). When q_{z}c is away from 2n pi, the w_{+-} modes show striking behavior. When the intrabilayer hopping t_z is relatively small (large), the w_{-} (w_{+}) mode becomes gapless at q_{||}=(0,0) whereas the w_{+} (w_{-}) mode retains the gap. However, when the interbilayer hopping integral t_{z}' is taken into account, the gapless mode acquires a gap at q_{||}=(0,0) and both w_{+-} modes are gapped at any q_{z}c. To highlight the special feature of the LRC, we also clarify a difference to the case of a short-range interaction. While the strong electron correlation effects are not included, the present theory captures available data of the charge excitations observed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering for Y-based cuprate superconductors.

Title: Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems
Authors: An Wang, Li Zou
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. We also demonstrated that using a single variable enables a linear SVM to achieve nearly perfect three-phase classification. Inspired by this discovery, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only achieves this classification without sacrificing significant performance but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.

Title: Multi-objective Bayesian Optimisation of Spinodoid Cellular Structures for Crush Energy Absorption
Authors: Hirak Kansara, Siamak F. Khosroshahi, Leo Guo, Miguel A. Bessa, Wei Tan
Abstract: In the pursuit of designing safer and more efficient energy-absorbing structures, engineers must tackle the challenge of improving crush performance while balancing multiple conflicting objectives, such as maximising energy absorption and minimising peak impact forces. Accurately simulating real-world conditions necessitates the use of complex material models to replicate the non-linear behaviour of materials under impact, which comes at a significant computational cost. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation framework specifically developed to optimise spinodoid structures for crush energy absorption. Spinodoid structures, characterised by their scalable, non-periodic topologies and efficient stress distribution, offer a promising direction for advanced structural design. However, optimising design parameters to enhance crush performance is far from straightforward, particularly under realistic conditions. Conventional optimisation methods, although effective, often require a large number of costly simulations to identify suitable solutions, making the process both time-consuming and resource intensive. In this context, multi-objective Bayesian optimisation provides a clear advantage by intelligently navigating the design space, learning from each evaluation to reduce the number of simulations required, and efficiently addressing the complexities of non-linear material behaviour. By integrating finite element analysis with Bayesian optimisation, the framework developed in this study tackles the dual challenge of improving energy absorption and reducing peak force, particularly in scenarios where plastic deformation plays a critical role. The use of scalarisation and hypervolume-based techniques enables the identification of Pareto-optimal solutions, balancing these conflicting objectives.

Title: Epitaxial PbGeSe thin films and their photoluminescence in the mid-wave infrared
Authors: Kelly Xiao, Bryce Wong, Jarod Meyer, Leland Nordin, Kunal Mukherjee
Abstract: PbSe is a narrow bandgap IV-VI compound semiconductor with application in mid-wave infrared optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, and quantum devices. Alkaline earth or rare earth elements such as Sr and Eu can substitute Pb to widen the bandgap of PbSe in heterostructure devices, but they come with challenges such as deteriorating optical and electronic properties, even in dilute concentrations due to their dissimilar atomic nature. We substitute Pb instead with column-IV Ge and assess the potential of rocksalt phase PbGeSe as a wider bandgap semiconductor in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs substrates. Low sticking of GeSe adatoms requires synthesis temperatures below 260 °C to incorporate Ge, but this yields poor structural and compositional uniformity as determined by X-ray diffraction. Consequently, as-grown films in the range Pb0.94Ge0.06Se to Pb0.83Ge0.17Se (6-17% Ge) show much less bandgap widening in photoluminescence than prior work on bulk crystals using absorption. We observe that post-growth rapid thermal annealing at temperatures of 375-450 °C improves the crystal quality and recovers bandgap widening. Rapid interdiffusion of Ge during annealing, however, remains a challenge in harnessing such PbGeSe materials for compositionally sharp heterostructures. Annealed 17%-Ge films emit light at 3-3.1 um with minimal shift in wavelength versus temperature. These samples are wider in bandgap than PbSe films by 55 meV at room temperature and the widening increases to 160 meV at 80 K, thanks to sharply different dependence of bandgap on temperature in PbSe and PbGeSe.

Title: Spin flip locking by the tunneling and relaxation in a driven double quantum dot with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: D.V. Khomitsky, M.V. Bastrakova, D.S. Pashin
Abstract: Coupled spin evolution and tunneling together with the relaxation and decoherence effects are studied for the double quantum dot formed in a semiconductor nanowire and driven by the periodic electric field. Such system represents a model of the spin and charge qubits interacting via the strong spin-orbit coupling. It is found that at certain regimes the combination of fast relaxation in the coordinate channel with the slower relaxation in the spin channel leads to the promising combination of fast spin manipulation and slow spin relaxation, locking the flipped spin in an excited state in one of the dots for a sufficiently long time. The predicted effect is maintained for a wide range of the relaxation times and the driving amplitude both for the coordinate and the spin channels and is also observed on higher subharmonic which requires lower driving frequencies.

Title: Quench Spectroscopy for Dissipative and (Non)-Hermitian Quantum Lattice Models
Authors: Julien Despres
Abstract: We extend the quench spectroscopy method to dissipative and isolated non-Hermitian quantum lattice models via the case study of the open Bose-Hubbard chain and the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain respectively. We first investigate theoretically the dynamics of the open Bose-Hubbard chain confined in the superfluid phase induced by a sudden global quench on the dissipations and the repulsive interactions using the equation-of-motion approach. Using the same analytical approach, we then discuss the applicability of the quench spectroscopy to non-Hermitian quantum lattice models by considering the sudden global quench dynamics of the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain confined in the paramagnetic phase. We finally generalize this spectroscopy method to isolated Hermitian quantum lattice models characterized by a quadratic fermionic or bosonic Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we consider the case study of the Hermitian version of the latter one-dimensional lattice model. The investigation is performed analytically for the bosonic and fermionic reformulations while considering for each case the equation-of-motion and quasiparticle theoretical approaches.

Title: Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model
Authors: Xiaoxue Ran, Sylvain Capponi, Junchen Rong, Fabien Alet, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal~\cite{ran2024hidden} experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of {\it thermal fractionalization}, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Random Tree Model of Meaningful Memory
Authors: Weishun Zhong, Tankut Can, Antonis Georgiou, Ilya Shnayderman, Mikhail Katkov, Misha Tsodyks
Abstract: Traditional studies of memory for meaningful narratives focus on specific stories and their semantic structures but do not address common quantitative features of recall across different narratives. We introduce a statistical ensemble of random trees to represent narratives as hierarchies of key points, where each node is a compressed representation of its descendant leaves, which are the original narrative segments. Recall is modeled as constrained by working memory capacity from this hierarchical structure. Our analytical solution aligns with observations from large-scale narrative recall experiments. Specifically, our model explains that (1) average recall length increases sublinearly with narrative length, and (2) individuals summarize increasingly longer narrative segments in each recall sentence. Additionally, the theory predicts that for sufficiently long narratives, a universal, scale-invariant limit emerges, where the fraction of a narrative summarized by a single recall sentence follows a distribution independent of narrative length.

Title: Density of states and differential entropy in Dirac materials in crossed magnetic and in-plane electric fields
Authors: Andrii A. Chaika, Yelizaveta Kulynych, D.O. Oriekhov, Sergei G. Sharapov
Abstract: The density of states and differential entropy per particle are analyzed for Dirac-like electrons in graphene subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field and an in-plane electric field. For comparison, the derived density of states is contrasted with the well-known case of nonrelativistic electrons in crossed magnetic and electric fields. The study considers ballistic electrons and also includes the effect of small impurity scattering. In the latter case, the limit of zero magnetic field and the so-called collapse of Landau levels in graphene are examined analytically. By comparing the results with numerical calculations on graphene ribbons, we demonstrate that the Landau state counting procedure must be modified for Dirac-like electrons, leading to a fields-dependent Landau level degeneracy factor. Additionally, it is shown that peaks in the differential entropy arise from the dispersionless surface mode localized at the zigzag edges of the ribbon.

Title: CrystalFlow: A Flow-Based Generative Model for Crystalline Materials
Authors: Xiaoshan Luo, Zhenyu Wang, Qingchang Wang, Jian Lv, Lei Wang, Yanchao Wang, Yanming Ma
Abstract: Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration space of crystalline materials. In this work, we present CrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and material science.

Title: Nonlinear stage of modulational instability in repulsive two-component Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: S. Mossman, S.I. Mistakidis, G. C. Katsimiga, A. Romero-Ros, G. Biondini, P. Schmelcher, P. Engels, P. G. Kevrekidis
Abstract: Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.

Title: Gap Anisotropy in Layered Superconductors Due to Rashba and Dresselhaus Spin-Orbit Interactions
Authors: Bahruz Suleymanli, B. Tanatar
Abstract: The theory of layered superconductors is extended in the presence of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions (SOIs). Using the intralayer BCS-like pairing interaction and employing the Gor'kov formalism, we obtain analytical expressions for the temperature Green's functions and determine the gap function $\Delta$ which becomes complex in the presence of SOIs. In the absence of SOIs, $\Delta$ is isotropic at both zero and finite temperatures, but it becomes anisotropic even in the presence of a single SOI. This anisotropy is related to the extra $\cos{k_z}$ factors in which the $k_z$ momentum along the $z$ direction contributes to the magnitude of the gap function. It is also found that SOIs suppress $\Delta$ at both zero and finite temperatures, and for certain critical values of SOIs and beyond $\Delta$ vanishes. Analytical expressions for the critical values of SOIs at zero temperature are obtained. Additionally, how the BCS equation for layered superconductors changes in the presence of SOIs is determined.

Title: Field-theory approach to flat polymerized membranes
Authors: Simon Metayer, Sofian Teber
Abstract: We review the field-theoretic renormalization-group approach to critical properties of flat polymerized membranes. We start with a presentation of the flexural effective model that is entirely expressed in terms of a transverse (flexural) field with non-local interactions. We then provide a detailed account of the full three-loop computations of the renormalization-group functions of the model within the dimensional regularization scheme. The latter allows us to consider the general case of a $d$-dimensional membrane embedded in $D$-dimensional space. Focusing on the critical flat phase of two-dimensional membranes $(d = 2)$ in three-dimensional space $(D = 3)$, we analyse the corresponding flow diagram and present the derivation of the anomalous stiffness. The latter controls all the other critical exponents of the theory such as the roughness exponent and the scaling of the elastic constants. State-of-the-art four-loop results as well as discussions on the structure of the perturbative series and comparison with other approaches are also provided.

Title: Partial versus total resetting for Lévy flights in d dimensions: similarities and discrepancies
Authors: Costantino Di Bello, Aleksei Chechkin, Tomasz Grzywny, Karol Szczypkowski, Bartosz Trojan, Zbigniew Palmowski
Abstract: While stochastic resetting (or total resetting) is less young and more established concept in stochastic processes, partial stochastic resetting (PSR) is a relatively new field. PSR means that, at random moments in time, a stochastic process gets multiplied by a factor between 0 and 1, thus approaching but not reaching the resetting position. In this paper, we present new results on PSR highlighting the main similarities and discrepancies with total resetting. Specifically, we consider both symmetric $\alpha$-stable Lévy processes (Lévy flights) and Brownian motion with PSR in arbitrary d dimensions. We derive explicit expressions for the propagator and its stationary measure, and discuss in detail their asymptotic behavior. Interestingly, while approaching to stationarity, a dynamical phase transition occurs for the Brownian motion, but not for Lévy flights. We also analyze the behavior of the process around the resetting position and find significant differences between PSR and total resetting.

Title: Comparison of NiFeCr and NiFe in ferromagnetic Josephson junctions
Authors: Joshua Willard, Swapna Sindhu Mishra, Robert M. Klaes, Nicholas J. Emtage, Reza Loloee, Norman O. Birge
Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.

Title: Multifractal-enriched mobility edges and emergent quantum phases in Rydberg atomic arrays
Authors: Shan-Zhong Li, Yi-Cai Zhang, Yucheng Wang, Shanchao Zhang, Shi-Liang Zhu, Zhi Li
Abstract: Anderson localization describes disorder-induced phase transitions, distinguishing between localized and extended states. In quasiperiodic systems, a third multifractal state emerges, characterized by unique energy and wave functions. However, critical indicators for differentiating these states, such as Lyapunov exponents (LEs) and inverse participation ratios (IPRs), have yet to be experimentally detected. To address these challenges, we introduce exactly solvable one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with flat bands, analytically determining phase boundaries using Avila's global theorem. We propose experimental realizations using Rydberg atom arrays, enabling the distinction of localized, extended, and multifractal states with as few as 18 qubits. Importantly, we develop a robust spectroscopic method for the experimental measurement of LEs and IPRs. Our work opens new avenues for the experimental exploration of Anderson localization and multifractal states in artificial quantum systems.

Title: Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals
Authors: Andressa R. Medeiros-Silva, Mariana Malard, Rodrigo G. Pereira, Thereza Paiva
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.

Title: Pure momentum-shift bulk photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric flat-band Mott insulators
Authors: Zhuocheng Lu, Zhihao Gong, Jingshan Qi, Hua Wang, Kai Chang
Abstract: The shift current photovoltaic effect is conventionally understood as the real-space displacement of a wave packet induced by photoexcitation. However, this interpretation becomes insufficient in flat-band systems, where quasiparticles are too massive to accelerate in real space under the optical electric field. Here, we developed a physically consistent method to decompose the shift current into real-space and momentum-space components. A surprising pure momentum-space shift current is found theoretically in flat-band Mott insulator Nb$_3$X$_8$ (X = Cl, Br, I) monolayers. This work underscores that significant shift current responses can emerge even in systems with minimal interband polarization differences, highlighting the potential for exploring novel bulk photovoltaic effects in flat-band Mott insulators.

Title: Quantum Turbulence Across Dimensions: Crossover from two- to three-dimension
Authors: Weican Yang, Xing Wang, Makoto Tsubota
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.

Title: Comprehensive numerical analysis of doping controlled efficiency in lead free Cs(SnGe)I3 perovskites solar cell
Authors: Nazmul Hasan, M. Hussayeen Khan Anik, Mohammed Mehedi Hasan, Sharnali Islam, Alamgir Kabir
Abstract: One effective way to prevent toxicity and improve the stability of materials for photovoltaic applications is to exclude lead and organic molecules from perovskite materials. Specifically, the CsSn1-xGexI3 appears to be a promising contender; nonetheless, it requires optimization, particularly bandgap tuning by doping concentration modifications. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was employed to comprehensively analyze the electronic properties of CsSn1-xGexI3 that influenced light-matter interactions tuning of the perovskite materials by varying composition in B site atoms. We use the solar cell capacitance (SCAPS-1D) simulator to compute device performance; however, it computes the absorption spectrum using a simplified mathematical function that approximates the actual spectrum. To achieve a quantum-mechanical level of accuracy DFT extracted parameters like absorption spectra and bandgap were fed into SCAPS-1D. We find that increasing the Ge concentration leads to a higher bandgap and improved absorption profile, thereby enhancing solar energy conversion efficiency. Thermal and field distribution analyses were also done for the optimized device through a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework. By optimizing the absorber layer with a 75% Ge concentration, we achieve a remarkable PCE of 23.80%. Our findings guide future research in designing high-performance non-leaded halide PSCs, paving the way for low-cost, stable, and highly efficient solar cells through atomic doping-tuned perovskite absorber layers.

Title: Thermal behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates of polar molecules
Authors: Juan Sánchez-Baena, Gerard Pascual, Raúl Bombín, Ferran Mazzanti, Jordi Boronat
Abstract: We use the finite-temperature extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation (TeGPE) to study a condensate of dipolar NaCs molecules under the conditions of the very recent, breakthrough experiment [Bigagli this http URL., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. We report the condensate fraction of the system, and its density profile after a time-of flight expansion for the coldest experimental case, finding excellent agreement with the experimental measurements. We also report the peak density of the ground state and establish a comparison with the experimental estimates. Our results, derived from the TeGPE formalism, successfully describe the Bose-Einstein condensation of polar molecules at finite temperature.

Title: Triggered ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ from hybrid phonons
Authors: Seongjoo Jung, Turan Birol
Abstract: Ferroelectric HfO$_2$ has garnered significant attention for its promising application in high density nonvolatile data storage and nanoscale transistors. However, the uncertain origin of polarization in HfO$_2$ limits our ability to fully understand and control its ferroelectricity. The ongoing debate centers on whether HfO$_2$ is a proper or improper ferroelectric, as it exhibits characteristics of both types. In this study, we utilize symmetry-guided first-principles quantum mechanical (DFT) calculations to accurately map the energy landscape and identify the coherent switching pathway of HfO$_2$ by voltage. Our findings reveal two key insights. First, ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ is driven by a triggered mechanism through coupling between the stable polar mode and hybrid non-polar modes. Second, unusually high polarization arises from the hybrid modes, which consists solely of non-polar modes. The results fundamentally transforms the perspective on polarization in HfO$_2$ and resolve conflicting characteristics observed, offering valuable guidance for superior technological applications.

Title: Apparent nonreciprocal transport in FeSe bulk crystals
Authors: Taichi Terashima, Shinya Uji, Yuji Matsuda, Takasada Shibauchi, Shigeru Kasahara
Abstract: We performed low-frequency ac first- and second-harmonic resistance measurements and dc $I-V$ measurements on bulk FeSe crystals in a temperature range between 1.8 and 150 K and in magnetic field up to 14 T. We observed considerable second-harmonic resistance, indicative of nonreciprocal charge transport, in some samples. By examining correlation between contact resistances and second-harmonic signals, we concluded that the second-harmonic resistance was not due to the genuine nonreciprocal transport effect but was caused by joule heating at a current contact through the thermoelectric effect. Our conclusion is consistent with a recent preprint (Nagata \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2409.01715), in which the authors reported a zero-field superconducting diode effect in devices fabricated with FeSe flakes and attributed it to the thermoelectric effect.

Title: Superspin Renormalization and Slow Relaxation in Random Spin Systems
Authors: Yi J. Zhao, Samuel J. Garratt, Joel E. Moore
Abstract: We develop an excited-state real-space renormalization group (RSRG-X) formalism to describe the dynamics of conserved densities in randomly interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems. Our formalism is suitable for systems with $\textrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and we apply it to chains of randomly positioned spins with dipolar $XX+YY$ interactions, as arise in Rydberg quantum simulators and other platforms. The formalism generates a sequence of effective Hamiltonians which provide approximate descriptions for dynamics on successively smaller energy scales. These effective Hamiltonians involve ``superspins'': two-level collective degrees of freedom constructed from (anti)aligned microscopic spins. Conserved densities can then be understood as relaxing via coherent collective spin flips. For the well-studied simpler case of randomly interacting nearest-neighbor $XX+YY$ chains, the superspins reduce to single spins. Our formalism also leads to a numerical method capable of simulating the dynamics up to an otherwise inaccessible combination of large system size and late time. Focusing on disorder-averaged infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, in particular the local spin survival probability $\overline{S_p}(t)$, we demonstrate quantitative agreement in results between our algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) at low but nonzero frequencies. Such agreement holds for chains with nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor, and long-range dipolar interactions. Our results indicate decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$ slower than any power law and feature no significant deviation from the $\sim 1/ \log^2(t)$ asymptote expected from the infinite-randomness fixed-point of the nearest-neighbor model. We also apply the RSRG-X formalism to two-dimensional long-range systems of moderate size and find slow late-time decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$.

Title: Finite-time blowup of a Brownian particle in a repulsive potential
Authors: P. L. Krapivsky, Baruch Meerson
Abstract: We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.

Title: Strong-coupling high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity in doped correlated band insulator
Authors: Yusuke Nomura, Motoharu Kitatani, Shiro Sakai, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: We explore the superconducting properties of the bilayer Hubbard model, which exhibits a high transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) for an $s_{\pm}$ pairing, using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory. Unlike the single-layer Hubbard model, where the $d$-wave superconductivity emerges by doping the Mott insulator, the parent state of the bilayer system is a correlated band insulator. Above $T_{\rm c}$, slight hole (electron) doping introduces a striking dichotomy between electron and hole pockets: the electron (hole) pocket develops a pseudogap while the other becomes a nearly incipient band. We reveal that the superconductivity is driven by kinetic (potential) energy gain in the underdoped (overdoped) region. We also find a very short coherence length, for which we argue the relevance to multi-orbital physics. Our study offers crucial insights into the superconductivity in the bilayer Hubbard model potentially relevant to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Local geometry of NAE-SAT solutions in the condensation regime
Authors: Allan Sly, Youngtak Sohn
Abstract: The local behavior of typical solutions of random constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) describes many important phenomena including clustering thresholds, decay of correlations, and the behavior of message passing algorithms. When the constraint density is low, studying the planted model is a powerful technique for determining this local behavior which in many examples has a simple Markovian structure. The work of Coja-Oghlan, Kapetanopoulos, Müller (2020) showed that for a wide class of models, this description applies up to the so-called condensation threshold. Understanding the local behavior after the condensation threshold is more complex due to long-range correlations. In this work, we revisit the random regular NAE-SAT model in the condensation regime and determine the local weak limit which describes a random solution around a typical variable. This limit exhibits a complicated non-Markovian structure arising from the space of solutions being dominated by a small number of large clusters. This is the first description of the local weak limit in the condensation regime for any sparse random CSPs in the one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) class. Our result is non-asymptotic, and characterizes the tight fluctuation $O(n^{-1/2})$ around the limit. Our proof is based on coupling the local neighborhoods of an infinite spin system, which encodes the structure of the clusters, to a broadcast model on trees whose channel is given by the 1RSB belief-propagation fixed point. We believe that our proof technique has broad applicability to random CSPs in the 1RSB class.

Title: Spectral chaos bounds from scaling theory of maximally efficient quantum-dynamical scrambling
Authors: Tara Kalsi, Alessandro Romito, Henning Schomerus
Abstract: A key conjecture about the evolution of complex quantum systems towards an ergodic steady state, known as scrambling, is that this process acquires universal features when it is most efficient. We develop a single-parameter scaling theory for the spectral statistics in this scenario, which embodies exact self-similarity of the spectral correlations along the complete scrambling dynamics. We establish that the scaling predictions are matched by a privileged stochastic process and serve as bounds for other dynamical scrambling scenarios, allowing one to quantify inefficient or incomplete scrambling on all time scales.

Title: Sensitivity of peptide conformational dynamics in carbon nanotubes to directional mechanical forces
Authors: Felipe C. Nepomuceno, Michal H. Kolář
Abstract: In living organisms, proteins and peptides are often under the influence of mechanical forces, especially in confined spaces such as membrane channels, ribosome exit tunnel, or proteasome gate. Due to the directional nature of proteins as polymers with distinct ends, forces have the potential to influence protein conformational dynamics in a direction-dependent manner. In this study, we employed force-probe molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of pulling a peptide through a confined environment versus pushing it in the same direction. Our model involves a carbon nanotube and one of three decapeptides with varying amino acid sequences. The simulations reveal that the difference between pulling the C-terminus and pushing the N-terminus is relatively minor when considering the conformational ensembles of the peptides. The loading rate of the force probe and the amino acid sequence of the peptide play a more important role. However, the application of force to the peptide significantly influences the relative motion of the peptides with respect to the nanotube. Pulling the peptide results in a smoother translocation through the nanotube compared to pushing, although the internal conformational dynamics of the peptide add complexity in either case. Our findings shed light on how short peptides navigate confined spaces within the cellular environment, emphasizing the importance of force-probe simulation studies in understanding these processes.

Title: Non-equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for stabilizer Renyi entropy in spin systems
Authors: Zejun Liu, Bryan K. Clark
Abstract: Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer Rényi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.

Title: Probing quantum chaos through singular-value correlations in sparse non-Hermitian SYK model
Authors: Pratik Nandy, Tanay Pathak, Masaki Tezuka
Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Topological edge states in all-dielectric square-lattice arrays of bianisotropic microwave resonators
Authors: Alina D. Rozenblit, Georgiy D. Kurganov, Dmitry V. Zhirihin, Nikita A. Olekhno
Abstract: We demonstrate that a bianisotropic response associated with a broken mirror symmetry of a dielectric resonator allows opening a band gap in simple square lattice arrays of such resonators. Realizing the proposed system as an array of high-index ceramic resonators working at GHz frequencies, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the presence of topological edge states at the interface between two domains with opposite orientations of the bianisotropic resonators, as well as at the boundary between a single domain and free space. For both cases, we experimentally characterize the dispersion of edge states, and we examine their propagation along sharp bends, their resilience to various types of geometrical defects, and a spin-momentum-locked unidirectional propagation in the case of circularly polarized excitation. Also, we develop a theoretical model based on a Green's function approach that describes the square lattice of resonators and features quadratic degeneracies in the vicinity of $\Gamma$ and $M$ high-symmetry points that are removed upon the introduction of bianisotropy, and apply this model to evaluate Berry curvature. The considered design opens possibilities in the construction of optical and microwave structures simultaneously featuring topological edge states at the interfaces between distinct resonator domains or a resonator domain and free space.

Title: Properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics
Authors: Siddharth Seetharaman, Chetanya Singh, Rejish Nath
Abstract: We analyze the properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics, considering a single qubit and a qubit pair. A geometrical picture of the Krylov complexity is discussed for the single-qubit case, whereas it becomes non-trivial for the two-qubit case. Considering the particular case of interacting Rydberg two-level atoms, we show that the Krylov basis obtained using an effective Hamiltonian minimizes the time-averaged spread complexity compared to that which is obtained from the original Hamiltonian. We further generalize the latter property to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space comprises of two subspaces provided a weak coupling between them.

Title: Holographic Foliations: Self-Similar Quasicrystals from Hyperbolic Honeycombs
Authors: Latham Boyle, Justin Kulp
Abstract: Discrete geometries in hyperbolic space are of longstanding interest in pure mathematics and have come to recent attention in holography, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. Working at a purely geometric level, we describe how any regular tessellation of ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic space naturally admits a $d$-dimensional boundary geometry with self-similar ''quasicrystalline'' properties. In particular, the boundary geometry is described by a local, invertible, self-similar substitution tiling, that discretizes conformal geometry. We greatly refine an earlier description of these local substitution rules that appear in the 1D/2D example and use the refinement to give the first extension to higher dimensional bulks; including a detailed account for all regular 3D hyperbolic tessellations. We comment on global issues, including the reconstruction of bulk geometries from boundary data, and introduce the notion of a ''holographic foliation'': a foliation by a stack of self-similar quasicrystals, where the full geometry of the bulk (and of the foliation itself) is encoded in any single leaf in a local invertible way. In the $\{3,5,3\}$ tessellation of 3D hyperbolic space by regular icosahedra, we find a 2D boundary quasicrystal admitting points of 5-fold symmetry which is not the Penrose tiling, and record and comment on a related conjecture of William Thurston. We end with a large list of open questions for future analytic and numerical studies.

Abstract: Instability of the charged pion vacuum resulting in the pion condensation is studied within the $\lambda|\phi|^4$ model at the rapid rotation of the system in presence of external fields. Case of the static external scalar and electric square potential wells and the uniform magnetic field is studied in detail. The Meissner and Aharonov-Bohm effects and the London moment are taken into account. Analogies and differences with the behavior of metallic superconductors under the action of the rotation and the external magnetic field are analysed.

Title: Optimizing attosecond pulse generation in solids by modulating electronic dynamics with monochromatic laser field
Authors: Xinyuan Zhang, Shiqi Hu, Mengxue Guan, Sheng Meng
Abstract: A practical approach is proposed for efficiently generating ultrashort attosecond pulses (APs) from realistic solid-state materials, aiming to optimize pulse width effectively. By adjusting the photon energy while maintaining a constant peak electric field, this strategy modulates the peak vector potential and laser field period, thereby controlling the high harmonic cutoff energy and the time-domain emission characteristics of the harmonics. The field-driven electronic dynamics lead to a non-monotonic variation in both the intensity and duration of the generated attosecond pulses. The light field frequency can be adjusted to yield the optimal pulse. Beyond the primary demonstration with hexagonal boron nitride as a prototypical material, significant pulse width optimization has been achieved across a range of different materials. This straightforward and versatile strategy shows promise for application in solid-state materials, offering new pathways to promote high harmonic performance.

Title: Wormhole-induced effective coupling in SYK chains
Authors: Pablo Basteiro, Giuseppe Di Giulio, Johanna Erdmenger, René Meyer, Zhuo-Yu Xian
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum chains have recently been considered in the context of developing novel discrete realizations of holographic dualities. To advance this programme, we explore the ground states of infinite chains with large number $N$ of Majorana fermions on each site, which interact via on-site $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) couplings, as well as via additional inhomogeneous hopping terms between nearest-neighbour sites. The hopping parameters are either aperiodically or randomly distributed. Our approach unifies techniques to solve SYK-like models in the large $N$ limit with a real-space renormalization group method known as strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG). We show that the SDRG decimation of SYK dots linked by a strong hopping induces an effective hopping interaction between their neighbouring sites. If two decimated sites are nearest neighbours, in the large $q$ limit their local ground states admit a holographic dual description in terms of eternal traversable wormholes. At the end of the SDRG procedure, we obtain a factorised ground state of the infinite inhomogeneous SYK chains that we consider, which has a spacetime description involving a sequence of wormholes. This amounts to a local near-boundary description of the bulk geometry in the context of discrete holography.

Title: Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons
Authors: Valery Shchesnovich
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.

Title: Hot wormholes and chaos dynamics in a two-coupled SYK model
Authors: Martí Berenguer, Javier Mas, Juan Santos-Suárez, Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.

Title: Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics
Authors: Satori Tsuzuki
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.

Title: Engineering of Anyons on M5-Probes via Flux Quantization
Authors: Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber
Abstract: These extended lecture notes survey a novel derivation of anyonic topological order (as seen in fractional quantum Hall systems) on single magnetized M5-branes probing Seifert orbi-singularities ("geometric engineering" of anyons), which we motivate from fundamental open problems in the field of quantum computing. The rigorous construction is non-Lagrangian and non-perturbative, based on previously neglected global completion of the M5-brane's tensor field by flux-quantization consistent with its non-linear self-duality and its twisting by the bulk C-field. This exists only in little-studied non-abelian generalized cohomology theories, notably in a twisted equivariant (and "twistorial") form of unstable Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H"). As a result, topological quantum observables form Pontrjagin homology algebras of mapping spaces from the orbi-fixed worldvolume into a classifying 2-sphere. Remarkably, results from algebraic topology imply from this the quantum observables and modular functor of abelian Chern-Simons theory, as well as braid group actions on defect anyons of the kind envisioned as hardware for topologically protected quantum gates.

Title: Qubit Regularization of Quantum Field Theories
Authors: Shailesh Chandrasekharan
Abstract: To study quantum field theories on a quantum computer, we must begin with Hamiltonians defined on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and then take appropriate limits. This approach can be seen as a new type of regularization for quantum field theories, which we refer to as qubit regularization. A related finite-dimensional regularization, known as the D-theory approach, was proposed long ago as a general framework for all quantum field theories. In this framework, the dimensionality of the local Hilbert space at each spatial point can increase as needed through an additional flavor index. To reproduce asymptotically free QFTs, most studies assume that qubit-regularized theories require extending the local Hilbert space to infinity. However, contrary to this common belief, recent discoveries in (1+1) dimensions have revealed two examples where asymptotic freedom appears to emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space through a novel renormalization group (RG) flow. These findings motivate further investigation into whether asymptotically free gauge theories could also emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space. To support these explorations, we propose an orthonormal basis called the monomer-dimer-tensor-network (MDTN) basis and use it to construct new types of qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories.
