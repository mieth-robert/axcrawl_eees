Title: Strain-transport superposition in shear-thinning dense non-Brownian suspensions
Authors: Rishabh V. More
Abstract: Shear thinning in dense non-Brownian suspensions is often attributed to shear-induced microstructural evolution, including changes in alignment, anisotropy, and near-contact statistics, yet how these changes influence particle-scale dynamics remains unclear. Using particle-resolved simulations of dense suspensions that shear thin through diverse microscopic mechanisms, including short-range attraction, repulsion, and load-dependent friction, we show that the magnitude of nonaffine particle velocities is controlled solely by the imposed shear rate, independent of coordination number, structural anisotropy, and interaction details. In contrast, macroscopic stress and viscosity remain strongly sensitive to the underlying interactions. When mean-squared displacements transverse to the flow are rescaled by accumulated strain and the nonaffine velocity variance, all data collapse onto a single master curve, revealing strain-controlled transport with a robust ballistic-to-diffusive crossover. These results demonstrate a fundamental decoupling between particle-scale kinematics and macroscopic rheology and identify nonaffine velocity fluctuations as the emergent dynamical scale governing shear-driven transport.

Title: Is gelation a singularity or a flow induced instability?
Authors: Manuel Dedola, Ludovico Cademartiri
Abstract: Gelation in the Smoluchowski coagulation equation is commonly interpreted as a finite-time singularity marked by mass loss or moment divergence. We instead characterize gelation as a loss of dynamical stability of the Smoluchowski flow, quantified through the time-dependent spectrum of the Jacobian along the evolving aggregation dynamics. Studying homogeneous kernels $K(i,j)=(ij)^{\alpha}$ together with the classical Smoluchowski, we show that gelation is consistently preceded by the appearance of positive real eigenvalues, indicating a loss of local dynamical stability. While non-gelling kernels exhibit only transient finite-size effects, gelling kernels display persistent spectral destabilization associated with macroscopic gel formation. Our results identify gelation as a genuine dynamical instability of the Smoluchowski flow.

Title: Curve-Fitting to resolve overlapping voltammetric peaks: Model and examples
Authors: Weiguang Huang, T.L.E. Henderson, A.M. Bond, K.B. Oldham
Abstract: A model is presented that is applicable to a wide range of peak-shaped voltammetric signals. It may be used, via curve-fitting, to resolve severely overlapped peaks, irrespective of the degree(s) of reversibility of the electrode processes. The resolution procedure has been thoroughly tested for several voltammetric and polarographic techniques (differential pulse, square wave and pseudo-derivative normal pulse), using reversible, quasireversible and irreversible electrochemical systems.

Title: MAD-SURF: a machine learning interatomic potential for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces
Authors: Manuel González Lastre, Joakim S. Jestilä, Rubén Pérez, Adam S. Foster
Abstract: Predicting how organic molecules adsorb, assemble, and interact on metal surfaces is central to surface chemistry and molecular electronics, particularly in the context of interpreting high-resolution scanning probe microscopy. Yet, the application of first-principles simulations to interfaces is hampered by the computational cost for evaluating the electronic structure for the large number of atoms typically involved. We hereby present MAD-SURF, a machine learning interatomic potential specifically tailored for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces. Trained on a broad dataset spanning diverse molecules, adsorption motifs, surfaces, molecular dynamics trajectories and non-covalent aggregates, MAD-SURF achieves accuracy comparable to the underlying DFT reference while enabling simulations orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. The model reliably reproduces energies, forces and adsorption geometries across the three coinage metal substrates. We demonstrate its capabilities on experimentally characterized systems, including organic monolayers, polycyclic aggregates, flexible biomolecules and the long-range herringbone reconstruction of gold. By merging accuracy, speed, and generalizability, MAD-SURF offers a practical framework for accelerating atomistic simulations and advancing data-driven workflows in surface science.

Title: Jordan-Wigner mapping between quantum-spin and fermionic Casimir effects
Authors: Katsumasa Nakayama, Kei Suzuki
Abstract: The Jordan-Wigner transformation connects spin operators in one-dimensional spin systems and fermionic operators. In this work, we elucidate the relationship between the finite-size corrections in the spin representation and the fermionic Casimir effect in the corresponding fermion representation. In particular, we focus on the ground-state energy of one-dimensional transverse-field Ising and XY models, and show that all finite-size corrections can be interpreted as lattice fermionic Casimir effects. We further find several types of Casimir phenomena, such as the conventional Casimir energy from massless fields, damping behavior from massive fields, vanishing behavior from flat or nonrelativistic bands, and oscillating behavior from the finite-density effect. Our findings establish a dictionary between finite-size corrections in spin chains and fermionic Casimir effects, and provide experimentally relevant platforms for the fermionic Casimir phenomena.

Title: Cooper Condensation and Pair Wave Functions in Strongly Correlated Electrons
Authors: Hannes Karlsson, Johannes S. Hofmann, Alexander Wietek
Abstract: Identifying superconducting states of matter without prior assumptions is a central challenge in strongly correlated electron systems. We introduce a canonical framework for diagnosing the formation of Cooper pair condensates based on the Penrose-Onsager criterion, in which superconducting order is encoded in the spectral properties of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM). Within this formulation, the symmetry and structure of the condensate are obtained by projecting the 2RDM onto irreducible representations of the underlying symmetry group, enabling an unbiased identification of both conventional and exotic superconducting states. We demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach through applications to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using both auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For attractive interactions without a magnetic field, we reveal a clear finite-size scaling of the condensate fraction on square lattices of size up to $20\times 20$. The framework further provides direct access to the internal structure and extent of Cooper pairs, which we track across the BCS-BEC crossover. Moreover, it enables a clean diagnosis of the finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in a magnetic field. Finally, we apply the approach to a supersolid phase in the repulsive Hubbard model with an additional next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^\prime$, where a charge-density wave coexists with a superconductor. We confirm the fragmented nature of the condensate and uncover substantial pairing correlations in the triplet channel with $p$-wave spatial symmetry in addition to the dominant singlet $d$-wave pairing. Our results establish the 2RDM-based Penrose-Onsager framework as a broadly applicable and unbiased tool for characterizing superconducting order in correlated quantum matter.

Title: Dissipative diffusion in quantum state preparation: from passive cooling to system-bath engineering
Authors: Tim Pokart, Lukas König, Sebastian Diehl, Jan Carl Budich
Abstract: We investigate and compare two particle number conserving protocols for the preparation of a topologically nontrivial state. The first is derived from thermally coupling the system to a cold bath, while the second is based on engineered dissipation. We numerically study the time required to reach the target state as well as its robustness against physically important perturbations. Crucially, in both protocols the cooling capability is limited by dissipatively induced diffusion processes. The resulting quadratic scaling of the cooling time with system size is corroborated also analytically using mean-field approximations and a purely classical random walk model. Furthermore, we find that the engineered protocol admits a unique and stable dark state, which contributes to an ongoing discussion regarding the applicability of dissipative state preparation to many-body systems.

Title: Accelerated design of proton exchange membranes for green hydrogen production with artificial intelligence
Authors: Huan Tran, Akhlak Mahmood, Harshal Chaudhari, Kuldeep Mamtani, Chiho Kim, Rampi Ramprasad, Anand N. Krishnamoorthy, Abhirup Patra
Abstract: Water electrolysis is an eco-friendly method for hydrogen production that has reached significant levels of technological maturity. Among commercialized water-electrolysis technologies, proton-exchange membrane electrolyzers offer high current density, fast dynamic response, and compact system design, among other advantages. On the other hand, managing their high capital cost and the ``forever-chemistry'' nature of Nafion, a perfluorinated proton-exchange membrane widely used in such devices, remains a major challenge. Searches for fluorine-free replacements for Nafion, pursued largely through physical experimentation, have been active for decades with limited success. In this work, we develop and demonstrate an AI-based strategy for designing new proton-exchange membranes for electrolyzers. Two key components of this strategy are an implementation of the virtual forward-synthesis approach and a set of machine-learning predictive models for essential application-inspired membrane properties; the former generates a vast space of millions of synthesizable polymers, which are then evaluated and screened by the latter. The strategy is validated against experimental data for known membranes and then applied to design over 1,700 new synthesizable candidates. This article concludes with a forward-looking vision in which the strategy could be elevated into an interactive and iterative scheme that are based on large language models to facilitate materials design in multiple ways.

Title: Stacked quantum Ising systems and quantum Ashkin-Teller model
Authors: Davide Rossini, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We analyze the quantum states of an isolated composite system consisting of two stacked quantum Ising (SQI) subsystems, coupled by a local Hamiltonian term that preserves the $Z_2$ symmetry of each subsystem. The coupling strength is controlled by an intercoupling parameter $w$, with $w=0$ corresponding to decoupled quantum Ising systems. We focus on the quantum correlations of one of the two SQI subsystems, $S$, in the ground state of the global system, and study their dependence on both the state of the weakly-coupled complementary part $E$ and the intercoupling strength. We concentrate on regimes in which $S$ develops critical long-range correlations. The most interesting physical scenario arises when both SQI subsystems are critical. In particular, for identical SQI subsystems, the global system is equivalent to the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, characterized by an additional $Z_2$ interchange symmetry between the two subsystem operators. In this limit, one-dimensional SQI systems exhibit a peculiar critical line along which the length-scale critical exponent $\nu$ varies continuously with $w$, while two-dimensional systems develop quantum multicritical behaviors characterized by an effective enlargement of the symmetry of the critical modes, from the actual $Z_2\oplus Z_2$ symmetry to a continuous O(2) symmetry.

Title: Moiré magnetism in a bilayer Ising model
Authors: Ryan Flynn, Anders W. Sandvik
Abstract: Moiré patterns in magnetic bilayers generate spatially modulated interlayer exchange interactions that can give rise to nonuniform magnetic textures. We study a minimal classical bilayer Ising model with a moiré-modulated interlayer coupling, generated either by relative twist or differential strain between the layers. Using large-scale classical Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the ordering transition remains in the conventional two-dimensional Ising universality class, even when the low-temperature state is domain-textured. At low temperatures, we find a smooth crossover between a uniform ferromagnet and domain-textured state, in which the spins locally follow the sign of the interlayer exchange. We demonstrate that there is no breaking of layer symmetry for twisted bilayers. The location of the crossover is determined by a simple geometric energy balance between bulk interlayer exchange and intralayer domain-wall costs. Our results provide a minimal framework for understanding how moiré-modulated magnetic textures can emerge from geometric energetics without requiring a thermodynamic phase transition.

Title: Detecting the finer structure of the P vs NP problem with statistical mechanics: the case of the Wang tiling problem
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora, Marco Cedeno
Abstract: We introduce the idea that the P vs NP problem can have a finer structure. Given the NP complete problem of interest, the configurations space of the problem can be divided in (at least) two regions. In one region, polynomial algorithms to solve the NP complete problem of interest are available (and we discuss one possible realization inspire by the games of chess and go). In the second region the problem to find polynomial time algorithms is very similar to the problem to find polynomial time algorithms to determine the asymptotic behavior of discrete dynamical systems in the chaotic regime. We cannot exclude the existence of a third region which separates the first two: this region would have the characteristics of the edge of chaos. We focuss on the Wang tiling problem of an N X N square (with N large): here a Wang tiles set Gamma is an alphabet. We construct a statistical-physics inspired heuristic which allows to define good alphabets as the ones with a good thermodynamical behavior. For (a suitable subclass of) good alphabets we construct an algortihm which, in polynomial time, determines how to tile the N x N square. On the other hand, for bad alphabets, we observe a chaotic behavior. The Cook-Levin theorem advocate a similar pattern for all the NP-complete problems.

Title: Accelerating Multicanonical Sampling with Irreversibility
Authors: Thomas Vogel, Ying Wai Li
Abstract: Flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations are well-established, robust methods to perform random walks in a physical observable or parameter space, making them suitable for finding ground states or studying phase transitions in complex systems in statistical physics. However, their efficiency can be limited by the time to attain the desired flat distribution, which is generally unknown prior to the simulations. In particular, they might suffer from slowing down towards the end of a simulation due to the diffusive nature of random walks. In this work we apply irreversibility to the multicanonical Monte Carlo method via the lifting approach to alleviate this behavior. We achieve a 2-4 times speedup in ground-state search for a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model, and up to an order of magnitude of speedup for finding the ground-state energy in an Edwards-Anderson spin glass, compared to traditional multicanonical sampling. The round-trip times between ground states show a narrower distribution and are significantly shorter compared to the reversible counterpart, suggesting that a lower convergence time with a smaller time variance is feasible.

Title: Toward Tunable Magnetic Dirac Semimetals: Mn Doping of Cd$_3$As$_2$
Authors: Anthony D. Rice, Ian Leahy, Herve Ness, Andrew G. Norman, Karen N. Heinselman, Chun-Sheng Jiang, David Graf, Alexey Suslov, Stephan Lany, Mark Van Schilfgaarde, Kirstin Alberi
Abstract: Magnetic impurities provide a route toward increasing functionality in electronic materials, often enabling new device concepts and architectures. In the case of topological semimetals, dilute magnetic doping presents a particularly attractive approach for inducing a Dirac to Weyl phase change via time reversal symmetry breaking. However, efforts to realize changes in the electronic structure have been limited by challenges in incorporating magnetic impurities into crystals with sufficiently high electron mobilities to detect them via transport or spectroscopic techniques. Here, we demonstrate incorporation of Mn into Cd$_3$As$_2$ Dirac semimetal thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Using As-rich growth conditions and [001] oriented thin films, Mn compositions of >10% are achieved. Films contain uniform distributions of Mn with no evidence of secondary phases and exhibit electron mobilities greater than 10,000-30,000 cm$^2$/Vs up to 5% Mn. An evolution in the magnetization behavior along with the emergence of a second quantum oscillation frequency at low Mn concentrations provide preliminary evidence of Mn-induced changes in the electronic structure that are consistent with a Weyl phase. This work demonstrates the potential of magnetically doping topological semimetal thin films and a pathway for synthesizing them.

Title: Topological hybridisation of plasmons with ferrimagnetic magnons
Authors: Cooper Finnigan, Mehdi Kagarian, Dmitry K. Efimkin
Abstract: We study the formation of hybrid plasmon-magnon modes in a heterostructure comprising a monolayer semiconductor with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling -- specifically, Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) -- and an insulating ferrimagnet, such as yttrium iron garnet-based compounds. Using a combined microscopic-macroscopic framework for plasmon-magnon coupling, we show that plasmons and magnons strongly hybridize over both GHz and THz frequency ranges, enabling experimental access well above cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours. Finally, we identify experimentally accessible manifestations of the hybridization, such as topological interface modes and an anomalous thermal Hall response.

Title: Frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function of IDTBT single-molecule fluorescence
Authors: Quanwei Li, Yuping Shi, Lam Lam, K. Birgitta Whaley, Graham Fleming
Abstract: The frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function (g(2)({\tau})) of single-molecule fluorescence has recently been proposed as a powerful new quantum light spectroscopy that can reveal intrinsic quantum coherence in excitation energy transfer in molecular systems ranging from simple dimers to photosynthetic complexes. Yet, no experiments have been reported to date. Here, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence g(2)({\tau}) quantum light spectroscopy (SMFg2-QLS) that can simultaneously measure the fluorescence intensity, lifetime, spectra, and g(2)({\tau}) with frequency resolution, for a single molecule in a controlled environment at both room temperature and cryogenic temperature. As a proof of principle, we have studied single molecules of IDTBT (indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole), a semiconducting donor-acceptor conjugated copolymer with a chain-like structure that shows a high carrier mobility and annihilation-limited long-range exciton transport. We have observed different g(2)({\tau}=0) values with different bands or bandwidths of the single molecule IDTBT fluorescence. The general features are consistent with theoretical predictions and suggest non-trivial excited state quantum dynamics, possibly showing quantum coherence, although further analysis and confirmation will require additional theoretical calculations that take into account the complexity and inhomogeneity of individual IDTBT single molecular chains. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of frequency- and time-resolved SMFg2-QLS to provide new insights into molecular quantum dynamics and to reveal signatures of intrinsic quantum coherence in photosynthetic light harvesting that are independent of the nature of the light excitation.

Title: Transport spin polarization in RuO$_2$ films
Authors: Alexandra J. Howzen, Sachin Gupta, Gavin Burnell, Nathan Satchell
Abstract: Altermagnets host spin-split electronic bands without net magnetization, enabling spin-polarized transport in the absence of conventional ferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been proposed as a candidate altermagnet, yet experimental reports remain conflicting, particularly between bulk-sensitive probes and thin-film measurements. Here we investigate the electronic transport properties of epitaxial RuO$_2$ thin films using anomalous Hall effect measurements and point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy. We observe transport spin polarization and a strongly orientation-dependent anomalous Hall response, while magnetometry reveals no detectable net magnetization. The anomalous Hall effect appears only in ultrathin (110)-oriented films, consistent with symmetry-driven Néel-vector physics, and the measured transport spin polarization is systematically higher for (110)-oriented films than for (001)-oriented films, consistent with the crystallographic anisotropy of the spin-split bands. These results are consistent with altermagnetic behavior in RuO$_2$, with the experimentally accessible signatures confined to near-surface regions. They also establish superconducting transport spectroscopy as a metrology for identifying and characterizing altermagnet candidates.

Title: Fundamental Tests of Quantum Geometric Bounds in Ionic and Covalent Insulators using Inelastic X-Ray Scattering
Authors: David Bałut, Barry Bradlyn, Marcus D. Collins, Peter Abbamonte
Abstract: Quantum geometry underlies many fundamental properties of materials, but it has remained largely inaccessible to direct experiment. Here we demonstrate that inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) provides a direct, quantitative probe of quantum geometry and quantum information in solids. Studying two prototype insulators, covalently bonded diamond and ionically bonded LiF, we measure the density response and experimentally determine the quantum Fisher information, the associated Bures metric, and the electron localization length. These measurements enable a quantitative comparison of quantum geometry for two distinct bonding environments. We find that the dimensionless quantum weight, $aK(q)$, which quantifies the longitudinal localization of quantum information, is constrained by fundamental electrostatic bounds in both materials. Crucially, the quantum weight of diamond exceeds that of LiF, indicating that covalent bonds exhibit a higher degree of delocalization and higher density of quantum information than the ionic bonds. Our results establish a direct experimental relationship between quantum information, electron localization, and chemical bonding, and identify IXS as a powerful tool for measuring quantum geometry in materials.

Title: Light-Emitting Diodes with Micrometer-Thick Perovskite Charge Transport Layers
Authors: Sang-Hyun Chin
Abstract: Over the past few decades, thin-film optoelectronic devices have shown significant advancements. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on organic materials, polymers, quantum dots, as well as metal halide perovskites have achieved remarkable efficiencies and long lifetimes, making them ideal for applications in full-color displays and solid-state lighting. These devices typically feature a layered structure, with the light-emitting layer positioned between charge transport layers and two electrodes. This perspective reviews recent progress in LEDs utilizing perovskite charge transport layers and suggests potential pathways for further development in this field.

Title: $PT$ Symmetry's Real Topology
Authors: J. X. Dai, Y. X. Zhao
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases have been a central theme in condensed matter physics and beyond over the past two decades. Most efforts have focused on topological classifications of physical systems under given symmetries, while the intrinsic topology of the symmetries themselves has received much less attention. Here, we show that, in generic non-interacting spinless crystals, the spacetime inversion symmetry $PT$ naturally carries a real vector-bundle structure whose topology is characterized by Stiefel--Whitney (SW) classes. In contrast to previous work, where SW classes were used to describe the topology of real valence bundles protected by $PT$, we identify SW classes associated to the $PT$ symmetry itself. These symmetry SW classes can endow the \emph{total} real bundle of a $PT$-symmetric band structure with nontrivial topology, overturning the common assumption that the total bundle is always trivial. As a consequence, valence and conduction bands can exhibit asymmetric SW classes, in sharp contrast to the usual symmetric scenario. We further demonstrate that the symmetry SW classes provide a refined distinction between atomic insulator phases. Our results underscore the importance of treating crystal symmetries as topological objects in their own right, rather than focusing solely on the topology of energy bands.

Title: C2NP: A Benchmark for Learning Scale-Dependent Geometric Invariances in 3D Materials Generation
Authors: Can Polat, Erchin Serpedin, Mustafa Kurban, Hasan Kurban
Abstract: Generative models for materials have achieved strong performance on periodic bulk crystals, yet their ability to generalize across scale transitions to finite nanostructures remains largely untested. We introduce Crystal-to-Nanoparticle (C2NP), a systematic benchmark for evaluating generative models when moving between infinite crystalline unit cells and finite nanoparticles, where surface effects and size-dependent distortions dominate. C2NP defines two complementary tasks: (i) generating nanoparticles of specified radii from periodic unit cells, testing whether models capture surface truncation and geometric constraints; and (ii) recovering bulk lattice parameters and space-group symmetry from finite particle configurations, assessing whether models can infer underlying crystallographic order despite surface perturbations. Using diverse materials as a structurally consistent testbed, we construct over 170,000 nanoparticle configurations by carving particles from supercells derived from DFT-relaxed crystal unit cells, and introduce size-based splits that separate interpolation from extrapolation regimes. Experiments with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion, flow-matching, and variational models, show that even when losses are low, models often fail geometrically under distribution shift, yielding large lattice-recovery errors and near-zero joint accuracy on structure and symmetry. Overall, our results suggest that current methods rely on template memorization rather than scalable physical generalization. C2NP offers a controlled, reproducible framework for diagnosing these failures, with immediate applications to nanoparticle catalyst design, nanostructured hydrides for hydrogen storage, and materials discovery.

Title: Design and fabrication of guiding patterns for topography-based searching of 2D devices for scanning tunneling microscopy measurements
Authors: Huandong Chen, Hong Li, Yutao Li, He Zhao, Ming Lu, Kazuhiro Fujita, Abhay N. Pasupathy
Abstract: We report the design and fabrication of guiding patterns for topography-based searching of two-dimensional (2D) devices for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements. Sub-micron geometric coordinate markers were etched into SiO2/Si wafers, serving as both substrates for 2D device integration and guiding maps for sample navigation. Here, we used a monolayer graphene/h-BN device with an active area of smaller than 20 um x 20 um as a model system and demonstrated that the device could be reliably located in STM solely through topographic imaging of the guiding patterns and in situ stage calibration, without reliance on optical viewports or capacitive sensing. Atomically resolved topographic imaging and tunneling spectroscopy were also obtained. Our proposed navigation strategy is fully compatible with standard device fabrication procedures and requires no hardware modification to existing STM setups. As such, it offers a practical alternative for locating miniaturized devices in STM, shedding light on studying emerging quantum phenomena in 2D systems.

Title: Altermagnetic spin-split Fermi surfaces in CrSb revealed by quantum oscillation measurements
Authors: Taichi Terashima, Yuya Hattori, David Graf, Takahiro Urata, Tomoki Yoshioka, Wataru Hattori, Hiroshi Ikuta, Hiroaki Ikeda
Abstract: Altermagnets, a class of collinear magnets defined by their spin-split electronic bands, are a focus of intense research, where a key challenge is to experimentally verify this unique band structure as a bulk property. Here, we report a comprehensive quantum oscillation study on the prototypical altermagnet CrSb. By combining high-field magnetotransport and torque measurements with DFT+$U$ calculations including spin-orbit coupling, we successfully identify a multitude of quantum-oscillation frequencies originating from four spin-non-degenerate bands. These results provide definitive, bulk-sensitive evidence for the altermagnetic spin-split Fermi surface of CrSb, which provides a firm foundation for exploring its novel electronic properties.

Title: Boson peak in the dynamical structure factor of network- and packing-type glasses
Authors: Hideyuki Mizuno, Emi Minamitani
Abstract: Glasses are structurally disordered solids that host, in addition to crystalline-like phonons, vibrational excitations with no direct phononic counterpart. A long-standing universal signature is the excess vibrational density of states~(vDOS) over the Debye prediction, known as the boson peak~(BP), which has been extensively reported via inelastic neutron and X-ray scattering measurements of the dynamical structure factor $S(q,\omega)$. Here we quantify the vDOS directly from dynamical-structure-factor data and clarify the microscopic origin of the BP. We contrast two routes to extract the vDOS from $S(q,\omega)$: (i) using high-wavenumber $q$ data beyond the Debye wavenumber $q_D$ to access predominantly incoherent scattering and recover the vDOS in a manner analogous to velocity-autocorrelation-based approaches; and (ii) integrating $S(q,\omega)$ over the low-$q$ regime below $q_D$, which enables a decomposition of the vDOS into contributions from distinct wavenumber sectors and thereby provides direct access to the spatial character of vibrational modes. Focusing on the second route, we demonstrate that the BP in the vDOS emerges as the spectral consequence of a dispersionless excitation band in $S(q,\omega)$. Our main results are obtained from molecular-dynamics simulations, and we further show that the same mechanism is captured by an effective-medium theory for random spring networks, providing a unified interpretation that connects the excess vDOS to the wavenumber-resolved structure of vibrational excitations in glasses.

Title: Atomic and Electronic Structure of Strongly Charged Domain Walls in van der Waals α-In$_2$Se$_3$
Authors: Gillian Nolan, Edmund Han, Shahriar Muhammad Nahid, Patrick Carmichael, Arend M. van der Zande, André Schleife, Pinshane Y. Huang
Abstract: Here, we use atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and first principles calculations to study the atomic and electronic structure of strongly charged domain walls in $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$. STEM imaging and density functional theory (DFT) show that head-to-head (HH) domain walls contain a layer of nonpolar $\beta$-In$_2$Se$_3$, whereas tail-to-tail (TT) domain walls are atomically abrupt. We apply 4D STEM and multislice electron ptychography to map ferroelectric domains in 2D and 3D, showing that nearly $180^\circ$ domain walls exhibit complex, curved 3D structures that differ from ideal $180^\circ$ structures. Band structure calculations show localized conducting states within a $\sim$ 1 nm thick layer at both HH and TT domain walls, such as a midgap state at the $\beta$ layer of the HH domain wall. These properties make strongly charged domain walls in $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ excellent candidates for realizing 2D electron or hole gases and domain wall engineering in van der Waals ferroelectrics.

Title: Mapping Metastable Magnetic Textures in (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2 with in-situ Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy
Authors: Reed Yalisove, Hongrui Zhang, Xiang Chen, Fanhao Meng, Jie Yao, Robert Birgeneau, Ramamoorthy Ramesh, Mary C. Scott
Abstract: Topologically protected magnetic textures are a promising route to low-energy control of magnetism, but they are most often studied away from ambient conditions, typically at low temperatures and high magnetic fields. Here we use in-situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy with control of temperature and magnetic field to investigate the skyrmion metastability in (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2 (FCGT). By field-cooling FCGT in magnetic fields of different magnitude to different base temperatures and then removing the applied field, we create meta(stable) zero-field magnetic states. We use this method to build a phase diagram of the zero-field metastable spin structures in FCGT, which will be critical for selecting the desired topologically-protected spin state for future studies to manipulate magnetism with stimuli such as electric current, electric field, mechanical strain, and more.

Title: Evidence of the de Almeida-Thouless transition in three-dimensional spin glasses
Authors: L. H. Miranda-Filho, Yuliang Jin
Abstract: The nature of spin-glass states in a magnetic field remains a major open problem in statistical physics. The existence of the de Almeida-Thouless (dAT) transition for three-dimensional (3D) spin glasses in a field is still debated. We introduce a new computational method to define the spin-glass susceptibility, which is robust against the broad tail in the overlap distribution that undermines conventional analyses. Applying this approach to the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model in 2D and 3D, and contrasting with the 3D Ising (without disorder) and mean-field spin-glass models, we find a stark difference: the locus of susceptibility maxima bends to the right in the field-temperature plane for the Ising and 2D spin-glass cases, indicating a supercritical crossover line, but bends to the left for the mean-field and 3D spin glasses - a signature of the dAT line. Finite-size scaling further suggests that the peak susceptibility diverges with system size in 3D spin glasses under a field, while saturating in 2D. These results provide direct numerical evidence for the dAT transition in 3D, supporting the replica symmetry breaking scenario.

Title: Site preference of chalcogen atoms in 1T$^\prime$ $MX_{2(1-x)}Y_{2x}$ ($M=$ Mo and W; $X, Y=$ S, Se, and Te)
Authors: Shota Ono, Ryotaro Ohse
Abstract: The insulator-metal transition, accompanying the structural phase transition from 2H to 1T$^\prime$ structure, has been reported in two-dimensional W-S-Te and W-Se-Te systems. It is also reported that Te atoms tend to occupy a specific site of the 1T$^\prime$ structure. Here, we study the site preference of chalcogen atoms in $MX_{2(1-x)}Y_{2x}$ ($M=$ Mo and W; $X, Y=$ S, Se, and Te; $0\le x \le 1$) using first-principles approach. We demonstrate that the site preference of chalcogen atoms explains the universal correlation between the formation energy and the Peierls-like distortion amplitude in the 1T$^\prime$ phase. The impact of the site preference on the linear elastic properties is strong, whereas its impact is weak in the non-linear regime. This establishes the structure-property relationships in $MX_{2(1-x)}Y_{2x}$ systems.

Title: AC Response Across the Metal Insulator Transition of YBCO Josephson Junctions Fabricated with a Helium Ion Beam
Authors: Adhilsha Parachikunnumal, Nirjhar Sarkar, Aravind Rajeev Sreeja, Sreekar Vattipalli, Rochelle Qu, Jay C. LeFebvre, Roger K. Lake, Shane A. Cybart
Abstract: Using focused helium ion beam (FHIB) irradiation, we fabricated in-plane, high-Tc YBCO Josephson junctions. By varying the dose of the irradiation, we tune the junction barriers from metallic (SNS) to insulating (SIS) and investigate how this transition affects microwave-driven dynamics. As the barrier transitions from metallic to insulating, the oscillatory response of the Shapiro steps to the RF power changes dramatically. On either side of the metal-insulator transition, the devices exhibit clean integer Shapiro steps without half-integer features, demonstrating that the current--phase relation is dominated by the first harmonic and that the excess current is minimal. The current-voltage response is well-described by the resistively, capacitively shunted junction model assuming a single-harmonic current--phase relation. This behavior indicates well-controlled junction properties suitable for a wide range of superconducting electronics, including detectors, mixers, and high-density integrated circuits.

Abstract: As fundamental one-dimensional defects, screw dislocations profoundly reshape the energy landscape and carrier dynamics of crystalline materials. By restoring the exact algebra of the screw dislocation group, we unveil the latent symmetry constraints that govern the electronic structure, providing a more rigorous physical picture than the conventional treatments. When applied to GaN, the method yields a band-connectivity constraint and rigorous dipole selection rules for polarization-resolved transitions. Combined with computed Hamiltonian matrix, the approach gives symmetry-filtered radiative and dielectric calculations and reveals a piezoelectrical effect at the dislocation core that strongly suppresses radiative recombination. The pronounced dominance of non-radiative capture over radiative recombination highlights the detrimental impact of screw dislocations on the luminous efficiency of GaN, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing dislocation-limited optoelectronic devices.

Title: Ultrastrong light-matter coupling in near-field coupled split-ring resonators revealed by photocurrent spectroscopy
Authors: Jing Huang, Jinkwan Kwoen, Yasuhiko Arakawa, Kazuhiko Hirakawa, Kazuyuki Kuroyama
Abstract: Landau polaritons arising from the coupling between cyclotron resonance and terahertz split-ring resonators (SRRs) have served as a central platform for exploring ultrastrong light-matter interaction for more than a decade. Over this period, a wide variety of SRR architectures, differing in size, geometry, and even material composition, have been investigated. However, the regime of near-field coupled SRRs has remained largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate ultrastrong coupling using photocurrent spectroscopy in two prototypical near-field configurations: a SRR dimer and a topological SRR chain. The measurements reveal hybridization not only with bright resonant modes but also with optically dark modes and topological edge modes, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of the photocurrent spectroscopy. Moreover, the engineered near-field interactions allow the study of multi-mode ultrastrong coupling and the interplay between topological band structure and cavity quantum electrodynamics.

Title: On the Determination of Gel Points
Authors: Kazumi Suematsu, Haruo Ogura, Seiichi Inayama, Toshihiko Okamoto
Abstract: A critical composition of cross-linked polysiloxanes observed by Scanlan and Winter is reinvestigated in comparison with the theory of gelation. We assume, based on the Scott findings, the geometric distribution for one of the monomers, divinyl-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane). Calculation results show that the two theories are in near-consistency, supporting the Scanlan-Winter estimation based on the linear viscoelastic theory. On the other hand, there is a disturbing result that calculation using the mean molecular weight, $M_{n}$, leads to exact agreement between the two theories, suggesting that the distribution is in effect monodisperse, contrary to the assumed geometric one and also the observed polydispersity, $M_w/M_n=2.1$. Further experimental studies employing monodisperse monomers would be highly valuable to consolidate the bridge between these two fundamental theories.

Title: Probing multipolar order in the candidate altermagnet MnF$_2$ through the elastocaloric effect under strain
Authors: Rahel Ohlendorf, Luca Buiarelli, Hilary M. L. Noad, Andrew P. Mackenzie, Rafael M. Fernandes, Turan Birol, Jörg Schmalian, Elena Gati
Abstract: Altermagnets break a combination of time-reversal and rotational symmetries without generating a net magnetization. As such, the order parameter of $d$-wave altermagnets has the same symmetry as magnetic multipoles, and couples to the product of a magnetic field and uniaxial strain. We combine elastocaloric experiments, free-energy modeling, and first-principles calculations on MnF$_2$ to establish a thermodynamic probe of the predicted finite-temperature altermagnetic critical point. These results pave the way to explore altermagnetic quantum criticality in $d$-wave materials and beyond.

Title: Molecular Hamiltonian learning from setpoint-dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy
Authors: Greta Lupi, Adolfo O. Fumega, Mohammad Amini, Robert Drost, Peter Liljeroth, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Molecular quantum magnets adsorbed on surfaces exhibit rich spin and orbital excitations that can be probed by scanning tunneling microscopy with inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (STM-IETS). However, the quantitative extraction of the underlying multiorbital Hamiltonian from experimental spectra remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we introduce molecular Hamiltonian learning, a machine learning strategy that infers the microscopic Hamiltonian parameters of a single adsorbed molecule directly from the setpoint-dependence of STM-IETS data. The method leverages the systematic evolution of spectral features as the STM tip tunes the local electrostatic environment for different tip-sample distances. We demonstrate this approach on iron phthalocyanine on ferroelectric SnTe, training our algorithm on theory spectra from a realistic multiorbital model, including spin-orbit coupling, electrostatic interactions, local crystal field, and substrate effects. The algorithm, trained solely on theoretical many-body simulations, allows reconstructing Hamiltonian parameters directly from experimental spectra. Our manuscript establishes a flexible and automated strategy for Hamiltonian reconstruction from STM-IETS, transforming setpoint-dependent spectroscopy into quantitative characterization of quantum materials at the atomic scale.

Title: Deterministic non-local parity control and supercurrent-based detection in an Andreev molecule
Authors: Shang Zhu, Xiaozhou Yang, Mingli Liu, Min Wei, Yiping Jiao, Jiezhong He, Bingbing Tong, Junya Feng, Ziwei Dou, Peiling Li, Jie Shen, Xiaohui Song, Guangtong Liu, Zhaozheng Lyu, Dong Pan, Jianhua Zhao, Li Lu, Fanming Qu
Abstract: The ability to manipulate and detect the parity of quantum states in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems is pivotal to realizing the promise of topological quantum computation. However, as these architectures scale toward artificial Kitaev chains with phase-control loops, local accessibility becomes restricted, constraining conventional local parity control and detection. While Andreev molecules offer a platform for non-local intervention, deterministic protocols for parity manipulation have yet to be experimentally established. Here, we demonstrate deterministic non-local control over the parity configuration of a quantum dot (QD) by electrically modulating the coherent hybridization with a spatially adjacent QD within an Andreev molecule. By systematically investigating three distinct joint parity configuration regimes in the elastic co-tunneling limit, we experimentally uncover the operational conditions for this non-local control. In conjunction with theoretical simulations establishing a global phase diagram, we identify a set of universal selection rules governing parity transitions, dictated by the symmetry-imposed interplay between the joint parity configuration and the dominant inter-dot coupling mechanism (elastic co-tunneling vs. crossed Andreev reflection). Furthermore, we establish the supercurrent, directly signaled by zero-bias conductance peaks, as an intrinsic, sensor-free probe of the parity configuration, obviating the need for auxiliary charge sensors. Our results provide a validated physical framework for parity engineering, offering a key building block for scalable, multi-QD superconducting architectures.

Title: Mapping optical, chemical, structural features in ZrO2 via cross-sectional SEM-Cathodoluminescence correlation microscopy
Authors: Ricardo Vidrio, Yuhan Tong, Junliang Liu, Bil Schneider, William O. Nachlas, Nathan Curtis, Maryam Zahedian, Alexander Kvit, Hongliang Zhang, Zefeng Yu, Ximeng Wang, Yongfeng Zhang, Adrien Couet, Jennifer T. Choy
Abstract: Understanding how nanoscale heterogeneities influence charge transport and mass transfer in oxides is critical for developing advanced materials for energy and electronic uses. In high-temperature applications, the formation of thermal oxides with complex chemical and structural features plays a central role in material lifetime. While thermally grown zirconia (ZrO2) on zirconium alloys exhibits strong chemical and microstructural gradients across the oxide thickness, linking these heterogeneities to electronic-defect landscapes remains challenging. We demonstrate cross-sectional scanning electron microscope-cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) as a mesoscale probe of spatial variations in luminescence in zirconia and establish correlations with co-registered electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) on the same region. The SEM-CL signal is dominated by the ~2.7 eV defect band, but its intensity varies strongly across the oxide cross section. Correlative EBSD-CL analysis reveals that CL intensity increases with grain area and decreases at the grain boundaries, consistent with enhanced non-radiative recombination associated with microstructural disorder. EPMA mapping shows that a substantial fraction of CL-dark features co-localize with secondary phase precipitates enriched in iron. These results show that SEM-CL contrast in corrosion-grown ZrO2 is controlled by both chemical heterogeneity and microstructural disorder, underscoring the need for correlative registration to interpret CL images. This multi-modal approach provides an efficient route to connect electronic properties and luminescence signatures across complex oxide cross sections to underlying chemistry and microstructure, thereby providing a pathway to relate local defect landscapes to regions likely to bias electronic/ionic transport during oxidation.

Title: Emergent hydrodynamics of chiral active fluids: vortices, bubbles and odd diffusion
Authors: Umberto Marini Bettolo Marconi, Alessandro Petrini, Raphaël Maire, Lorenzo Caprini
Abstract: Starting from a microscopic multiparticle Langevin equation, we systematically derive a hydrodynamic description in terms of density and momentum fields for chiral active particles interacting via standard repulsive and nonlocal odd forces. These odd interactions are reciprocal but non-conservative: they are non-potential forces, as they act perpendicular to the vector joining any pair of particles. As a result, the torques that two particles exert on one another are non-reciprocal. The ensuing macroscopic continuum description consists of a continuity equation for the density and a generalized compressible Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid velocity. The latter includes a chirality-induced torque density term and an odd viscosity contribution. Our theory predicts the emergence of odd diffusivity, edge currents, and an inhomogeneous phase - characterized by bubble-like structures - recently observed in simulations. Specifically, the theory exhibits a linear instability arising from the interplay between odd viscosity and torque density, and admits steady-state inhomogeneous solutions featuring bubbles and vortices, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our findings can be tested experimentally in systems of granular spinners or rotating microorganisms suspended in a fluid.

Title: Charge redistribution at metal-ZrO2 interfaces: A combined DFT and continuum electrostatic study
Authors: Ximeng Wang, Yongfeng Zhang, Dmitry Skachkov, Arnab Das, Junliang Liu, Alexander Kvit, Jennifer T. Choy, Adrien Couet
Abstract: Nanoscale metallic inclusions (NMIs) are commonly observed within oxide scales formed during high-temperature oxidation, revealing the existence of chemical and electronic heterogeneity beyond conventional corrosion theories that assume homogeneous, fully oxidized films. Using tetragonal zirconia (tZrO2) facing a series of face-centered cubic (fcc) metals as the model system, this work investigates the short-range and long-range charge redistributions across metal-oxide interfaces by coupling density functional theory (DFT) calculations with continuum modeling. We show that metal-oxide contact induces a short-range charge redistribution confined to a few atomic layers and a long-range redistribution of space charge that can extend over macroscopic distances within weakly doped oxides. DFT calculations show that the short-range redistribution is dominated by metal induced gap states (MIGS) in tZrO2 facing noble metals like Au and Ag, and by chemical bonding in tZrO2 facing active metals like Al. DFT-informed continuum theoretical analysis shows that the range of space-charge redistribution is governed by the doping level of tZrO2, and that the Schottky barrier height (SBH) exhibits a stronger dependence on the metal work function than the doping level. Both the short-range and long-range charge redistributions can alter the transport of charge carriers via their associated electric fields, extending several nm to hundreds of nm from the interface, depending on the doping concentrations, suggesting possible heterogeneous oxide growth caused by NMIs.

Title: Graphene Nanoribbon-Graphdiyne Lateral Heterojunctions with Atomically Abrupt Interfaces
Authors: Alice Cartoceti, Simona Achilli, Masoumeh Alihosseini, Adriana E. Candia, Enrico Beltrami, Paolo D'Agosta, Alessio Orbelli Biroli, Francesco Sedona, Andrea Li Bassi, Jorge Lobo Checa, Carlo S. Casari
Abstract: Carbon-based 2D heterostructures represent an attractive platform for nanoelectronics owing to their tunable electronic and transport properties, yet achieving precise control over their fabrication remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the on--surface synthesis of covalently bonded lateral heterostructures between armchair graphene nanoribbons and metalated hydrogenated graphdiyne networks on Au(111). Atomic--resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy combined with density functional theory reveals the formation mechanism of covalent interfacial bonds and highlights the critical influence of surface chemistry. In particular, chemisorbed bromine atoms suppress junction formation, while controlled atomic hydrogen dosing increases the bonding efficiency to 71\%. Electronic structure and transport calculations demonstrate how the metallic substrate influences the supported heterostructure, whereas in the freestanding limit, the two carbon subsystems retain their intrinsic properties, forming an atomically narrow junction that enables voltage-tunable spatial current separation. These results define a viable strategy for engineering graphene--graphdiyne heterostructures and advance the design of all-carbon nanoscale electronic architectures.

Title: Coupled Majorana modes in a dual vortex of the Kitaev honeycomb model
Authors: Surajit Basak, Jean-Noël Fuchs
Abstract: The Kitaev model is exactly solvable in terms of Majorana fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice and coupled to a static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field, giving the possibility of $\pi$-vortices in hexagonal plaquettes. In the vortex-full sector and in the presence of a time-reversal-breaking three-spin term of strength $\kappa$, the energy spectrum is gapped and the ground state possesses an even Chern number. An isolated vortex-free plaquette acts as a ``dual vortex'' and binds a fermionic mode at finite energy $\epsilon$ in the bulk gap. This mode is equivalent to two coupled Majorana zero modes located on the same dual vortex. In a continuum approximation, we analytically compute the Majorana wavefunctions and their coupling $\epsilon$ in the two limits of small or large $\kappa$. The analytical approach is confirmed by numerical perturbation theory directly on the lattice. The latter is in excellent agreement with the full numerics on a finite-size system. We contrast our results with states bound to an isolated vortex in a topological superconductor with even Chern number.

Title: Multiple charge carrier species as a possible cause for triboelectric cycles
Authors: Juan Carlos Sobarzo, Scott Waitukaitis
Abstract: The tendency of materials to order in triboelectric series has prompted suggestions that contact electrification might have a single, unified underlying description. However, the possibility of triboelectric cycles, i.e. series that loop back onto themselves, is seemingly at odds with such a coherent description. In this work, we propose that if multiple charge carrying species are at play, both triboelectric series and cycles are possible. We show how series arise naturally if only a single charge carrier species is involved and if the driving mechanism is approach toward thermodynamic equilibrium, and simultaneously, that cycles are forbidden under such conditions. Suspecting multiple carriers might relax the situation, we affirm this is the case by explicit construction of a cycle involving two carriers, and then extend this to show how more complex cycles emerge. Our work highlights the importance of series/cycles towards determining the underlying mechanism(s) and carrier(s) in contact electrification.

Title: Paramagnetically driven superconducting re-entrance in Eu-doped infinite layer nickelates

Abstract: The breakthrough discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates, and subsequently in several superconducting nickelates with more complex layered structures, capped a search spanning more than two decades and opened an entirely new field of research. Significant efforts aim to increase the critical temperature, to determine the electronic structure of the system, the underlying pairing mechanism, and the similarities between this system and cuprates - Ni1+ in infinite-layer nickelates being isoelectronic to Cu2+ in high-Tc cuprates. Here, we explore the unique role of magnetic rare earth ions in superconducting Eu-doped NdNiO2. We show that the field-induced re-entrant superconductivity which we evidence in this compound is the result of a delicate balance between the competing effects of the Eu2+ and Nd3+ ions. Our analyses of the extraordinary Hall effect and modeling of the superconducting critical fields demonstrate that the influence of these ions on magneto-transport is only felt when they are polarized by a magnetic field.

Title: Realization of Wigner-Mott insulators in 6R-TaS$_2$ superconductor
Authors: Hongqin Xiao, Geng Li, Yuxuan He, Ke Zhu, Yuhan Ye, Yumeng Li, Lijing Huang, Haitao Yang, Ziqiang Wang, Hong-Jun Gao
Abstract: Wigner-Mott insulating states represent a paradigmatic manifestation of strong electronic correlations, in which long-range Coulomb interactions drive spontaneous charge ordering and enable Mott localization at fractional electronic fillings. Such states have been theoretically proposed to arise from the cooperative interplay between onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. However, experimental realization of a Wigner-Mott insulator has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a Wigner-Mott insulating states in 6R-TaS$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy. By locally injecting electrons into the depleted 1T layer, we induce distinct Star-of-David charge-ordered superstructures and realize a cascade of insulating phases. In particular, a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ superstructure constitutes a Wigner-Mott insulating state, characterized by a robust Mott gap despite fractional filling. Comparative measurements reveal that the conventional 1$\times$1 Mott state at integer filling is governed predominantly by onsite interaction U, whereas the $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ fractional-filling Mott state requires the cooperative effects of both U and long-range Coulomb interaction V. Our results provide not only the direct microscopic evidence for a Wigner-Mott mechanism, but also establish a platform for the controllable realization and investigation of Wigner-Mott insulating states.

Title: Si-Ga2O3/p-GaN epitaxial heterostructure based self-powered and visible-blind UV photodetectors with fast and electrically tuneable response time
Authors: Ajoy Biswas, Amandeep Kaur, Bhabani Prasad Sahu, Sushantika Saha, Umakanta Patra, Rupa Jeena, Pradeep Sarin, Subhabrata Dhar
Abstract: n-Ga2O3/p-GaN heterojunction based photodetector devices are fabricated on Si-doped (-201) \beta-Ga2O3 epitaxial layers grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique on p-type c-GaN/sapphire templates. These devices demonstrate the ability to act as highly efficient self-powered visible blind UV-photodetectors with fast response time. It has been found that the optimum performance of the detector in terms of its responsivity, detectivity and response time could be achieved by adjusting the Si doping level and the thickness of the Ga2O3 layer. Our best performing device showing the peak responsivity and detectivity of 56.8 mA/W and 3*10^12 Jones, respectively, is achieved for 660 nm thick Ga2O3 layer with Si-concentration of 8*10^18 cm^-3. Moreover, as low as a few nW of optical signal can be sensed by the detector. The response time of the detector is found to be only a few tens of nanoseconds, which highlights their potential for application in ultrafast detection of UV light. These devices also exhibit a slower component of photoresponse with a timescale of a few tens of milliseconds. Interestingly, the time-scale of the slower response can be prolongated by several orders of magnitude through enhancing the applied reverse bias. Such an electrical tuneability of the response time is highly desirable for neuromorphic device applications.

Title: Bosonic phases across the superconductor-insulator transitions in an infinite-layer samarium nickelate

Abstract: Superconductivity arises from the global phase coherence of Cooper pairs. The modulation of phase coherence leads to quantum phase transitions, serving as an important tool for the study of unconventional superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate bosonic phases across the superconductor-insulator transitions in infinite-layer nickelate superconducting films by the control of spatially periodic network patterns. Magnetoresistance oscillations with a periodicity of h/2e provide direct evidence of 2e Cooper pairing in nickelates. The phase transitions are predominantly driven by enhanced superconducting fluctuations, with Cooper pairs involved in the charge transport across the transitions. Notably, we observe two types of anomalous metallic phases, emerging respectively in finite and down to zero magnetic fields. They can be characterized by bosonic excitations, suggesting the dynamic roles of vortices at the ground states. Our work establishes nickelates as a key platform for investigating the rich landscape of bosonic phases controlled via the phase coherence of Cooper pairs.

Title: Analytical solution of the Schrödinger equation with $1/r^3$ and attractive $1/r^2$ potentials: Universal three-body parameter of mixed-dimensional Efimov states
Authors: Yuki Ohishi, Kazuki Oi, Shimpei Endo
Abstract: We study the Schrödinger equation with $1/r^3$ and attractive $1/r^2$ potentials. Using the quantum defect theory, we obtain analytical solutions for both repulsive and attractive $1/r^3$ interactions. The obtained discrete-scale-invariant energies and wave functions, validated by excellent agreement with numerical results, provide a natural framework for describing the universality of Efimov states in mixed dimension. Specifically, we consider a three-body system consisting of two heavy particles with large dipole moments confined to a quasi-one-dimensional geometry and resonantly interacting with an unconfined light particle. With the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, this system is effectively reduced to the Schrödinger equation with $1/r^3$ and $1/r^2$ potentials, and manifests the Efimov effect. Our analytical solution suggests that, for repulsive dipole interactions, the three-body parameter of the mixed-dimensional Efimov states is universally set by the dipolar length scale, whereas for attractive interactions it explicitly depends on the short-range phase. We also investigate the effects of finite transverse confinement and find that our analytical results are useful for describing the Efimov states composed of two polar molecules and a light atom.

Title: Nonlinear waves: a review Vector $0π$ pulse and the generalized perturbative reduction method
Authors: G. T. Adamashvili
Abstract: In this review, a more general theory of self-induced transparency (SIT) in comparison with the theory of McCall and Hahn is considered. Using the recently developed generalized perturbative reduction method (GPRM) the SIT equations are reduced to vector (coupled) nonlinear Schrodinger equations for auxiliary functions. This approach demonstrates that, unlike McCall and Hahn SIT theory in which single-component scalar breather can propagate independently, in the more general theory of SIT the second derivatives with respect to the spatial coordinate and time of the wave equation play a significant role and describe the interaction of two scalar SIT breathers forming a coupled pair. This is a vector 0\pi pulse of SIT - a two-component vector breather oscillating with the sum and difference of frequencies and wave numbers. The profile, parameters and properties of this pulse differ significantly from the characteristics of the McCall and Hahn pulses. Using GPRM it is shown that besides the scalar soliton and the scalar breather, the vector $0\pi$ pulse is also a universal nonlinear wave, arising in virtually all areas of physics where nonlinear phenomena are described by nonlinear equations containing second-order and higher-order derivatives. A number of such nonlinear equations are presented. Among them almost all well known nonlinear equations, as well as the general fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation and the sixth-order generalized Boussinesq-type equations.

Title: Near-field effects on cathodoluminescence outcoupling in perovskite thin films
Authors: Robin Schot, Imme Schuringa, Álvaro Rodríguez Echarri, Lars Sonneveld, Tom Veeken, Yang Lu, Samuel D. Stranks, Albert Polman, Bruno Ehrler, Saskia Fiedler
Abstract: Halide perovskite semiconductors are a promising material for high-efficiency solar cells. Their optical properties can vary within and between crystallographic grains. We present spatially-resolved cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy at 2 keV and 5 keV on polycrystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite films to study these variations at the nanoscale. The CL maps show a strongly reduced intensity near the polycrystalline grain boundaries. We perform numerical simulations of the far-field emission of the electron beam-generated optical near fields using the surface profiles from AFM as input. We find that near grain boundaries the light outcoupling is strongly reduced due to enhanced internal reflection and light trapping at the curved surfaces. Lateral variations in CL intensity inside grains are due to Fabry-Perot-like resonances in the film, with the substrate acting as a back reflector. Our results show that near-field coupling and interference effects can dominate nanoscale luminescence maps of halide perovskite films. The results are broadly relevant for the analysis of cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence of corrugated thin films.

Title: Discrete Dislocation Dynamics Modeling of Nanotwinned Materials: Orientation Effects in a Multilayer Twinned Structure of Copper
Authors: DeAn Wei, Michael Zaiser, Jing Tang, Xu Zhang
Abstract: The impact of twin boundaries (TBs) on the microstructure evolution and plastic deformation mechanisms of face-centered cubic (FCC) metals has been extensively studied since the discovery that nanotwinned materials exhibit a favorable combination of high strength and ductility. In this work, a dislocation-twin boundary interaction model for copper is incorporated into a three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) framework. This approach is applied to systematically investigate the orientation effects on the deformation of nanotwinned copper, utilizing a multilayer twinned structure (MTS) with a twin thickness of 160 nm. The simulation results show that the stress-strain response of MTSs under uniaxial loading depends significant on the orientation of the loading axis. Dislocations inclined to TBs are confined to slip in single- or multi-layer twin lamellae; when the loading axis is oriented perpendicular or parallel to TBs, such whereas when loading axis inclined to TBs, the dislocations with glide plane parallel to TBs are easily activated (mainly twinning dislocations) and the TBs do not hinder the dislocations and behave in soft modes. If the hard mode dominates the deformation mechanism, microstructures with single-layer confined slip lead to significant hardening behavior, while microstructures with multilayer confined slip maintain stable plastic flow and do not lead to hardening. Finally, through the introduction of critical resolved shear stresses (CRSSs) specific to various deformation modes and the adaptation of Schmid's law, we have effectively projected the additional anisotropic characteristics induced by TBs in MTSs.

Title: Dual-Switch Control of a Layer-Locked Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in a Sliding Ferroelectric Antiferromagnet
Authors: Quan Shen, Wenhu Liao, Degao Xu, Jiansheng Dong, Jianing Tan
Abstract: The integration of ferroelectric (FE) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders in twodimensional (2D) materials provides a promising avenue for the nonvolatile control of coupled spin and valley degrees of freedom, a capability central to advancing spinvalleytronics. However, realizing a single material system where these quantum states can be independently and reversibly manipulated by distinct stimuli, a prerequisite for multifunctional devices, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a dual-switch mechanism in bilayer VS2, a room-temperature FE-AFM system, that enables electrical and magnetic control of a layer-locked anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). First-principles calculations reveal that interlayer sliding breaks spatial inversion symmetry, inducing a switchable out-of-plane FE polarization that coexists with interlayer AFM. The spin-orbit coupled valley polarization can be reversibly switched either by FE polarization reversal or by a magnetic-field-induced spin-flip transition, confirming the existence of electrically and magnetically addressable valley states. The Berry curvature exhibits both valley-contrasting and layer-locked characteristics, which underpin a switchable Hall response. Notably, electric and magnetic switching are functionally equivalent in modulating valley, layer, and spin indices, revealing strong magnetoelectric coupling. This work establishes a multidegree-of-freedom operational paradigm in 2D multiferroics and opens a viable design pathway toward multi-state memory and spin-valleytronic logic devices.

Title: All-electrical switching of spin texture in a strain-tunable 2D Janus ferroelectric altermagnet
Authors: Tao Yao, Quan Shen, Wenhu Liao, Jianing Tan, Jiansheng Dong
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), a collinear magnetic phase with momentum-dependent spin splitting, is a promising candidate for strong magnetoelectric coupling. However, realizing direct and tunable coupling between ferroelectricity (FE) and AM within a single two-dimensional (2D) material remains an outstanding challenge. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we identify the distorted phase of monolayer Janus VOClBr as an intrinsic 2D FE-AM. This phase demonstrates robust magnetoelectric coupling, as evidenced by a complete reversal of momentum-space spin polarization upon FE switching, and further supported by spin texture analysis and the magneto-optical Kerr effect. Notably, the FE properties are highly strain-tunable: biaxial compression strain of -4% reduces the FE polarization switching barrier by approximately 87%, whereas a tensile strain of +3% induces a phase transition to an antiferromagnet. Leveraging the lock-in between the electrically controlled spin texture and the magneto-optical Kerr effect signal, we propose a non-volatile, polymorphic spintronic memory device featuring all-electrical writing and optical readout. This work establishes 2D FE-AMs as a versatile platform for coupled ferroic orders and paves the way for voltage-controlled, multifunctional spin-logic devices.

Title: Lanthanide-Dependent Clustering in Yb$^{3+}$/Ln$^{3+}$ Co-Doped CaF$_2$ Nanocrystals: Correlating Spectroscopic Signatures with DFT Insights
Authors: Sangeetha Balabhadra, Haoming Xu, Jiajia Cai, Chang-Kui Duan, Michael F. Reid, Jon-Paul R. Wells
Abstract: The formation of heterogeneous lanthanide-ion clusters in CaF$_2$ was investigated experimentally and computationally. CaF$_2$ nanoparticles co-doped with 20~mol\% Yb$^{3+}$ and 2~mol\% Ln$^{3+}$ (Ln$^{3+}$ = Ce$^{3+}$, Pr$^{3+}$, Nd$^{3+}$, Sm$^{3+}$, Eu$^{3+}$, Gd$^{3+}$, Ho$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, and Tm$^{3+}$) were synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The structural and morphological properties were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy techniques. High-resolution Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy revealed the presence of Yb$^{3+}$ isolated cubic centers and various cluster sites. The relative concentration of the clusters varied with the choice of the co-doping ion. Calculations based on density functional theory were used to estimate the formation energies and local coordination structures of different clusters. The calculations indicate that the neutral $C_{4v}$ aggregations containing Ln$^{3+}$ tend to decrease across the lanthanide series, while the negatively charged derivatives of hexameric clusters are relatively constant. This variation matches the experimental results. This study advances understanding of the clustering mechanisms in lanthanide-doped CaF$_2$ nanoparticles and has implications for luminescence optimization in advanced nanomaterials.

Title: Learning the Intrinsic Dimensionality of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou Trajectories: A Nonlinear Approach using a Deep Autoencoder Model
Authors: Gionni Marchetti
Abstract: We address the intrinsic dimensionality (ID) of high-dimensional trajectories, comprising $n_s = 4\,000\,000$ data points, of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ oscillators. To this end, a deep autoencoder (DAE) model is employed to infer the ID in the weakly nonlinear regime ($\beta \lesssim 1$). We find that the trajectories lie on a nonlinear manifold of dimension $m^{\ast} = 2$ embedded in a $64$-dimensional phase space. The DAE further reveals that this dimensionality increases to $m^{\ast} = 3$ at $\beta = 1.1$, coinciding with a symmetry breaking transition, in which additional energy modes with even wave numbers $k = 2, 4$ become excited. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the linear approach based on principal component analysis (PCA), which fails to capture the underlying structure of the data and therefore yields unreliable results in most cases.

Title: Effects of Dynamic Disorder on Diffusion in Rugged Energy Landscapes
Authors: Biman Bagchi
Abstract: Established theoretical studies of diffusion in rugged (or rough) potential surfaces have largely focused on quenched energy landscapes. Here we study diffusion on a rugged energy landscape in the presence of dynamic disorder, a situation relevant to a wide range of disordered systems, including glasses, disordered solids, and biomolecular transport. For static (quenched) Gaussian disorder, Zwanzig derived a compact mean field expression for the diffusion constant, showing that increasing ruggedness leads to a sharp reduction of diffusive transport. Subsequent work demonstrated that in one-dimensional discrete lattices diffusion is further suppressed by rare but long-lived multi-site traps that lie beyond the mean-field description. In many physical systems, however, the local energy landscape is not frozen but fluctuates in time, there by modifying trap lifetimes and transport properties. In this work we develop a minimal, analytically tractable theory of diffusion on rugged energy landscapes with dynamic disorder by allowing site or barrier energies to fluctuate as dichotomic (telegraph) processes with given amplitude and flipping rate. Using a Kehr type formulation appropriate for discrete hopping processes, we derive an analytic expression for the diffusion constant in terms of mean waiting times. We show that dynamic disorder induces a continuous crossover from quasi-quenched, trap-dominated transport to an annealed, motional narrowing regime as the fluctuation rate increases. Explicit numerical calculations confirm this crossover, interpolating between rare-event-dominated diffusion and Zwanzig mean-field regime.

Title: Observation of an exciton crystal in a moiré excitonic insulator
Authors: Ruishi Qi, Qize Li, Haleem Kim, Jiahui Nie, Zuocheng Zhang, Ruichen Xia, Zhiyuan Cui, Jianghan Xiao, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Michael F. Crommie, Feng Wang
Abstract: Strong Coulomb interactions can drive electrons to crystallize into a Wigner lattice. Achieving the bosonic analogue - a crystal of excitons - has remained elusive due to their short lifetimes and weaker interactions. Here, we report the observation of a thermodynamically stable exciton crystal in an excitonic insulator coupled to a moiré potential. Using an electron-hole bilayer composed of a monolayer MoSe2 and a WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice, we construct a tunable extended Bose-Hubbard model with electrical control over exciton and charge doping in thermal equilibrium. Optical spectroscopy reveals spontaneous crystallization of long-lived excitons at one exciton filling per three moiré sites, evidenced by strong Umklapp scattering peaks in the optical spectrum. Exciton transport measurements further show a pronounced exciton resistance peak at the same filling, consistent with suppressed exciton hopping in a crystalline phase. When doped away from net charge neutrality, this moiré electron-hole bilayer can host new correlated insulating phases where dipolar excitonic insulators form on top of the background of a hole Mott insulator or generalized Wigner crystals in the moiré superlattice. These findings establish moiré excitonic insulators as a versatile platform for realizing correlated crystalline phases of bosons and fermions.

Title: Microscopic theory of an atomic spin diode
Authors: William J. Huddie, Rembert A. Duine
Abstract: We present a microscopic theory of an atomic spin diode. Our proposed system consists of two magnetic adatoms deposited on the surface of a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. A local s-d type coupling between the local spins and the spins of the electrons induces a non-local Ruderman-Kittel-Kazuya-Yoshida type interaction and a Dzyalonshinskii-Moriya interaction, in addition to dissipative interactions, between the spins. We derive the effective action for the spins using the Keldysh formalism. From the effective action, we also derive equations of motion for the spins which are shown to be of Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) type, and give expressions for the effective field and Gilbert damping which appear in this equation. From our microscopic theory, we find that for an in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the vector connecting the two atoms, the magnitude of the field and the distance between the atoms can always be tuned to engender perfectly diodic coupling. Our findings may pave the way to experimental realisation of atomic spin diodes.

Title: Fundamental Relations as the Leading Order in Nonlinear Thermoelectric Responses with Time-Reversal Symmetry
Authors: Ying-Fei Zhang, Zhi-Fan Zhang, Hua Jiang, Zhen-Gang Zhu, Gang Su
Abstract: In recent years, nonlinear transport phenomena have garnered significant interest in both theoretical explorations and experiments. In this work, we utilize the semi-classical wave packet theory to calculate disorder-induced second-order transport coefficients: second-order electrical ($\sigma$), thermoelectric ($\alpha$), and thermal ($\kappa$) coefficients, capturing the interplay between side-jump and skew-scattering contributions in systems with time-reversal symmetry. Using a topological insulator model, we quantitatively characterize the Fermi-level dependence of these second-order transport coefficients by explicitly including Coulomb impurity potentials. Furthermore, we elucidate the relationships between these coefficients, establishing the second-order Mott relation and the Wiedemann-Franz law induced by disorder. This study develops a comprehensive theoretical framework elucidating the nonlinear thermoelectric transport mechanisms in quantum material systems.

Title: Competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases on the frustrated Ising honeycomb lattice
Authors: Pietro F. Dias, Fabio M. Zimmer, Nikolaos G. Fytas, Mateus Schmidt
Abstract: We investigate the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice, featuring first- and second-neighbor ferromagnetic couplings ($J_1>0$ and $J_2>0$) and third-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions ($J_3<0$). Using the cluster mean-field method, we analyze the phase transitions in the regime $1/2 < J_2/J_1 \le 1$, where ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases compete. Our results reveal that near the strongly frustrated limit $J_3/J_1 = -1$, the system exhibits order-by-disorder state selection, tricritical and bicritical behavior, critical endpoints, and two successive phase transitions. The ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition remains second order across the entire interaction range, whereas the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic boundary shows a richer behavior, including both first- and second-order transitions as well as tricriticality. Increasing the second-neighbor coupling $J_2/J_1$ narrows the range of $J_3/J_1$ where first-order antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions occur; beyond a certain threshold, only second-order order-disorder transitions persist. Consequently, the tricritical point shifts toward $J_3/J_1 \approx -1$ as $J_2/J_1$ increases, culminating in a bicritical point where the antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and paramagnetic phases meet.

Title: Revealing the (111) surface electronic structure of epitaxially grown Na$_2$KSb photocathode
Authors: N.Yu. Solovova, V.A. Golyashov, S.V. Eremeev, S.Yu. Priobrazhenskii, S.P. Lebedev, A.A. Lebedev, V.S. Rusetsky, O.E. Tereshchenko
Abstract: A recent study has established the Na$_2$KSb(Cs) photocathode as a highly efficient emitter of spin-polarized electrons. However, the electronic structure of alkali antimonides remains poorly understood. In this work, we report the first crystalline epitaxial growth of Na$_2$KSb films, achieved via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on a graphene-coated SiC(0001) substrate. The high crystalline quality of these films enabled a direct investigation of the material's electronic structure using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). By comparing the experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have identified dispersive surface states originating from different terminations of the Na$_2$KSb(111) surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the crystalline order of the film is preserved following its activation via the deposition of Cs and Sb. This finding opens a pathway for investigating the electronic structure of multialkali Na$_2$KSb(Cs) photocathodes and for rationally improving their properties.

Title: Observation of Erratic Non-Hermitian Skin Localization and Transport
Authors: Jia-Xin Zhong, Jee Woo Kim, Stefano Longhi, Yun Jing
Abstract: Localization is a pervasive phenomenon across physics, shaping transport from electrons in solids to light and sound in engineered media. In traditional settings, disorder strongly impedes transport, resulting in dynamical localization or, at best, sub-ballistic or diffusive dynamics. A distinct and previously unobserved regime, erratic non-Hermitian skin localization (ENHSL), can arise in globally reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices with disorder. It features macroscopic, disorder-dependent localization at irregular bulk positions with subexponential decay, linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. We realize this regime experimentally in an acoustic lattice implementing a disordered Hatano-Nelson chain with imaginary gauge fields. Using Green's-function-based spectroscopy together with time-resolved measurements on the same platform, we reconstruct the full complex spectrum and eigenstates, and directly observe wave-packet dynamics. Remarkably, we observe ballistic transport despite strong spectral localization. We develop a transport theory that connects the dominant propagation site to the maximal random-walk excursion within an expanding light cone and predicts a universal Levy-arcsine statistics, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Our results decouple eigenstate localization from transport and establish ENHSL as a new paradigm for wave dynamics.

Title: Comparative Analysis of Plasticity-based GND Density Estimation Methods in Crystal Plasticity Finite Element Models
Authors: Michael Pilipchuk, Chaitali Patil, Veera Sundararaghavan
Abstract: In crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) simulations, accurately quantifying geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) is critical for capturing strain gradients in polycrystals. We compare different methods for quantifying GNDs, all of which originate from the Nye tensor, which is computed as the curl of the plastic deformation gradient. The projection technique directly decomposes the Nye tensor onto individual screw and edge dislocation components to compute GNDs. This approach requires converting a nine-component Nye tensor into densities for a larger number of dislocation systems, a fundamentally underdetermined (non-unique) process, which is resolved using $L2$ minimization. In contrast, when employing CPFE analysis, one could directly compute dislocation densities on each slip system using shear gradients. Projection and slip gradient methods are compared with respect to their prediction of GNDs with changing grain size, strain, and grain neighborhoods, including multigrain junctions. Although these techniques match analytical GND densities for single slip, single crystal deformation, and are consistent with anticipated overall GND trends, we find that the GND densities from projection techniques are significantly lower than those predicted from CPFE-based slip gradients in polycrystals. A suggested improvement of only using the active dislocation systems in the projection technique almost entirely resolved this mismatch.

Title: Atomic imaging of 2D transition metal dihalides

Abstract: Transition metal di-iodides such as FeI2, NiI2 and CoI2 are an emerging class of 2D magnets exhibiting rich and diverse magnetic behaviour, but their study at the monolayer limit has been severely hindered by fabrication challenges due to their air-sensitivity. Here, we introduce a polymer-free method for clean, rapid, and high-yield assembly of hermetically encapsulated suspended samples of air-sensitive monolayers. Applying it to di-iodides enables atomic resolution characterisation of thin samples - down to the monolayer limit - for the first time. Our imaging, combined with complementary first-principles calculations, reveals an unusually small energy barrier between alternate stable stacking polytypes in few-layer films, enabling extrinsic control of the stacking phase. We also observe stable isolated iodine vacancies that do not aggregate to form extended structures, and identify and verify the stability of the various edge configurations of thin samples. These results establish the unique structural characteristics of these materials in the thin limit, and more broadly demonstrate the utility of our transfer platform for creating atomically clean suspended vdW heterostructures.

Title: Nonrelativistic-Ising superconductivity in p-wave magnets
Authors: Maxim Khodas, Libor Šmejkal, I. I. Mazin
Abstract: We discuss a possibility of superconductivity in the p-wave magnets. These are recently discovered materials that have zero net magnetization by symmetry and finite non-relativistic spin splitting of electron bands, like in altermagnets. Similarly, the spin polarizations is collinear in the momentum space. Yet, as opposed to altermagnets, the magnetization is noncollinear in the real space, and the spin splitting obeys time-reversal symmetry in the momentum space. As a result, if such material harbors superconductivity (due to phonons, or any other mechanism), the only supported superconducting symmetry is Ising superconductivity, an exotic symmetry where any Cooper pair is a 50:50 mix of singlet and triplet. This unusual behavior is also in stark contrast to regular antiferromagnet, which can support Cooper pairs of any parity, and altermagnets, which can only support nonunitary triplet pairs. The presence of large triplet component and enhanced resilience against pair breaking is inherent to the p-wave magnets and as such is unconventional as it does not materialize in conventional spin-orbit coupling induced Ising superconductors.

Title: Interband State Transfer in Double-Gated Bilayer Graphene at High Electric Field
Authors: Margherita Melegari, Brian Skinner, Ignacio Gutierrez-Lezama, Alberto F. Morpurgo
Abstract: The band structure of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene can be tuned using double-gated transistors to apply a perpendicular electric field that generates an interlayer potential energy difference $\Delta$. Dielectric breakdown limits the operation of conventional devices to the $\Delta \ll t_\perp \simeq 360$ meV regime. We employ double ionic gating to reach fields past $ 1$ V/nm, for which $\Delta > t_\perp$. We find that for $\Delta \simeq t_\perp$, the evolution of the longitudinal resistance ($R_{xx}$) peak as a function of applied gate voltages undergoes a sharp change in slope, exhibiting a pronounced "knee". Increasing $\Delta$ past the "knee" results in an unusual evolution transport properties: the peak in $R_{xx}$ decreases in magnitude, it exhibits a splitting concomitant with multiple sign reversals of the Hall resistance, and hysteresis in the peak position emerges. We explain the observed phenomenology in terms of in-gap bound states, whose energy strongly depends on the perpendicular electric field, and crosses the mid-gap level for sufficiently large $\Delta > t_\perp$. The phenomenon causes large changes in the electronic density of in-gap states that profoundly affect the evolution of the chemical potential. Our experimental results and their interpretation reveal unique aspects of the physics of in-gap states in Bernal bilayer graphene and demonstrate that double ionic gating enables investigating the large-$\Delta$ regime, which has remained experimentally inaccessible so far.

Title: Magnetization Plateaus in the Spin-Orbit Coupled Bilayer Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet Rb2Co2(SeO3)3
Authors: Shengzhi Zhang, Gabriel Silva Freitas, Vivien S. Zapf, Minseong Lee, Wonjune Choi, Shi-Zeng Lin, Tong Chen, Collin Broholm, Xianghan Xu, Robert J. Cava, Eun Sang Choi
Abstract: Geometric frustration among competing spin exchanges can give rise to novel quantum phases by enhancing fluctuations that drive magnetic systems beyond the classical regime. We investigate the frustrated array of strongly correlated spin dimers in the bilayer triangular lattice antiferromagnet \rcs{} under applied magnetic fields. A cascade of magnetization plateaus appears at \(M/M_s = 1/3, 1/2, 2/3,\) and \(5/6\), together with a weak anomalous feature near \(M/M_s = 1/6\), in fields up to 60 T. Concurrent changes in magneto-dielectric response follows the plateau boundaries. The finite slope of each plateau and the absence of a zero-field gap in our ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility down to 20 mK indicate broken \(U(1)\) spin-rotation symmetry. A minimal bilayer-dimer model treated with bond operator representation reproduces the low-field sequence only when \(U(1)\) symmetry is explicitly lifted by spin-orbit-driven, bond-dependent anisotropy. Near saturation, a projected triangular pseudospin model accounts for the high-field plateaus with modest further-neighbor interactions. These results demonstrate that anisotropic exchange arising from spin-orbit-coupled moments is essential for stabilizing the full plateau hierarchy in \rcs{}, a mechanism overlooked in previous interpretations of Co-based triangular bilayers.

Title: Effective interactions in active Brownian particles
Authors: Clare R. Rees-Zimmerman, C. Miguel Barriuso Gutierrez, Chantal Valeriani, Dirk G. A. L. Aarts
Abstract: We report an approach to obtain effective pair potentials which describe the structure of two-dimensional systems of active Brownian particles. The pair potential is found by an inverse method, which matches the radial distribution function found from two different schemes. The inverse method, previously demonstrated via simulated equilibrium configurations of passive particles, has now been applied to a suspension of active particles. Interestingly, although active particles are inherently not in equilibrium, we still obtain effective interaction potentials which accurately describe the structure of the active system. Treating these effective potentials as if they were those of equilibrium systems, furthermore allows us to measure effective chemical potentials and pressures. Both the passive interactions and active motion of the active Brownian particles contribute to their effective interaction potentials.

Title: Anomalous transport in non-integrable classical field theories
Authors: Matija Koterle, Tomaz Prosen, Tianci Zhou
Abstract: Anomalous KPZ spin transport is well established in integrable non-Abelian lattice models but has not been investigated in continuum field theories as discretization in numerics generally break the continuum theory's integrability. We show that finite temperature acts as a regulator that can restore anomalous transport over a broad time window. In a family of spin field theories labeled by integer $n$, the $n = 1$ case is the Landau-Lifshitz model, whose numerical data shows spin superdiffusion with Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling and, at lower temperature ballistic energy transport, whereas both observables are diffusive at high temperature. The non-integrable $n = 2$ case shows the same crossover. While Lyapunov analysis confirms the model's non-integrability, the structure of spin-density space-time profiles suggests that long-lived soliton-like trajectories exist at low temperature.

Title: Real-Time Iteration Scheme for Dynamical Mean-Field Theory: A Framework for Near-Term Quantum Simulation
Authors: Chakradhar Rangi, Aadi Singh, Ka-Ming Tam
Abstract: We present a time-domain iteration scheme for solving the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) self-consistent equations using retarded Green's functions in real time. Unlike conventional DMFT approaches that operate in imaginary time or frequency space, our scheme operates directly with real-time quantities. This makes it particularly suitable for near-term quantum computing hardware with limited Hilbert spaces, where real-time propagation can be efficiently implemented via Trotterization or variational quantum algorithms. We map the effective impurity problem to a finite one-dimensional chain with a small number of bath sites, solved via exact diagonalization as a proof-of-concept. The hybridization function is iteratively updated through time-domain fitting until self-consistency. We demonstrate stable convergence across a wide range of interaction strengths for the half-filled Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice, successfully capturing the metal-to-insulator transition. Despite using limited time resolution and a minimal bath discretization, the spectral functions clearly exhibit the emergence of Hubbard bands and the suppression of spectral weight at the Fermi level as interaction strength increases. This overcomes major limitations of two-site DMFT approximations by delivering detailed spectral features while preserving efficiency and compatibility with quantum computing platforms through real-time dynamics.

Title: Engineering discrete local dynamics in globally driven dual-species atom arrays
Authors: Francesco Cesa, Andrea Di Fini, David Aram Korbany, Roberto Tricarico, Hannes Bernien, Hannes Pichler, Lorenzo Piroli
Abstract: We introduce a method for engineering discrete local dynamics in globally-driven dual-species neutral atom experiments, allowing us to study emergent digital models through uniform analog controls. Leveraging the new opportunities offered by dual-species systems, such as species-alternated driving, our construction exploits simple Floquet protocols on static atom arrangements, and benefits of generalized blockade regimes (different inter- and intra-species interactions). We focus on discrete dynamical models that are special examples of Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA), and explicitly consider a number of relevant examples, including the kicked-Ising model, the Floquet Kitaev honeycomb model, and the digitization of generic translation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians (e.g., for Trotterized evolution). As an application, we study chaotic features of discretized many-body dynamics that can be detected by leveraging only demonstrated capabilities of globally-driven experiments, and benchmark their ability to discriminate chaotic evolution.

Title: Phase Diagrams of Information Backflow: Unifying Entanglement Revivals and Entropy Overshoots in Minimal Non-Markovian Models
Authors: Koichi Nakagawa
Abstract: Memory effects in non-Markovian dynamics are often diagnosed either via quantum-correlation revivals or via non-monotonic classical information measures, yet a unified minimal framework comparing their ``backflow phases'' is still lacking. Here we propose an information-backflow phase-diagram approach that places \emph{quantum entanglement revivals} and \emph{classical entropy overshoots} on the same footing through a common backflow functional $N_I=\int_{\dot I>0}\dot I\,dt$. On the quantum side, we employ a fractional (Caputo) extension of a two-state dissipative model embedded by thermo-field dynamics (TFD), yielding a closed-form intrinsic entanglement component $b^{(\alpha)}_{qe}(t)=\frac14[E_\alpha(-\lambda^\alpha t^\alpha)]^2\sin^2(\omega t)$ and an integrated revival measure $N_{qe}$ that delineates a sharp boundary near $\alpha\simeq 1/2$ in the $(\alpha,\omega/\lambda)$ plane. On the classical side, we consider a three-state model whose Markov generator is promoted either to an exponential-kernel generalized master equation (with exact Markov embedding) or to a semi-Markov process with Erlang-2 waiting times. We quantify non-monotonicity by the entropy overshoot $\Delta H$ and KL-based diagnostics on the probability simplex. To strengthen the quantum--classical symmetry, we further introduce a \emph{fractional Mittag--Leffler memory kernel} in the classical dynamics and show that an analogous backflow transition emerges around $\alpha\simeq 1/2$, indicating that the boundary originates from the kernel's mathematical structure rather than from quantumness per se. Overall, our results provide a compact, model-agnostic route to classify non-Markovianity by phase diagrams of information backflow and to interpret them via a shared embedding narrative: memory stored in hidden degrees of freedom returns to the observed sector as non-monotonic information flow.

Title: Eigenstate condensation in quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces
Authors: Christopher David White, Michael Winer, Noam Bernstein
Abstract: Random quantum states drawn from the Haar ensemble with a constraint on the energy expectation value $E_{\mathrm{av}} = \langle \psi | H | \psi\rangle$ display \textit{eigenstate condensation}: for $E_{\mathrm{av}}$ below a critical value $E_c$, they develop macroscopic overlap with the ground state. We study eigenstate condensation in systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. These systems display three phases: a ground-state phase, in which energy-constrained random states have macroscopic overlap with the ground state; a high-temperature phase, in which they have exponentially small overlap with each energy eigenstate; and an anti-ground-state phase, in which they have macroscopic overlap with the most highly excited state. In local spin systems the ground-state and anti-ground-state phases approach the middle of the spectrum as $1/[\text{system size}]$, but -- because the condensation phase transitions have exponential, rather than polynomial, finite-size scaling -- the crossover becomes exponentially sharp in system size and the high-temperature phase is best understood as an extended phase.

Title: Twisting Kelvin Cells for Enhanced Vibration Control
Authors: Lukas Kleine-Wächter, Anastasiia O. Krushysnka, Romain Rumpler, Gerhard Müller
Abstract: This work investigates the propagation of elastic waves in periodic Kelvin-cell chains, focusing on symmetry-breaking geometric modifications induced by twisting the cell's faces. By imposing such twists, the original lattice topology is preserved, while mirror symmetries are strategically broken through modifying a single geometric parameter, allowing wave characteristics to be adjusted without additional resonators or mass augmentation. The complex-valued Bloch-Floquet analysis reveals that twisting activates two distinct wave attenuation mechanisms: Bragg-type band gaps associated with periodicity-induced scattering, and polarization-dependent band gaps arising from longitudinal-torsional mode coupling and avoided crossings. To obtain qualitative and quantitative insight into these mechanisms, a simplified analytical model with coupled translational and rotational degrees of freedom is considered. The finite-element wave transmission calculations are experimentally validated on SLA-printed three-cell specimens, for which wave attenuation reaches up to 20 dB within the predicted band-gap frequencies. Note that high prediction accuracy requires accounting for viscoelastic material behavior, underscoring the importance of material behavior on the wave propagation characteristics. Overall, the findings show that modest geometric modifications to a classical Kelvin-cell lattice can enhance wave-filtering behavior, offering a tractable design strategy for vibration control in lightweight architected lattices.

Title: Configurable p-Neurons Using Modular p-Bits
Authors: Saleh Bunaiyan, Mohammad Alsharif, Abdelrahman S. Abdelrahman, Hesham ElSawy, Suraj S. Cheema, Suhaib A. Fahmy, Kerem Y. Camsari, Feras Al-Dirini
Abstract: Probabilistic bits (p-bits) have recently been employed in neural networks (NNs) as stochastic neurons with sigmoidal probabilistic activation functions. Nonetheless, there remain a wealth of other probabilistic activation functions that are yet to be explored. Here we re-engineer the p-bit by decoupling its stochastic signal path from its input data path, giving rise to a modular p-bit that enables the realization of probabilistic neurons (p-neurons) with a range of configurable probabilistic activation functions, including a probabilistic version of the widely used Logistic Sigmoid, Tanh and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions. We present spintronic (CMOS + sMTJ) designs that show wide and tunable probabilistic ranges of operation. Finally, we experimentally implement digital-CMOS versions on an FPGA, with stochastic unit sharing, and demonstrate an order of magnitude (10x) saving in required hardware resources compared to conventional digital p-bit implementations.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Technology
Authors: Marin Bukov, Florian Marquardt
Abstract: Many challenges arising in Quantum Technology can be successfully addressed using a set of machine learning algorithms collectively known as reinforcement learning (RL), based on adaptive decision-making through interaction with the quantum device. After a concise and intuitive introduction to RL aimed at a broad physics readership, we discuss the key ideas and core concepts in reinforcement learning with a particular focus on quantum systems. We then survey recent progress in RL in all relevant areas. We discuss state preparation in few- and many-body quantum systems, the design and optimization of high-fidelity quantum gates, and the automated construction of quantum circuits, including applications to variational quantum eigensolvers and architecture search. We further highlight the interactive capabilities of RL agents, emphasizing recent progress in quantum feedback control and quantum error correction, and briefly discuss quantum reinforcement learning as well as applications to quantum metrology. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges -- such as scalability, interpretability, and integration with experimental platforms -- and outlines promising directions for future research. Throughout, we highlight experimental implementations that exemplify the increasing role of reinforcement learning in shaping the development of quantum technologies.

Title: Towards Self-Optimizing Electron Microscope: Robust Tuning of Aberration Coefficients via Physics-Aware Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization
Authors: Utkarsh Pratiush, Austin Houston, Richard Liu, Gerd Duscher, Sergei Kalinin
Abstract: Realizing high-throughput aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) exploration of atomic structures requires rapid tuning of multipole probe correctors while compensating for the inevitable drift of the optical column. While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. By balancing competing objectives, this approach enables "self-optimizing" microscopy by dynamically sustaining optimal performance during experiments.

Title: qNEP: A highly efficient neuroevolution potential with dynamic charges for large-scale atomistic simulations
Authors: Zheyong Fan, Benrui Tang, Esmée Berger, Ethan Berger, Erik Fransson, Ke Xu, Zihan Yan, Zhoulin Liu, Zichen Song, Haikuan Dong, Shunda Chen, Lei Li, Ziliang Wang, Yizhou Zhu, Julia Wiktor, Paul Erhart
Abstract: Although electrostatics can be incorporated into machine-learned interatomic potentials, existing approaches are computationally very demanding, limiting large-scale, long-time simulations of electrostatics-driven phenomena such as dielectric response, infrared activity, and field-matter coupling. Here, we extend the neuroevolution potential (NEP), a highly efficient machine-learned interatomic potential, to a charge-aware framework (qNEP) by introducing explicit, environment-dependent partial charges. Each ionic partial charge is represented by a neural network as a function of the local descriptor vector, analogous to the NEP site-energy model. This formulation enables the direct prediction of the Born effective charge tensor for each ion and, consequently, the polarization. As a result, dielectric properties, infrared spectra, and coupling to external electric fields can be evaluated within a unified framework. We derive consistent expressions for the forces and virials that explicitly account for the position dependence of the partial charges. The qNEP method has been implemented in the free-and-open-source GPUMD package, with support for both Ewald summation and particle-particle particle-mesh treatments of electrostatics. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the qNEP approach through representative applications to water, Li7La3Zr2O12, BaTiO3, and a magnesium-water interface. These results show that qNEP enables accurate atomistic simulations with explicit long-range electrostatics, scalable to million-atom systems on nanosecond time scales using consumer-grade GPUs.

Title: Transformer Learning of Chaotic Collective Dynamics in Many-Body Systems
Authors: Ho Jang, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: Learning reduced descriptions of chaotic many-body dynamics is fundamentally challenging: although microscopic equations are Markovian, collective observables exhibit strong memory and exponential sensitivity to initial conditions and prediction errors. We show that a self-attention-based transformer framework provides an effective approach for modeling such chaotic collective dynamics directly from time-series data. By selectively reweighting long-range temporal correlations, the transformer learns a non-Markovian reduced description that overcomes intrinsic limitations of conventional recurrent architectures. As a concrete demonstration, we study the one-dimensional semiclassical Holstein model, where interaction quenches induce strongly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics of the charge-density-wave order parameter. While pointwise predictions inevitably diverge at long times, the transformer faithfully reproduces the statistical "climate" of the chaos, including temporal correlations and characteristic decay scales. Our results establish self-attention as a powerful mechanism for learning effective reduced dynamics in chaotic many-body systems.

Title: Evolution of quantum geometric tensor of 1D periodic systems after a quench
Authors: Jia-Chen Tang, Xu-Yang Hou, Yu-Huan Huang, Hao Guo. Chih-Chun Chien
Abstract: We investigate the post-quench dynamics of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of 1D periodic systems with a suddenly changed Hamiltonian. The diagonal component with respect to the crystal momentum gives a metric corresponding to the variance of the time-evolved position, and its coefficient of the quadratic term in time is the group-velocity variance, signaling ballistic wavepacket dispersion. The other diagonal QGT component with respect to time reveals the energy variance. The off-diagonal QGT component features a real part as a covariance and an imaginary part representing a quench-induced curvature. Using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as an example, our numerical results of different quenches confirm that the post-quench QGT is governed by physical quantities and local geometric objects from the initial state and post-quench bands, such as the Berry connection, group velocities, and energy variance. Furthermore, the connections between the QGT and physical observables suggest the QGT as a comprehensive probe for nonequilibrium phenomena.

Title: Short-distance production of three particles with large scattering length
Authors: Timothy G. Backert, Sebastian Dietz, Hans-Werner Hammer, Sebastian König, Dam Thanh Son
Abstract: The short-distance production of multi-particle states in high-energy nuclear reactions provides a unique way to study the low-energy properties of few-body systems. In particular, the production amplitude of multi-neutron systems is strongly constrained by an approximate conformal symmetry of the underlying theory. We calculate the full amplitude for the short-distance production of three particles with large scattering length in leading order pionless EFT, focusing on the cases of three neutrons and three spinless bosons. We investigate the signature of low-energy resonances and other correlations in the relative energy distributions. For the case of neutrons, we compare to the predictions from approximate conformal symmetry close to the unitary limit and calculate the range corrections up to next-to-next-to leading order.

Title: Engineering Quantum Emission with Mie Voids
Authors: Yuchao Fu, Ilia Lykov, Sergejs Boroviks, Nai-Quan Zhu, Tianyue Li, Siarhei Zavatski, Makhlad Chahid, Olivier J. F. Martin
Abstract: Spontaneous emission, as a fundamental radiative process and a versatile information carrier, plays a vital role in light-emitting devices, optical information modulation and encryption, super-resolution fluorescence imaging and nano sensing. Engineering the photonic environment surrounding quantum emitters can enhance their emission characteristics. However, simultaneously achieving precise control over both excitation enhancement and quantum-yield modulation at the nanoscale remains elusive, highlighting substantial room for advancing the precised engineering of quantum emission. Here, we introduce silicon Mie voids - air-defined cavities that invert the conventional solid-particle geometry - to achieve independent tuning of quantum emission within an individual subwavelength structure, while minimizing optical losses. Full-wave simulations and experiments on both gradient and uniform Mie-void arrays jointly validate this quantitative framework for emission tuning, which disentangles excitation enhancement arising from local field confinement in air and quantum-yield enhancement resulting from strengthened emitter-resonator coupling, while confirming the accelerated radiative decay enabled by the void configuration. Leveraging this flexible mechanism, we realize a bimodal nanophotonic pattern with near-diffraction-limited pixels that encode the EPFL logo in the bright field and the SJTU logo in both dark field and photoluminescence micrographs. These results establish Mie voids as a powerful platform for programmable, high-density multimodal displays and open new avenues for advancing state-of-the-art nanophotonic devices.

Title: Flux-tunable transmon incorporating a van der Waals superconductor via an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction
Authors: Eliya Blumenthal, Ilay Mangel, Amit Kanigel, Shay Hacohen-Gourgy
Abstract: Incorporating van der Waals (vdW) superconductors into Josephson elements extends circuit-QED beyond conventional Al/AlO$_x$/Al tunnel junctions and enables microwave probes of unconventional condensates and subgap excitations. In this work, we realize a flux-tunable transmon whose nonlinear inductive element is an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction. The tunnel barrier is formed by sequential deposition and full in-situ oxidation of ultrathin Al layers on an exfoliated 4Hb-TaS$_2$ flake, followed by deposition of a top Al electrode, yielding a robust, repeatable hybrid junction process compatible with standard transmon fabrication. Embedding the device in a three-dimensional copper cavity, we observe a SQUID-like flux-dependent spectrum that is quantitatively reproduced by a standard dressed transmon--cavity Hamiltonian, from which we extract parameters in the transmon regime. Across measured devices we obtain sub-microsecond energy relaxation ($T_1$ from $0.08$ to $0.69~\mu$s), while Ramsey measurements indicate dephasing faster than our $16$ ns time resolution. We also find a pronounced discrepancy between the Josephson energy inferred from spectroscopy and that expected from the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation using room-temperature junction resistances, pointing to nontrivial junction physics in the hybrid Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ system. Although we do not resolve material-specific subgap modes in the present geometry, this work establishes a practical route to integrating 4Hb-TaS$_2$ into coherent quantum circuits and provides a baseline for future edge-sensitive designs aimed at enhancing coupling to boundary and subgap degrees of freedom in vdW superconductors.

Title: Efficient Application of Tensor Network Operators to Tensor Network States
Authors: Richard M. Milbradt, Shuo Sun, Christian B. Mendl, Johnnie Gray, Garnet K.-L. Chan
Abstract: The performance of tensor network methods has seen constant improvements over the last few years. We add to this effort by introducing a new algorithm that efficiently applies tree tensor network operators to tree tensor network states inspired by the density matrix method and the Cholesky decomposition. This application procedure is a common subroutine in tensor network methods. We explicitly include the special case of tensor train structures and demonstrate how to extend methods commonly used in this context to general tree structures. We compare our newly developed method with the existing ones in a benchmark scenario with random tensor network states and operators. We find our Cholesky-based compression (CBC) performs equivalently to the current state-of-the-art method, while outperforming most established methods by at least an order of magnitude in runtime. We then apply our knowledge to perform circuit simulation of tree-like circuits, in order to test our method in a more realistic scenario. Here, we find that more complex tree structures can outperform simple linear structures and achieve lower errors than those possible with the simple structures. Additionally, our CBC still performs among the most successful methods, showing less dependence on the different bond dimensions of the operator.

Title: Locally Scaled Self-Interaction Corrected Energy Functionals with Complex Optimal Orbitals
Authors: Jukka John, Hlynur Guðmundsson, Iðunn Björg Arnaldsdóttir, Hannes Jónsson, Elvar Örn Jónsson
Abstract: We present a fully variational locally scaled self-interaction corrected (SIC) energy functional using complex optimal orbitals. This represents an important milestone for fully variational SIC energy functionals, which have been shown to improve the prediction of the properties of atomic, molecular and solid state systems in general, in both ground and excited states. However, it depends on the system and property of the system whether it is beneficial to scale the SIC correction by a factor of one-half, which makes the application of SIC inconsistent. In the limit of a single electron the SIC exactly cancels the self interaction error, but overcorrects the error in regions of high density where there is large overlap between occupied orbitals. The newly implemented local scaling function, $z(\mathbf{r})$, which is based on an iso-orbital indicator derived from considering the kinetic energy density in the iso-electron and many electron case, and takes into account that the orbitals are complex, naturally scales the SIC correction from $0\leq z(\mathbf{r}) \leq 1$ in regions of high and low (isolated orbital) electron density. The locally scaled and fully variational SIC framework is general and applicable to atomic, molecular and solid-state systems.

Title: Approximate Decoherence, Recoherence and Records in Isolated Quantum Systems
Authors: Philipp Strasberg, Joseph Schindler, Jiaozi Wang, Andreas Winter
Abstract: Using the framework of decoherent histories, we study which past events leave detectable records in isolated quantum systems under the realistic assumption that decoherence is approximate and not perfect. In the first part we establish -- asymptotically for a large class of (pseudo-)random histories -- that the number of reliable records can be much smaller than the number of possible events, depending on the degree of decoherence. In the second part we reveal a clear decoherence structure for long histories based on a numerically exact solution of a random matrix model that, as we argue, captures generic aspects of decoherence. We observe recoherence between histories with a small Hamming distance, for localized histories admitting a high purity Petz recovery state, and for maverick histories that are statistical outliers with respect to Born's rule. From the perspective of the Many Worlds Interpretation, the first part -- which views the self-location problem as a coherent version of quantum state discrimination -- reveals a "branch selection problem", and the second part sheds light on the emergence of Born's rule and the theory confirmation problem.

Title: Quantum Light Detection with Enhanced Photonic Neural Network
Authors: Stanisław Świerczewski, Dogyun Ko, Amir Rahmani, Juan Camilo López Carreño, Wouter Verstraelen, Piotr Deuar, Barbara Piętka, Timothy C. H. Liew, Michał Matuszewski, Andrzej Opala
Abstract: Advances in quantum technologies are accelerating the demand for optical quantum state sensors that combine high precision, versatility, and scalability within a unified hardware platform. Quantum reservoir computing offers a powerful route toward this goal by exploiting the nonlinear dynamics of quantum systems to process and interpret quantum information efficiently. Photonic neural networks are particularly well suited for such implementations, owing to their intrinsic sensitivity to photon-encoded quantum information. However, the practical realisation of photonic quantum reservoirs remains constrained by the inherently weak optical nonlinearities of available materials and the technological challenges of fabricating densely coupled quantum networks. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical detection protocol that integrates the advantages of quantum reservoirs with the adaptive learning capabilities of analogue neural networks. This synergistic architecture substantially enhances information-extraction accuracy and robustness, enabling low-cost performance improvements of quantum light sensors. Based on the proposed approach, we achieved significant improvements in quantum state classification, tomography, and feature regression, even for reservoirs with a relatively small nonlinearity-to-losses ratio $U/\gamma \approx 0.02$ in a network of only five nodes. By reducing reliance on material nonlinearity and reservoir size, the proposed approach facilitates the practical deployment of high-fidelity photonic quantum sensors on existing integrated platforms, paving the way toward chip-scale quantum processors and photonic sensing technologies.

Title: Resolving Gauge Ambiguities of the Berry Connection in Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Ievgen I. Arkhipov
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting unique Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

Title: Nonequilibrium phase transitions in a racism-spreading model with interaction-driven dynamics
Authors: Nuno Crokidakis, Lucas Sigaud
Abstract: Racism remains a persistent societal issue, increasingly amplified by the structure and dynamics of online social networks. In this work, we propose a three-state compartmental model to study the spreading and suppression of racist content, drawing from epidemic-like dynamics and interaction-driven transitions. We analyze the model on fully-connected (homogeneous mixing) networks using a set of coupled differential equations, and on Barabási-Albert (BA) scale-free and Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world networks through agent-based simulations. The system exhibits three distinct stationary regimes: two racism-free absorbing states and one active phase with persistent racist content. We identify and characterize the phase transitions between these regimes, discuss the role of network topology, and highlight the emergence of absorbing states. Our findings illustrate how statistical physics tools can help uncover the macroscopic consequences of microscopic social interactions in digital environments.

Title: Atomtronic superconducting quantum interference device in synthetic dimensions
Authors: Wenxi Lai, Yu-Quan Ma, Yi-Wen Wei
Abstract: Coherence and scalability are essential properties of quantum systems required in quantum computers. This study presents a high coherent and scalable qubit system with atomtronics in synthetic dimensions. It is atomtronic counterpart of superconducting quantum interference device. Comparing with traditional superconducting quantum interference device which requires at least $2$-dimensional circuits, the synthetic dimensional superconducting quantum interference device can be realized only in $1$-dimensional circuits. The synthetic dimensional system is composed of Bose-Einstein condensate in two neighboring optical wells which is coupled to an external coherent light. Control parameter for the qubit is naturally provided by artificial magnetic flux originated from the coherent atom-light coupling. It should be a great advantage for the scalability and integration feature of quantum logic gates.

Title: A single atom vibration sensor
Authors: Wenxi Lai, Yu-Quan Ma, Qiaoxin Li
Abstract: Previously in vibration sensors, optical glass plates, optical fibres, carbon nanotubes, semiconductor materials, piezoelectric materials and molecules are proved to be effective transducers for sensing vibrations. In this work, for the first time, we will propose a model of vibration sensor using single atom transport in an open optical lattice. In this apparatus, information of mechanical vibration could be transferred into shaking of optical lattice through one of a cavity mirror. Shaking lattice consequently induces Mott insulator due to quantum interference. It is found that information of vibration is encoded in the atomic current and it could be extracted by Fourier transformations. The present atomic vibration sensor has wide detection range of frequency with high precision. Our present model of sensor based on atomic system opens a new area of studying vibration sensors.

Title: Kramers Dichroism in PT Symmetric Magnets
Authors: Oles Matsyshyn, Ying Xiong, Justin C. W. Song
Abstract: Superpositions between states in doubly degenerate Kramers pairs can act as an internal degree of freedom. Here we uncover a Kramers dichroism in PT symmetric magnets: interband transitions induced by circularly polarized light irradiation produce a coherent superposition between Kramers partnered states. This allows to optically control the Kramers degree of freedom. In contrast, Kramers pairs optically excited by linearly polarized light remain in a completely mixed state. Strikingly, we find a class of second-order nonlinear responses that directly track the coherence between Kramers partnered states. Such Kramers nonlinearities can be pronounced producing large second-order nonlinear layer polarization responses activated by Kramers degeneracy in layered antiferromagnets. Together with Kramers dichroism, these render optical responses a novel means for accessing the Kramers degree of freedom and diagnosing their quantum coherent state.

Title: Conductance of atomic size contacts of Ag and Au at high magnetic fields
Authors: Beilun Wu, Andrés Martínez, Paula Obladen, Marta Fernández-Lomana, Edwin Herrera, Carlos Sabater, Juan José Palacios, Isabel Guillamón, Hermann Suderow
Abstract: Electronic conduction at the atomic scale can be described by Landauer's formalism. In single atom point contacts of noble metals like Au and Ag, there is just one channel open between both electrodes and the conductance is very close to the quantum of conductance $G \approx G_0=\frac{2e^2}{h}$, with the factor of two coming from spin degeneracy. The magnetoconductivity of atomic size contacts has been studied for numerous systems, unveiling local Kondo screening, magnetic order and spin-polarized currents. However, these have been mostly performed in elements with multiple open conduction channels where $G$ differs from $G_0$. The realization of a magnetically active conductor with a single open channel remains difficult to achieve. Here we present measurements of the electronic conductance of single channel Au and Ag atomic-size contacts in magnetic fields up to 20 Tesla. We observe a decrease in $G$ which goes up to about 15% in many Au contacts at 20 T. We perform calculations and find that pure Ag and Au do not present a strong field dependence of $G$, in agreement with previous results at smaller magnetic fields. We also find, however, that residual O$_2$ molecules attached close to the contact produce an an induced spin-polarized current, which leads to a decrease in $G$. We discuss the role of the magnetic response of the electrodes in the jump to contact. Our results suggest that single channel atomic size conductors with a sizeable response to a magnetic field can be built by combining noble metals and magnetically active molecular systems.

Title: Theory of phonon angular momentum transport across a smooth crystal interface
Authors: Yuta Suzuki, Shuntaro Sumita, Yusuke Kato
Abstract: We theoretically elucidate the transfer of phonon angular momentum by acoustic modes across a smooth interface between crystals. We analyze this process, which is difficult to describe with the conventional acoustic mismatch model, using a reformulated boundary condition and the Boltzmann theory. For an interface between a chiral and an achiral crystal, our analysis reveals that thermal gradients in the chiral crystal induce angular momentum, which diffuses into the achiral crystal even without heat flow. Notably, the density of angular momentum can be enhanced near the interface. These findings advance our understanding of phonon transport and its interplay with electron spins.

Title: Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires
Authors: Magali Korolev, Karyn Le Hur
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids, i.e. analyzing and summing charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ballistic ring geometry at zero temperature, as a result of charge fractionalization. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, bipartite fluctuations can detect a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.

Title: Absorbing state transitions with discrete symmetries
Authors: Hyunsoo Ha, David A. Huse, Rhine Samajdar
Abstract: Robust phases of matter, which remain stable under small perturbations, are of fundamental importance in statistical physics and quantum information. Recent advances in interactive quantum dynamics have led to renewed interest in out-of-equilibrium dynamical phases and associated phase transitions in both classical and quantum many-body systems. Motivated by these developments, we investigate whether a stable absorbing phase can exist in one-dimensional classical stochastic systems, with local update rules, in the presence of fluctuations. We study models with multiple absorbing states related by discrete symmetries, such as Z2 for two-state systems, and Z3 or S3 for three-state systems. In these models, domain walls perform random walks and coarsen under local rules, which, if perfect, eventually bring the system to an absorbing state in polynomial time. However, imperfect feedback can cause domain walls to branch, potentially leading to an opposing active phase. While two-state models exhibit a well-known transition between absorbing and active phases as the branching rate increases, in three-state models with only local dynamics, branching is a relevant perturbation, ruling out a robust absorbing phase under purely local rules. However, we discover that by incorporating nonlocal information into the feedback, the absorbing phase can be stabilized, with the transition between the active and absorbing phases belonging to a new universality class. Finally, we outline how these classical rules can be implemented using deterministic quantum circuits and discuss their connections to passive error correction.

Title: Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model
Authors: Andreas M. Läuchli, Loïc Herviou, Patrick H. Wilhelm, Slava Rychkov
Abstract: Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.

Title: Fast and direct preparation of a genuine lattice BEC via the quantum Mpemba effect
Authors: Philipp Westhoff, Sebastian Paeckel, Mattia Moroder
Abstract: We demonstrate that dissipative state preparation protocols in many-body systems can be substantially accelerated via the quantum Mpemba effect. Our approach exploits weak symmetries to analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. In particular, we study the preparation of a lattice Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of the dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.

Title: Probing Spin Defects via Single Spin Relaxometry

Abstract: Spin defects in solids offer promising platforms for quantum sensing and memory due to their long coherence times and optical addressability. Here, we integrate a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond with scanning probe microscopy to discover, read out, and spatially map arbitrary spin-based quantum sensors at the nanoscale. Using the boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{B}^-$) center in hexagonal boron nitride$\unicode{x2013}$an emerging two-dimensional spin system$\unicode{x2013}$as a model, we detect its electron spin resonance indirectly via changes in the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) of a nearby NV center, eliminating the need for optical excitation or fluorescence detection of the $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{B}^-$. Cross-relaxation between NV and $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles significantly reduces NV $T_1$, enabling quantitative nanoscale mapping of defect densities beyond the optical diffraction limit and clear resolution of hyperfine splitting in isotopically enriched h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N. Our method demonstrates interactions between 3D and 2D spin sensors, establishing NV centers as versatile probes for characterizing otherwise inaccessible spin defects.

Title: Spin-Orbital Intertwined Topological Superconductivity in a Class of Correlated Noncentrosymmetric Materials
Authors: Lichuan Wang, Ran Wang, Xinliang Huang, Xianxin Wu, Ning Hao
Abstract: In this study, we propose an alternative route to achieving topological superconductivity (TSC). Our approach applies to a new class of correlated noncentrosymmetric materials that host two spin-split Fermi surfaces with identical spin textures due to a spin-orbital intertwined effect. Incorporating multi-orbital repulsive Hubbard interactions, we calculate the superconducting pairings of a minimal two-orbital effective model within a spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity framework. We find that, depending on the effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) strength and filling level, the Hubbard interaction can drive the leading pairing symmetry into the $A_1(S_{\pm})$, $B_1$, $B_2$ or $B_2(d_{\pm})$ irreducible representations (IRs) of the $C_{4v}$ point group. Notably, the $A_1(S_{\pm})$ pairing gives rise to a fully gapped TSC characterized by a $Z_2$ invariant, while the $B_2(d_{\pm})$ pairing results in a nodal TSC. Our analysis reveals that the fully gapped TSC is predominated by spin-singlet regardless of the presence of the spin-triplet components. This distinguishes our model from noncentrosymmetric materials with conventional Rashba-split band structures, where TSC typically emerges near the van Hove singularity and is primarily driven by $p$-wave or $f$-wave spin-triplet pairing. These features enhances its experimental accessibility, and we discuss potential experimental systems for its realization.

Title: Universal Bound States with Bose-Fermi Duality in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules
Authors: Tingting Shi, Haitian Wang, Xiaoling Cui
Abstract: We report universal bound states of microwave-shielded ultracold molecules that solely depend on the strengths of long-range dipolar interaction and microwave coupling. Under a highly elliptic microwave field, few-molecule scatterings in three dimension are shown to be governed by effective one-dimensional (1D) models, which well reproduce the tetratomic bound state and the Born-Oppenheimer potential in three-molecule sector. For hexatomic systems comprising three identical molecules, we find much deeper bound state than the tetratomic one, with binding energy exceeding twice of the latter. Strikingly, these bound states display Bose-Fermi duality as facilitated by the effective 1D scattering with a large repulsive core from angular fluctuations. For large molecule ensembles, our results suggest the formation of elongated self-bound droplets with crystalline patterns in both bosonic and fermionic molecules.

Title: Internal and External Field Effects upon Crystal Field Excitations in REFeO$_3$ (RE = Nd$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, Yb$^{3+}$, Pr$^{3+}$, and Ho$^{3+}$)
Authors: Guochu Deng
Abstract: We systematically investigated crystal-field (CF) excitations of Kramers (Nd$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, Yb$^{3+}$) and non-Kramers (Pr$^{3+}$, Ho$^{3+}$) rare-earth ions in $REFeO_3$ using optimized CF simulations. Internal magnetic fields from the Fe$^{3+}$ and RE$^{3+}$ sublattices split the ground-state doublets of all Kramers ions (e.g. $NdFeO_3$, $ErFeO_3$, and $YbFeO_3$), generating low-energy excitations around 1 meV. In non-Kramers systems, low-energy excitations arise only when the ground state forms an accidental pseudo-doublet, as observed for Ho$^{3+}$ in $HoFeO_3$; such pseudo-doublets exhibit field-induced splitting analogous to Kramers ions. In contrast, true singlet ground states, exemplified by Pr$^{3+}$, show no zero-field splitting. Strong anisotropies are found in both internal- and external-field responses of the CF excitations in these $REFeO_3$. These results provide a unified explanation for the anomalous Zeeman splitting of CF ground states in $REFeO_3$.

Title: Disorder-driven exceptional points and concurrent topological phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Xiaoyu Cheng, Tiantao Qu, Yaqing Yang, Jun Chen, Lei Zhang
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are spectral degeneracies unique to non-Hermitian systems which underpin phenomena from enhanced sensing to unconventional topology. While disorder is usually viewed as detrimental, it can also drive topological phase transitions (TPTs). Here, we show that random disorder alone can generate EPs and concurrent TPTs in a multiorbital non-Hermitian lattice with nonreciprocal hopping. Increasing disorder induces successive real-complex-real spectral transitions accompanied by band inversion and quantized changes in the spin Bott index. Using effective medium theory and large-scale simulations, we trace these transitions to a competition between disorder-induced energy-level renormalization and nonreciprocity-driven hybridization. The resulting phase diagram reveals extended EP lines that emerge from the Hermitian TPT point and persist over a broad parameter range. Our results establish disorder as an active mechanism for engineering exceptional point mediated topology in non-Hermitian matter.

Title: Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons
Authors: Julius Bohm, Hugo Gerlitz, Christina Jörg, Michael Fleischhauer
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of topological systems is the robust quantization of particle transport. It is the origin of the integer-valued quantum Hall conductivity and a potential tool for quantum information technology. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by using arrays of photonic waveguides and described by the (lattice-translational invariant) Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model, have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. In these systems, a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound multi-photon states. Upon increasing the interaction strength a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a quantum description of topological pumps of self-bound many-particle states in terms of an effective Hamiltonian of their center-of-mass (COM) motion, which allows to introduce an effective band structure $E_\mu(K)$ with $K$ being the COM momentum, and to classify topological phases in terms of generalized symmetries. We provide an explicit analytic expression of the effective Hamiltonian for few particles in the strong interaction limit and present numerical results in the more general case. We identify a topological invariant, an effective single-particle Chern number, which fully governs the soliton transport. Increasing the interaction strength in the AAH model leads to a successive merging of COM bands, which is the origin of the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential breakdown of topological quantization for some interaction strength.

Title: Two-site entanglement in the two-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: Frederic Bippus, Anna Kauch, Gergő Roósz, Christian Mayrhofer, Fakher Assaad, Karsten Held
Abstract: The study of entanglement in strongly correlated electron systems typically requires knowledge of the reduced density matrix. Here, we apply the parquet dynamical vertex approximation to study the two-site reduced density matrix at varying distance, in the Hubbard model at weak coupling. This allows us to investigate the spatial structure of entanglement in dependence of interaction strength, electron filling, and temperature. We compare results from different entanglement measures, and benchmark against quantum Monte Carlo.

Title: Unifying renormalized and bare viscosity in two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: Kazuma Yokota, Masato Itami, Shin-ichi Sasa
Abstract: Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a framework connecting mesoscopic fluctuations with macroscopic transport behavior. To bridge mesoscopic and macroscopic transport from microscopic dynamics, we introduce a wavenumber-dependent viscosity, defined via the equilibrium correlation of time-averaged Fourier components of the fine-grained shear stress field. Two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations reveal its small-wavenumber divergence characteristic of the renormalized viscosity, while its large-wavenumber behavior determines the bare viscosity, thereby establishing a link between mesoscopic and macroscopic transport based on microscopic dynamics.

Title: Spin caloritronics in collinear ferromagnetic helical structures under irradiation
Authors: Sudin Ganguly, Moumita Dey, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: We study the charge and spin-dependent thermoelectric response of a ferromagnetic helical system irradiated by arbitrarily polarized light, using a tight-binding framework and the Floquet-Bloch formalism. Transport properties for individual spin channels are determined by employing the non-equilibrium Green's function technique, while phonon thermal conductance is evaluated using a mass-spring model with different lead materials. The findings reveal that that light irradiation induces spin-split transmission features, suppresses thermal conductance, and yields favorable spin thermopower and figure of merit (FOM). The spin FOM consistently outperforms its charge counterpart under various light conditions. Moreover, long-range hopping is shown to enhance the spin thermoelectric performance, suggesting a promising strategy for efficient energy conversion in related ferromagnetic systems.

Title: Fermion quantum criticality far from equilibrium
Authors: Rohan Mittal, Tom Zander, Johannes Lang, Sebastian Diehl
Abstract: Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge, both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation, suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum phenomena in fermionic systems.

Title: Scaling Behaviors in Active Model B+ via the Functional Renormalization Group
Authors: Gergely Fejős, Zsolt Szép, Naoki Yamamoto
Abstract: We study the scaling behaviors of the active model B+ using the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach, based on the nonequilibrium effective action formulated via the Martin-Siggia-Rose path-integral formalism. We derive the $\beta$ functions for all couplings of the system in generic $d$ dimensions, revealing regulator independence in various contributions to the renormalization group (RG) flow at specific values for $d$. After identifying specific regions of the parameter space that define submodels closed under RG transformations, we determine all fixed points of potential physical relevance. We confirm the existence of a bicritical fixed point, which was conjectured within the perturbative momentum-shell RG method for being responsible for the transition from bulk phase separation to microphase separation in active systems. We argue that, within the FRG approach, global flows significantly differ from those obtained in its perturbative counterpart.

Title: Role of lattice structure and breaking of antiferromagnetic spin order in enhancement of ferromagnetic, electronic, and magneto-electric properties in Fe$_{2-x}$Sc$_x$O$_3$ system
Authors: R. N. Bhowmik, Bipin Kumar Parida, Amit Kumar, P.D. Babu, S. M. Yusuf
Abstract: The strategy of breaking antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state in alpha-Fe2O3 by doping non-magnetic Sc3+ ions at the Fe3+ sites has been used in Fe2-xScxO3 system (x = 0.2-1.0). The material has been stabilized in single-phase (rhombohedral alpha-Fe2O3) or mix-phase (rhombohedral alpha-Fe2O3 and cubic Sc2O3-types) structure by varying Sc content and heat treatment temperature. Neutron diffraction confirmed perturbed AFM ground state down to low temperature with magnetic moment 2.75-4.68 muB per Fe site and Morin transition 260 K. DC magnetic measurement showed magnetic coercivity 0.2 to 6 kOe. The material showed transformation from insulating state (conductivity 10-14-10-10 S per cm and polarization 0.5-2 micro-C per cm2) to high conductive state (conductivity 10-10 -10-7 S per cm and polarization greater than 2 micro-C per cm2) above the Morin transition. The room temperature measurements showed maximum current density 35-186 micro-A per cm2, electric polarization 2.7-15.6 micro-C per cm2, magneto-electric voltage up to 5 mV with coupling constant 0.62-10.11 mV per this http URL and magneto-conductance up to 90 %. The results will open the door for suitably modifying the lattice-structure, magnetic spin order, and charge-spin coupling in hematite based material and their application in low power spintronic devices.

Abstract: Dislocations are line defects in crystals that multiply and self-organize into a complex network during strain hardening. The length of dislocation links, connecting neighboring nodes within this network, contains crucial information about the evolving dislocation microstructure. By analyzing data from Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD) simulations in face-centered cubic (fcc) Cu, we characterize the statistical distribution of link lengths of dislocation networks during strain hardening on individual slip systems. Our analysis reveals that link lengths on active slip systems follow a double-exponential distribution, while those on inactive slip systems conform to a single-exponential distribution. The distinctive long tail observed in the double-exponential distribution is attributed to the stress-induced bowing out of long links on active slip systems, a feature that disappears upon removal of the applied stress. We further demonstrate that both observed link length distributions can be explained by extending a one-dimensional Poisson process to include different growth functions. Specifically, the double-exponential distribution emerges when the growth rate for links exceeding a critical length becomes super-linear, which aligns with the physical phenomenon of long links bowing out under stress. This work advances our understanding of dislocation microstructure evolution during strain hardening and elucidates the underlying physical mechanisms governing its formation.

Title: Dynamically emergent correlations in Brownian particles subject to simultaneous non-Poissonian resetting protocols
Authors: Gabriele de Mauro, Marco Biroli, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional gas of $N$ independent Brownian particles subject to simultaneous stochastic resetting, with inter-reset times drawn from a general waiting-time distribution $\psi(\tau)$. This includes the well-known Poissonian case, where $\psi(\tau)=re^{-r\tau}$, and extends to more general classes of resetting, such as heavy-tailed and bounded distributions. We show that the simultaneous resetting generates correlations between particles dynamically. These correlations grow with time and eventually drive the system into a strongly correlated non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS). Exploiting the renewal structure of the resetting dynamics, we derive explicit analytical expressions for the joint distribution of the positions of the particles in the NESS. We show that the NESS has a conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure that enables us to compute various physical observables exactly for arbitrary $\psi(\tau)$. These observables include the average density, extreme value and order statistics, the spacing distribution between consecutive particles and the full counting statistics, i.e., the distribution of the number of particles in a given interval centered at the origin. We discuss the universal features of the large $N$ scaling behaviors of these observables for different choices of the resetting protocol $\psi(\tau)$. Our results provide an interesting example of a stochastic control whereby, by tuning the inter-reset distribution $\psi(\tau)$, one can generate a class of tunable, and yet solvable, strongly correlated NESS in a many-body system.

Title: Unconventional Josephson effects in {\it PT}-symmetric antiferromagnetic bilayers
Authors: Jin-Xin Hu, Mengli Hu, Ying-Ming Xie, K. T. Law
Abstract: We propose that unconventional Josephson effects can typically emerge in {\it PT}-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayer systems. When proximitized by a conventional superconductor, these heterostructures host dominant interlayer Cooper pairing that features a distinctive spin texture enabled by the strong exchange field. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for electrically tunable 0-$\pi$ oscillations in lateral Josephson junctions, controlled by an out-of-plane electric displacement field. This behavior originates from field-induced finite-momentum Cooper pairing, a hallmark of the unique layer-pseudospin structure in {\it PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers. Furthermore, we introduce a Josephson giant magnetoresistor based on these exotic spin-layer-locked Cooper pairs, in which the supercurrent exhibits a strong dependence on the internal Néel order. Our findings establish {\it PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers as a versatile platform for phase-controllable Josephson junctions and superconducting magnetic random-access memory, with promising applications in superconducting circuits and ultralow-power computing.

Title: Beyond Structure: Invariant Crystal Property Prediction with Pseudo-Particle Ray Diffraction
Authors: Bin Cao, Yang Liu, Longhan Zhang, Yifan Wu, Zhixun Li, Yuyu Luo, Hong Cheng, Yang Ren, Tong-Yi Zhang
Abstract: Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-range atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is openly available at this https URL.

Title: Design of model Boger fluids with systematically controlled viscoelastic properties
Authors: Jonghyun Hwang, Howard A. Stone
Abstract: The subject of viscoelastic flow phenomena is crucial to many areas of engineering and the physical sciences. Although much of our understanding of viscoelastic flow features stems from carefully designed experiments, preparation of model viscoelastic fluids remains a challenge; for example, fabricating a series of fluids with different fluid shear moduli $G_0$, but with an identical relaxation time $\tau$, is nontrivial. In this work, we harness the non-ideality of nearly constant-viscosity elastic fluids, commonly known as `Boger fluids', made with polyisobutylene, to develop an experimental methodology that produces a set of fluids with desired viscoelastic properties, specifically, $G_0$, $\tau$, and the first normal stress difference coefficient $\psi_1$. Through a linear algebraic relation between the rheological properties of interest ($G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$) and the fluid compositions in terms of polymer concentration $c$, molecular weight $M_w$, and solvent viscosity $\eta_s$, we developed a `design equation' that takes $G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$ as inputs and calculates values for $c$, $M_w$, $\eta_s$ as outputs. Using this method, fabrication of dilute viscoelastic fluids whose rheological properties are \textit{a priori} known can be achieved.

Title: Topological Textures in Zr-Substituted Barium Titanate
Authors: Florian Mayer
Abstract: Topological polarization textures in ferroelectrics offer pathways to dense memory, neuromorphic computing, and controlled probes of topology in solids. In rhombohedral barium titanate, theory has identified stable antiskyrmions of topological charge -2 that fractionalize into six -1/3 hotspots, termed topological quarks. Here we extend this landscape to Zr-substituted barium titanate (BZT) using a first-principles parameterized effective Hamiltonian framework. In an ordered 12.5% composition, the chemically doubled periodicity enforces an alternation along [111]: one half hosts the -2 antiskyrmion (six -1/3 quarks), the other a +4 skyrmion (six +2/3 quarks). The two share the same six-vortex scaffold (threefold motif) but differ in the core-level polarization texture, resulting in an integer +1 per vortex offset in the plane-integrated (slice) topological charge. In random BZT, nanodomains remain inducible and cryogenically stable, yet quenched disorder pins and distorts the vortices, producing a heterogeneous, skyrmion-glass-like state with fluctuations of the topological charge along the nanodomain axis. Thermal stability maps show that pure barium titanate retains -2 textures up to ~100 K, whereas in BZT the collapse temperature is nonmonotonic, with a minimum near 6-8% Zr, reflecting competition between ferroelectric softening and disorder pinning. Importantly, the 12.5% ordered arrangement remains rhombohedral above 300 K, enabling field-stabilized nanodomains at 293 K. Under a local [111] bias, the ordered system carries +4 slice charge, while the random composition fragments under the same conditions. These results establish BZT as a platform for chemically programmed, fractionalized ferroelectric topology from cryogenic to room temperature and suggest routes to multistate, reconfigurable devices.

Title: When Normality Tests Detect Equilibrium Distributions of Finite N-Body Systems
Authors: Jae Wan Shim
Abstract: The particle number $N$ can be used as a quantitative gauge of non-Gaussianity. This idea extends to systems that are not literally finite by assigning them a notional $N$ that captures the same deviation. For an ideal gas with $N$ insufficiently large for the thermodynamic limit, the velocity distribution that maximises Havrda-Charvát entropy departs markedly from the Maxwell-Boltzmann (Gaussian) form obtained in that limit. We explore how five standard normality tests -- Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cramér--von Mises, Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilk -- respond to samples drawn from this finite-$N$ equilibrium distribution. A large-scale Monte Carlo study maps the tests' statistical power across system size $N$ and sample size $n$, providing practical reference tables and a heuristic scaling law, visualised as a contour plot, that together indicate when finite-size effects remain detectable.

Title: Tuning the Electronic Structure of Graphene by Controlling Spatial Confinement
Authors: Mohammadamir Bazrafshan, Thomas. D. Kühne
Abstract: The electronic properties of a material depend on the spatial freedom of the electron wavefunction. A well-known example is graphite, which is a conventional gapless semiconductor, while a single layer of it, graphene, exhibits extremely high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, graphene ribbons can have different physical properties, such as a tunable band gap, ranging from gapless to a large band gap semiconductor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the electronic structure of few-layer graphene composed of a layer of graphene nanoribbons and graphene sheet(s), where quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons can interact with a two-dimensional sheet of graphite. Using the tight-binding model for graphite, we show how different configurations of such heterostructures can affect the electronic structure, which is different from that of their components. Our results show that systems composed of semiconducting AGNRs can not be seen as two separate systems. Namely, a local gap of ~0.6 eV at the Dirac point for dispersive bands can be opened in a bilayer configuration composed of a layer of gapless armchair nanoribbon stacked on graphene. We demonstrate that the band steepness in these structures can be tuned, highlighting their potential for electronic applications.

Title: Stable Quantum Vortices in Lee-Huang-Yang Dipolar Superfluids
Authors: S. Sabari, R. Radha, Lauro Tomio, B. A. Malomed
Abstract: The nucleation and dynamics of vortices in the quasi-two-dimensional rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate are explored by taking into account the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the mean-field (MF) theory. Assuming approximate cancellation of the MF interactions, we focus on the formation of a pure LHY superfluid. The effect of rotational frequency $\Omega $ is investigated numerically by determining the corresponding number of stable vortices in the superfluid, together with the respective energy per particle $E$ and chemical potential $\mu $. The LHY superfluid provides a deep minimum of $E$ and $\mu $, indicating that it is a remarkably robust state of quantum matter. By fixing the LHY interaction strength, an exact single-vortex critical frequency is found, along with the respective chemical potential. A notable feature, observed when creating the LHY superfluid with fewer than five vortices, which is understood as being due to the superfluid's nonlinearity and trapping aspect ratio, is the large frequency ranges admitting the production of two and four vortices, as compared to the small frequency ranges to obtain one and three vortices.

Title: Following the Long-Term Evolution of sp$^3$-type Defects in Tritiated Graphene using Raman Spectroscopy
Authors: Genrich Zeller, Magnus Schlösser, Helmut H. Telle
Abstract: We report on the evolution of tritium-induced sp$^3$-defects in monolayer graphene on a Si/SiO$_2$ substrate, by comparing large-area Raman maps of the same two samples, acquired just after fabrication and twice thereafter, about 9-12 months apart. Inbetween measurements the samples were kept under standard laboratory conditions. Using a conservative classification of sp$^3$-type spectra, based on the D/D' peak intensity ratio, we observed almost complete depletion of sp$^3$-type defects over the investigation period of about two years. This by far exceeds the ~5.5% annual reduction expected from tritium decay alone (~3x larger). This change in the defect composition is accompanied by a recovery of the 2D-band of graphene and an overall decrease in defect-density, as determined via the D/G intensity ratio. Hydogenated graphene is reported to be reasonably stable over several months, when kept under vacuum, but suffers substantial hydrogen loss under laboratory air conditions. While the results shown here for tritiated graphene exhibit similarities with hydrogenated graphene, however, some distinct differences are observed.

Title: Hydrogen diffusion in TiCr$_2$H$_x$ Laves phases: A combined ab initio and machine-learning-potential study
Authors: Pranav Kumar, Fritz Körmann, Kaveh Edalati, Blazej Grabowski, Yuji Ikeda
Abstract: The kinetics of hydrogen diffusion in C15 cubic and C14 hexagonal TiCr$_2$H$_x$ (0 < $x$ <= 4) Laves-phase hydrogen storage alloys is investigated with density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Generalized solid-state nudged elastic band calculations are conducted based on DFT for all symmetrically inequivalent paths between the first-nearest-neighbor face-sharing interstitial sites. The hydrogen migration barriers are substantially higher for the paths that require breaking a Ti-H bond than for those that require breaking a Cr-H bond. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the MLIPs also demonstrate that hydrogen migration occurs more frequently within the hexagonal rings made of the A$_2$B$_2$ interstitial paths, each requiring the breaking of Cr-H bonds, than along the inter-ring paths. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen obtained from the MD simulations reveal a non-monotonic dependence on hydrogen concentration, which is more pronounced at lower temperatures. Time-averaged radial distribution functions of hydrogen further show that hydrogen avoids face-sharing positions during diffusion and that the hydrogen occupancy at the second-nearest-neighbor edge-sharing positions increases with increasing hydrogen concentration. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen within 400-1000 K follow an Arrhenius relationship, with activation barriers consistent with most experimental values. One-order of magnitude overestimation of diffusion coefficients compared with some experiments suggests a substantial impact of hydrogen trapping by defects such as Cr vacancies and Ti anti-sites in non-stoichiometric TiCr$_2$ in experiments.

Title: Local Irreversible phase reconfiguration and thermal-memory effects in a highly-correlated manganite
Authors: Guilherme Kuhl-Soares, Otávio Canton, Eduardo Granado, Diego Carranza-Célis, Marcelo Knobel, Gabriel Gomide, Juan Gabriel Ramirez, Diego Muraca
Abstract: Phase-separated manganites provide a unique platform to study the dynamics of competing electronic and structural orders in correlated systems. In La0.275Pr0.35Ca0.375MnO3 (LPCMO), we use temperature-cycling Raman spectroscopy to uncover a previously unidentified regime of structural irreversibility, emerging from the interplay between lattice distortions and phase competition across the phase-separation and charge-orbital ordering temperatures. This irreversible behavior encodes a thermal-memory effect reflecting the system's history-dependent energy landscape. Correlated magnetic and transport responses confirm the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom, revealing a new form of nonequilibrium phase dynamics in mixed-valence oxides. These results advance the understanding of metastability and memory phenomena in strongly correlated materials.

Title: Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor junctions as thermoelectric bolometers
Authors: Leonardo Lucchesi, Federico Paolucci
Abstract: We design a superconducting thermoelectric bolometer made of a Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction. Our detector has the advantage of being passive, as it directly transduces input power to a voltage without the need to modulate an external bias. We characterize the device via numerical simulation of the full nonlinear thermal dynamical model of the junction, considering heating of both sides of the junction. While estimating noise contributions, we found novel expressions due to the temperatures of both sides being different than the bath temperature. Numerical simulations show a Noise Equivalent Power ${\rm NEP}\sim 4\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm W}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for an input power of $\sim10^{-16}\,{\rm W}$, a response time of $\tau_{th}\sim 200\, {\rm ns}$ and an integration time to obtain a Signal-to-Noise Ratio ${\rm SNR}=1$ of $\tau_{\rm SNR=1}\sim 100\,\mu{\rm s}$ for an input power $\sim 10^{-13}\,{\rm W}$. Therefore, the device shows promise for large-array cosmological experiment applications, also considering its advantages for fabrication and heat budget.

Title: Orbital Magnetization Reveals Multiband Topology
Authors: Chun Wang Chau, Robert-Jan Slager, Wojciech J. Jankowski
Abstract: We demonstrate that nontrivial multiband topological invariants of electronic wavefunctions can be revealed through orbital magnetization responses to external magnetic fields. We find that decomposing orbital magnetization into energetic and quantum-geometric contributions allows one to deduce nontrivial multiband topology, provided knowledge of the energy spectrum. We showcase our findings in general effective models with multiband Euler topology. We moreover identify such multiband topological invariants in effective models of strontium ruthenate ($\text{Sr}_2 \text{Ru} \text{O}_4$), which may in principle be verified in the state-of-the-art doping-dependent magnetization measurements. Our reconstruction scheme for multiband invariants sheds a topological perspective on the multiorbital effects in materials realizing unconventional phenomenologies of orbital currents or multiband superconductivity.

Title: Effect of hybrid field coupling in nanostructured surfaces on anisotropic signal detection in nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods
Authors: Ayona James, Maryam Ali, Zekai Ye, Phan Thi Yen Nhi, Sharon Xavi, Mashiat Huq, Sajib Barua, Meng Luo, Yisak Tsegazab, Anna Elmanova, Robin Schneider, Olga Ustimenko, Sarmiza-Elena Stanca, Marco Diegel, Andrea Dellith, Uwe Hübner, Christoph Krafft, Jasmin Finkelmeyer, Maximilian Hupfer, Kalina Peneva, Matthias Zeisberger, Christin David, Martin Presselt, Daniela Täuber
Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution < 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.

Title: Detuning the Floquet anomalous chiral spin liquid
Authors: Matthieu Mambrini, Nathan Goldman, Didier Poilblanc
Abstract: At high-frequency a periodically-driven quantum spin-1/2 system can emulate a chiral spin liquid (CSL) described by an effective static local chiral Hamiltonian. In contrast, at low-frequency these settings realize "Swap" models exhibiting {\it anomalous} CSL phases, in which one-way spin transport occurs at the edge although the bulk time-evolution operator over one period is trivial. In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the Streda response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL. We also discuss the possible occurrence of a long-lived prethermal anomalous CSL.

Title: Symbolic recursion method for strongly correlated fermions in two and three dimensions
Authors: Igor Ermakov, Oleg Lychkovskiy
Abstract: We present a symbolic implementation of recursion method for the dynamics of strongly correlated fermions on one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices. Focusing on two paradigmatic models, interacting spinless fermions and the Hubbard model, we first directly confirm that the universal operator growth hypothesis holds for interacting fermionic systems, manifested by the linear growth of Lanczos coefficients. Equipped with symbolically computed Lanczos coefficients and knowledge of their asymptotics, we are able to compute infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions up to times long enough for thermalization to occur. In turn, the knowledge of autocorrelation functions unlocks transport properties. We compute with high precision the charge diffusion constant over a broad range of interaction strengths, $V$. Surprisingly, we observe that these results are well described by a simple functional dependence $\sim 1/V^2$ universally valid both for small and large $V$. All results are obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our results highlight the promise of symbolic computational paradigm where the most costly step is performed once and outputs symbolic results that can further be used multiple times to easily compute physical quantities for specific values of model parameters.

Title: Topological phonons in anomalous Hall crystals
Authors: Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Félix Desrochers, Joe Huxford, Yong Baek Kim
Abstract: Recent experiments on few-layer graphene structures have reported indirect signatures of anomalous Hall crystals (AHCs), but the need for a top gate to stabilize the phase precludes direct imaging of the emergent electronic lattice. This situation necessitates the investigation of alternative signatures of AHCs. The gapless phonons of the emergent electronic lattice provide a clear distinction from conventional quantum Hall states, but it may be difficult to disentangle these phonons from the plethora of other possible low-lying modes. Intriguingly, the quantum geometry of the underlying electronic ground state can imprint on the collective modes, possibly leading the phonons themselves to be topological. Were this the case, the resulting neutral chiral edge modes would provide a further signature of an AHC. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase. We conclude by discussing the relevance of collective mode topology to experiments on candidate systems for AHCs.

Title: Fractional-Monolayer 2D-GaN/AlN Structures: Growth Kinetics and UVC-emitter Applications
Authors: V.N. Jmerik, D.V. Nechaev, E.A. Evropeitsev, E.M. Roginskii, A.N. Semenov, M.A. Yagovkina, P.A. Alekseev, V.I. Kozlovsky, M.M. Zverev, N.A. Gamov, Tao Wang, Xinqiang Wang, T.V. Shubina, A.A. Toropov
Abstract: The paper reports on fundamental properties of the GaN/AlN quantum wells (QWs) with nominal subcritical thicknesses of 0.75-2 monolayers (MLs). They are grown by plasma-activated molecular beam epitaxy, varying either the nominal thickness or the gallium-to-nitrogen flux ratio. In situ monitoring reveals difference in 2D nucleation and step-flow growth modes of the QWs. The emission charactestics of QWs with integer thicknesses of 1 and 2 MLs depend weakly on the growth mechanism. In contrast, the intensity and spectral position luminescence of QWs with fractional-ML thicknesses are determined by the growth mechanism. Using ab initio calculations, a phenomenological model is proposed that describes fractional-ML QWs either as arrays of 2D quantum disks or as arrays of 2D quantum ribbons, in cases where 2D nucleation or step-flow growth mechanisms predominate, respectively. This model is generally consistent with experimental data on photo- and cathodoluminescence of heterostructures with multiple (250) GaN/AlN QWs. These heterostructures, when pumped by electrom beam at an energy 12.5 keV with a maximum pulse current of 2 A, exhibit linear current dependences of optical peak powers up to 1 and 37 W for wavelengths of 228 and 256 nm, respectively, making them promising for use as powerfull ultraviolet-C emitters.

Title: De novo emergence of metabolically active protocells
Authors: Nayan Chakraborty, Shashi Thutupalli
Abstract: A continuous route from a disordered soup of simple chemical feedstocks to a functional protocell -- a compartment that metabolizes, grows, and propagates -- remains elusive. Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes. Internal spherules that are themselves growth-competent are produced within the protocells, establishing a rudimentary mode of self-perpetuation. The chemical dynamics we observe in controlled laboratory conditions also occur in reaction mixtures exposed to natural day-night cycles. Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.

Title: Majorana Fermions in spin up and down electronic complexes in spin-orbit coupled array of semiconductor quantum dots in proximity to $s$-type superconductor and in magnetic field
Authors: Mijanur Islam, Mahan Mohseni, Ibsal Assi, Daniel Miravet, Pawel Hawrylak
Abstract: Semiconductor-s-type superconductor nanowires host spinful fermions and cannot be reduced to a single spinless Kitaev chain hosting single Majorana zero mode. Instead, such systems can be converted into two coupled p-wave Kitaev-like chains associated with different spin sectors. Using the bond Fermion transformation and exact diagonalization, we analyze parity resolved spectra and local spectral functions, demonstrating that zero-energy modes strongly localized at the system boundaries emerge only in one effective chain. Inter-chain coupling lifts parity degeneracy and redistributes the low-energy spectral weight, providing a controlled framework to assess the stability of Majorana-like modes in the finite spinful nanowires.

Title: Hysteretic Excitation in Non-collinear Antiferromagnetic Spin-Torque Oscillators: A Terminal Velocity Motion Perspective
Authors: Hao-Hsuan Chen, Ching-Ming Lee
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin torque oscillators (NC-AFM STO) by unifying spin dynamics under the Poisson Bracket formalism. Shifting from traditional torque-based descriptions to an operational symmetry perspective, we develop two complementary viewpoints: a vector perspective identifying infinite degenerate Rigid Body Precession (RBP) states where exchange energy depends solely on the total magnetic momentum, and a particle perspective decomposing dynamics into Center-of-Mass (CM) translation and Relative Motion (RM) oscillation. Using time-dependent rotational and translational transformation techniques, we analytically resolve the rapid (~10 ps) transient evolution into a stable RBP state driven by SOT and damping. We demonstrate that the out-of-plane anisotropy (OPA) lifts the exchange degeneracy, triggering a long-term (~1 ns) oscillatory decay toward a steady state characterized by uniform spin z-components and a 120-degree inter-spin locking angle. This state is accurately governed by our Terminal Velocity Motion (TVM) model [arXiv:2305.14013], where exchange coupling transforms into kinetic energy with a light effective mass. The model precisely predicts SOT-driven transients, hysteretic excitation, and the dynamic phase diagram. Finally, we account for the sub-critical current regime mismatch by identifying a 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect: a surge in effective friction caused by the self-resonance of RM variables induced by CM translation, mediated by the in-plane anisotropy (IPA).

Title: Magnetic structure of EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ single-crystal thin-film
Authors: Yu Wei Soh, Hsiang Lee, Eugen Weschke, Shinichi Nishihaya, Mikhael T. Sayat, Masaki Uchida, Jian-Rui Soh
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials are a class of compounds which can host massless electrons controlled by the magnetic order. One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\,K, which is associated with an \textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers. We propose that EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ behaves as a Weyl semimetal in the surface FM layers, and as a topological crystalline insulator in the lower AFM layers.

Abstract: We present a theory for the interaction between active particles and a passive flexible membrane. By explicitly solving for the pressure exerted by the active particles, we show that they reduce the membrane tension and bending modulus and introduce novel non-local contributions to the membrane mechanics. This theory predicts activity-induced instabilities and their morphology are in agreement with recent experimental and simulation data.

Title: Superconductivity under pressure in the two-dimensional van der Waals heavy-fermion metal CeSiI
Authors: Tong Shi, Wenhao Li, Qingxin Dong, Pengtao Yang, Hanming Ma, Zhaoming Tian, Ningning Wang, Jianping Sun, Yoshiya Uwatoko, Yi-feng Yang, Bosen Wang, Hechang Lei, Jinguang Cheng
Abstract: CeSiI is a newly discovered exfoliable van der Waals (vdW) heavy-fermion metal featured by a long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) order (TN =7.5 K) inside the Kondo coherent state below T* = 50 K. To gain a more profound understanding of the intriguing physics of this material and to uncover novel phenomena driven by quantum criticality, it is imperative to construct the phase diagram of CeSiI detailing the evolutions of T* and TN as a function of external tuning parameters such as pressure (P).In this study, we employ high pressure as an effective tuning knob to investigate this system, thereby generating a comprehensive T-P phase diagram of CeSiI. This diagram is characterized by an unusual V-shaped nonmonotonic evolution of T*(P) and the emergence of a superconducting dome with Tcmax = 240 mK upon suppression of AF order at Pc = 6 GPa, coinciding with the minimum of T*(P).The close proximity of the superconductivity (SC) to the AF instability and an unusually large upper critical field Bc2(0) exceeding 4-7 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit, suggests an unconventional pairing mechanism in CeSiI. Further analyses of normal-state transport properties provide evidence of quantum criticality, i.e., non-Fermi-liquid behavior and divergence of quasiparticle effective mass near Pc = 7 GPa. Our findings not only establish CeSiI as the first vdW heavy-fermion superconductor but also highlight an unconventional nature for the Kondo coherent state at T* at ambient pressure, hence opening a new avenue to study the interplay of strong electron correlation, Kondo hybridization, magnetism, and unconventional SC in the vdW heavy-fermion systems.

Title: Relaxation time approximation revisited and non-analytical structure in retarded correlators
Authors: Jin Hu
Abstract: In this paper, we give a rigorous mathematical justification for the relaxation time approximation (RTA) model. We find that only the RTA with an energy-independent relaxation time can be justified in the case of hard interactions. Accordingly, we propose an alternative approach to restore the collision invariance lacking in traditional RTA. Besides, we provide a general statement on the non-analytical structures in the retarded correlators within the kinetic description. For hard interactions, hydrodynamic poles are the long-lived modes. Whereas for soft interactions, commonly encountered in relativistic kinetic theory, the gapless eigenvalue spectrum of linearized collision operator leads to gapless branch-cuts. We note that particle mass and inhomogeneous perturbations would complicate the above-mentioned non-analytical structures.

Title: Exact treatment of the memory kernel under time-dependent system-environment coupling via a train of delta distributions
Authors: Yuta Uenaga, Kensuke Gallock-Yoshimura, Takano Taira
Abstract: Memory effects in a quantum system coupled to an environment are one of the central features in the theory of open quantum systems. The dynamics of such quantum systems are typically governed by an equation of motion with a time-convolution integral of the memory kernel. However, solving such integro-differential equations is challenging, especially when the memory kernel is nonstationary (not time-translation invariant). In this paper, we analytically and nonperturbatively solve such integro-differential equations with a nonstationary memory kernel by employing a train of Dirac-delta switchings. We then apply this method to the damped Jaynes-Cummings model and the damped harmonic oscillator model to demonstrate that (i) our solution asymptotes to the well-known exact solution in the continuum limit, and that (ii) our method also enables us to visualize the memory effect in the environment.

Title: General many-body entanglement swapping protocol: opportunities for distributed quantum computing
Authors: Santeri Huhtanen, Yousef Mafi, Ali G. Moghaddam, Teemu Ojanen
Abstract: Sharing entangled pairs between non-signaling parties via entanglement swapping constitutes a striking demonstration of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics and a crucial building block for future quantum technologies. In this work, we generalize pair-swapping methods by introducing a many-body entanglement swapping protocol, which allows two non-signaling parties to share general many-body states along an arbitrary partitioning. The shared many-body state retains exactly the same Schmidt vectors as the target state and exhibits typically high fidelity, which approaches unity as the variance of the Schmidt coefficients vanishes. Moreover, we demonstrate how the three-party protocol can be generalized to many-body swapping networks, enabling a general many-body state sharing with unit fidelity via arbitrary number of intermediate nodes. This is achieved by replacing all but one of the unitary operations with those corresponding to the same Schmidt states but with a flattened spectrum, which also completely eliminates the need for postselection. We provide a proof of concept of the three-party protocol on real quantum hardware and discuss how it enables new functionalities, such as fault-tolerant entanglement swapping and new strategies for distributed quantum computing.

Title: Robust qubit interactions mediated by photonic topological edge states
Authors: Boris Gurevich, Weihua Xie, Mohsen Yarmohammadi, Michael H. Kolodrubetz
Abstract: We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes. We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by topological edge modes.

Title: Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries
Authors: Gerardo Ortiz, Chinmay Giridhar, Philipp Vojta, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy, Zohar Nussinov
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.

Title: LLM Agents for Knowledge Discovery in Atomic Layer Processing
Authors: Andreas Werbrouck, Marshall B. Lindsay, Matthew Maschmann, Matthias J. Young
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

Title: Reducing TLS loss in tantalum CPW resonators using titanium sacrificial layers
Authors: Zachary Degnan, Chun-Ching Chiu, Yi-Hsun Chen, David Sommers, Leonid Abdurakhimov, Lihuang Zhu, Arkady Fedorov, Peter Jacobson
Abstract: We demonstrate a substantial reduction in two-level system loss in tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates through the use of an ultrathin titanium sacrificial layer. A 0.2nm titanium film, deposited atop pre-sputtered {\alpha}-tantalum, acts as a solid-state oxygen getter that chemically modifies the native Ta oxide at the metal-air interface. After device fabrication, the titanium layer is removed using buffered oxide etchant, leaving behind a chemically reduced Ta oxide surface. Subsequent high-vacuum annealing further suppresses two-level system loss. Resonators treated with this process exhibit internal quality factors Qi exceeding an average of 1.5 million in the single-photon regime across ten devices, over three times higher than otherwise identical devices lacking the titanium layer. These results highlight the critical role of interfacial oxide chemistry in superconducting loss and reinforce atomic-scale surface engineering as an effective approach to improving coherence in tantalum-based quantum circuits. The method is compatible with existing fabrication workflows applicable to tantalum films, offering a practical route to further extending T1 lifetimes in superconducting qubits.
