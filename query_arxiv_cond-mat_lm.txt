Title: Thermal gradient effect on hydrogen transport in tungsten
Authors: Sanad Alturk, Jacob Jeffries, Muhammed Kose, Enrique Martinez
Abstract: One key challenge for efficiency and safety in fusion devices is the retention of tritium (T) in plasma-facing components. Tritium retention generates radioactive concerns and decreases the amount of fuel available to generate power. Hence, understanding the behavior of T in tungsten (W), as the main candidate as armor material, is critical to the deployment of fusion as a reliable energy source. In this work, we have studied the effect of a thermal gradient in the transport properties of hydrogen (as a T surrogate) in pure W. Strong thermal gradients develop in the divertor as a result of the intense energy fluxes arriving at the material. We have developed an analytical approach to compute the heat of transport ($Q^*$) that is parameterized from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. $Q^*$ is a parameter needed in irreversible thermodynamics frameworks to understand mass transport in the presence of thermal gradients. We show that $Q^*$ can be written as a function of temperature, temperature gradient, a characteristic length and the ratio of the rates towards hot and cold regions. Furthermore, we describe how, to first order, the dependence of $Q^*$ on the thermal gradient vanishes, in agreement with MD results. On average, we find $Q^*=-5.41\times 10^{-3}kT^2~\text{eV}$ for H in pure W, with $k$ the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature.

Title: Survival and Detection of Symmetry-Protected Topology in Loop Quenches
Authors: Nicolò Forcellini, Miklós Horváth, Panagiotis Kotetes
Abstract: We explore a class of dynamical protocols - that we term loop quenches - which are tailored for the study of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) systems. In loop quenches, SPT phases can survive even out of equilibrium, thus evading the dynamical violation of their protecting symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate that employing loop quenches allows to detect the equilibrium topology via measurable dynamical quantities. Focusing on chiral-SPT phases, we introduce the Loschmidt chirality amplitude as a key observable that encodes the equilibrium topological invariant. We exemplify our method for chiral-symmetric one-dimensional two-band insulators and propose a pump-probe measurement scheme which allows to extract the amplitude in question. Our protocol uncovers a direct dynamical signature of SPT phases and, most importantly, paves the way for a general diagnostic framework that can be extended to other symmetry classes and dimensions.

Title: A microscopically reversible kinetic theory of flocking
Authors: Ruben Lier
Abstract: We formulate a kinetic theory of two species of hard spheres which can undergo collisions converting chemical energy into kinetic energy. As the two species represent birds and air, this reactive collision mimics birds flapping their wings, allowing for their propulsion. We demand microscopic reversibility of the reactive collisions. We then introduce a chemostat to drive the system out of equilibrium. When the chemostat is sufficiently turned on and one restricts to grazing interspecies collisions, the momentum damping term can turn into a momentum growth term, hinting at a flocking transition.

Title: Numerically Discovered Inherent States are Always Protocol Dependent in Jammed Packings
Authors: Eddie Bautista, Eric I. Corwin
Abstract: The energy landscape for soft sphere packings exists in a high-dimensional space and plays host to an astronomical number of local minima in a hierarchical and ultrametric arrangement. Each point in the landscape is a configuration that can be unambiguously mapped to its inherent state, defined as the local minimum that the configuration will flow to under perfectly overdamped continuous dynamics. Typically, discrete in time dynamics are used to computationally find local minima, but it is not known whether these algorithms are capable of reliably finding inherent states. Here, we use steepest descent dynamics to find the distribution of the largest time step, $\delta_\textrm{best}$, which finds the inherent state. We find that for systems of $N$ particles, $\delta_\textrm{best}$ is approximately proportional to $N^{-3}$, and weakly dependent on d and $\varphi$. We argue that the proportionality is due to saddle points in the energy landscape. Our results suggest that it is impossible, in practice, to reliably find inherent states for systems of about 64 particles or more.

Title: Rigidity paradox of kirigami arches
Authors: Eszter Fehér
Abstract: The geometry of bending-active kirigami arches, decorated by cuts and holes, is strongly influenced by the location and geometry of the perforations. This study demonstrates that, in some instances, the geometric stiffening induced by additional cuts can outweigh the weakening effect of material removal, leading to a counterintuitive increase in structural rigidity under a given concentrated load. We present multiple parametric cut patterns to show that rigidity can be increased both under symmetric and asymmetric loads. While the preferred cut location is often near the point of action of the load, asymmetric loading can shift this optimum elsewhere. Moreover, the distance between the supports also plays a crucial role, namely, the rigidity gain vanishes when the supports are too far apart. We found that the rigidity can be increased for both non-perforated and perforated sheets, and there is a non-monotonic relationship between the global porosity and the rigidity of the structure. Numerical predictions are validated against experimental measurements.

Title: Orbital dependent Coulomb drag in electron-hole bilayer graphene heterostructures
Authors: Zuocheng Zhang, Ruishi Qi, Jingxu Xie, Qize Li, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Michael F. Crommie, Feng Wang
Abstract: We report Coulomb drag studies in an electron-hole bilayer graphene heterostructure in a magnetic field, where the orbital, spin, and valley degrees of freedom are lifted by the combined effects of exchange interaction, Zeeman energy, and vertical displacement field. Our device enables the application of a large vertical displacement field in both layers. In addition to the well-established strong Coulomb drag between Landau levels with an orbital quantum number N = 0, we observe a Coulomb drag signal between the N = 1 Landau levels under a suitable vertical displacement field. As the displacement field increases further, the Coulomb drag signal between N = 1 Landau levels weakens, and a Coulomb drag signal emerges between the N = 0 and N = 1 Landau levels. These findings suggest the important roles of the orbital index and vertical displacement field in interlayer Coulomb interactions within the quantum Hall regime of coupled bilayer systems.

Title: Controlled Growth of Bronze Telluride for Scalable Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting
Authors: Karthik R, Abhijith MB, Juan Gomez Quispe, Varinder Pal, Manas Paliwal, Ajit K Roy, Pedro Alves Da Silva Autreto, Sreeram Punathil Raman, Pulickel M. Ajayan, Chandra Sekhar Tiwary
Abstract: With the growing demand for sustainable and decentralized energy solutions, thermoelectric energy harvesting has emerged as a promising technology for directly converting waste heat into electricity through solid state, environmentally friendly means. Among copper chalcogenides, Cu2Te is a notable p-type material due to its degenerate semiconducting nature and low thermal conductivity. In this study, we present a sustainable synthesis strategy for Sn-doped Cu2Te referred to as bronze telluride (BT) via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) assisted tellurization process using pre-alloyed Cu Sn (bronze) powder. The resulting BT exhibited an enhanced thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 1 at 500 K. To assess practical applicability, BT was integrated with n type galena (PbS) in a cascaded p n thermoelectric module, which generated 2.8 mV across a temperature gradient of 35 K, demonstrating its potential for medium- to high-temperature waste heat recovery. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations and density functional theory (DFT) simulations provided insights into the formation mechanism of Cu2Te and the thermoelectric behaviour of BT. This work introduces an efficient, scalable, and environmentally responsible pathway for developing copper-based thermoelectric materials using industrially relevant precursors.

Title: Dimensional analysis for clogging of grains in two and three dimensions
Authors: Julián Montero, Ryan Kozlowski, Luis A. Pugnaloni
Abstract: We conduct standard dimensional analysis (Vaschy--Buckingham $\Pi$-theorem) for the mean avalanche size $\langle s \rangle$ when particles flow through, and clog at, a small orifice on the base of a flat-bottomed silo. We consider the effect of particle diameter $d$, orifice diameter $D$, particle density $\rho$, particle Young's modulus $E$ and acceleration of gravity $g$. We both perform discrete element method simulations and compile available data in the literature in order to sample the parameter space. We find that our simulations and data across many experiments and simulations of frictional grains are consistent with the scaling equation $\ln (\langle s \rangle+1) = A_\alpha (D/d-1)^{\alpha} + B_\alpha \sqrt{\rho g d / E}$, where $A_\alpha$ and $B_\alpha$ are empirical constants and $\alpha$ is the dimensionality of the system ($\alpha=2$ and $\alpha=3$ for 2D and 3D, respectively). This expression successfully synthesizes the clogging behavior of a number of related clogging systems and motivates future extensions to more complex configurations involving, for example, very low friction particles or external vibrations.

Title: Antiferron Modes in Ferroelectric Materials
Authors: David Galvez-Poblete, Mario A. Castro, Roberto E. Troncoso, Guillermo Romero, Alvaro S. Nunez, Sebastian Allende
Abstract: We introduce the concept of antiferron modes in ferroelectric materials as dynamically stabilized collective excitations over inverted polarization states that decrease the system energy. While ferrons represent quantized oscillations around the stable polarization minimum, antiferrons require dynamic stabilization via high-frequency driving. Using a generalized Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire framework, we derive the effective curvature corrections from external driving, demonstrate the conditions for stabilizing metastable wells, and present the quantized Hamiltonian. Antiferrons could be a promising candidate for developing electrical sensing devices, offering tunable, dynamically controllable excitations with high sensitivity to external electric fields.

Title: Exploring the Nonlinear Rheology of Composite Hydrogels: A New Paradigm for LAOS Analysis
Authors: Wayan A. Fontaine-Seiler, Gavin J. Donley, Emanuela Del Gado, Daniel L. Blair
Abstract: We investigate composite biopolymer networks composed of co-polymerized fibrin and gelatin networks and perform rheological measurements over a broad parameter space including strain amplitudes that go beyond the linear response regime. One goal of the work presented here is to provide a prototypical biocomposite material with highly separable polymerization times and controlled nonlinear rheological characteristics. We then extend the Sequence of Physical Processes (SPP)\cite{Rogers2017} into a statistical and geometrical framework that fingerprints the nonlinear rheological response of biopolymer composite gels. Our analysis is based on the changes in the shape of the time-dependent Cole-Cole plots that allow to reduce the time resolved analysis of the SPP method into the transition between linear and nonlinear behavior as the rheological parameters are varied. While the results clearly highlight how the mechanical responses of individual constituents are not simply additive, our extended SPP analysis provides a robust and intuitive classification scheme for comparing the nonlinear response of composite materials subjected to large oscillatory strain.

Title: Electric-Field Control of Josephson Oscillations in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: David Galvez-Poblete, Roberto E. Troncoso, Guillermo Romero, Alvaro S. Nunez, Sebastian Allende
Abstract: We study the dynamic behavior of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with dipolar interactions when the influence of external electric fields affects the coherent tunneling properties. Here, we propose a tunable platform based on BECs where Josephson oscillations can be engineered and modulated through external electric fields. We develop a theoretical and numerical frame-work that reveals how electric fields affect intercondensate tunneling, phase dynamics, and collective excitations. By employing a coupled set of Gross-Pitaevskii equations with adiabatic elimination of excited states, we demonstrate field-induced tuning of Josephson frequencies and a transition from contact to dipole-dominated regimes. These findings corroborate theoretical predictions about the sensitivity of dipolar BECs to external fields and deepen our understanding of quantum coherence and tunneling in long-range interacting quantum systems.

Title: Trigonal warping enables linear optical spectroscopy in single-valley superconductors
Authors: Benjamin A. Levitan, Étienne Lantagne-Hurtubise
Abstract: In superconductors with multiple pairing channels, Bardasis-Schrieffer modes and clapping modes arise as fluctuations in channels whose angular momenta differ from that of the pair condensate. Crystal symmetries often impose selection rules which keep these modes optically dark. We show that if pairing occurs around a single Fermi surface, trigonal warping renders both of these modes, as well as the quasiparticle excitation gap, visible in the longitudinal and Hall optical responses. Our results suggest that rhombohedral graphene multilayers, which are believe to host the required ingredients, might offer an ideal setting for the study of exotic superconducting collective modes.

Title: Bose-Einstein condensate sub-wavelength confinement via superoscillations
Authors: Dusty R. Lindberg, Gerard McCaul, Peisong Peng, Lev Kaplan, Diyar Talbayev, Denys I. Bondar
Abstract: Optical lattices are essential tools in ultra-cold atomic physics. Here we demonstrate theoretically that sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved in these lattices through \textit{superoscillations}. This generic wave phenomenon occurs when a local region of the wave oscillates faster than any of the frequencies in its global Fourier decomposition. To illustrate how sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved via superoscillations, we consider a one-dimensional tri-chromatic optical potential confining a spinless Bose-Einstein Condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms. By numerical optimization of the relative phases and amplitudes of the optical trap's frequency components, it is possible to generate superoscillatory spatial regions. Such regions contain multiple density peaks at sub-wavelength spacing. This work establishes superoscillations as a viable route to sub-wavelength BEC confinement in blue-detuned optical lattices.

Title: Energetically Favored One-Dimensional Moiré Superstructure in the Pseudo-Square Lattice GdTe3
Authors: Jieun Yeon, Kihyun Lee, Myeongjin Jang, Tae Keun Yun, Jongho Park, Changyoung Kim, Kwanpyo Kim
Abstract: Moiré engineering in layered crystals has recently gained considerable attention due to the discovery of various structural and physical phenomena, including interfacial reconstruction, superconductivity, magnetism, and distinctive optoelectronic properties. Nevertheless, most explored moiré systems have been limited to hexagonal lattices, thereby constraining a comprehensive understanding and technological application of moiré phenomena in general layered crystals. Here, we investigate GdTe3, a pseudo-tetragonal layered crystal, as a platform to explore unconventional moiré phenomena. GdTe3 exhibits a slight in-plane distortion correlated with the direction of charge density wave formation. Through vertical stacking of layers with different distortions-induced via a controlled strain/release process-we realize energetically favorable one-dimensional (1D) moiré superstructures. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), including high-resolution scanning TEM imaging, dark-field TEM imaging, and sample tilting experiments, we systematically examine stacking variations across the 1D moiré structure. Additionally, electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals modulations in electronic properties associated with the 1D moiré structure. Our findings expand the scope of moiré systems beyond conventional hexagonal twistronics, enabling exploration of moiré phenomena in low-symmetry van der Waals crystals.

Title: Ultrafast Optical Evidence of Split Density Waves in Bilayer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Qi-Yi Wu, De-Yuan Hu, Chen Zhang, Mengwu Huo, Hao Liu, Bo Chen, Ying Zhou, Zhong-Tuo Fu, Chun-Hui Lv, Zi-Jie Xu, Hai-Long Deng, H. Y. Liu, Jun Liu, Yu-Xia Duan, Meng Wang, Jian-Qiao Meng
Abstract: Utilizing ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we investigated the quasiparticle and spin dynamics in single crystals of bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the presence of two distinct density wave (DW)-like orders, manifesting with onset temperatures at $\sim$140 K and $\sim$115 K. Through time-resolved ellipticity measurements, we identified the higher-temperature order at 140 K ($T_{\rm SDW}$) as the onset of a spin density wave (SDW) with associated electronic nematicity. In contrast, the lower-temperature order is attributed to a charge order. A key finding is the differential response of these orders to photoexcitation: the charge order is entirely suppressed at a pump fluence of approximately 40 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, whereas the SDW order persists up to 200 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, albeit with its characteristic temperature suppressed to approximately 70 K. These compelling experimental observations provide critical insights into the coexistence and manipulability of density wave phenomena in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, laying a foundation for future research into their optical control.

Title: Giant Shift Current in Electrically-Tunable Superlattice Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Nabil Atlam, Swati Chaudhary, Arpit Raj, Matthew Matzelle, Barun Ghosh, Gregory Fiete, Arun Bansil
Abstract: Recent introduction of superlattice potentials has opened new avenues for engineering tunable electronic band structures featuring topologically nontrivial moiré-like bands. Here we consider optoelectronic properties of Bernal-stacked graphene subjected to a superlattice potential either electrostatically or through lattice twisting to show that it exhibits a giant shift current response that is orders of magnitude larger than existing predictions in twisted mulitlayer systems. Effects of gate voltage and the strength and phase of the superlattice potential on the shift current are delineated systematically across various topological regimes. Our study gives insight into the nature of nonlinear responses of materials and how these responses could be optimized by tuning the superlattice potential.

Title: Planar Hall effects in $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,g,f,i$
Authors: Motohiko Ezawa
Abstract: The planar Hall effect is a phenomenon that the Hall conductivity emerges perpendicular to the electric field in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. We investigate the planar Hall effect in two-dimensional higher symmetric $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$, where those with $X=d,g,i$ are altermagnets. The $X$-wave magnet is characterized by the number $N_{X}$ of the nodes in the band structure, where $N_{X}=1,2,3,4,6$ corresponding to $X=p,d,f,g,i$. We demonstrate that the Hall conductivities are almost half quantized and well approximated by the formula $\sigma _{xy}=\pm (e^{2}/2h)$ sgn$\left( J\sin N_{X}\Phi \right) $, where $J$ is the coefficient of the coupling between the $X$-wave magnet and the electrons, and $\Phi $ is the direction of the applied magnetic field. Hence, the Hall conductivity has the periodicity with respect to $\Phi $, and the periodicity is equal to the number $N_{X}$ of the nodes. This property may be used to confirm that the target material is indeed an $X$-wave magnet. Furthermore, the sign of $J$ may be used as a bit for antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Entropy of a double quantum dot
Authors: David Kealhofer, Christoph Adam, Max J. Ruckriegel, Petar Tomić, Benedikt Kratochwil, Christian Reichl, Yigal Meir, Werner Wegscheider, Thomas Ihn, Klaus Ensslin
Abstract: We use charge sensing to detect entropy changes in a double quantum dot defined by electrostatic gating of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. This system can be tuned to be two separate systems, like two independent, artificial atoms, or a single coherent system, like a molecule. We study entropy changes in both regimes due to changes in the occupation of the system. First we recover the single-dot result for each dot, that the occupation of the dot by a single electron corresponds to an increase in the entropy of $k_{\mathrm{B}} \log 2$. Next we examine two different charge transitions in the "molecular" regime, and how it reveals itself in terms of the measured entropy. We also uncover a realization of Pauli blockade that clutters the entropy signal. By applying a rate equation model, we demonstrate the effect's nonequilibrium origins and exclude it from the analysis of the system's entropy. Understanding these experiments in this simplest coupled system enables the study of the entropy in other, more complicated coupled quantum systems, such as ones with topological or highly entangled ground states.

Title: Pressure in active matter
Authors: Guo Yu, Ruiyao Li, Fukang Li, Jiayu Zhang, Xiyue Li, Zequ Chen, Joscha Mecke, Yongxiang Gao
Abstract: In the last decade, the study of pressure in active matter has attracted growing attention due to its fundamental relevance to nonequilibrium statistical physics. Active matter systems are composed of particles that consume energy to sustain persistent motion, which are inherently far from equilibrium. These particles can exhibit complex behaviors, including motility-induced phase separation, density-dependent clustering, and anomalous stress distributions, motivating the introduction of active swim stress and swim pressure. Unlike in passive fluids, pressure in active systems emerges from momentum flux originated from swim force rather than equilibrium conservative interactions, offering a distinct perspective for understanding their mechanical response. Simple models of active Brownian particles (ABPs) have been employed in theoretical and simulation studies across both dilute and dense regimes, revealing that pressure is a state function and exhibits a nontrivial dependence on density. Together with nonequilibrium statistical concepts such as effective temperature and effective adhesion, pressure offers important insight for understanding behaviors in active matter such as sedimentation equilibrium and motility induced phase separation. Extensions of ABPs models beyond their simplest form have underscored the fragility of pressure-based equation of state, which can break down under factors such as density-dependent velocity, torque, complex boundary geometries and interactions. Building on these developments, this review provides a comprehensive survey of theoretical and experimental advances, with particular emphasis on the microscopic origins of active pressure and the mechanisms underlying the breakdown of the equation of state.

Title: Mechanical Force-Driven Charge Redistribution for Hydrogen Release at Ambient Conditions in Transition Metal-Intercalated Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Jongdeok Kim, Vikram Mahamiya, Massimiliano Di Ventra, Hoonkyung Lee
Abstract: Transition-metal (TM) atom-functionalized nanomaterials are promising candidates for hydrogen storage due to their ability to adsorb multiple hydrogen molecules through Kubas interactions. However, achieving efficient hydrogen desorption at ambient conditions remains a critical challenge for practical use. Here, we present a novel approach to modulate the desorption temperature of hydrogen in TM-intercalated bilayer graphene (BLG) using external mechanical forces. By employing first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and thermodynamic occupancy probability calculations, we demonstrate that adjusting the interlayer distance allows for precise control over the interaction energy of H2, thereby facilitating its desorption at ambient conditions. Complete hydrogen desorption occurs when the interlayer distance is reduced below 4.7 Å, 5.3 Å, and 5.1 Å for Sc-, Ti-, and V-intercalated BLG, respectively. Our findings suggest that external mechanical forces can effectively bring hydrogen occupancy to zero by minimizing charge transfer from the TM d-orbitals to H2 antibonding orbitals. Notably, while the total charge transferred from the TM atoms remains nearly constant at varying interlayer distances, its redistribution between the graphene layers and H2 fine-tunes the interaction strength. This approach can be extended to large interlayer distances, as supported by recent experiments on graphene oxide membranes [ACS Nano 12, 9309 (2018)]. Furthermore, recent experimental advances in noble gas and alkali metal intercalation in BLG highlight the potential of this approach to overcome the long-standing challenge of high desorption temperatures in TM-functionalized layered nanomaterials.

Title: Boron Clusters for Metal-Free Water Splitting
Authors: Masaya Fujioka, Haruhiko Morito, Melbert Jeem, Jeevan Kumar Padarti, Kazuki Morita, Taizo Shibuya, Masashi Tanaka, Yoshihiko Ihara, Shigeto Hirai
Abstract: Electron-deficient boron clusters are identified as a fundamentally new class of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, entirely free of transition metals. Selective sodium extraction from NaAlB14 and Na2B29 via high-pressure diffusion control introduces hole doping into B12 icosahedral frameworks, resulting in OER activity exceeding that of Co3O4 by more than an order of magnitude, and exceptional durability under alkaline conditions. B12 clusters are known for their superchaotropic character, which destabilizes hydrogen bonding in water. In this system, H2O, instead of OH-, preferentially adsorbs on the catalyst surface, suggesting a distinct OER pathway mediated by molecular water. This adsorption behavior contrasts with conventional transition-metal oxides and reflects the unique interfacial properties of the boron clusters. Density functional theory reveals unoccupied p orbitals and unique local electric fields at the cluster surface, both of which could promote the water activation. These findings suggest a paradigm shift in OER catalysis, in which the unique interaction between B12 clusters and water drives the reaction, replacing the conventional role of redox-active metals. Hole-doped boron clusters thus offer a promising platform for designing high-performance and durable water-splitting catalysts, opening new avenues for OER design beyond conventional transition-metal chemistry.

Title: Discovery and Synthesis of a Family of Boride Altermagnets
Authors: Zhen Zhang, Eranga H. Gamage, Genevieve Amobi, Subhadip Pradhan, Andrey Kutepov, Kirill D. Belashchenko, Yang Sun, Kirill Kovnir, Vladimir Antropov
Abstract: Borides are a rich material family. To push the boundaries of borides' properties and applications into broader fields, we have conducted systematic theoretical and experimental searches for synthesizable phases in ternary borides TM$_2$B$_2$ (T = 3d, M = 4d/5d transition metals). We find that TM$_2$B$_2$ in the FeMo$_2$B$_2$-type and CoW$_2$B$_2$-type structures form a large family of stable/metastable materials of 120 members. Among them, we identify 40 materials with stable magnetic solutions. Further, we discover 11 altermagnets in the FeMo$_2$B$_2$-type structure. So far, boride altermagnets are rare. In these altermagnets, T = Fe or Mn atoms are arranged in parallel T-chains with strong ferromagnetic intrachain couplings and antiferromagnetic interchain couplings. They simultaneously exhibit electronic band spin splitting, typical of ferromagnetism, and zero net magnetization, typical of antiferromagnetism. They also exhibit magnonic band chiral splitting. Both effects originate from the unique altermagnetic symmetries crucially constrained by the nonmagnetic atoms in the structure. Transport properties of relevance to spintronic applications, including the strain-induced spin-splitter effect and anomalous Hall effect, are predicted. An iodine-assisted synthesis method for TM$_2$B$_2$ is developed, using which 7 of the predicted low-energy phases are experimentally synthesized and characterized, including 4 altermagnets. This work expands the realm of borides by offering new opportunities for studying altermagnetism and altermagnons in borides. It also provides valuable insights into the discovery and design of altermagnets. By demonstrating that altermagnets can exist as families sharing a common motif, this work paves a feasible route for discovering altermagnets by elemental substitutions and high-throughput computations.

Title: Twist-angle tunable Josephson junctions in three-dimensional superconductors
Authors: Tenta Tani, Takuto Kawakami, Mikito Koshino
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the superconducting phase and perpendicular Josephson supercurrent in twisted three-dimensional (3D) superconductors, where two layered 3D materials are stacked with a relative twist. We formulate the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and develop a self-consistent method to calculate the superconducting order parameter and the resulting supercurrent. Applying this framework to a toy model with Fermi surfaces located near the Brillouin zone corners, we demonstrate a phase discontinuity at the twisted interface, indicating that a Josephson junction is formed purely by the twist. Our calculations reveal that the interface supports a finite critical current even when the Fermi surfaces of the two superconductors are completely separated, unlike in the case of a twisted normal-metal interface. We further show that the critical current can be effectively controlled by the twist angle, transitioning from a high-transparency regime at small angles to a low-transparency regime at larger angles.

Authors: Chaitanya Arya, Johannes Trautvetter, Jose M. Sojo-Gordillo, Yashpreet Kaur, Valentina Zannier, Fabio Beltram, Tommaso Albrigi, Alicia Ruiz-Caridad, Lucia Sorba, Riccardo Rurali, Ilaria Zardo
Abstract: Fine-tuning the functional properties of nanomaterials is crucial for technological applications. Superlattices, characterized by periodic repetitions of two or more materials in different dimensions, have emerged as a promising area of investigation. We present a study of the phonon interference effect on thermal transport in GaAs-GaP superlattice nanowires with sharp interfaces between the GaAs and GaP layers, as confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We performed thermal conductivity measurements using the so-called thermal bridge method on superlattice nanowires with a period varying from 4.8 to 23.3 nm. The measurements showed a minimum of the thermal conductivity as a function of superlattice period up to room temperature, that we interpreted as an indication of the crossover from coherent to incoherent thermal transport. Notably, this effect is not destroyed by surface boundary or by phonon-phonon scattering, as the crossover trend is also observed at room temperature. Our results were corroborated by both ab initio lattice dynamics and semiclassical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics calculations. These findings provide insights into the wave-like and particle-like transport of phonons in superlattice nanowires and demonstrate the potential for engineering thermal properties through precise control of the superlattice structure.

Abstract: The oxygen stoichiometry is an essential key to tune functional properties of advanced oxide materials and thus has motivated numerous studies of the oxygen off-stoichiometry diagram, with the aim to determine and control structural, electronic, ionic, electrochemical and optical properties, as well as thermodynamic quantities such as the oxygen storage capacity, among others. Here, a novel approach is developed, which allows to project a broad range of oxygen chemical potentials onto a single thin film sample with unprecedented control via electrochemical polarization. Therefore, a specifically designed electrochemical cell geometry is deployed, resulting in a well-defined, linear, 1D in-plane oxygen concentration gradient, independent of variations in the materials electrical resistivity, whose endpoints can be flexibly controlled via the external pO2 and applied overpotential. This allows for an unparalleled study of materials properties as a continuous function of the oxygen content using spatially resolved tools (spectroscopic, diffraction, microscopy, local electrical probes, etc.) and thereby greatly reduces experimental efforts while also avoiding sample-to-sample variability, multi-step treatments, sample evolution effects, etc. This work presents the proof-of-concept of in-plane oxygen gradients, based on spatially resolved ex/in situ and novel fixed-energy X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), X-ray diffraction, ellipsometry and electrical resistivity measurements in hyper-stoichiometric La2NiO4+{\delta} and sub-stoichiometric (La,Sr)FeO3-{\delta} thin films. It thereby demonstrates the readiness and wide applicability of this innovative approach, which can be highly relevant for fundamental as well as applied research.

Title: Laser-induced topological phases in monolayer amorphous carbon
Authors: Arnob Kumar Ghosh, Quentin Marsal, Annica M. Black-Schaffer
Abstract: Driving non-topological materials out of equilibrium using time-periodic perturbations, such as circularly-polarized laser light, is a compelling way to engineer topological phases. At the same time, topology has traditionally only been considered for crystalline materials. Here we propose an experimentally feasible way of driving monolayer amorphous carbon topological. We show that circularly polarized laser light induces both regular and anomalous edge modes at quasienergies $0$ and $\pm \pi$, respectively. We also obtain complete topological characterization using an energy- and space-resolved topological marker based on the spectral localizer. Additionally, by introducing atomic coordination defects in the amorphous carbon, we establish the importance of the local atomic structure in topological amorphous materials. Our work establishes amorphous systems, including carbon, as a versatile and abundant playground to engineer topological phases.

Title: Oxygen incorporation in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ thin films: surface activation and degradation
Authors: Alexander Stangl (1,2), Xavier Obradors (2), Anna Palau (2), Arnaud Badel (3), Teresa Puig (2) ((1) Univ.

Abstract: The oxygen off-stoichiometry plays a pivotal role for the physical properties of superconducting oxides. Yet, there is a lack of knowledge on the fundamental processes of oxygen incorporation and correlated phenomena during oxygen post annealing treatments. Here, we deployed electrical probes ($\rho(T)$ and electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) measurements) to gain a better understanding of the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in epitaxial YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) thin films. We identified a new indicator for the onset temperature of oxygen incorporation and report for the first time drastic kinetic deactivation in bare YBCO. We demonstrate that surface decoration using silver micro islands both catalytically activates oxygen incorporation and bypasses surface degradation processes. Our results suggest that the ORR in the studied YBCO samples is limited by a surface reaction. Additionally, weak XRD signatures of the formation of extended bulk defects were identified, which have to be considered in the designing of an optimal oxygenation treatment to obtain best performing superconducting YBCO.

Title: Interpreting Aqueous Two-Phase Extraction of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Highly Versatile Nonionic Polymers
Authors: Blazej Podlesny, Lukasz Czapura, Oussama Er-Riyahi, Karolina Z. Milowska, Dawid Janas
Abstract: The development of efficient separation methods is essential for the production of fine chemicals and materials. Among them, the aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) allows for the isolation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) of specific structures and other substances. However, this easy-to-use method, in which an analyte is partitioned between two phases, still demands a better understanding of its mechanism to make its application more effective. Herein, we demonstrate how various biphasic systems can be formed according to the nature of the phase-forming components. Moreover, by employing polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEPEG), previously unrecognized in this context, we reveal the versatility of nonionic polymers for ATPE, which can successfully act as phase-forming compounds, partitioning modulators, and dispersing agents. Interestingly, as proven by experiments and modelling, PEPEG exhibited chirality-sensitive preference toward SWCNTs, which can significantly facilitate the purification of SWCNTs using various approaches. Capitalizing on this finding, we report how the extraction environment may be tailored to promote the isolation of (8,3) SWCNTs and other chirality-enriched SWCNT fractions. The relationships noted, based on the examination of a model material (SWCNTs), provide substantial insight into the elusive mechanism of the ATPE purification approach, widely employed across a range of analytes, from cell organelles to nanostructures

Title: Colorization of Optically Transparent Surfactants to Track Their Movement in Biphasic Systems Used for Differentiation of Nanomaterials
Authors: Blazej Podlesny, Lukasz Czapura, Dawid Janas
Abstract: Aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) is a versatile method for the purification of numerous chemical compounds and materials, ranging from proteins and nucleic acids to cell organelles and various nanostructures. However, despite its widespread use, the underlying extraction mechanism remains unclear, which significantly reduces the utility of ATPE. Many types of surfactants are often added to biphasic systems to enhance the extraction of analytes between phases. Although their role in this process is crucial, it is not entirely understood. In this work, to fill this gap, we adapt and refine a nearly two-hundred-year-old chemical technique for the detection of bile salts in urine, referred to as Pettenkofer's test and monitor the partitioning of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by ATPE. This approach enabled us to tint the otherwise transparent bile salt surfactants to precisely track their distribution and concentration in the biphasic system, thereby unravelling the modus operandi of this popular purification technique.

Title: Anomalous Critical Behavior of Driven Disordered Systems Beyond the Overdamped Limit
Authors: Giuseppe Petrillo, Eduardo Jagla, Eugenio Lippiello, Alberto Rosso
Abstract: We investigate the role of relaxation mechanisms in the driven response of elastic disordered interfaces in finite dimensions, focusing on the interplay between dimensionality and interaction range. Through extensive numerical simulations, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes. In two-dimensional systems with long-range interactions, we observe a regime of coexistence between pinned and flowing states. In contrast, for one-dimensional interfaces with long-range elasticity, as well as for short-range interactions in both 1D and 2D, the coexistence regime is absent. Nevertheless, the avalanche statistics differ significantly from those of overdamped systems: the usual power-law distribution is replaced by a pronounced bump, associated with large, anomalous avalanches that expand ballistically. We interpret these events as failed synchronization attempts and suggest they could be detected in experimental systems.

Title: Resonantly enhanced polariton-mediated superconductivity in a doped transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer
Authors: Kenneth Choo, Olivier Bleu, Meera M. Parish, Jesper Levinsen
Abstract: We present a proposal for achieving light-induced superconductivity using exciton polaritons - hybrid light-matter particles of excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) and microcavity photons. In contrast to previous theories of polariton-mediated superconductivity, which typically require multiple semiconductor layers, we show that superconductivity can be induced within a single semiconductor monolayer with inverted conduction bands, such as in the tungsten-based transition metal dichalcogenides. The key ingredient is that we can resonantly excite exciton polaritons into bands that are different from those occupied by the doped electrons, thus avoiding any Pauli blocking effects. Crucially, we can exploit the trion fine structure (i.e., multiple exciton-electron bound states) and tune the electron-polariton interactions via Feshbach resonances. Our theory of polariton-mediated superconductivity includes the energy dependence of the polariton-mediated interactions between electrons, as well as the polariton-induced changes to the electron quasiparticles. We find that superconductivity at elevated temperatures is within reach of current experiments.

Title: Quasi-1D Electronic Metadevices with Enhanced Electrical Properties
Authors: Abdallah Abushawish, Ziwen Huang, Mohammad Samizadeh Nikoo
Abstract: Electronic metadevices leveraging sub-wavelength metallic features have shown great potential for high-frequency switching. Theoretical analysis based on a one-dimensional (1D) model indicates that reducing the size of subwavelength features can enhance electrical properties, such as contact resistance and switching cutoff frequency. Here, we report higher-than-expected contact resistance in electronic metadevices when the subwavelength feature size is aggressively downscaled. We attribute this effect to transverse currents in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) running parallel to the stripe width. We present the first experimental demonstration of a metadevice governed by a one-dimensional model, which we refer to as a quasi-1D electronic metadevice and show that it enables enhanced electrical performance. Our findings pave the way to design next generation electronic metadevice switches with applications in future telecommunication circuits.

Title: Switching of a closed mobile vacancy based memristor, whose specific resistance linearly depends on local vacancy concentration
Authors: Irina V. Boylo, Konstantin L. Metlov
Abstract: The linear (proportional to local vacancy concentration) term in specific resistance of the material does not directly contribute to the change of memristor's total resistance when the vacancies are redistributed inside while keeping their total number constant. But it still changes kinetics of the vacancy drift under the influence of a passing electric current. These changes are especially significant in the presence of metal-insulator phase transition in the memristor's material. In this paper, kinetic equation for local vacancy concentration is obtained, and exact solutions for its steady states are analyzed. It is shown that not only in the weakly nonlinear case (when the dependence of the specific resistance on the vacancy concentration can be neglected), but also in a strongly non-linear memristor with phase transition, its kinetics can be reduced to the classical exactly solvable Burgers equation.

Title: Ratchet effect and jamming in dense mixtures of active and passive colloids in narrow pores
Authors: Frantisek Slanina, Miroslav Kotrla
Abstract: Using the framework of generalized exclusion processes we study mixtures of passive and active particles interacting by steric repulsion. The particles move in a pore with periodically modulated aperture, which is modeled by a quasi-one-dimensional channel with periodic tooth-shaped profile. Internal driving of the active particles induces a ratchet current of these particles. In the current-density diagram, we observe three main regimes: of free flow; of thermally activated processes; of spinodal decomposition. When the density of particles is increased, we observe a transition to jammed state, where the ratchet current is substantially reduced. In time evolution, the transition to jammed state is seen as sudden drop of current at certain time. The probability distribution of these jamming times follows an exponential law. The average jamming time depends itself exponentially on the density of active particles. The coefficient in this exponential is nearly independent of the switching rate of the active particles as well as on the presence or absence of passive particles. Due to the interaction, the current of active particles imposes a drag on the passive particles. In the limit of both large systems and long times, the current of passive particles has always the same direction as the ratchet current of active particles. However, during the evolution of the system we observe very slow (logarithmic in time) approach to the asymptotic value, sometimes accompanied by current reversal, i.e. current of active and passive particles may go in opposite direction.

Title: URhGe -- Altermagnetic Ferromagnet
Authors: V.P.Mineev
Abstract: It is well known that the anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnetic and strongly paramagnetic metals in addition to electron skew scattering on impurities is determined by internal mechanism linked to the Berry curvature, a quantum-mechanical property of the electron states of a perfect crystal. Experimentally, however, it has been established that the Berry curvature does not play any role in the Hall resistance of the ferromagnet URhGe. URhGe is so called altermagnetic ferromagnet which crystal symmetry includes operation of time inversion only in combination with rotations and reflections. The explanation for strictly zero Berry curvature of electronic states in this material lies in the non-symmorphic symmetry of its crystal lattice.

Title: Hydrodynamic approximations for driven dense colloidal mixtures in narrow pores
Authors: Frantisek Slanina, Miroslav Kotrla
Abstract: The system of driven dense colloid mixtures is studied in one-, two- and three-dimensional geometries. We calculate the diffusion coefficients and mobilities for each particle type, including cross-terms, in a hydrodynamic limit, using a mean-field-type approximation. The set of non-linear diffusion equations are then solved. In one dimension, analytical results are possible. We show that in mixtures, the ``Brazil nut'' phenomenon, or depletion of larger particles by force of smaller ones, appears quite generically. We calculate the ratchet current and quantify the capability of sorting particles according to their size. We also indicate that the ``Brazil nut'' effect lies behind the possibility of perfect separation, where large and big particles travel in strictly opposite direction.

Title: Mid-infrared LEDs based on lattice-mismatched hybrid IV-VI/III-V heterojunctions
Authors: Jarod E. Meyer, Biridiana Rodriguez, Leland Nordin, Kunal Mukherjee
Abstract: Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can bridge the gap between narrow linewidth, expensive lasers and broadband, inefficient thermal globars for low-cost chemical sensing in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). However, the efficiency of III-V based mid-IR LEDs at room temperature is low, primarily limited by strong nonradiative Auger-Meitner recombination that is only partially overcome with complex quantum-engineered active regions. Here, we exploit the intrinsically low Auger Meitner recombination rates of the IV-VI semiconductors PbSe and PbSnSe, while leveraging the mature III-V platform through the fabrication of hybrid heterojunctions that mediate the ~8% lattice mismatch to GaAs. Electrically injected n-PbSe/p-GaAs LEDs emit at 3.8 um with output powers up to 400 uW under pulsed operation and a peak wall plug efficiency of 0.08% at room temperature, approaching the performance of commercial III-V LEDs at similar wavelengths. Incorporating 7% Sn extends the emission to 5 um in GeSe/PbSnSe/GaAs LEDs with output powers up to 45 uW. Notably, both devices operate despite threading dislocation densities on the order of 1e9/cm^2, underscoring the potential of hybrid IV-VI/III-V heterojunction architectures. We show that combining the complementary advantages of IV-VI and III-V semiconductors offers a simple and efficient mid IR optoelectronic platform for a rapidly expanding set of applications.

Title: Short-range and long-range correlations in driven dense colloidal mixtures in narrow pores
Authors: Frantisek Slanina, Miroslav Kotrla, Karel Netocny
Abstract: The system of driven dense colloid mixture in a tube with diameter comparable with particle size is modeled by a generalization of asymmetric simple exclusion (ASEP) model. The generalization goes in two directions: relaxing the exclusion constraint by allowing several (but few) particles on a site, and by considering two species of particles, which differ by size and transport coefficients. We calculate the nearest-neighbor correlations using a variant of Kirkwood approximation and show by comparison with numerical simulations that the approximation provides quite accurate results. However, for long-range correlations, we show that the Kirkwood approximation is useless, as it predicts exponential decay of the density-density correlation function with distance, while simulation data indicate that the decay is algebraic. For one-component system, we show that the decay is governed by a power law with universal exponent close to 2. In two-component system, the correlation function behaves in more complicated manner; its sign oscillates but the envelope decays again very slowly and the decay is compatible with power-law with exponent somewhat lower than 2. Therefore, our generalization of ASEP belongs to different universality class than the ensemble of generalized ASEP models which are mappable to zero-range processes.

Title: Altermagnetic spintronics
Authors: T. Jungwirth, J. Sinova, P. Wadley, D. Kriegner, H. Reichlova, F. Krizek, H. Ohno, L. Smejkal
Abstract: The research landscape of magnetism has been recently enriched by the discovery of altermagnetism. It is an unconventional phase of matter characterized by a d-wave (or higher even-parity-wave) collinear compensated spin ordering, which enables strongly spin-polarized currents in the absence of magnetization, and features fast spin dynamics. Simultaneously, on the applied magnetism front, spintronic memories based on conventional ferromagnets are currently turning from a niche to a mass produced integrated-circuit technology as they start to complement semiconductors on advanced-node microprocessor chips. Our review connects these two rapidly developing science and technology fields by discussing how the unique signatures of altermagnetism can impact the functionality and scalability of future spintronic devices. As a reference, we first briefly recall the merits and physical limitations of the present ferromagnetic spintronic technology, and of proof-of-concept spintronic devices based on conventional collinear antiferromagnets and non-collinear compensated magnets. The main part of the review then focuses on physical concepts of the altermagnetic spintronics, and its potential interplay with ferroelectricity or superconductivity. We conclude with an outlook on the nascent experimental research of altermagnetic spintronics, and on the role of relativistic phenomena.

Title: Discovery of a low-density filled-ice phase in nitrogen hydrate at high pressure
Authors: Selene Berni, Sophie Espert, Tomasz Poreba, Simone Di Cataldo, Richard Gaal, Gabriel Tobie, Erwan Le Menn, Thomas C. Hansen, Roberto Bini, Livia Eleonora Bove
Abstract: We map the high-pressure phase diagram of nitrogen hydrate up to 16 GPa at room temperature by combining neutron diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and crystal structure prediction. We reveal a rich sequence of structural transformations, from sI/sII clathrates to hexagonal (sH) and tetragonal (sT) phases, culminating in a previously unknown orthorhombic filled-ice structure above 1.8 GPa in the Pnma space group, which we designate as NH-V. This new phase cannot be indexed to any known ice frameworks - such as the high-pressure methane hydrates MH-III (Imma) or MH-IV (Pmcn) - and exhibits a density approximately 30% lower than that of stable ice VII, pointing to distinctive water-nitrogen interactions. Our results refine the understanding of nitrogen hydrate behavior under extreme conditions and demonstrate the propensity of nitrogen and water to form stable filled-ice structures up to 16 GPa, with important implications for planetary science.

Title: Efficient predecision scheme for Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation of long-range interacting lattice systems
Authors: Fabio Müller, Wolfhard Janke
Abstract: We propose a fast and general predecision scheme for Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation of $d$-dimensional long-range interacting lattice models. For potentials of the form $V(r)=r^{-d-\sigma}$, this reduces the computational complexity from $O\left(N^2\right)$ to $O\left(N^{2-\sigma/d}\right)$ for $\sigma < d$ and to $O\left(N \right)$ for $\sigma > d$, respectively. The algorithm is implemented and tested for several $\mathrm{O}(n)$ spin models ranging from the Ising over the XY to the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model. With the same random number sequence it produces exactly the same Markov chain as a simulation with explicit summation of all terms in the Hamiltonian. Due to its generality, its simplicity, and its reduced computational complexity it has the potential to find broad application and thus lead to a deeper understanding of the role of long-range interactions in the physics of lattice models, especially in nonequilibrium settings.

Title: Optical phonons as a testing ground for spin group symmetries

Abstract: Lattice vibrations are highly sensitive to crystal symmetries and their changes across phase transitions. The latter can modify irreducible (co)representations and corresponding infrared and Raman selection rules of phonons. This concept is established for relativistic magnetic point groups, simultaneously transforming spatial and spin coordinates. However, in altermagnets described by non-relativistic spin groups with disjunct symmetry operations for both vector spaces, the phonon selection rules have remained unexplored. Here, we present a detailed study of the infrared- and Raman-active modes in the collinear antiferromagnet and altermagnet candidate Co$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. Comparing to ab initio calculations accurately capturing the eigenfrequencies, we identify all expected phonon modes at room temperature and deduce their selection rules using both symmetry approaches. Importantly, we observe the change of selection rules upon antiferromagnetic ordering, agreeing with the relativistic symmetry approach, while the spin group formalism predicts no changes. Therefore, optical phonons can reveal the appropriate symmetry treatment.

Title: Directed Cycles as Higher-Order Units of Information Processing in Complex Networks
Authors: Hardik Rajpal, Paul Expert, Vaiva Vasiliauskaite
Abstract: Directed cycles form the fundamental motifs in natural, social and artificial networks, yet their distinct computational roles remain under-explored, particularly in the context of higher-order structure and function. In this work, we investigate how two types of directed cycles - feedforward and feedback - can act as higher-order structures to facilitate the flow and integration of information in sparse random networks, and how these roles depend on the environment of the cycles. Using information-theoretic measures, we show that network size, sparsity and relative directionality critically impact the information-processing capacities of directed cycles. In a network with no-preferred global direction, a feedforward cycle enables greater information flow and a feedback cycle allows for increased information integration. The relative direction of a feedforward cycle as well as the structural incoherence it induces, determines its capacity to generate higher-order behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate that introducing feedback loops into otherwise feedforward architectures increases the diversity of network activity patterns. These findings suggest that directed cycles serve as computational motifs with local information processing capabilities that depend on the structure they are embedded. Using directed cycles, we highlight the interdependence between higher-order structures and the higher-order order behaviour they can induce in the network dynamics.

Title: Self-propulsion via non-transitive phase coexistence in chemically active mixtures
Authors: Yicheng Qiang, Chengjie Luo, David Zwicker
Abstract: Phase separation drives the formation of biomolecular condensates in cells, which comprise many components and sometimes possess multiple phases. The equilibrium physics of phase separation is well understood, but many components in condensates undergo active reactions. We demonstrate that such reactions affect phase separation by altering the chemical potential balance and by introducing an osmotic pressure difference at interfaces. However, the system does not permit a pseudo-pressure balance, and bulk compositions depend on which phases are in contact. Moreover, phase coexistence is no longer transitive, which enables self-propelled phases and more complex dynamics.

Title: Dynamics of phase separation in non-local elastic networks
Authors: Oliver W. Paulin, Yicheng Qiang, David Zwicker
Abstract: Phase separation of a liquid mixture embedded within an elastic network is relevant to a wide range of natural and industrial systems, including biomolecular condensates interacting with the cytoskeleton, structural colouring in bird feathers, and gas bubbles forming within soft sediments. Recent experiments in synthetic polymer gels have demonstrated that when the size of phase-separated domains is comparable to the characteristic pore size of the network, a patterned phase with a well-defined length scale may emerge. Theoretical works based on an equilibrium approach have attributed this pattern formation to non-local elastic effects arising from heterogeneity of the underlying network. Here, we extend these ideas by developing a dynamic theory in which phase separation is coupled to non-local elasticity via the framework of large-deformation poroelasticity. We study our model via both linear stability analysis and numerical simulation, identifying the parameter space in which phase separation occurs, and investigating the impact of different elasticity models. We find that although local elasticity can inhibit phase separation and affect domain count, it is unable to completely suppress coarsening. In contrast, non-local elasticity arrests coarsening to form patterned domains with a well-defined length scale that decreases with increasing stiffness. Our modelling framework thus paves the way for quantitative comparisons between simulations and experiments, for example by considering a strain-stiffening network rheology.

Title: Learning complexity of many-body quantum sign structures through the lens of Boolean Fourier analysis
Authors: Ilya Schurov, Anna Kravchenko, Mikhail I. Katsnelson, Andrey A. Bagrov, Tom Westerhout
Abstract: We study sign structures of the ground states of spin-$1/2$ magnetic systems using the methods of Boolean Fourier analysis. Previously it was shown that the sign structures of frustrated systems are of complex nature: specifically, neural networks of popular architectures lack the generalization ability necessary to effectively reconstruct sign structures in supervised learning settings. This is believed to be an obstacle for applications of neural quantum states to frustrated systems. In the present work, we develop an alternative language for the analysis of sign structures based on representing them as polynomial functions defined on the Boolean hypercube - an approach called Boolean Fourier analysis. We discuss the relations between the properties of the Boolean Fourier series and the learning complexity of sign structures, and demonstrate that such polynomials can potentially serve as variational ansätze for the complex sign structures that dramatically outperform neural networks in terms of generalization ability. While ansätze of this type cannot yet be directly used in the context of variational optimization, they indicate that the complexity of sign structures is not an insurmountable curse, and can potentially be learned with better designed NQS architectures. Finally, we show how augmenting data with Boolean functions can aid sign prediction by neural networks.

Title: Emergent Hydrodynamics in an Exclusion Process with Long-Range Interactions
Authors: Ali Zahra, Jerome Dubail, Gunter M. Schütz
Abstract: We study the symmetric Dyson exclusion process (SDEP) - a lattice gas with exclusion and long-range, Coulomb-type interactions that emerge both as the maximal-activity limit of the symmetric exclusion process and as a discrete version of Dyson's Brownian motion on the unitary group. Exploiting an exact ground-state (Doob) transform, we map the stochastic generator of the SDEP onto the spin-$1/2$ XX quantum chain, which in turn admits a free-fermion representation. At macroscopic scales we conjecture that the SDEP displays ballistic (Eulerian) scaling and non-local hydrodynamics governed by the equation $\partial_t \rho+\partial_x j[\rho]=0$ with $j[\rho]=(1/\pi)\sin(\pi\rho(x,t))\sinh(\pi\mathcal{H}\rho(x,t))$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is the Hilbert transform, making the current a genuinely non-local functional of the density. This non-local one-field description is equivalent to a local two-field "complex Hopf" system for finite particle density. Closed evolution formulas allow us to solve the melting of single and double block initial states, producing limit shapes and arctic curves that agree with large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The model thus offers a tractable example of emergent non-local hydrodynamics driven by long-range interactions.

Title: Doping Evolution of Nodal Electron Dynamics in Trilayer Cuprate Superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+δ}$ Revealed by Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy

J. Zhou
Abstract: The doping evolution of the nodal electron dynamics in the trilayer cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi2223) is investigated using high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Bi2223 single crystals with different doping levels are prepared by controlled annealing which cover the underdoped, optimally-doped and overdoped regions. The electronic phase diagram of Bi2223 is established which describes the T$_\mathrm{c}$ dependence on the sample doping level. The doping dependence of the nodal Fermi momentum for the outer (OP) and inner (IP) CuO$_2$ planes is determined. Charge distribution imbalance between the OP and IP CuO$_2$ planes is quantified, showing enhanced disparity with increasing doping. Nodal band dispersions demonstrate a prominent kink at $\sim$94$\,$meV in the IP band, attributed to the unique Cu coordination in the IP plane, while a weaker $\sim$60$\,$meV kink is observed in the OP band. The nodal Fermi velocity of both OP and IP bands is nearly constant at $\sim$1.62$\,$eVÅ independent of doping. These results provide important information to understand the origin of high T$_\mathrm{c}$ and superconductivity mechanism in high temperature cuprate superconductors.

Title: Spin-chirality-dependent modulation of topological gap, Chern number, and valley-polarization in monolayer Kagome materials
Authors: Wenzhe Zhou, Guibo Zheng, Yating Li, Zhenzhen Wan, Aolin Li, Fangping Ouyang
Abstract: Kagome materials exhibit unique electronic properties, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The control of Chern numbers is critical for quantum device manipulation, but existing research has mainly focused on collinear magnetization while neglecting chiral spin textures. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling of monolayer Cr3Se4, this study reveals spin chirality-dependent control of topological gaps, Chern numbers, and valley polarization in kagome materials. The results demonstrate that the azimuthal angle has no observable effect. For collinear magnetization, the topological bandgap decreases as the spin orientation approaches the in-plane direction. In the breathing Kagome lattice, the degeneracy between K and K' valleys is lifted, and increasing the polar angle induces successive closing and reopening of the valleys. For chiral spin textures, increasing polar angle enlarges the bandgap when chirality \k{appa} = 1, while reducing it when \k{appa} = -1. Moreover, spin chirality enables the quantum anomalous Hall state without spin-orbit coupling. Structural asymmetry and spin chirality effectively modulate the bandgap, Chern number, and valley polarization. These findings provide strategies for controlling topological states and advancing applications in quantum devices and valleytronic systems.

Title: Binary Mixtures in Linear Convection Arrays
Authors: Pulak Kumar Ghosh, Yuxin Zhou, Yunyun Li, Fabio Marchesoni, Franco Nori
Abstract: We numerically investigated the dynamics of a mixture of finite-size active and passive particles in a linear array of convection rolls. The interplay of advection and steric interactions produces a number of interesting effects, like the stirring of a passive colloidal fluid by a small fraction of slow active particles, or the separation of the mixture active and passive colloidal fractions by increasing the motility of the active one, which eventually clusters in stagnation areas along the array walls. These mechanisms are quantitatively characterized by studying the dependence of the diffusion constants of the active and passive particles on the parameters of the active mixture fraction.

Title: Strain-driven feedback tunes memory and relaxation in a Mott insulator far from equilibrium

Abstract: Memory effects in metal-insulator transitions in quantum materials reveal complex physics and potential for novel technologies mimicking biological neural systems. Nonetheless, understanding of memory and nonlinearity in non-equilibrium transitions remains elusive as they can involve timescales from femtoseconds to microseconds. In this study, we extend time-resolved x-ray Bragg diffraction to the necessary high dynamic range of timescales to fully trace the pathways of far-from-equilibrium photoexcited transitions in epitaxial films of V2O3, a technologically promising prototypical Mott insulator. We find a 105 times adjustment in relaxation time: the memory of spatial and energy heterogeneity during transition causes a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts shaped relaxation lingering over a hundred microseconds versus nanoseconds. The dramatic slowdown in the light-driven highly correlated system accompanies heterogeneous excitation barriers, as in neural systems.

Title: Active Particle Diffusion in Convection Roll Arrays
Authors: Pulak Kumar Ghosh, Fabio Marchesoni, Yunyun Li, Franco Nori
Abstract: We numerically investigated the Brownian motion of active Janus particles in a linear array of planar counter-rotating convection rolls at high Péclet numbers. Similarly to passive particles, active microswimmers exhibit advection enhanced diffusion, but only for self-propulsion speeds up to a critical value. The diffusion of faster Janus particles is governed by advection along the array's edges, whereby distinct diffusion regimes are observed and characterized. Contrary to passive particles, the relevant spatial distributions of active Janus particles are inhomogeneous. These peculiar properties of active matter are related to the combined action of noise and self-propulsion in a confined geometry and hold regardless of the actual flow boundary conditions.

Title: 2D bilayer electron-hole superfluidity with unequal and anisotropic masses
Authors: Jihang Zhu, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We investigate the stability of electron-hole superfluidity in two-dimensional bilayers with unequal and anisotropic effective masses. Using a zero-temperature, self-consistent Hartree-Fock approach, we study two experimentally relevant deviations from the ideal equal-mass isotropic case: (i) isotropic but unequal conduction and valence band masses ($m_c^* \neq m_v^*$), and (ii) equal average masses with orthogonal in-plane anisotropies $(m_{c,x}^*, m^*_{c,y}) = (m_1^*, m_2^*)$ and $(m^*_{v,x}, m^*_{v,y}) = (m_2^*, m_1^*)$. For both scenarios, we compute the order parameter and analyze the BEC-BCS crossover as a function of layer separation and mass ratio. We find that both mass imbalance and mass anisotropy reduce the pairing strength and suppress the inferred critical temperature $T_c$ by breaking perfect Fermi surface nesting, and shift the BEC-BCS crossover. Despite these effects, superfluidity remains robust across the full range of densities and interlayer separations considered, with no transition to an unpaired plasma state in the absence of screening. Our results provide a baseline for understanding the interplay of mass mismatch and anisotropy in current and emerging bilayer platforms, including van der Waals heterostructures and anisotropic two-dimensional semiconductors. Our work also establishes that Fermi surface nesting is not a key ingredient for the bilayer superfluidity, which is always the ground state for all electron-hole bilayers although the resultant $T_c$ depends on the parameter details and may very well be unmeasurably low for large interlayer separations.

Title: Solvable Models of Heat Transport in Quantum Mechanics
Authors: R Loganayagam, Prithvi Narayan, Swathi T S
Abstract: We investigate solvable models of heat transport between a pair of quantum mechanical systems initialized at two different temperatures. At time $t=0$, a weak interaction is switched on between the systems, and we study the resulting energy transport. Focusing on the heat current as the primary observable, we analyze both the transient dynamics and the long-time behavior of the system. We demonstrate that simple toy models - including Random Matrix Theory like models ({\it RMT models}) and Schwarzian like models ({\it conformal models}) - can capture many generic features of heat transport, such as transient current peaks and the emergence of non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). For these models, we derive a variety of exact results characterizing the short time transients, long time approach to NESS and thermal conductivity. Finally, we show how these features appear in a more realistic solvable model, the Double-Scaled SYK (DSSYK) model. We demonstrate that the DSSYK model interpolates between the seemingly distinct toy models discussed earlier, with the toy models in turn providing a useful lens through which to understand the rich features of DSSYK.

Title: A Promise for the JWST era: Massive black holes directly collapsed from wave dark matter haloes, and Star formation in and around their accretion flows
Authors: Xiaobo Dong, Yongda Zhu, Marcia Rieke, George Rieke, Xinyu Li, Peter Behroozi, Haixia Ma, Runyu Meng, Zhiying Mao, Zhe Sun
Abstract: There are several puzzling phenomena from recent JWST observations, which seem to push the standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmology over the edge. All those puzzles can be understood in a coherent way if we assume that first massive black holes (MBHs, the "heavy eggs") formed by directly collapsing from wave CDM haloes, which can be even earlier than the formation of first galaxies (the "chickens"). We elucidate two false obstacles that have been believed to prevent wave CDM haloes from collapsing into black holes (namely "maximum stable mass" and "bosenova") and point out that general-relativistic instabilities (e.g., the non-axisymmetric instability numerically found in spinning scalar-field boson stars) could serve as the concrete mechanisms for direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) born from wave dark matter. Once the MBHs formed, star formation bursts in and around the accretion flows, characteristic of a special mode in compact regions of high gravitational accelerations.

Title: Certifying Quantum States with Uniform Measurements
Authors: Liang Mao, Yifei Wang, Yingfei Gu, Chengshu Li
Abstract: Qubit-resolved operations and measurements are required for most current quantum information processing schemes. However, these operations can be experimentally costly due to the need for local addressing, demanding significant classical control. A more resource-efficient alternative to extract information is uniform measurement, where a site-independent rotation of qubits is performed before measuring in the computational basis. This operation can be performed in parallel, or globally, in atom- and ion-based platforms, reducing resource cost and increasing fidelity. In this work, we initiate the exploration of the utility of this operation in quantum information processing. In particular, we demonstrate that uniform measurements can certify certain graph states, a family of highly entangled and broadly useful quantum states. We provide a sample-efficient certification algorithm with a proved performance guarantee, together with an experimental scheme based on analog-mode Rydberg atom arrays. Uniform measurements, therefore, allow direct and efficient characterization of quantum states on quantum platforms in a hitherto unexplored manner.

Title: Entropy Measures for Transition Matrices in Random Systems
Authors: Zhaohui Chen, Rene Meyer, Zhuo-Yu Xian
Abstract: A transition matrix can be constructed through the partial contraction of two given quantum states. We analyze and compare four different definitions of entropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD entropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each entropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB entropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement between the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix. Combining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent non-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged, whereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further apply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several ensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in $PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases considered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror the behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in contrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can be unbounded or fails to scale with system size.

Title: Oscillating bound states in waveguide-QED system with two giant atoms
Authors: F. J. Lü, W. Z. Jia
Abstract: We study the bound states in the continuum (BIC) in a system of two identical two-level giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. By deriving general dark-state conditions, we clarify how coupling configurations and atomic parameters influence decay suppression. Through analysis of the long-time dynamical behaviors of atoms and bound photons, we carry out a detailed classification of bound states and explore the connections between these dynamical behaviors and the system's intrinsic light-matter interactions. The system supports static bound states with persistent atomic excitations, and oscillating bound states with periodic atom-photon or atom-atom excitation exchange. Under certain conditions, oscillating bound states can contain more harmonic components owing to the emergence of additional quasi-dark modes, rendering them promising platforms for high-capacity quantum information processing. These findings advance the understanding of BIC in waveguide quantum electrodynamics with multiple giant atoms and reveal their prospective applications in quantum technologies.

Title: Edge states in square lattice media and their deformations
Authors: Jonah Chaban, Jeremy L. Marzuola, Michael I. Weinstein
Abstract: Edge states are time-harmonic solutions of conservative wave systems which are plane wave-like parallel to and localized transverse to an interface between two bulk media. We study a class of 2D edge Hamiltonians modeling a medium which slowly interpolates between periodic bulk media via a domain wall across a "rational" line defect. We consider the cases of (1) periodic bulk media having the symmetries of a square lattice, and (2) linear deformations of such media. Our bulk Hamiltonians break time-reversal symmetry due to perturbation by a magnetic term, which opens a band gap about the band structure degeneracies of the unperturbed bulk Hamiltonian. In case (1), these are quadratic band degeneracies; in case (2), they are pairs of conical degeneracies. We demonstrate that this band gap is traversed by two distinct edge state curves, consistent with the bulk-edge correspondence principle of topological physics. Blow-ups of these curves near the bulk band degeneracies are described by effective (homogenized) edge Hamiltonians derived via multiple-scale analysis which control the bifurcation of edge states. In case (1), the bifurcation is governed by a matrix Schrödinger operator; in case (2), it is governed by a pair of Dirac operators. We present analytical results and numerical simulations for both the full 2D edge Hamiltonian spectral problem and the spectra of effective edge Hamiltonians.

Title: Efficient computation of average subsystem Bures distance in transverse field Ising chain
Authors: Zhouhao Guo, M. A. Rajabpour, Jiaju Zhang
Abstract: The average subsystem trace distance has been proposed as an indicator of quantum many-body chaos and integrability. In integrable systems, evaluating the trace distance faces two challenges: the computational cost for large systems and ambiguities in defining and ordering eigenstates. In this paper, we calculate the average subsystem Bures distance in the spin-1/2 transverse-field Ising chain. We develop an efficient algorithm to evaluate the Bures distance between two Gaussian states, which allows us to access larger system sizes. To address the degeneracy issue, we consider simultaneous eigenstates of all local conserved charges and use these charges to systematically order degenerate states. The results align with the conjectured linear increase with subsystem size. We demonstrate that the distinct scaling behaviors of the average subsystem trace and Bures distances in chaotic versus integrable systems stem from discontinuities of local conserved charges across the spectrum in integrable systems. Additionally, we investigate the average subsystem distances between random pure Gaussian states but do not observe a linear increase.

Title: A Pseudo-Fermion Propagator Approach to the Fermion Sign Problem
Authors: Yunuo Xiong, Hongwei Xiong
Abstract: In this work, within the framework of path integral Monte Carlo, we construct a pseudo-fermion propagator by replacing the original fermionic determinant with its absolute value. This modified propagator defines an auxiliary system free from the fermion sign problem, enabling efficient simulations of fermionic systems. We found that by shifting the pseudo-fermion energy based on the energy of a non-interacting fermion system, we can efficiently and reliably infer the energy of fermionic systems in various situations, from strong quantum degeneracy to weak quantum degeneracy. We have performed first-principles simulations of quantum dots confined in a two-dimensional harmonic potential and found excellent agreement with benchmark results provided by other established methods. We believe that this pseudo-fermion propagator framework opens up new possibilities for first-principles simulations of fermionic systems.

Title: Energetics-based model for a diffusiophoretic motion of a deformable droplet
Authors: Hiroyuki Kitahata, Yuki Koyano, Yasuaki Kobayashi, Masaharu Nagayama
Abstract: We construct a mathematical model for a diffusiophoretic motion of a deformable droplet, which is floating at a liquid surface and is driven by the surface tension gradient originating from the surface concentration field of the chemicals that are emitted from the droplet. We define the free energy of the system by including the surface and line energies. From the calculation of the functional of the free energy, we obtain a mathematical model for the diffusiophoretic motion with deformation. By only considering the deformation of the second mode, we explicitly derived the time-evolution equations for the translational motion and the elliptic deformation. We found three stable states: an immobile circular droplet, an immobile elliptically deformed droplet, and a moving droplet with the elliptic deformation in which the minor axis meets the motion direction, and discussed the transition between these three stable states.

Title: Stabilizing boundary time crystals through Non-markovian dynamics
Authors: Bandita Das, Rahul Ghosh, Victor Mukherjee
Abstract: We study Boundary time crystals (BTCs) in the presence of non-Markovian dynamics. In contrast to BTCs observed in earlier works in the Markovian regime, we show that non-Markovian dynamics can be highly beneficial for stabilizing BTCs over a wide range of parameter values, even in the presence of intermediate rates of dissipation. We analyze the effect of non-Markovian dynamics on BTCs using quantum Fisher information, order parameter, a measure of non-Markovianity, and a dynamical phase diagram, all of which show complex behaviours with changing non-Markovianity parameters. Our studies can pave the way for stabilizing time crystals in dissipative systems, as well as lead to studies on varied dissipative dynamics on time translational symmetry breaking.

Authors: Guillaume Costa, Giorgio Krstulovic, Sergey Nazarenko
Abstract: We study the stability of steady-state solutions of the Wave-Kinetic Equations for acoustic waves. Combining theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we characterise the time evolution of small isotropic perturbations for both 2D and 3D equilibrium Rayleigh-Jeans and non-equilibrium Kolmogorov-Zakharov solutions. In particular, we show that the stability of these solutions is ensured by different mechanisms.

Title: Time delay as the origin of oscillations in anodic Si electrodissolution
Authors: Yukiteru Murakami, Katharina Krischer
Abstract: Silicon is the most important semiconductor electrode with applications in photoelectrochemistry and sensor technology. Yet its electrochemistry exhibits many poorly understood phenomena, including oscillations during the anodic dissolution of silicon electrodes. In this article, we present a mathematical model based on physicochemical steps that captures these oscillations and enables a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanism. The model describes the formation and dissolution of an oxide layer, and determines the oxide composition and the electrostatic potential in the direction perpendicular to the electrode. Oscillations occur if the following conditions are fulfilled: 1. The etching speed increases with defects in the oxide layer 2. The number of defects decreases with increasing electric field strength at the Si-oxide interface. 3. There is a sufficient time delay between the production and the etching of the oxide. Numerical simulations reproduce experimental results well, including the dependence of the oscillation amplitude and period on the potential, as well as the hysteresis behavior observed in cyclic voltammetry. Based on these results, we derive a simplified time-delay differential equation model. Using linear stability analysis, we confirm the essential role of the time delay for the oscillatory oxide-layer dynamics. The basic steps of the model are general and in line with the point defect model for growth and dissolution of passive films on metal electrodes. Therefore, it is likely applicable to a variety of oscillating anodic metal or semiconductor dissolution reactions.

Title: Tensor-network formulation of QCD in the strong-coupling expansion
Authors: Thomas Samberger, Jacques Bloch, Robert Lohmayer, Tilo Wettig
Abstract: We present a tensor-network formulation for the strong-coupling expansion of QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential, for arbitrary number of dimensions, colors, and flavors. We integrate out the gauge and quark degrees of freedom and rewrite the partition function as the complete trace of a tensor network. This network consists of local tensors that contain a numerical and a Grassmann part. We truncate the initial tensor at a fixed order in the inverse coupling $\beta$ and compute analytical results for the partition function, the free energy, and the chiral condensate on a $2\times2$ lattice up to order $\beta^4$. In a follow-up paper we will introduce an enhanced tensor-network method, order-separated GHOTRG, to explicitly compute the expansion coefficients of the partition function for larger lattices.

Title: Beam Cross Sections Create Mixtures: Improving Feature Localization in Secondary Electron Imaging
Authors: Vaibhav Choudhary, Akshay Agarwal, Vivek K Goyal
Abstract: Secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy and helium ion microscopy (HIM), use electrons emitted by a sample in response to a focused beam of charged particles incident at a grid of raster scan positions. Spot size -- the diameter of the incident beam's spatial profile -- is one of the limiting factors for resolution, along with various sources of noise in the SE signal. The effect of the beam spatial profile is commonly understood as convolutional. We show that under a simple and plausible physical abstraction for the beam, though convolution describes the mean of the SE counts, the full distribution of SE counts is a mixture. We demonstrate that this more detailed modeling can enable resolution improvements over conventional estimators through a stylized application in semiconductor inspection of localizing the edge in a two-valued sample. We derive Fisher information about edge location in conventional and time-resolved measurements (TRM) and also derive the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) from the latter. Empirically, the MLE computed from TRM is approximately efficient except at very low beam diameter, so Fisher information comparisons are predictive of performance and can be used to optimize the beam diameter relative to the raster scan spacing. Monte Carlo simulations show that the MLE gives a 5-fold reduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) of edge localization as compared to conventional interpolation-based estimation. Applied to three real HIM datasets, the average RMSE reduction factor is 5.4.

Title: Scaling of Disorder Operator and Entanglement Entropy at Easy-Plane Deconfined Quantum Criticalities
Authors: Jiarui Zhao, Zi Yang Meng, Yan-Cheng Wang, Nvsen Ma
Abstract: We systematically investigate the scaling behaviors of the disorder operator and the entanglement entropy (EE) of the easy-plane JQ (EPJQ) model at its transitions between the antiferromagnetic XY ordered phase (AFXY) and the valence bond solid (VBS) phase. We find there exists a tiny yet finite value of the order parameters at the AFXY-VBS phase transition points of the EPJQ model, and the finite order parameter is strengthened as anisotropy $\Delta$ varies from the Heisenberg limit ($\Delta=1$) to the easy-plane limit ($\Delta=0$). This observation provides evidence that the Néel-VBS transition in the JQ model setting evolves from weak to prominent first-order transition as the system becomes anisotropic. Furthermore, both EE and disorder operator with smooth boundary cut exhibit anomalous scaling behavior at the transition points, resembling the scaling inside the Goldstone mode (AFXY) phase, and the anomalous scaling becomes strengthened as the transition becomes more first order. In particular, for $\Delta \le 0.3$, the obtained log-coefficients converge to 0.5 which is the same as the contribution from one Goldstone mode in the Néel phase. For $\Delta > 0.3$, the log-coefficients are smaller and our findings might suffer from strong finite-size effects due to the fact that the remaining Néel order here is quite tiny.

Title: The quantum Newman-Moore model in a longitudinal field
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.

Title: Enhanced metrology based on flipping trajectory of cold Rydberg gases

Abstract: The dynamical trajectory of a dissipative Rydberg many-body system could be flipped under a microwave field driving, displaying an enhanced sensitivity. This is because the intersection of the folded hysteresis trajectories exhibits a sharp peak near the phase transition, amplifying the response to small changes in the microwave field. Here, we demonstrate an experiment of enhanced metrology through flipping the hysteresis trajectory in a cold atomic system, displaying an approach to improve sensitivity near the gap-closing points. By measuring the intersection points of hysteresis trajectories versus Rabi frequency of the microwave field, we quantify the equivalent sensitivity to be 1.6(5) nV cm-1 Hz-1/2. The measurement is also dependent on the interaction time, optical depth and principal quantum number since the long-range interaction between Rydberg atoms could dramatically change the shape of hysteresis trajectories. The reported results suggest that flipping trajectory features in cold Rydberg many-body systems could advance sensing and metrology applications.

Title: Towards chemical accuracy for chemi- and physisorption with an efficient density functional
Authors: Manish Kothakonda (1), Ruiqi Zhang (1), Jinliang Ning (1), James Furness (1), Abhirup Patra (2), Qing Zhao (3), Jianwei Sun (1) ((1) Physics and Engineering Physics, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA (2) Delaware Energy Institute, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA (3) Department of Chemical Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA)
Abstract: Understanding molecular adsorption on surfaces underpins many problems in chemistry and materials science. Accurately and efficiently describing the adsorption has been a challenging task for first-principles methods as the process can involve both short-range chemical bond formations and long-range physical interactions, e.g., the van der Waals (vdW) interaction. Density functional theory presents an appealing choice for modeling adsorption reactions, though calculations with many exchange correlation density functional approximations struggle to accurately describe both chemical and physical molecular adsorptions. Here, we propose an efficient density functional approximation that is accurate for both chemical and physical adsorption by concurrently optimizing its semilocal component and the long-range vdW correction against the prototypical adsorption CO/Pt(111) and Ar$_2$ binding energy curve. The resulting functional opens the door to accurate and efficient modeling of general molecular adsorption.

Title: Density Matrix Renormalization Group Study of Domain Wall Qubits
Authors: Guanxiong Qu, Ji Zou, Daniel Loss, Tomoki Hirosawa
Abstract: Nanoscale topological spin textures in magnetic systems are emerging as promising candidates for scalable quantum architectures. Despite their potential as qubits, previous studies have been limited to semiclassical approaches, leaving a critical gap: the lack of a fully quantum demonstration. Here, we address this challenge by employing the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to establish domain wall (DW) qubits in coupled quantum spin-1/2 chains. We calculate the ground-state energies and excitation gaps of the system and find that DWs with opposite chiralities form a well-defined low-energy sector, distinctly isolated from higher excited states in the presence of anisotropies. This renders the chirality states suitable for encoding quantum information, serving as robust qubits. Interestingly, when a magnetic field is applied, we observe tunneling between quantum DW states with opposite chiralities. Through quantum simulations, we construct an effective qubit Hamiltonian that exhibits strongly anisotropic $g$-factors, offering a way to implement single-qubit gates. Furthermore, we obtain an effective interacting Hamiltonian for two mobile DWs in coupled quantum spin chains from DMRG simulations, enabling the implementation of two-qubit this http URL-qubit and two-qubit gates are also demonstrated in real-time simulations using the time-dependent variational principle. Our work represents a critical step from semiclassical constructions to a fully quantum demonstration of the potential of DW textures for scalable quantum computing, establishing a solid foundation for future quantum architectures based on topological magnetic textures.

Title: Analytic bulk-edge connection in circular-symmetric models
Authors: Klaus Ziegler
Abstract: We propose a systematic analysis of the eigenfunctions of two-band systems in two dimensions with a circular edge. Our approach is based on an analytic continuation of the wavenumber, which yields a mapping from the bulk modes to the edge modes. Phase relations of the eigenfunctions are described by their mapping onto a three-dimensional field of unit vectors. This mapping is studied in detail for a two-band Laplacian model and a Dirac model. The direction of the unit vector identifies the phase relation of the eigenfunctions and enables us to distinguish between the upper band, the lower band and the edge spectrum. Bulk and edge modes are spectrally separated, which results in two transitions from delocalized bulk modes to localized edge modes. These transitions are accompanied by transitions of the phase relations. Our analytic approach is compared with the topological bulk-edge correspondence, which is based on the Chern number of the bulk.

Title: Improving noisy free-energy measurements by adding more noise
Authors: Stephen Whitelam
Abstract: Estimating free-energy differences using nonequilibrium work relations, such as the Jarzynski equality, is hindered by poor convergence when work fluctuations are large. For systems governed by overdamped Langevin dynamics, we propose the counterintuitive approach of adding noise in order to increase the precision of such calculations. By introducing additional stochastic fluctuations to the system and rescaling its potential energy, we leave the thermodynamics of the system unchanged while increasing its relaxation rate. For a given time-dependent protocol this modification reduces dissipated work, leading to more accurate free-energy estimates. We demonstrate this principle using computer simulations applied to two model systems. However, the regime of applicability of this strategy is likely limited, because it requires control of the system's potential energy in a way that is feasible in only a few experimental settings.

Title: Untwisted and Twisted Rényi Negativities: Toward a Rényi Proxy for Logarithmic Negativity in Fermionic Systems
Authors: Fo-Hong Wang, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum entanglement for pure states, but for large-scale many-body systems, Rényi entanglement entropy is much more computationally accessible. For mixed states, logarithmic negativity (LN) serves as a widely used entanglement measure, but its direct computation is often intractable, leaving Rényi negativity (RN) as the practical alternative. In fermionic systems, RN is further classified into untwisted and twisted types, depending on the definition of the fermionic partial transpose. However, which of these serves as the true Rényi proxy for LN has remained unclear -- until now. In this work, we address this question by developing a robust quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to compute both untwisted and twisted RNs, focusing on the rank-4 twisted RN, where non-trivial behavior emerges. We identify and overcome two major challenges: the singularity of the Green's function matrix and the exponentially large variance of RN estimators. Our method is demonstrated in the Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model, revealing critical distinctions between untwisted and twisted RNs, as well as between rank-2 and high-rank RNs. Remarkably, we find that the twisted Rényi negativity ratio (RNR) adheres to the area law and decreases monotonically with temperature, in contrast to the untwisted RNR but consistent with prior studies of bosonic systems. This study not only establishes the twisted RNR as a more pertinent Rényi proxy for LN in fermionic systems but also provides comprehensive technical details for the stable and efficient computation of high-rank RNs. Our work lays the foundation for future studies of mixed-state entanglement in large-scale fermionic many-body systems.

Title: Spin models from nonlinear cellular automata
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Luke Causer, Jamie F. Mair, Stephen Powell, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We study classical and quantum spin models derived from one-dimensional cellular automata (CA) with nonlinear update rules, focusing on rules 30, 54 and 201. We argue that the classical models, defined such that their ground states correspond to allowed trajectories of the CA, are frustrated and can be described in terms of local defect variables. Including quantum fluctuations through the addition of a transverse field, we study their ground state phase diagram and quantum phase transitions. We show that the nonlinearity of the CA rule leads to a quantum order-by-disorder mechanism, which selects a particular (rule-dependent) spatial structure for small transverse fields, with spontaneous breaking of the translation symmetry in some cases. Using numerical results for larger fields, we also observe a first-order quantum phase transition into a quantum paramagnet, as in previous studies of spin models based on linear CA rules.

Title: Localizing entropy production along non-equilibrium trajectories
Authors: Biswajit Das, Sreekanth K Manikandan
Abstract: An important open problem in nonequilibrium thermodynamics is the quantification and spatiotemporal localization of entropy production in complex nanoscale processes from experimental data. Here we address this issue through a data-driven approach that combines the recently developed short-time thermodynamic uncertainty relation based inference scheme with machine learning techniques. Our approach leverages the flexible function representation provided by deep neural networks to achieve accurate reconstruction of high-dimensional, potentially time-dependent dissipative force fields as well as the localization of entropy production in both space and time along nonequilibrium trajectories. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework through applications to diverse systems of fundamental interest and experimental significance, where it successfully addresses distinct challenges in localizing entropy production.

Title: Comprehensive Study of Phonon Chirality under Symmetry Constraints
Authors: Shuai Zhang, Zhiheng Huang, Muchen Du, Tianping Ying, Luojun Du, Tiantian Zhang
Abstract: Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations, and their modes (linear, circular, or stationary) are symmetry-determined. Circularly polarized phonons, possessing nonzero angular momentum (AM), have drawn widespread attention recently. Despite widespread use of pseudo-angular momentum (PAM) and circularly polarized light polarization flips to identify chiral phonons in Raman scattering, their reliability is debated due to symmetry dependence, and experimental verification standards remain lacking. Here, we systematically study phonon chirality and associated phenomena across magnetic point groups. We establish that the AM-PAM correlation is governed by both crystalline symmetry and Wyckoff positions, dictating conditions where nonzero AM manifests in PAM signatures. Crucially, phonons belonging to distinct irreducible representations exhibit distinct experimental benchmarks, enabling direct determination of crystalline chirality and symmetry classification. Furthermore, we report the discovery of a signature for symmetry-induced phenomena, notably a half-wave plate-analogous effect induced by mirror-odd phonons. Meanwhile, we conducted five experiments to validate our theory.

Title: High-Throughput Exploration of NV-like Color Centers Across Host Materials
Authors: Oscar Groppfeldt, Joel Davidsson, Rickard Armiento
Abstract: Point defects in semiconductors offer a promising platform for advancing quantum technologies due to their localized energy states and controllable spin properties. Prior research has focused on a limited set of defects within materials such as diamond, silicon carbide, and hexagonal boron nitride. We present a high-throughput study to systematically identify and evaluate point defects across a diverse range of host materials, aiming to uncover previously unexplored defects in novel host materials suitable for use in quantum applications. A range of host materials are selected for their desirable properties, such as appropriate bandgaps, crystal structure, and absence of d- or f-electrons. The Automatic Defect Analysis and Qualification (ADAQ) software framework is used to generate vacancies, substitutions with s- and p-elements, and interstitials in these materials and use density functional theory to calculate key properties such as Zero-Phonon Lines (ZPLs), ionic displacements, Transition Dipole Moments (TDMs), and formation energies. Special attention is given to charge correction methods for materials with dielectric anisotropy. We uncover new defect-host combinations with advantageous properties for quantum applications: 28 defects across 11 isotropic and 2 anisotropic host materials show properties similar to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Beryllium (Be) substitutional defects in SrS, MgS, and SrO emerge as particularly promising. These findings contribute to diversifying and enhancing the materials available for quantum technologies.

Title: Fractional chiral second-order topological insulator from a three-dimensional array of coupled wires
Authors: Viktoriia Pinchenkova, Katharina Laubscher, Jelena Klinovaja
Abstract: We construct a model of a three-dimensional chiral second-order topological insulator (SOTI) from an array of weakly coupled nanowires. We show that, in a suitable parameter regime, the interplay between rotating magnetic fields and spatially modulated interwire tunnelings leads to the opening of gaps in the bulk and surface spectrum of the system, while one or more chiral hinge states propagating along a closed path of one-dimensional hinges are left gapless. The exact path of these hinge states is determined by the hierarchy of interwire couplings and the boundary termination of the sample. Depending on the ratio between the period of the rotating magnetic field and the Fermi wavelength, our model can realize both integer and fractional chiral SOTIs. The fractional regime emerges in the presence of strong electron-electron interactions and features hinge states carrying only a fraction $e/p$ of the electronic charge $e$ for a positive odd integer $p$.

Title: Persistent Homology-Based Indicator of Orientational Ordering in Two-Dimensional Quasi-Particle Systems Applied to Skyrmion Lattices
Authors: Michiki Taniwaki, Thomas Brian Winkler, Jan Rothörl, Raphael Gruber, Chiharu Mitsumata, Masato Kotsugi, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) quasi-particle systems, such as magnetic skyrmions, exhibit topological phase transitions between unique 2D phases. However, to identify the phases, an easy and computationally low-cost methodology for capturing the configurational properties of lattice ordering and constructing such an appropriate descriptor that can be easily calculated is, though, not obvious. Here, we propose an indicator for topological phase transitions using persistent homology (PH). PH offers novel insights beyond conventional indicators by capturing topological features derived from the configurational properties of the lattice. The proposed persistent-homology-based topological indicator, which selectively counts stable features in a persistence diagram, effectively traces the lattice's topological changes, as confirmed by comparisons with the conventionally used measure of the ordering (the magnitude of the orientational order parameter $\langle|\Psi_6|\rangle$), typically used to identify lattice phases. We demonstrate the applicability of our indicator to experimental data, showing that it yields results consistent with those of simulations. This experimental validation highlights the robustness of the proposed method for real physical systems beyond idealized simulated systems. While our method is demonstrated in the context of skyrmion lattice systems, the approach is general and can be extended to other two-dimensional systems composed of interacting quasi-particles. As a key advantage, our indicator offers lower computational complexity than the conventionally used measures.

Title: Frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness and short-range magnetic order in the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: I. A. Goremykin, A. A. Katanin
Abstract: We study doping and temperature dependencies of temporal and spatial spin stiffnesses of the Hubbard model within the mean field approach for incommensurate magnetic order. We show that the frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness within the considered mean-field approach is crucial to obtain small values of correlation length, comparable to those observed in cuprates. Using the obtained spin stiffnesses, we obtain the temperature and doping dependence of correlation length within the large-$N$ limit of the respective nonlinear sigma model. In agreement with the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ we obtain short range magnetic order with relatively small correlation length at $0.1 \lesssim x\lesssim 0.2$, and magnetically ordered ground state in the narrow doping region $0.05\lesssim x \lesssim 0.1$. The latter state may correspond to the spin-frosen state, observed in the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.

Title: Raman and IR Signatures of Mo3S4 and Mo3S13 Molybdenum Sulphide Molecular Catalysts for Solar Hydrogen Evolution
Authors: Pardis Adams, Jan Bühler, Angel Labordet Alvarez, David Tilley, Mirjana Dimitrievska
Abstract: Molybdenum sulfide clusters, [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, have emerged as key molecular models for understanding active sites in Mo-S-based catalysts and as promising candidates for energy conversion applications. Despite their importance, comprehensive vibrational characterization of these clusters remains limited. Here, we present a detailed Raman and infrared spectroscopic analysis of both clusters, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. High-quality crystalline samples were synthesized and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to confirm morphology and stoichiometry. Raman spectra, acquired using 488 nm and 532 nm laser excitation, were deconvoluted using Lorentzian fitting. Vibrational mode assignments were made through direct comparison with DFT predictions. For [Mo3S4]4+, major Raman bands appear near 200 cm^-1, 350 cm^-1, and 450 cm^-1, corresponding to Mo-S-Mo bending, Mo-S stretching, and terminal sulfur vibrations. [Mo3S13]2- shows two distinct spectral regions: 100-400 cm^-1 for Mo-S and S-S bending and stretching, and 450-550 cm^-1 for terminal disulfide (S-S) stretching. Complementary IR spectra calculations reveal additional vibrational features, yielding a more complete fingerprint for each cluster. Finally, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy offers greater sensitivity than X-ray diffraction (XRD) in detecting these clusters on supporting materials. This work provides a detailed vibrational reference for [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, establishing Raman and IR spectroscopy as powerful tools for characterizing Mo-S molecular clusters in both fundamental and applied contexts.

Title: Inchworm tensor train hybridization expansion quantum impurity solver
Authors: Yang Yu, André Erpenbeck, Dominika Zgid, Guy Cohen, Olivier Parcollet, Emanuel Gull
Abstract: The investigation of quantum impurity models plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics because of their wide-ranging applications, such as embedding theories and transport problems. Traditional methods often fall short of producing accurate results for multi-orbital systems with complex interactions and off-diagonal hybridizations. Recently, tensor-train-based integration and summation techniques have shown promise as effective alternatives. In this study, we use tensor train methods to tackle quantum impurity problems formulated within the imaginary-time inchworm hybridization expansion framework. We identify key challenges in the inchworm expansion itself and its interplay with tensor-train-based methods. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of our approach by solving general quantum impurity problems. Our results suggest that tensor-train decomposition schemes offer a viable path toward accurate and efficient multi-orbital impurity solvers.

Title: Parasitic RF-SQUIDs in superconducting qubits due to wirebonds
Authors: B. Berlitz, E. Daum, S. Deck, A.V. Ustinov, J. Lisenfeld
Abstract: Superconducting qubits show great promise to realize practical quantum computers from micro-fabricated integrated circuits. However, their solid-state architecture bears the burden of parasitic modes in qubit materials and the control circuitry which cause decoherence and interfere with qubits. Here, we present evidence that wirebonds, which are used to contact the micro-circuits and to realize chip-to-chip airbridges, may contain parasitic Josephson junctions. In our experiment, such a junction was enclosed in a superconducting loop and so gave rise to the formation an RF-SQUID which interfered with a nearby flux-tunable transmon qubit. Periodic signatures observed in magnetic field sweeps revealed a strong AC-dispersive coupling of the parasitic RF-SQUID to both the qubit and its readout resonator, in addition to the DC-inductive coupling between RF-SQUID and qubit. Our finding sheds light on a previously unknown origin of decoherence due to parasitic Josephson junctions in superconducing circuits.

Title: Time inversion symmetry in the Dirac and Schrödinger-Pauli theories
Authors: R. Winkler, U. Zülicke
Abstract: The Schrödinger-Pauli theory is generally believed to give a faithful representation of the nonrelativistic and weakly relativistic limit of the Dirac theory. However, the Schrödinger-Pauli theory is fundamentally incomplete in its account of broken time inversion symmetry, e.g., in magnetically ordered systems. In the Dirac theory of the electron, magnetic order breaks time inversion symmetry even in the nonrelativistic limit, whereas time inversion symmetry is effectively preserved in the Schrödinger-Pauli theory in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. In the Dirac theory, the Berry curvature $1/(2m^2c^2)$ is thus an intrinsic property of nonrelativistic electrons similar to the well-known spin magnetic moment $e\hbar/(2m)$, while this result is missed by the nonrelativistic or weakly relativistic Schrödinger-Pauli equation. In ferromagnetically ordered systems, the intrinsic Berry curvature yields a contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity independent of spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Benchmark control problems in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics
Authors: Stephen Whitelam, Corneel Casert, Megan Engel, Isaac Tamblyn
Abstract: We present a set of computer codes designed to test methods for optimizing time-dependent control protocols in fluctuating nonequilibrium systems. Each problem consists of a stochastic model, an optimization objective, and C++ and Python implementations that can be run on Unix-like systems. These benchmark systems are simple enough to run on a laptop, but challenging enough to test the capabilities of modern optimization methods. This release includes five problems and a worked example. The problem set is called NESTbench25, for NonEquilibrium STatistical mechanics benchmarks (2025).

Title: Ultrastable jammed sphere packings with a wide range of particle dispersities
Authors: Robert S. Hoy
Abstract: We show that for a standard continuously-polydisperse model with particle-diameter distribution $P(\sigma) \propto \sigma^{-3}$ and polydispersity index $\Delta$, employing a combination of standard SWAP moves and transient degree of freedom (TDOF) moves during a Lubachevsky-Stillinger-like particle-growth process dramatically increases the generated packings' jamming densities $\phi_{\rm J}(\Delta)$ and coordination numbers $Z_{\rm J}(\Delta)$, for a wide range of $\Delta$. The fractional increase in $\phi_{\rm J}(\Delta)$ obtained by employing these moves first increases rapidly with $\Delta$, then plateaus at $6-7\%$ over the range $0.10 \lesssim \Delta \leq 50$; the obtained $\phi_{\rm J}$ are as high as $0.747$ (for $\Delta = 0.50$). These density increases are achieved without producing clearly-noticeable crystallization or increased fractionation, despite the fact that the packings are quite hyperstatic for all $\Delta > 0$. SWAP and TDOF moves also reduce packings' rattler populations by as much as 99% and increase their bulk moduli by as much as 80%.

Title: Emergence of a Boundary-Sensitive Phase in Hyperbolic Ising Models
Authors: Xingzhi Wang, Zohar Nussinov, Gerardo Ortiz
Abstract: Physical systems defined on hyperbolic lattices may exhibit phases of matter that only emerge due to negative curvature. We focus on the case of the Ising model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and (low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation. We discuss a holographic correspondence between boundary and bulk behaviors and derive exact expressions for boundary correlation functions on Cayley trees.

Title: Electrochemically-driven formation of Intermetallic Cu3ZnLi2 alters Li-transport in nanostructured bimetallic battery anode

Abstract: The role of Li-based batteries in the electrification of society cannot be understated, however their operational lifetime is often limited by the formation of dendrites, i.e. the localised deposition of Li that can cause shorts between the two electrodes leading to the failure of the battery. Nanocrystalline bimetallic current collectors can be used for anode-free Li-metal batteries, with improved Li plating and limited or suppressed formation of dendrites. Here, we demonstrate that the microstructure of an alpha-Brass current collector, Cu 63% Zn 37%, used in an anode-free Li-metal battery evolves during cycling. It initially had a nanocrystalline deformation layer approximately 80 nm in thickness after polishing. After 100 cycles, the initial deformed brass layer was partially converted to a ternary Laves phase Cu3ZnLi2 within a nanocrystalline brass matrix that grew to 200 - 250 nm in thickness. Upon Li stripping, the phase partially decomposes electrochemically, but what remains can sequester Li thus forming "dead Li" thereby contributing to capacity loss. We propose a mechanism for the microstructural evolution including dynamic recrystallization and phase formation. Since this ternary Laves phase emerges during electrochemical cycling alone, binary alloy current collectors must be assessed for metastable ternary phase formation under different cycling conditions to either stabilize and exploit such phases or electrochemically fully strip them.

Title: Floquet Theory of lattice electrons coupled to an off-resonant cavity
Authors: Jules Sueiro, Gian Marcello Andolina, Marco Schirò
Abstract: We use Floquet theory and the High-Frequency expansion to derive an effective Hamiltonian for electrons coupled to an off resonant cavity mode, either in its vacuum or driven by classical light. For vacuum fields, we show that long-range hopping and cavity-mediated interactions arise as a direct consequence of quantum fluctuations. As an application, this method is applied to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. At high light-matter coupling, our results reveal significant deviations from mean-field predictions, with our framework capturing light-matter entanglement through the Floquet micromotion. Furthermore, the cavity-mediated interactions appearing at first order are shown to be crucial to the description of the system at sufficiently strong light-matter coupling for a fixed cavity frequency. Finally, a drive resonant with the cavity is added with the SSH chain displaying dynamical behavior dependent on the cavity parameters.

Title: Ultrafast Raman probe of the photoinduced superconducting to normal state transition in the cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$
Authors: Laurène Gatuingt, Alexandr Alekhin, Niloufar Nilforoushan, Sarah Houver, Alain Sacuto, Genda Gu, Yann Gallais
Abstract: We report an ultrafast Time-Resolved Raman scattering study of the out-of-equilibrium photoinduced dynamics across the superconducting to normal state phase transition of the cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. Using the polarization-resolved momentum space selectivity of Raman scattering, we track the superconducting condensate destruction and recovery dynamics with sub-picoseconds time resolution in the anti-nodal region of the Fermi surface where the superconducting gap is maximum. Leveraging ultrafast Raman thermometry, we find a significant dichotomy between the superconducting condensate and the quasiparticle temperature dynamics near the anti-nodes, which cannot be framed in terms of a single effective electron temperature. The present work demonstrates the ability of Time-Resolved Raman scattering to selectively probe out-of-equilibrium pathways of different electronic sub-degrees of freedom during a photoinduced phase transition.

Title: Double Helix of atomic displacements in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$
Authors: Yihao Hu, Shi Liu
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of a "dipole spiral" structure in strained freestanding membranes, promising a route to giant electromechanical responses [\href{this https URL}{PRL \textbf{133}, 046802 (2024)}]. However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic properties remain largely unexplored from a first-principles perspective. Here, using density function theory on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we unveil a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This intricate topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which mediates an emergent electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. This unique structure, conceptualized as a "self-Moiré" crystal, manifests two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the spiral's long-period potential fundamentally reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to an emergent multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work establishes a powerful, purely physical route to designing complex chiral order and provides a unified platform where structural topology, giant electromechanical coupling, and multi-valley electronics are intrinsically linked.

Title: Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Youngjae Kim
Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.

Title: Characterisation of Irradiation Damage in Fe3Cr and Fe5Cr: A Study on the Effects of Chromium Content and Temperature
Authors: Chandra Bhusan Yadav, Andrew J. London, Tonci Tadic, Ruqing Xu, Wenjun Liu, Stjepko Fazinic, Suchandrima Das
Abstract: Fe-Cr binary alloys serve as simplified model systems to study irradiation damage relevant to fusion structural materials. Here, Fe-3%Cr and Fe-5%Cr samples were irradiated with 4 MeV Fe ions under a dose rate of 4x10^5 dpa/s across a linear thermal gradient (120C to 480C) in a single experiment, enabling direct comparison of temperature and Cr content effects under identical conditions. Depth-resolved Laue micro-diffraction (~10^4 strain sensitivity), nanoindentation, and AFM reveal non-monotonic evolution of lattice strain and hardness: both decrease with temperature up to ~300C, then increase beyond. This turning point reflects a shift from enhanced defect mobility and partial recovery to solute-defect clustering and cavity formation, which stabilize damage. Fe-3%Cr shows consistently higher strain and hardening than Fe-5%Cr, especially at lower temperatures. Minimal change in post-indentation pile-up indicates limited softening or localization. These results highlight how Cr content and temperature jointly affect irradiation response, offering new insights into defect evolution in fusion-relevant alloys.

Title: Entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene plasmonics
Authors: Jay A. Berres, S. Ali Hassani Gangaraj, George W. Hanson
Abstract: We investigate entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons. Nonreciprocal systems are ideal for the enhancement, control, and preservation of entanglement due to the potential for unidirectional beam-like wave propagation, i.e., efficiently transporting photons from one emitter to another. Using a quantum master equation and three-dimensional Green's function analysis, we investigate a system consisting of two two-level emitters dominantly interacting via electric current induced nonreciprocal plasmonic modes of a graphene waveguide. We use concurrence as a measure of entanglement. We show that nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons are a promising candidate to generate and mediate concurrence, where it is shown that there is good enhancement and control of entanglement over vacuum, which is beneficial for the broad applications of entanglement as a quantum resource. We believe our findings contribute to the development of quantum devices, enabling efficient and tunable entanglement between two-level systems, which is a central goal in quantum technologies.

Title: Learning topological states from randomized measurements using variational tensor network tomography
Authors: Yanting Teng, Rhine Samajdar, Katherine Van Kirk, Frederik Wilde, Subir Sachdev, Jens Eisert, Ryan Sweke, Khadijeh Najafi
Abstract: Learning faithful representations of quantum states is crucial to fully characterizing the variety of many-body states created on quantum processors. While various tomographic methods such as classical shadow and MPS tomography have shown promise in characterizing a wide class of quantum states, they face unique limitations in detecting topologically ordered two-dimensional states. To address this problem, we implement and study a heuristic tomographic method that combines variational optimization on tensor networks with randomized measurement techniques. Using this approach, we demonstrate its ability to learn the ground state of the surface code Hamiltonian as well as an experimentally realizable quantum spin liquid state. In particular, we perform numerical experiments using MPS ansätze and systematically investigate the sample complexity required to achieve high fidelities for systems of sizes up to $48$ qubits. In addition, we provide theoretical insights into the scaling of our learning algorithm by analyzing the statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation. Notably, our method is sample-efficient and experimentally friendly, only requiring snapshots of the quantum state measured randomly in the $X$ or $Z$ bases. Using this subset of measurements, our approach can effectively learn any real pure states represented by tensor networks, and we rigorously prove that random-$XZ$ measurements are tomographically complete for such states.

Title: Asymptotic behaviour of determinants through the expansion of the Moyal star product
Authors: Maurizio Fagotti, Vanja Marić
Abstract: We work out a generalization of the Szegö limit theorems on the determinant of large matrices. We focus on matrices with nonzero leading principal minors and elements that decay to zero exponentially fast with the distance from the main diagonal, but we relax the constraint of the Toeplitz structure. We obtain an expression for the asymptotic behaviour of the determinant written in terms of the factors of a left and right Wiener-Hopf type factorization of an appropriately defined symbol. For matrices with elements varying slowly along the diagonals (e.g., in locally Toeplitz sequences), we propose to apply the analogue of the semiclassical expansion of the Moyal star product in phase-space quantum mechanics. This is a systematic method that provides approximations up to any order in the typical scale of the inhomogeneity and allows us to obtain explicit asymptotic formulas.

Title: Strong anomalous diffusion for free-ranging birds
Authors: Ohad Vilk, Motti Charter, Sivan Toledo, Eli Barkai, Ran Nathan
Abstract: Diffusion and anomalous diffusion are widely observed and used to study movement across organisms, resulting in extensive use of the mean and mean-squared displacement (MSD). However, these measures - corresponding to specific displacement moments - do not capture the full complexity of movement behavior. Using high-resolution data from over 70 million localizations of young and adult free-ranging Barn Owls (\textit{Tyto alba}), we reveal strong anomalous diffusion as nonlinear growth of displacement moments. The moment spectrum function $\lambda_t(q)$ -- defined by $\left<|\bm{x}(t)|^q\right> \sim t^{\lambda_t(q)}$ -- displays piecewise linearity in $q$, with a critical moment marking the crossover between scaling regimes. This highlights the need of a broad spectrum of displacement moments to characterize movement, which we link to age-specific ecological drivers. Furthermore, a characteristic timescale of five minutes marks an unexpected transition from a convex to a concave $\lambda_t(q)$. Using two stochastic models - a bounded Lévy walk and a multi-mode behavioral model - we account for the observed phenomena, showing good agreement with data, relating age-specific behavioral states to environmentally confined movement, and demonstrating how Lévy walk-like patterns can arise from underlying behavioral structure. Finally, we discuss the ecological significance of our results, arguing that strong anomalous diffusion may be widespread in animal movement.

Title: Gauging or extending bulk and boundary conformal field theories: Application to bulk and domain wall problem in topological matter and their descriptions by (mock) modular covariant
Authors: Yoshiki Fukusumi
Abstract: We study gauging operations (or group extensions) in (smeared) boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and bulk conformal field theories, and their applications to various phenomena in topologically ordered systems. We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories in the testable information of general classes of partition functions. One can obtain the bulk topological properties of $2+1$ dimensional topological ordered phase corresponding to the massive RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional systems, or smeared BCFT. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. Related to the bulk topological degeneracies in $2+1$ dimensions and quantum phases in $1+1$ dimensions, we construct a new series of BCFT. We also investigate the implications of the massless RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional CFT to $2+1$ dimensional topological order, which corresponds to the earlier proposal by L. Kong and H. Zheng in [Nucl. Phys. B 966 (2021), 115384], arXiv:1912.01760, closely related to the integer-spin simple current by Schellekens and Gato-Rivera. We study the properties of the product of two CFTs connected by the two kinds of massless flows. The (mock) modular covariants appearing in the analysis seem to contain new ones. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. One can obtain the general phenomenology of the transportation of anyons through the domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase based on the established data of classifications of conformal field theories or modular invariants.

Title: Surface Plasmon Polaritons: Creation Dynamics and Interference of Slow and Fast Propagating SPPs at a Temporal Boundary
Authors: Jay A. Berres, S. Ali Hassani Gangaraj, George W. Hanson
Abstract: We establish the theoretical framework for a material system that supports surface plasmon polaritions (SPPs) excited by a dipole excitation, where the media configuration suddenly changes at a temporal boundary. We employ three-dimensional Green's function analysis in the Laplace transform domain. We use this framework to demonstrate dynamic SPP formation and time-boundary-induced interference of slow and fast propagating SPPs. This analysis provides insight into how SPPs are formed in time and how they interfere at a temporal boundary.

Title: Homomorphism, substructure and ideal: Elementary but rigorous aspects of renormalization group or hierarchical structure of topological orders
Authors: Yoshiki Fukusumi, Yuma Furuta
Abstract: We propose a general quantum Hamiltonian formalism of a renormalization group (RG) flow with an emphasis on generalized symmetry by interpreting the elementary relationship between homomorphism, quotient ring, and projection. In our formalism, the noninvertible nature of the ideal of a fusion ring realizing the generalized symmetry of an ultraviolet (UV) theory plays a fundamental role in determining condensation rules between anyons, resulting in the infrared (IR) theories. Our algebraic method applies to the domain wall problem in $2+1$ dimensional topologically ordered systems and the corresponding classification of $1+1$ dimensional gapped phase, for example. An ideal decomposition of a fusion ring provides a straightforward but strong constraint on the gapped phase with noninvertible symmetry and its symmetry-breaking (or emergent symmetry) patterns. Moreover, even in several specific homomorphisms connected under massless RG flows, less familiar homomorphisms appear, and we conjecture that they correspond to partially solvable models in recent literature. Our work demonstrates the fundamental significance of the abstract algebraic structure, ideal, for the RG in physics.

Title: Free-Fermion Dynamics with Measurements: Topological Classification and Adaptive Preparation of Topological States
Authors: Asadullah Bhuiyan, Haining Pan, Chao-Ming Jian
Abstract: We develop a general framework for classifying fermionic dynamical systems with measurements using symmetry and topology. We discuss two complementary classification schemes based on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way: (1) the many-body evolution operator (mEO) symmetry class, which classifies fermionic dynamics at the many-body level and generalizes to interacting dynamics, and (2) the single-particle transfer matrix (sTM) symmetry class, which classifies free-fermion dynamics at the single-particle level and connects to Anderson localization physics. In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in one-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of area-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical bulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime \textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state ensemble living on its temporal \textit{boundary}. Building on this correspondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical phases using Gaussian adaptive circuits. They are designed to prepare and stabilize free-fermion topological states as their steady states in \textit{any} spatial dimension. While circuits with exponentially local operations can stabilize a single topological steady state, those with finite-range operations can reach a topological steady-state ensemble. As a demonstration, we explicitly construct and simulate 2+1d adaptive circuits that realize mEO-class-A topological dynamics. We show that the finite-range versions converge to an ensemble of Chern insulators in ${\cal O}(1)$ circuit depth. We numerically study the topological phase transitions and dynamical domain-wall modes between different topological dynamical phases in this symmetry class. We also analyze the robustness of our adaptive circuit protocol to coherent noise.

Title: Defect Engineered Layer Dependent Nonlinear Optical Response in Two Dimensional Muscovite for Efficient Optical Limiting

Abstract: Light-matter interactions in two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained significant interest due to their distinctive optical and electronic properties. Recently, silicates have emerged as a promising new class of 2D materials, but their nonlinear optical properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate layer-dependent nonlinear absorption and optical limiting capabilities of 2D muscovite using femtosecond laser excitation at 450 nm. The two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient is highly sensitive to both the number of layers and excitation intensity, increasing markedly from (3.91+/-0.06)x10^3 cm GW^-1 in multilayer structures to (6.94+/-0.17)x10^5 cm GW^-1 in the monolayer limit at a peak intensity of 68 GW cm^-2, highlighting a strong layer-dependent enhancement in nonlinear absorption. Additionally, monolayer muscovite exhibits an optical limiting threshold of 1.46 mJ cm^-2, outperforming graphene and other 2D dichalcogenides. This enhanced TPA arises from quantum confinement and intrinsic lattice defects that facilitate nonlinear optical transitions. Density functional theory reveals that liquid-phase exfoliation disrupts potassium interlayers and induces oxygen vacancies, generating mid-gap electronic states that significantly enhance TPA. These insights open new avenues for designing low-fluence, high-efficiency optical limiters using 2D silicates.

Title: Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering
Authors: Kazuki Doi, Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.

Title: Finite-dimensional approximations of generalized squeezing
Authors: Sahel Ashhab, Felix Fischer, Davide Lonigro, Daniel Braak, Daniel Burgarth
Abstract: We show unexpected behaviour in simulations of generalized squeezing performed with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space: even for extremely large dimension of the state space, the results depend on whether the truncation dimension is even or odd. This situation raises the question whether the simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact, the two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary evolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the infinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the generalized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite excitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we present results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to even and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different self-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To make the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize it by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental implementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the Hamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the parity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.
