Title: Quantum Theory of Optical Spin Texture in Chiral Tellurium Lattice
Authors: Pronoy Das, Sathwik Bharadwaj, Jungho Mun, Xueji Wang, Junsuk Rho, Zubin Jacob
Abstract: The absence of inversion symmetry in chiral tellurium (Te) creates exotic spin textures within its electron waves. However, understanding textured optical waves within Te remains a challenge due to the semi-classical limitations of long-wavelength approximation. To unveil these textured optical waves, we develop a spin-resolved deep-microscopic optical bandstructure for Te analogous to its electronic counterpart. We demonstrate that the degeneracies in this optical bandstructure is lifted by the twisted lattice of Te, which induces optical gyrotropy. Our theory shows excellent agreement with experimental optical gyrotropy measurements. At the lattice level, we reveal that the chirality of Te manifests as deep-microscopic optical spin texture within the optical wave. Our framework uncovers the finite-momentum origin of optical activity and provides a microscopic basis for light-matter interactions in chiral crystalline materials.

Title: A Review on Improving PSC Performance through Charge Carrier Management: Where We Stand and What's Next?
Authors: Dilshod Nematov
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent a breakthrough in photovoltaic technology, combining high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), ease of fabrication, and tunable optoelectronic properties. However, their commercial viability is limited by critical issues such as charge carrier recombination, interfacial defects, instability under environmental stress, and toxicity of lead-based components. This review systematically examines recent advancements in charge carrier management strategies aimed at overcoming these limitations. Initially, fundamental mechanisms governing carrier generation, separation, transport, and recombination are outlined to provide a clear foundation. The study then delves into an in-depth analysis of carrier lifetime and mobility, evaluating recent methodologies for their enhancement through compositional engineering and structural optimization. Subsequently, trap state passivation techniques and interface engineering approaches are reviewed, with a particular focus on their impact on device stability and efficiency. The review also discusses long-term stability strategies and emerging trends in lead-free and scalable PSC technologies. In this work, recent strategies for charge carrier management are systematically categorized, comparative analyses are provided and synergistic solutions with high potential for real-world implementation are highlighted. By synthesizing data and perspectives from over thirty recent studies, this article offers a comprehensive roadmap for researchers seeking to optimize PSC performance and accelerate their transition toward commercial application.

Title: Canonical Thermodynamics
Authors: Arnaldo Spalvieri
Abstract: In the paper, thermodynamics of canonical systems is derived from the multinomial distribution of the occupancy numbers of quantum eigenstates. The cathegorical distribution (i.e. the one-particle distribution) on which the multinomial distribution is based, should be derived from the maximum entropy principle, but, being the multinomial distribution intractable, the paper proposes to take instead the Boltzmann distribution as cathegorical distribution, discussing the reason why the entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution should closely approximate the entropy achieved by the multinomial distribution equipped with the entropy-maximizing cathegorical distribution. After this, we impose Clausius' equation on the Shannon entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution, getting an unexpected result: in general, the Lagrange multiplier $\beta$ that imposes the energy constraint in constrained entropy maximization turns out to be substantially different from the inverse temperature. To support this unexpected result, the paper presents an example where, with $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature, the thermodynamic entropy (i.e. the entropy at a given temperature) of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution is greater than the Bose-Einstein thermodynamic entropy. However, the latter is derived from entropy maximization with constrained expected energy and expected number of particles, therefore if we plug $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature in the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution, then the thermodynamics of the canonical system obtained in this way turns out to be non-compatible with the principle of maximum entropy.

Title: Microscopic origin of the magnetic interactions and their experimental signatures in altermagnetic La$_2$O$_3$Mn$_2$Se$_2$
Authors: Laura Garcia-Gassull, Aleksandar Razpopov, Panagiotis Peter Stavropoulos, Igor I Mazin, Roser Valent√≠
Abstract: Altermagnets (AM) are a recently introduced type of magnets, with no net magnetization like antiferromagnets, but displaying a non-relativistic Zeeman splitting in reciprocal space like ferromagnets. One of the lately discussed models to realize AM is the inverse Lieb lattice (ILL). Initially suggested as a purely theoretical construct, the ILL occurs in real materials such as La$_2$O$_3$Mn$_2$Se$_2$. However, AM on the ILL requires 90$^\circ$ nearest-neighbor superexchange to be {\it antiferromagnetic} and dominant over the 180$^\circ$ next-nearest-neighbor superexchange, in apparent contradiction to the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson (GKA) rules. Yet, AM ordering was found to be the ground state in La$_2$O$_3$Mn$_2$Se$_2$. Combining ab initio and analytical methods, we determine how direct exchange and superexchange act together to produce a large antiferromagnetic nearest-neigbor coupling. The seeming contradiction with the GKA rules is traced back to the multiorbital character of Mn$^{+2}$ ions. By calculating magnon bands, we identify universal signatures of the exchange interactions, suggesting experimental fingerprints.

Title: Spontaneous Quantum Turbulence in a Newborn Bose-Einstein Condensate via the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism
Authors: Seong-Ho Shinn, Matteo Massaro, Mithun Thudiyangal, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts the spontaneous formation of topological defects in a continuous phase transition driven at a finite rate. We propose the generation of spontaneous quantum turbulence (SQT) via the KZM during Bose-Einstein condensation induced by a thermal quench. Using numerical simulations of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two spatial dimensions, we describe the formation of a newborn Bose-Einstein condensate proliferated by quantum vortices. We establish the nonequilibrium universality of SQT through the Kibble-Zurek and Kolmogorov scaling of the incompressible kinetic energy.

Title: Intertwined Orders and the Physics of High Temperature Superconductors
Authors: Eduardo Fradkin
Abstract: Complex phase diagrams are generic feature of quantum materials that display high temperature superconductivity. In addition to d-wave superconductivity (or other unconventional states), these phase diagrams typically include various forms of charge-ordered phases, including charge-density-waves and/or spin-density waves, and electronic nematic states. In most cases these phases have critical temperatures comparable in magnitude to that of the superconducting state, and appear in a "pseudo-gap" regime. In these systems the high temperature state is not a good metal with well-defined quasiparticles but a "strange metal". These states typically arise from doping a strongly correlated Mott insulator. With my collaborators we have identified these behaviors as a problem with "Intertwined Orders". A Pair-density wave is a type of superconducting state which embodies the physics of intertwined orders. Here I discus the phenomenology of intertwined orders and the quantum materials that are known to display these behaviors.

Title: A New Experimental Method for Determining the Pinning Energy of an Abrikosov Vortex
Authors: Elmeri O. Rivasto
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel method of experimentally addressing the pinning energy of an Abrikosov vortex in high-temperature superconducting thin films. The method is based on our previously published theoretical framework considering the optimization of heterostructural bilayer films. To demonstrate our method, we have estimated the pinning energy of a typical BaZrO$_3$-nanocolumn within YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ lattice using the experimental data from our previous study. Our calculations result in pinning energy of 0.04 eV/nm for a $c$-axis oriented vortex, which is in excellent agreement with a widely used theoretical formula for artificial columnar defects. However, the estimated energy is significantly higher than what has been previously reported for BaZrO$_3$-nanocolumns based on magnetic relaxation measurements. We argue that this discrepancy originates from the previously raised issues concerning the reliability of the magnetic relaxation measurements in determining the pinning energy. While the presented study only considers BaZrO$_3$-nanocolumns in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, the demonstrated method is equally applicable to any pinning site and superconducting material. The introduced method of measuring the pinning energy of Abrikosov vortices reduces the present ambiguity around the topic and enables more reliable modeling and design of YBCO based cryogenic memory cells and investigation for their use in quantum applications.

Title: A canonical approach to quantum fluctuations
Authors: Joanna Ruhl, Vanja Dunjko, Maxim Olshanii
Abstract: We present a canonical formalism for computing quantum fluctuations of certain discrete degrees of freedom in systems governed by integrable partial differential equations with known Hamiltonian structure, provided these models are classical-field approximations of underlying many-body quantum systems. We then apply the formalism to both the 2-soliton and 3-soliton breather solutions of the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation, assuming the breathers are created from an initial elementary soliton by quenching the coupling constant. In particular, we compute the immediate post-quench quantum fluctuations in the positions, velocities, norms, and phases of the constituent solitons. For each case, we consider both the white-noise and correlated-noise models for the fluctuation vacuum state. Unlike previous treatments of the problem, our method allows for analytic solutions. Additionally, in the correlated-noise case, we consider the particle-number-conserving (also called $U(1)$-symmetry-conserving) Bogoliubov modes, i.e., modes with the proper correction to preserve the total particle number. We find that in most (but not all) cases, these corrections do not change the final result.

Title: Unveiling the Electronic Origin of Anomalous Contact Conductance in Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Kevin J. U. Vidarte, Caio Lewenkopf, F. Crasto de Lima, R. Hiroki Miwa, Felipe P√©rez Riffo, Eric Su√°rez Morell
Abstract: This study theoretically investigates the contact conductance in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), providing a theoretical explanation for recent experimental observations from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM). These experiments revealed a surprising non-monotonic current pattern as a function of the TBG rotation angle $\theta$, with a peak at $\theta \approx 5^\circ$, a finding that markedly departs from the well-known magic angle TBG behavior. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a comprehensive theoretical and computational framework. Our calculations, performed on both relaxed and rigid TBG structures, simulate contact conductance by analyzing the local density of states across a range of biases and rotational angles. Contrary to the current interpretation, our results demonstrate that the maximum conductance at $\theta \approx 5^{\rm o}$ is not caused by structural relaxation or AA stacking zone changes. Instead, we attribute this peak to the evolution of the electronic band structure, specifically the shifting of van Hove singularities (vHs) to the Fermi level as the twist angle decreases. We further show that the precise location of this conductance maximum is dependent on the applied bias voltage. This interplay between twist angle, bias, and vHs energy provides a robust explanation for the experimental findings.

Title: Scalable Dip-Coated Bragg Mirrors for Strong Light-Matter Coupling with 2D Perovskites
Authors: Melissa M√©ndez-Galv√°n, Zaira Saucedo-Ch√°vez, Diana Medrano, Michael Zuarez-Chamba, Yesenia A. Garc√≠a-Jomaso, C√©sar L. Ord√≥√±ez-Romero, Giuseppe Pirruccio, Arturo Camacho-Guardian, Galo J. A. A. Soler-Illia, Hugo A. Lara-Garc√≠a
Abstract: We report a scalable and cost-effective method for fabricating high-performance Bragg mirrors using a bottom-up approach that combines evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and dip-coating. The photonic crystals are composed of alternating mesoporous SiO$_2$ and dense TiO$_2$ layers, providing a high refractive index contrast ($\sim$0.8). This enables strong reflectance (up to 96%) with as few as five bilayers and precise control of the photonic stop band across the visible spectrum by simply adjusting the deposition parameters. Integration of a thin film of the two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ leads to strong light--matter coupling at room temperature. Angle-resolved reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal the formation of upper and lower polariton branches, with a Rabi splitting of 90 meV. The observed polaritonic dispersion is well described by a two-level system and Green's function formalism. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for constructing tunable optical cavities using simple solution-based methods. The combination of high optical quality, spectral tunability, and strong coupling performance positions this platform as a promising candidate for low-threshold polariton lasers, nonlinear optics, and integrated optoelectronic devices.

Title: Excitation-detector principle and the algebraic theory of planon-only abelian fracton orders
Authors: Evan Wickenden, Wilbur Shirley, Agn√®s Beaudry, Michael Hermele
Abstract: We study abelian planon-only fracton orders: a class of three-dimensional (3d) gapped quantum phases in which all fractional excitations are abelian particles restricted to move in planes with a common normal direction. In such systems, the mathematical data encoding fusion and statistics comprises a finitely generated module over a Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[t^\pm]$ equipped with a quadratic form giving the topological spin. The principle of remote detectability requires that every planon braids nontrivially with another planon. While this is a necessary condition for physical realizability, we observe - via a simple example - that it is not sufficient. This leads us to propose the $\textit{excitation-detector principle}$ as a general feature of gapped quantum matter. For planon-only fracton orders, the principle requires that every detector - defined as a string of planons extending infinitely in the normal direction - braids nontrivially with some finite excitation. We prove this additional constraint is satisfied precisely by perfect theories of excitations - those whose quadratic form induces a perfect Hermitian form. To justify the excitation-detector principle, we consider the 2d abelian anyon theory obtained by spatially compactifying a planon-only fracton order in a transverse direction. We prove the compactified 2d theory is modular if and only if the original 3d theory is perfect, showing that the excitation-detector principle gives a necessary condition for physical realizability that we conjecture is also sufficient. A key ingredient is a structure theorem for finitely generated torsion-free modules over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k} [t^\pm]$, where $p$ is prime and $k$ a natural number. Finally, as a first step towards classifying perfect theories of excitations, we prove that every theory of prime fusion order is equivalent to decoupled layers of 2d abelian anyon theories.

A Bethe Ansatz procedure is developed to obtain expressions for the energy spectrum and eigenstates.

Title: Droplet growth, Ostwald's rule, and emergence of order in Fused in Sarcoma

Thirumalai (1) ((1) Department of Chemistry, The University of Texas at Austin, (2) Institute of Soft Matter Synthesis and Metrology, Georgetown University, Washington, (3) Departamento de Fisicoquimica, Facultad de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Coyoacan, CDMX, Mexico, (4) Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin)
Abstract: The low complexity domain of Fused in Sarcoma (FUS-LC consisting of 214 residues) undergoes phase separation, resulting in a dense liquid-like phase that forms early and slowly matures to reach ordered gel-like state on long time scales. Upon maturation, core-1, comprising of the 57 residues (39-95) in the N-terminus become structured, resulting in the formation of a non-polymorphic fibril. The truncated FUS-LC-C (residues 110-214) construct forms a fibril in which core-2 (residues 112-150) adopts a $\beta$-sheet structure. Using coarse-grained monomer SOP-IDP model simulations of FUS-LC, we predict that residues 155-190 in the C-terminal (core-3) form rapidly, followed by core-2, and finally core-1. The time scale of formation of the cores and their stabilities are inversely correlated, as anticipated by the Ostwald's rule of stages. Unbiased multichain simulations show that the chemical potentials in the two phases are equal and the calculated densities of the dense and dilute phases are in agreement with experiments. The dense phase, which forms by a nucleation mechanism, coarsens over time by a process that is reminiscent of Ostwald ripening. AlphaFold predictions of the core-3 structure and the simulations show that $\beta$-strand emerges in the core-3 region early during the droplet formation, and drives the initiation of FUS-LC assembly. The techniques introduced here are general and could be used to probe assembly of other IDPs such as TDP-43, which shares many features with FUS-LC.

Abstract: Doping in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers provides a powerful method to precisely tailor their electronic, optical, and catalytic properties for advanced technological applications, including optoelectronics, catalysis, and quantum technologies. However, doping efficiency and outcomes in these materials are strongly influenced by the complex interactions between introduced dopants and intrinsic defects, particularly sulfur vacancies. This coupling between dopants and defects can lead to distinctly different behaviors depending on doping concentration, presenting significant challenges in the predictable and controlled design of TMD properties. For example, in this work we systematically varied the p-type vanadium (V) doping density in tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayers and observed a transition in doping behavior. At low concentrations, V-dopants enhance the native optical properties of WS2, as evidenced by increased photoluminescence, without introducing new electronic states. However, at higher concentrations, V-dopants promote the formation of vanadium-sulfur vacancy complexes that generate mid-gap states, with energies that can be precisely tuned by controlling the vanadium concentration. Using a combination of excitation- and temperature-dependent photoluminescence microscopy, atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, and first-principles calculations, we identify attractive interactions between p-type V-dopants and n-type monosulfur vacancies. Our results provide mechanistic understanding of how enthalpic dopant-defect interactions versus entropic effects govern the balance between property enhancement versus perturbation of transition metal dichalcogenides and suggest a pathway toward the rational design of doping strategies for next-generation optoelectronic, catalytic, and quantum devices.

Title: Hydrodynamic Origin of Friction Between Suspended Rough Particles
Authors: Jake Minten, Bhargav Rallabandi
Abstract: Tangential interactions between particles play a central role in suspension rheology. We show theoretically that these interactions, often attributed to contact friction, are a direct consequence of fluid flows between rough particles in relative motion. We find that small surface asperities generically lead to localized hydrodynamic sliding forces and torques that can exceed their smooth counterparts by orders of magnitude. A fully analytic thin-film theory shows that these forces grow inversely with the surface separation, significantly more singular than the logarithmic scaling for smooth particles. The impending singularity tightly constrains the particles' rotation with their translation, recovering a crucial ingredient in dense suspension rheology. Despite their purely hydrodynamic origin, these features resemble several aspects of dry rolling and sliding friction.

Title: Angular Momentum Fluctuations in the Phonon Vacuum of Symmetric Crystals
Authors: Rule Yi, Violet Williams, Benedetta Flebus
Abstract: Although time-reversal and inversion symmetry constrain the angular momentum of each phonon mode to vanish, we show that the vacuum state of crystals with such symmetries can nevertheless exhibit finite angular momentum fluctuations. These fluctuations arise from quantum coherence between nondegenerate, orthogonally polarized modes and are encoded in the off-diagonal components of the angular momentum operator. Their origin lies in the noncommutativity between the phonon Hamiltonian and angular momentum, which enables time-dependent rotational dynamics even in symmetric vacua. We provide intuitive insight into the coherence underlying this phenomenon by drawing an analogy with the beating between linearly polarized classical waves. Finally, we show that these angular momentum fluctuations produce distinct spectral signatures that can, in principle, be probed via established techniques sensitive to the polarization content and symmetry of lattice excitations, opening an uncharted avenue for accessing and leveraging rotational vacuum correlations in crystalline systems.

Title: Symmetry analysis of cross-circular and parallel-circular Raman optical activity
Authors: Hikaru Watanabe, Rikuto Oiwa, Gakuto Kusuno, Takuya Satoh, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: The Raman scattering regarding the circularly-polarized incident and scattered lights is closely related to the circular activity of a given system. We investigate the symmetry of its activity, called the cross-circular and parallel-circular Raman optical activity. The analysis is systematically performed with the magnetic point groups and indicates that the response allows for a useful diagnosis of the symmetry of materials like chirality and (magneto-)axiality. It is also shown that the Stokes and anti-Stokes processes are related to each other by the conserved antiunitary symmetry for the time-reversal operation and that combined with the mirror reflection.

Title: Designer Heavy Fermions in Incommensurate $\bf{Nb_3Cl_8}$/Graphene van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Yuchen Gao, Wenjie Zhou, Fan Yang, Zhijie Ma, Hansheng Xu, Xinyue Huang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Youguo Shi, Yu Ye
Abstract: Heavy fermion systems, traditionally realized in rare-earth compounds with limited tunability, have hindered systematic exploration of correlated quantum phenomena. Here, we introduce a general strategy for engineering heavy fermions in incommensurate van der Waals heterostructures by coupling a Mott insulator (Nb$_3$Cl$_8$) with itinerant electrons (from monolayer graphene), circumventing strict lattice-matching requirements. Through magnetotransport and slave spin mean-field calculations, we demonstrate the hybridization gap ($\Delta\approx30$ meV), gate-tunable metal-insulator transition, and band-selective electron effective mass enhancement, hallmarks of Kondo coherence. The heterostructure exhibits nearly order-of-magnitude electron effective mass dichotomy between hybridized and conventional graphene-like regimes, alongside in-plane magnetic field-induced metal-insulator transitions. Top gate-temperature phase mapping reveals competing correlated states, including insulating and hidden-order phases. This work establishes a scalable platform for designing heavy fermion by replacing the itinerant electron materials, with implications for engineering topological superconductivity and quantum criticality in low-dimensional systems.

Title: Theory of Magnon Spintronics: Non-Abelian Gauge Theory of Electron Spintronics
Authors: Y.M. Cho, Franklin H. Cho
Abstract: Treating the electron as a charged spinon we propose a theory of magnon spintronics, a non-Abelian gauge theory of SU(2)xU(1), which could be viewed as an effective theory of electron spintronics. Just like QED the theory has the U(1) electromagnetic interaction, but the new ingredient is the non-Abelian SU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon with the spinon. A remarkable feature of the theory is the photon-magnon mixing, the mixing between the electromagnetic U(1) gauge boson and the diagonal part of the SU(2) magnon gauge boson. After the mixing we have the massless Abelian magnon and a massive photon, and the doubly charged massive off-diagonal non-Abelian magnons which induce the spin-flip interaction to the spinon. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different penetration lengths, the one fixed by the mass of the photon which generates the well known Meissner effect and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnons which generates the non-Abelian Meissner effect. The non-Abelian structure of the theory naturally accommodates new topological objects, the non-Abrikosov quantized magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole of the Cho-Maison type, as well as the well known Abrikosov vortex. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theory of the magnon spintronics.

Title: Spin non-Collinear Real-Time Time-Dependent Density-Functional Theory and Implementation in the Modern GPU-Accelerated INQ code
Authors: Jacopo Simoni, Xavier Andrade, Wuzhang Fang, Andrew C.Grieder, Alfredo A. Correa, Tadashi Ogitsu, Yuan Ping
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a theory that describes the time evolution of quantum mechanical many-electron systems under the influence of external time-dependent electric and magnetic fields. INQ is a specially designed software to efficiently solve the real-time TDDFT equations on graphics processing units (GPUs), which aim to overcome the computational limitation of time and size scales of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. In this work we will present an implementation of non-collinear TDDFT for the INQ code to simulate spin dynamics in real time and discuss the implementation of non-collinear magnetic effects into the code. We will discuss the implementation of exchange-correlation magnetic fields, spin-orbit coupling, and the interaction between the electronic system and external magnetic fields. We will then consider several prototypical examples of spin dynamics in magnetic clusters and solids after light excitation. Potential applications range from the study of real-time dynamics of magnons to ultrafast spin dynamics under linear and circularly polarized laser excitation, as well as spectroscopic signatures such as magnetic circular dichroism and pump-probe Kerr rotation.

Abstract: Low-dimensional materials hold great promises for exploring emergent physical phenomena, nanoelectronics, and quantum technologies. Their synthesis often depends on catalytic metal films, from which the synthesized materials must be transferred to insulating substrates to enable device functionality and minimize interfacial interactions during quantum investigations. Conventional transfer methods, such as chemical etching or electrochemical delamination, degrade material quality, limit scalability, or prove incompatible with complex device architectures. Here, a scalable, etch-free transfer technique is presented, employing Field's metal (51% In, 32.5% Bi, and 16.5% Sn by weight) as a low-melting-point mechanical support to gently delaminate low-dimensional materials from metal films without causing damage. Anchoring the metal film during separation prevents tearing and preserves material integrity. As a proof of concept, atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are transferred from Au(111)/mica to dielectric substrates, including silicon dioxide (SiO_2) and single-crystalline lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl). Comprehensive characterization confirms the preservation of structural and chemical integrity throughout the transfer process. Wafer-scale compatibility and device integration are demonstrated by fabricating GNR-based field-effect transistors (GNRFETs) that exhibit room-temperature switching with on/off current ratios exceeding 10^3. This method provides a scalable and versatile platform for integrating low-dimensional materials into advanced low-dimensional materials-based technologies.

Title: Investigation of magnetic and magneto-transport properties in non-centrosymmetric antiferromagnetic semimetal GdGaSi
Authors: Manikantha Panda, Prabuddha Kant Mishra, Sonali S Pradhan, V. Kanchana, Tapas Paramanik
Abstract: In this work, we investigated the magneto-transport and magnetic properties of GdGaSi, having non-centrosymmetric tetragonal structure, with space group $I4_1md$. Our theoretical results are supported by experimental studies. First-principles calculations reveal that GdGaSi is an antiferromagnetic semimetallic system, characterized by dominant electron-type charge carriers. In addition, the possible nontriviality of the crossing at the Fermi energy is consistent with isostructural LaPtSi-structured materials. The compound shows robust antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with a N√©el temperature of 19 K, and spin-reorientation signature below $T_N$. The semimetallic nature with positive magnetoresistance ($\simeq$ 2\% at 2 K and 8 T) is observed from the magnetotransport data, having electrons as majority charge carrier, established from the Hall measurements. The strong correlation in magnetism and transport is supported by various observations, like (1) concordant transitions in $M(T)$ and $\rho (T)$ data, (2) change in the concentration and mobility of electron below $T_N$, and (3) splitting of Kohler's plots in the two branches across the transition. Thus, our findings establish GdGaSi as a material with intertwined magnetic and transport degrees of freedom, within noncentrosymmetric lattice.

Title: Prediction of A15 Tilt Grain Boundary Structures
Authors: Wenwen Zou, Zihan Su, Juan Zhang, Kai Jiang
Abstract: In this work, we present a theoretical method to predict all coincidence site lattice (CSL) tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in A15, especially high-$\Sigma$ CSL GBs. This method includes a modified Farey diagram (MFD) and a computational framework based on the 3D phase field crystal model. Applied to [001] CSL symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) in A15, this method identifies building blocks of A15 GBs, known as structural units (SUs). The MFD predicts the quantity and proportion of SUs within GBs. The developed computational approach further determines the arrangement of these SUs. The predictive rule reveals the SU arrangement of A15 [001] CSL STGBs.

Title: The Bulk Penetration of Edge Properties in Two-Dimensional Materials
Authors: Markus Kari, Pekka Koskinen
Abstract: Edges are essential for the mechanical, chemical, electronic, and magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Research has shown that features assigned to edges are not strictly localized but often penetrate the bulk to some degree. However, mechanical edge properties, such as edge energies and stresses, are typically assigned at the system level, with spatial bulk penetrations that remain unknown. Here, we use density-functional tight-binding simulations to study how deep various edge properties spatially penetrate the 2D bulk. We study nine different edges made of four materials: graphene, goldene, boron nitride, and molybdenum disulfide. By investigating edge energies, edge stresses, and edge elastic moduli, we find that although the edge properties typically originate near edges, they still penetrate the bulk to some degree. An utmost example is goldene with a staggered edge, whose edge properties penetrate the bulk nanometer-deep. Our results caution against associating system-level edge properties too strictly with the edge, especially if those properties are further used in continuum models.

Title: The Structural Behavior of Physisorbed Metallenes
Authors: Kameyab Raza Abidi, Pekka Koskinen
Abstract: Atomically thin metallenes have properties attractive for applications, but they are intrinsically unstable and require delicate stabilization in pores or other nano-constrictions. Substrates provide solid support, but metallenes' wanted properties can only be retained in weak physisorption. Here, we study the 45 physisorbed, atomically thin metallene structures in flat and buckled lattices using a sequential multi-scale model based on density-functional theory calculations. The lattices are mostly buckled but flat for a handful of elements such as Na, K, Rb, Ag, Au, and Cd, depending on physisorption strength. Moreover, under certain conditions, the structure can be controlled by applying biaxial tensile stress parallel or an electric field normal to the surface. The stress reduces the threshold of adhesion strength required to flatten a buckled lattice, and the electric field can be used to increase that threshold controllably. Our results help provide fundamental information about the structures of physisorbed metallenes and suggest means to control them at will by suitable substrate choice or tuning of experimental parameters.

Title: Observation of entanglement in a cold atom analog of cosmological preheating
Authors: Victor Gondret, Clothilde Lamirault, Rui Dias, L√©a Camier, Amaury Micheli, Charlie Leprince, Quentin Marolleau, Jean-Ren√© Rullier, Scott Robertson, Denis Boiron, Christoph I. Westbrook
Abstract: We observe entanglement between collective excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a configuration analogous to particle production during the preheating phase of the early universe. In our setup, the oscillation of the inflaton field is mimicked by the transverse breathing mode of a cigar-shaped condensate, which parametrically excites longitudinal quasiparticles with opposite momenta. After a short modulation period, we observe entanglement of these pairs which demonstrates that vacuum fluctuations seeded the parametric growth, confirming the quantum origin of the excitations. As the system continues to evolve, we observe a decrease in correlations and a disappearance of non-classical features, pointing towards future experimental probes of the less understood interaction-dominated regime.

Title: Flocking with random non-reciprocal interactions
Authors: Jiwon Choi, Jae Dong Noh, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: Flocking is ubiquitous in nature and emerges due to short or long range alignment interactions among self-propelled agents. Two unfriendly species that anti-align or even interact non-reciprocally show more complex collective phenomena, ranging from parallel and anti-parallel flocking over runand chase behavior to chiral phases. Whether flocking or any of these collective phenomena can survive in the presence of a large number of species with random non-reciprocal interactions remained elusive so far. As a first step here the extreme case of a Vicsek-like model with fully random nonreciprocal interactions between the individual particles is considered. As soon as the alignment bias is of the same order as the random interactions the ordered flocking phase occurs, but deep within this phase, the random non-reciprocal interactions can still support global chiral and oscillating states in which the collective movement direction rotates or oscillates slowly. For short-range interactions, moreover, even without alignment bias self-organized cliques emerge, in which medium size clusters of particles that have predominantly aligning interactions meet accidentally and stay together for macroscopic times. These results may serve as a starting point for the study of multi-species flocking models with non-random but complex non-reciprocal inter-species interactions.

Title: Non-Relativistic Anisotropic Magnetoresistance with Collinear and Non-Collinear Magnetic Order
Authors: Philipp Ritzinger, Ond≈ôej Sedl√°ƒçek, Jakub ≈Ωelezn√Ω, Karel V√Ωborn√Ω
Abstract: Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) arises from symmetry lowering of the conductivity tensor induced by magnetic order. In simple ferromagnets, AMR is a relativistic effect, relying on spin-orbit interaction (SOC). Here, we demonstrate that a comparable symmetry lowering can also occur in a non-relativistic limit. Using tight-binding models, density functional theory calculations, and Boltzmann transport theory, we investigate systems with multiple magnetic sublattices, including both collinear and non-collinear antiferromagnets, as well as ferrimagnetic configurations. We show that AMR and related anisotropies can emerge purely from magnetic order, without the need for SOC, and may reach significant magnitudes. The findings are supported by case studies on toy-model lattices and real materials such as MnN, Mn$_3$Sn, and are further interpreted using a symmetry analysis based on Neumann's principle. Material candidates that exhibit non-relativistic anisotropic magnetoresistance are identified by symmetry analysis applied to entries in the MAGNDATA database.

Title: Exceptional thermoelectric properties in Na$_2$TlSb enabled by quasi-1D band structure
Authors: √òven A. Grimenes (1), Ole M. L√∏vvik (2), Kristian Berland (1) ((1) Norwegian University of Life Sciences, (2) SINTEF Sustainable Energy Technology)
Abstract: Quasi-low-dimensional band structures in bulk high-symmetry materials can exhibiting density of states (DOS) profiles akin to those of low-dimensional materials. A particular striking example is the full-Heusler compound Na$_2$TlSb, with valence band energy isosurfaces consisting of intersecting 2D-dimensional pockets forming a box-like structure, with the sides individually akin to the energy isosurfaces arising in one-dimensional (1D) quantum wells. The combination of high velocities and rapidly increasing DOS with energy is extremely promising for thermoelectric applications. However, these beneficial properties could in principle be counteracted by high electronic scattering rates, and the benefits of for instance band convergence has been questioned precisely because of increased scattering rates. It is therefore critical to understand the electronic scattering nature of low-dimensional systems. In the current study, describing electronic transport properties of Na$_2$TlSb from first principles, we found that electronic scattering rates remained modest despite the high DOS. This was caused by the intricate interplay between several effects: (i) delocalized energetic isosurfaces giving rise to large momentum scattering paths with low wavefunction overlap, reducing the scattering probability; (ii) a high DOS resulting in a high free-carrier screening; (iii) a large portion of the scattering paths within the flat energy isosurfaces keeps the electron group velocity nearly constant, reducing the effective relaxation rates. The high velocity and modest relaxation time result in a high carrier mobility, which, together with the high DOS and beneficial DOS profile, results in excellent electron transport properties. Combined with an ultra-low $\kappa_\ell$ of $<1$ reported in literature, we predict a thermoelectric figure of merit ranging from 2.4 at 300 K to a maximum of 4.4 at 600 K.

Title: A Generic Platform for Designing Fractional Chern Insulators: Electrostatically Engineered Rashba Materials
Authors: Bokai Liang, Wei Qin, Zhenyu Zhang
Abstract: We present a generic platform for designing topological flat bands through applying an artificially designed electrostatic superlattice potential to a thin film with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Utilizing many-body exact diagonalization, we show that the lowest flat band can host fractional Chern insulator states at filling factor $n = 1/3$ and $2/3$. Notably, these fractional charge states present robustly in a broad regime of the parameter space. We further discuss the potential realistic materials and the associated experimental conditions required to realize these compelling theoretical predictions. Our findings establish a versatile platform for engineering topological flat bands and exploring topologically nontrivial correlated states.

Title: Chiral Quantum Droplet in a Spin-Orbit Coupled Bose Gas
Authors: Tianqi Luo, Xiaoling Cui
Abstract: We report the formation of chiral quantum droplet in a spin-orbit coupled Bose gas, where the system turns to a self-bound droplet when moving towards a particular direction and remains gaseous otherwise. The chirality arises from the breaking of Galilean invariance by spin-orbit coupling, which enables the system to dynamically adjust its condensation momentum and spin polarization in response to its velocity. As a result, only towards a specific moving direction and beyond a critical velocity, the acquired spin polarization can trigger collective interactions sufficient for self-binding and drive a first-order transition from gas to droplet. We have mapped out a phase diagram of droplet, gas and their coexistence for realistic spin-orbit coupled 39K mixtures with tunable moving velocity and magnetic detuning. Our results have revealed the emergence of chirality in spin-orbit coupled quantum gases, which shed light on general chiral phenomena in moving systems with broken Galilean invariance.

Title: Ultra-small Mode Volume Polariton Condensation via Precision $He^+$ Ion Implantation

Abstract: We present a novel method for generating potential landscapes in GaAs microcavities through focused $He^{+}$ implantation. The ion beam imprints micron-scale patterns of non-radiative centers that deplete the exciton reservoir and form a loss-defined potential minimum. Under non-resonant pumping, the resulting traps have a lateral size $\le 1.2 ~\mathrm{\mu m}$ and a three-dimensional mode volume of only $\approx 0.6 ~ \mathrm{\mu m^3}$, small enough to to support a single polariton condensate mode. The implantation process maintains strong coupling and provides lithographic ($ < 300 ~ \mathrm{nm}$) resolution. These loss-engineered traps effectively overcome the micrometer-scale limitations of conventional microcavity patterning techniques, opening new avenues for device development and polariton research within the quantum regime.

Title: Vortex structure and intervortex interaction in superconducting structures with intrinsic diode effect
Authors: A. V. Putilov, D. V. Zakharov, A. Kudlis, A. S. Mel'nikov, A. I. Buzdin
Abstract: We demonstrate that the intrinsic superconducting-diode effect can strongly reshape Abrikosov vortices in non-centrosymmetric superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid structures. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory accounting for the spin-orbit and exchange-field effects predicts a chiral distortion of the superfluid velocity, non-central interaction forces and resulting torque in a vortex-antivortex pair, and anisotropy of the Bean-Livingston barrier. These closed-form results are fully confirmed by time-dependent GL numerical simulations carried out with a fourth-order least-squares finite-difference solver, which captures equilibrium single vortex configuration in realistic mesoscopic geometries. The analysis shows that the cubic gradient term shifts vortex cores by an amount proportional to the in-plane exchange field and simultaneously generates a lateral torque that can rotate entire vortex ensembles, showing how spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the exchange field enable breakdown of the vortex--antivortex symmetry in a finite-size sample. By combining transparent analytics with quantitative numerics, the work provides the hallmarks of vortex physics in superconducting structures with an intrinsic diode effect and supplies concrete guidelines for designing non-reciprocal superconducting circuits, fluxonic logic elements, and kinetic-inductance devices.

Title: Wurtzite AlScN/AlN Superlattice Ferroelectrics Enable Endurance Beyond 1010 Cycles
Authors: Ruiqing Wang, Feng Zhu, Haoji Qian, Jiuren Zhou, Wenxin Sun, Siying Zheng, Jiajia Chen, Bochang Li, Yan Liu, Peng Zhou, Yue Hao, Genquan Han
Abstract: Wurtzite ferroelectrics are rapidly emerging as a promising material class for next-generation non-volatile memory technologies, owing to their large remanent polarization, intrinsically ordered three-dimensional crystal structure, and full compatibility with CMOS processes and back-end-of-line (BEOL) integration. However, their practical implementation remains critically constrained by a severe endurance bottleneck: under conditions where the remanent polarization (2Pr) reaches or exceeds 200 uC/cm^2, devices typically undergo catastrophic failure before reaching 10^8 cycles. Here, we report a vacancy-confining superlattice strategy that addresses this limitation, achieving reliable ferroelectric switching beyond 10^10 cycles while preserving saturated polarization (2Pr >= 200 uC/cm^2). This is achieved by embedding periodic ultrathin AlN layers within AlScN films, forming wurtzite AlScN/AlN superlattices, in conjunction with a dynamic recovery protocol that actively stabilizes the defect landscape throughout repeated cycling. Atomic-resolution imaging and EELS spectrum imaging technique, supported by first-principles calculations, reveal a self-regulated defect topology in which nitrogen vacancies are spatially confined by heterostructure energy barriers and dynamically re-trapped into energetically favorable lattice sites. This dual spatial-energetic confinement mechanism effectively inhibits both long-range percolative migration and local defect clustering, enabling such an ultrahigh endurance exceeding 10^10 cycles and limiting polarization degradation to below 3% after 10^9 cycles. These findings establish nitrogen vacancy topology stabilization as a foundational design principle for reliable operation of wurtzite ferroelectrics, providing a scalable and CMOS-compatible platform for future high-endurance ferroelectric memory technologies.

Title: Microscopic approach to the quantized light-matter interaction in semiconductor nanostructures: Complex coupled dynamics of excitons, biexcitons, and photons
Authors: Hendrik Rose, Stefan Schumacher, Torsten Meier
Abstract: We present a microscopic and fully quantized model to investigate the interaction between semiconductor nanostructures and quantum light fields including the many-body Coloumb interaction between photoexcited electrons and holes. Our approach describes the coupled dynamics of the quantum light field and single and double electron-hole pairs, i.e., excitons and biexcitons, and exactly accounts for Coulomb many-body correlations and carrier band dispersions. Using a simplified yet exact approach, we study a one-dimensional two-band system interacting with a single-mode, two-photon quantum state within a Tavis$\unicode{x2013}$Cummings framework. By employing an exact coherent factorization scheme, the computational complexity is reduced significantly enabling numerical simulations. We also derive a simplified model which includes only the bound $1s$-exciton and biexciton states for comparison. Our simulations reveal distinct single- and two-photon Rabi oscillations, corresponding to photon-exciton and exciton-biexciton transitions. We demonstrate, in particular, that biexciton continuum states significantly modify the dynamics in a way that cannot be captured by simplified models which consider only bound states. Our findings emphasize the importance of a comprehensive microscopic modeling in order to accurately describe quantum optical phenomena of interacting electronic many-body systems.

Title: Controllable Non-reciprocity in Multi-sphere Loaded Chiral Resonator
Authors: Maxime Ardisson, Guillaume Bourcin, Julien Haumant, Romain Lebrun, Isabella Boventer, Vincent Castel
Abstract: Cavity magnonics explores the hybridization of photons and magnons within microwave resonators. One of the hallmarks of these systems is their ability to exhibit non-reciprocity, which is a key feature for radio frequency (RF) applications. One way to control non-reciprocal behaviors in cavity magnonics is the design of chiral cavities that allow selective coupling between photons and magnons depending on their polarization. However, a built-in chiral platform to harness and control non-reciprocity remains to be achieved. Here, we experimentally demonstrate controllable non-reciprocity (with an absolute isolation ratio reaching 46 dB) in a chiral resonator loaded with multiple yttrium iron garnet spheres. We develop a theoretical model of the S-parameters based on input-output formalism which highlights the links between the phases occurring in the system and its non-reciprocal behavior. Controllable non-reciprocity in cavity magnonics could enable the development of programmable isolators, circulators, and RF switches with improved performance. Such developments could pave the way toward more versatile and scalable information processing systems.

Title: Coherent coupling of YBCO superconducting resonators and 100-nm-thick YIG films
Authors: Alberto Ghirri, Mattia Cavani, Claudio Bonizzoni, Marco Affronte
Abstract: In cavity magnonics, magnon-photon hybridization has been widely investigated for both fundamental studies and applications. Planar superconducting resonators operating at microwave frequencies have demonstrated the possibility to achieve high couplings with magnons by exploiting the confinement of the microwave field in a reduced volume. Here we report a study of the coupling of high-Tc YBCO superconducting waveguides with 100-nm-thick YIG magnetic films. We study the evolution of mode frequencies at different temperatures and extract the coupling strength of hybrid magnon-photon modes. We show that the experimental results can be reproduced using a simple model in which the temperature dependence of the penetration depth accounts for the evolution of the polaritonic spectrum.

Title: Symmetry oscillations sensitivity to SU(2)-symmetry breaking in quantum mixtures
Authors: S. Musolino, M. Albert, P. Vignolo, A. Minguzzi
Abstract: In one-dimensional bosonic quantum mixtures with SU(2)-symmetry breaking Hamiltonian, the dynamical evolution explores different particle exchange symmetry sectors. For the case of infinitely strong intra-species repulsion, the hallmark of such symmetry oscillations are time modulations of the momentum distribution [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 183402 (2024)], an observable routinely accessed in experiments with ultracold atoms. In this work we show that this phenomenon is robust in strongly interacting quantum mixtures with arbitrary inter-species to intra-species interaction strength ratio. Taking as initial state the ground state of the SU(2) symmetric Hamiltonian and time-evolving with the symmetry breaking Hamiltonian, we analyze how the amplitude and frequency of symmetry oscillations, and thus of the momentum distribution oscillations, depend on the strength of the symmetry-breaking perturbation. We find that the set of symmetry sectors which are coupled during the time evolution is dictated by the spin-flip symmetry of the initial state and show that the population of the initial state may vanish periodically, even in the thermodynamic limit, thus revealing the robustness and universality of the symmetry oscillations.

Title: From Density Functional Theory to Spin Hamiltonians: Magnetism in $d^5$ Honeycomb Compound OsCl$_3$
Authors: Ritwik Das, Indra Dasgupta
Abstract: Magnetism in strongly correlated honeycomb systems with $d^5$ electronic configuration has garnered significant attention due to its potential to realize the Kitaev spin liquid state, characterized by exotic properties. However, real materials exhibit not only Kitaev exchange interactions but also other magnetic exchanges, which may drive the transition from a spin liquid phase to a long-range ordered ground state. This work focuses on modelling the effective spin Hamiltonian for two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb magnetic systems with $d^5$ electronic configurations. The Hubbard-Kanamori (HK) Hamiltonian equipped with spin-orbit coupling and electron correlations is considered where onsite energies and hopping parameters, preserving the crystal symmetry, are extracted from the first principles Density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Exact diagonalization (ED) calculations for the HK Hamiltonian on a two-site cluster are performed to construct the effective magnetic Hamiltonian. The ground-state magnetic properties are explored using the semi-classical Luttinger-Tisza approach. As a representative case, the magnetic ground state of the $d^5$ honeycomb system OsCl$_3$ is investigated, and the variation of magnetic exchange parameters with respect to the correlation strength (U) and Hund's coupling ($J_H$) is analyzed. The magnetic ground state exhibits zigzag antiferromagnetic ordering for a chosen value of $U$ and $J_H$, consistent with DFT results. This study provides insight into the magnetism of OsCl$_3$ and offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional energy-based methods for calculating exchange interactions for strongly correlated systems.

Title: Signatures of rigidity and second sound in dipolar supersolids
Authors: G. A. Bougas, T. Bland, H. R. Sadeghpour, S. I. Mistakidis
Abstract: We propose a dynamical protocol to probe the rigidity and phase coherence of dipolar supersolids by merging initially separated fragments in quasi-one-dimensional (1D) double-well potentials. Simulations based on the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveal distinct dynamical signatures across phases. Supersolids exhibit damped crystal oscillations following barrier removal, with the damping rate reflecting superfluid connectivity. A phase-imprinted jump additionally triggers metastable dark solitons, which excites second sound, as revealed by an out-of-phase drift between the droplet lattice and the superfluid background. Our results show a realizable path to dynamically detect the second sound and rigidity of supersolids, as well as to realize and probe soliton formation.

Title: Long-range systems, (non)extensivity, and the rescaling of energies
Authors: Michael Kastner
Abstract: Systems with long-range interactions have seen a surge of interest in the past decades. In the wake of this surge, the use of a system size dependent rescaling, sometimes termed "Kac prescription," of the long-range pair potential has seen widespread use. This ad hoc modification of the Hamiltonian makes the energy extensive, but its physical justification and implications are a frequent source of confusion and misinterpretation. After all, in real physical $N$-body systems, the pair interaction strength does not scale with the number $N$ of constituents. This article presents, at an introductory level, scaling arguments that provide a clear physical interpretation of the "Kac prescription" for finite systems as well as in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Phase-modulated superconductivity via altermagnetism
Authors: Shuntaro Sumita, Makoto Naka, Hitoshi Seo
Abstract: Stimulated by recent interest in altermagnets, a novel class of antiferromagnets with macroscopic time-reversal symmetry breaking, we investigate the coexistence of altermagnetism and superconductivity. By developing a Ginzburg--Landau theory based on microscopic models, we show that a phase-modulated Fulde--Ferrell superconducting state is stabilized via altermagnetic spin splitting, in contrast to the typical amplitude-modulated states that occur under a uniform Zeeman field. We apply our framework to different models: a two-sublattice model with altermagnetic order, a continuum model with an anisotropic Zeeman field mimicking altermagnetic spin splitting, and a conventional square-lattice model with two kinds of anisotropic Zeeman fields. Our results indicate that the multi-sublattice structure is crucial for realizing this exotic superconductivity, and highlight spin-split altermagnets as a promising platform for exploring phase-modulated superconductivity without external magnetic fields.

Title: Dissipative Kondo physics in the Anderson Impurity Model with two-body losses
Authors: Matthieu Vanhoecke, Naoto Tsuji, Marco Schir√≤
Abstract: We study a dissipative version of the Anderson Impurity model, where an interacting impurity is coupled to a fermionic reservoir and exposed to Markovian dissipation in the form of two-body losses. Using a self-consistent hybridization expansion based on the Non-Crossing Approximation (NCA) we compute the dynamics of the impurity, its steady-state and spectral function. We show that the interplay between strong Coulomb repulsion and correlated dissipation gives rise to robust signatures of Kondo physics both at weak and strong losses. These include a strongly suppressed spin relaxation rate, displaying a characteristic Kondo-Zeno crossover and a spectral function where doublon band is quickly destroyed by dissipation while the coherent Kondo peak remains visible for weak losses, then disappears at intermediate values and finally re-emerge as the system enters in the Kondo-Zeno regime. As compared to the case of single particle losses we show that two-body dissipation protects Kondo physics. The picture obtained with NCA is confirmed by numerical simulations of exact dynamics on finite-size chains. We interpret these results using a dissipative Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, which leads to an effective Kondo model with residual impurity-bath losses which are suppressed by strong correlations or strong losses.

Title: Entropy of self-avoiding branching polymers: mean field theory and Monte Carlo simulations
Authors: Davide Marcato, Achille Giacometti, Amos Maritan, Angelo Rosa
Abstract: We study the statistics of branching polymers with excluded-volume interactions, by modeling them as single self-avoiding trees on a generic regular periodic lattice with coordination number $q$. Each lattice site can be occupied at most by one tree node, and the fraction of occupied sites can vary from dilute to dense conditions. By adopting the statistics of directed trees as a proxy for that of undirected trees without internal loops and by an exact mapping of the model into a field theory, we compute the entropy and the mean number of branch-nodes within a mean field approximation and in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we find that the mean number of branch-nodes is independent of both the lattice details and the lattice occupation, depending only on the associated chemical potential. Monte Carlo simulations in $d=2,3,4$ provide evidence of the remarkable accuracy of the mean field theory, more accurate for higher dimensions.

Title: Skyrmions of Frustrated Quantum Dimer Systems
Authors: Fletcher Williams, David Dahlbom, Hao Zhang, Shruti Agarwal, Kipton Barros, Cristian D. Batista
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected solitons observed in various classes of real magnets. In two-dimensional systems, where the target space of local magnetization values is the two-sphere $S^2$, skyrmion textures are classified by the homotopy classes of two-loops $S^2$ in $S^2$: $\Pi_2(S^2) \cong Z$. Here, we demonstrate that more general topological skyrmion textures emerge in the classical limit of quantum dimer systems, where the phase space of the relevant classical theory is $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ (with $N=4$ for the case of interest), because the relevant second homotopy group, $\Pi_2(\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}) \cong Z$ for $N\geq 2$, remains unchanged. Building on the framework established by Zhang et al. (2023), we consider a classical limit based on SU(4) coherent states, which preserve intra-dimer entanglement. We show that the zero-temperature phase diagram of frustrated spin-dimer systems on a bilayer triangular lattice with weak inter-dimer coupling includes two magnetic-field-induced $\mathbb{CP}^{3}$ skyrmion crystal phases.

Title: Site-polarized Mott phases competing with a correlated metal in twisted WSe$_2$
Authors: Siheon Ryee, Lennart Klebl, Gautam Rai, Ammon Fischer, Valentin Cr√©pel, Lede Xian, Angel Rubio, Dante M. Kennes, Roser Valent√≠, Andrew J. Millis, Antoine Georges, Tim O. Wehling
Abstract: Twisted WSe$_2$ hosts superconductivity, metal-insulator phase transitions, and field-controllable Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid transport properties. In this work, we use dynamical mean-field theory to provide a coherent understanding of the electronic correlations shaping the twisted WSe$_2$ phase diagram. We find a correlated metal competing with three distinct site-polarized correlated insulators; the competition is controlled by interlayer potential difference and interaction strength. The insulators are characterized by a strong differentiation between orbitals with respect to carrier concentration and effective correlation strength. Upon doping, a strong particle-hole asymmetry emerges, resulting from a Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen-type charge-transfer mechanism. The associated charge-transfer physics and proximity to a van Hove singularity in the correlated metal sandwiched between two site-polarized insulators naturally explains the interlayer potential-driven metal-to-insulator transition, particle-hole asymmetry in transport, and the coherence-incoherence crossover in $3.65^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$.

Title: Terahertz time-domain signatures of the inverse Edelstein effect in topological-insulator|ferromagnet heterostructures

Abstract: Three-dimensional topological insulators possess topologically protected surface states with spin-momentum locking, which enable spin-charge-current interconversion (SCI) by the inverse Edelstein effect (IEE). However, it remains experimentally challenging to separate the surface-related IEE from the bulk-type inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). Here, we search for distinct time-domain signatures of the two SCI phenomena in a $\mathcal{F}$|TI model stack of a ferromagnetic-metal layer $\mathcal{F}$ (Co and Fe) and a topological-insulator layer TI (Bi$_2$Te$_3$, SnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ with $x$ = 0.15 and 0.3), where the focus is on Bi$_2$Te$_3$. A femtosecond laser pulse serves to induce a transient spin voltage $\mu_s^{\mathcal{F}}$ in $\mathcal{F}$ and, thus, drive an ultrafast spin current out of $\mathcal{F}$. SCI results in a transverse charge current with a sheet density $I_c$ that is detected by sampling the emitted terahertz electric field. Analysis of the dynamics of $I_c(t)$ vs time $t$ relative to $\mu_s^{\mathcal{F}}(t)$ reveals two components with distinct time scales: (i) a quasi-instantaneous response and (ii) a longer-lived response with a relaxation time of 270 fs, which is independent of the chosen $\mathcal{F}$ material. Component (i) is consistently ascribed to the ISHE. In contrast, we interpret component (ii) as a signature of interfacial spin accumulation and the IEE at the $\mathcal{F}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ interface, with a fraction of $< 10^{-2}$ of the incident spins participating. This assignment is fully consistent with respect to its dynamics and magnitude. We rate other possible signal contributions, such as spin trapping in intermediate states, as less likely. Our results show that the femtosecond dynamics of photocurrents provide important insights into the mechanisms of spin transport and SCI in $\mathcal{F}$|TI stacks.

Title: Enhanced thermoelectric effects in a driven one-dimensional system
Authors: C. X. Zhang, Alessandro Braggio, Alessandro Romito, Fabio Taddei
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric properties of a one-dimensional quantum system in the presence of an external driving. We employ Floquet scattering theory to calculate linear-response stationary thermoelectric figures of merit in a single-channel conductor subjected to a periodically varying delta-like potential barrier. We include a step barrier in one of the leads as a model of a nanoscale inhomogeneous semiconducting system. In the absence of a step barrier, we found that the external driving can strongly enhance the Seebeck coefficient, particularly at low temperatures, with a relative increase with respect to the static condition reaching up to 200% at large frequencies. In the presence of a step barrier, we found that the thermoelectric Onsager coefficient for the driven case is also enhanced with respect to the static case with a significant effect at low temperatures when the chemical potential is within the gap of the semiconductor. Our results demonstrate that external driving can be used to tune and enhance the thermoelectric capabilities of low-electron-density nanodevices.

Title: Role of long-range dipolar interactions in the simulation of the properties of polar crystals using effective atomic potentials
Authors: Miao Yu, Fernando G√≥mez-Ortiz, Louis Bastogne, Jin-Zhu Zhao, Philippe Ghosez
Abstract: Driven by novel approaches and computational techniques, second-principles atomic potentials are nowadays at the forefront of computational materials science, enabling large-scale simulations of material properties with near-first-principles accuracy. However, their application to polar materials can be challenging, particularly when longitudinal-optical phonon modes are active on the material, as accurately modeling such systems requires incorporating the long-range part of the dipole-dipole interactions. In this study, we challenge the influence of these interactions on the properties of polar materials taking BaTiO$_3$ as paradigmatic example. By comparing models with and without the long-range part of the electrostatic contributions in a systematic way, we demonstrate that even if these interactions are neglected, the models can still provide an overall good description of the material, though they may lead to punctual significant artifacts. Our results propose a pathway to identify when an atomistic potential may be inadequate and needs to be corrected through the inclusion of the long-range part of dipolar interactions.

Title: Multislice Hollow Ptychography for Simultaneous Atomic-Layer-Resolved 3D Structural Imaging and Spectroscopy
Authors: Yu Lei, Peng Wang
Abstract: Electron matter interactions in electron microscopy produce both elastic and inelastic scattering, forming the basis for imaging and spectroscopy. However, the integration of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) with 4D-STEM and electron ptychography remains challenging because of detector geometry conflicts. Song et al. solved this issue by introducing a hollow type pixelated detector that enables hollow ptychography and allows low angle electrons to go through to the EELS spectrometer. The single-slice approach of hollow ptychography proves effective for 2D thin materials but struggles with multiple scattering in thicker specimens. Here, we introduce multislice hollow ptychography (MHP), a robust imaging modality that overcomes these limitations by accounting for multiple scattering. MHP enables high-resolution structural imaging from hollow diffraction patterns while remaining compatible with simultaneous EELS acquisition. It potentially can provide sub-angstrom lateral resolution at intermediate doses and supports full 3D atomic-layer reconstruction at ultrahigh doses, with up to 70% of total electrons available for spectroscopy. This flexible framework facilitates correlative 3D imaging and chemical mapping in complex materials, including interfaces, defects, and dopants.

Title: Topological Defect Propagation to Classify Knitted Fabrics
Authors: Daisuke S. Shimamoto, Keiko Shimamoto, Sonia Mahmoudi, Samuel Poincloux
Abstract: Knits and crochets are mechanical metamaterials with a long history and can typically be produced from a single yarn. Despite the simplicity of the manufacturing process, they exhibit a wide range of structural configurations with diverse mechanical properties and application potential. Although there has been recent growing interest in textile-based metamaterials, a rigorous topological characterization of what makes a structure knittable has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce a general criterion based on topological constraints that distinguishes knits and crochets from other textile structures. We demonstrate how the introduction of topological defects and their propagation makes this classification practical. Our approach highlights a fundamental link between manufacturing processes and structural fragility. Within this framework, we show how the rationalization of defect propagation unlocks the design of fabrics with controllable resistance to damage.

Title: Modeling the g-factors, hyperfine interaction and optical properties of semiconductor QDs: the atomistic and eight-band $k \cdot p$ approaches
Authors: Krzysztof Gawarecki, Alina Garbiec, Jakub Stanecki, Micha≈Ç Zieli≈Ñski
Abstract: We present a detailed comparative study of two important theoretical approaches: atomistic sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding and continuum eight-band $k \cdot p$ methods, for modeling the spin and optical properties of quantum dots (QDs). Our investigation spans key physical observables, including single-particle energy levels, g-factors, exciton radiative lifetimes, and hyperfine-induced Overhauser field fluctuations. We perform our calculations for self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs QD systems as representative case studies. While both methods yield qualitatively consistent trends, quantitative discrepancies arise due to different treatment of atomistic details, strain effects, and confinement. We introduce targeted corrections to the eight-band $k \cdot p$ framework, including a modified deformation potential scheme and adjusted remote-band contributions, to improve agreement with atomistic results, especially for electron g-factors and single-particle energies. Furthermore, we validate the eight-band implementation of hyperfine interactions by benchmarking it against the tight-binding model, showing reasonable convergence for both electrons and holes. Our results establish criteria for selecting the appropriate modeling framework based on the desired physical accuracy and computational efficiency in spin-optical studies of semiconductor QDs.

Title: Decoherence of Majorana qubits by 1/f noise
Authors: Abhijeet Alase, Marcus C. Goffage, Maja C. Cassidy, Susan N. Coppersmith
Abstract: Qubits based on Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have attracted intense interest as a platform for utility-scale quantum computing. These qubits have been predicted to show extremely low error rates due to topological protection of the MZMs, where decoherence processes have been thought to be exponentially suppressed by either the nanowire length or the temperature. However, here we show that 1/f noise, which is ubiquitous in semiconductors, gives rise to a previously unexplored mechanism for Majorana qubit decoherence. The high frequency components of this noise causes quasiparticle excitations in the bulk of the topological superconductor, which in turn result in qubit errors that increase with the length of the nanowire. We calculate the probability of quasiparticle excitation for disorder-free nanowires in the presence of 1/f noise and show that this mechanism limits the decoherence times of the MZM qubits currently being developed to less than a microsecond even for perfectly uniform nanowires with no disorder. This decoherence time is significantly shorter than the time to implement quantum gates using this technology and is also shorter than the decoherence times of qubits in other leading solid-state architectures.

Title: Spin Seebeck Effect of Triangular-lattice Spin Supersolid
Authors: Yuan Gao, Yixuan Huang, Sadamichi Maekawa, Wei Li
Abstract: Using our developed thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling of normalized spin current $\tilde{I}_S$ through the interface, and benchmark our approach on 1D Heisenberg chain, with the negative spinon spin current reproduced. In addition, we find an algebraic scaling $\tilde{I}_S \sim T^{\alpha}$ with varying exponent $\alpha$ in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with characteristic spin-current signatures distinguishing different magnetic phases. Remarkably, we discover a persistent spin current $\tilde{I}_S$ in the spin supersolid phase, which saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $\tilde{I}_S \sim T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits - particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence in SSE - provide sensitive experimental probes for investigating spin-supersolid compounds such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Moreover, our results establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.

Title: Quantum-geometric dipole: a topological boost to flavor ferromagnetism in flat bands
Authors: Lei Chen, Sayed Ali Akbar Ghorashi, Jennifer Cano, Valentin Cr√©pel
Abstract: Robust flavor-polarized phases are a striking hallmark of many flat-band moir√© materials. In this work, we trace the origin of this spontaneous polarization to a previously overlooked quantum-geometric quantity: the quantum-geometric dipole. Analogous to how the quantum metric governs the spatial spread of wavepackets, we show that the quantum-geometric dipole sets the characteristic size of particle-hole excitations, e.g. magnons in a ferromagnet, which in turn boosts their gap and stiffness. Indeed, the larger the particle-hole separation, the weaker the mutual attraction, and the stronger the excitation energy. In topological bands, this energy enhancement admits a lower bound within the single-mode approximation, highlighting the crucial role of topology in flat-band ferromagnetism. We illustrate these effects in microscopic models, emphasizing their generality and relevance to moir√© materials. Our results establish the quantum-geometric dipole as a predictive geometric indicator for ferromagnetism in flat bands, a crucial prerequisite for topological order.

Title: Structure-Property Correlations in Sb, Ge, and Ga Doped AlFe$_2$B$_2$ for Magnetocaloric Applications
Authors: R. Preyadarshini, S. Kavita, Ashutosh Kumar, D. Sivaprahasam
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of Sb, Ge, and Ga doping in AlFe$_2$B$_2$ on magnetic and magneto-caloric properties. Samples of AlFe$_2$B$_2$ and AlFe$_{1.9}$M$_{0.1}$B$_2$ (M= Ge, Ga and Sb) with 20\% excess Al were synthesized by arc melting, and the powder processed were investigated for their phase constituents, microstructure, magnetic and magneto-caloric effect. The parent compounds prepared showed the AlFe$_2$B$_2$ phase with a FeB secondary phase. However, in Sb and Ga-doped samples, an additional impurity phase, Al$_{13}$Fe$_4$, was observed apart from FeB, while in Ge-doped, only the AlB$_2$ impurity phase was present. The Curie temperature of AlFe$_2$B$_2$ is 277 K, increasing with Sb, Ge, and Ga doping to 287\,K, 297\,K, and 296\,K, respectively. The magnetization ($M$) is also higher with Ge and Ga addition in the 100-300\,K range; however, with Sb doping, the $M$ decreases significantly compared to parent AlFe$_2$B$_2$. The magnetic entropy change under 2\,T reached 2.93 JKg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ near 274\,K in AlFe$_2$B$_2$, which decreases to 2.53 JKg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ and 1.92 JKg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ with Ge and Ga, respectively. With Sb doping, the MC change was affected dramatically to 0.32 JKg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. However, the relative cooling power of Ge doped is the same as that of parent AlFe$_2$B$_2$. This research advances the understanding of the relationship between doping elements and magnetic properties in AlFe$_2$B$_2$ and opens pathways for designing magneto-caloric materials with tailored magnetic characteristics.

Title: Mesoscale properties of protein clusters determine the size and nature of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)
Authors: Gonen Golani, Manas Seal, Mrityunjoy Kar, Anthony A. Hyman, Daniella Goldfarb, Samuel Safran
Abstract: The observation of Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) in biological cells has dramatically shifted the paradigm that soluble proteins are uniformly dispersed in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. The LLPS region is preceded by a one-phase solution, where recent experiments have identified clusters in an aqueous solution with 102-103 proteins. Here, we theoretically consider a core-shell model with mesoscale core, surface, and bending properties of the cluster shell and contrast two experimental paradigms for the measured cluster size distributions of the Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding-4 (CPEB4) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) proteins. The fits to the theoretical model and earlier electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments suggest that the same protein may exhibit hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic conformations, which act to stabilize the clusters. We find that CPEB4 clusters are much more stable compared to FUS clusters, which are less energetically favorable. This suggests that in CPEB4, LLPS consists of large-scale aggregates of clusters, while for FUS, clusters coalesce to form micron-scale LLPS domains.

Title: Correlation Enhanced Electron-Phonon Coupling in FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ at a Magic Angle
Authors: Qiang Zou, Antik Sihi, Basu Dev Oli, Merc√® Roig, Daniel Agterberg, Michael Weinert, Lian Li, Subhasish Mandal
Abstract: While a predictive theory for unconventional superconductivity in Fe-based superconductors remains elusive, an extensively debated aspect is the interaction between phonons and strongly correlated electrons, and its potential role in the pairing mechanism. Here, through the combination of first principles dynamical mean field theory calculations and epitaxial growth of the single-layer FeX (X=Se, S, Te) on SrTiO$_3$ (STO)(001) substrate, which facilitates the controlled distortion of the FeX$_4$ tetrahedron, we demonstrate an unique superconducting dome where the superconducting gap peaks at a `magic' angle of the FeX$_4$ tetrahedron and the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) for the A$_{1g}$ mode is maximized for the FeSe film. Our findings uncover a significant role of electronic correlations in strengthening Cooper pairing in unconventional superconductors by enhancing EPC.

Title: The Chern character of the Laughlin vector bundle in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Semyon Klevtsov, Dimitri Zvonkine
Abstract: We begin by explaining how a physical problem of studying the quantum Hall effect on a closed surface $C$ leads, via Laughlin's approach, to a mathematical question of describing the rank and the first Chern class of a particular vector bundle on the Picard group ${\rm Pic}^g(C)$. Then we formulate and solve the problem mathematically, proving several important conjectures made by physicists, in particular the Wen-Niu topological degeneracy conjecture and the Wen-Zee shift formula. Let $C$ be a closed Riemann surface of genus~$g$ and $S^NC$ its $N$th symmetric power. The product $C \times {\rm Pic}^d(C)$ carries a universal line bundle. On the product $C^N \times {\rm Pic}^d(C)$ we consider the product of $N$ pull-backs of this universal line bundle and twist it by a power of the diagonal on $C^N$. The resulting line bundle descends onto $S^NC \times {\rm Pic}^d(C)$. Its push-forward (as a sheaf) to ${\rm Pic}^d(C)$ is a vector bundle that we call Laughlin's vector bundle. We determine all the Chern characters of the Laughlin vector bundle via a Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch calculation.

Title: Pressure dependence of liquid iron viscosity from machine-learning molecular dynamics
Authors: Kai Luo, Xuyang Long, R. E. Cohen
Abstract: We have developed a machine-learning potential that accurately models the behavior of iron under the conditions of Earth's core. By performing numerous nanosecond scale equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, the viscosities of liquid iron for the whole outer core conditions are obtained with much less uncertainty. We find that the Einstein-Stokes relation is not accurate for outer core conditions. The viscosity is on the order of 10s \si{mPa.s}, in agreement with previous first-principles results. We present a viscosity map as a function of pressure and temperature for liquid iron useful for geophysical modeling.

Title: Heavy-Heavy-Light Asymptotics from Thermal Correlators
Authors: Ilija Buriƒá, Francesco Mangialardi, Francesco Russo, Volker Schomerus, Alessandro Vichi
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of spectral densities and heavy-heavy-light (HHL) operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients in three-dimensional conformal field theories using thermal one-point functions on $S^1 \times S^2$. A central element of our analysis is a new inversion formula for one-point functions which is derived via Casimir differential equations. We develop systematic expansions of the spectral density and HHL OPE coefficients in the regime of large $\Delta_H$. We validate our analytic tools by comparing the results with the partial wave expansions of thermal one-point functions in free field theories. The algorithms developed for these expansions make full use of Casimir recursion relations, thereby extending their applicability into the heavy exchange regime. In the end, we observe excellent agreement with our analytic predictions and an improvement of up to three orders of magnitude compared to all previous leading order estimates of the CFT data even for moderate values of $\Delta_H$.

Title: Multi-task parallelism for robust pre-training of graph foundation models on multi-source, multi-fidelity atomistic modeling data
Authors: Massimiliano Lupo Pasini, Jong Youl Choi, Pei Zhang, Kshitij Mehta, Rylie Weaver, Ashwin M. Aji, Karl W. Schulz, Jorda Polo, Prasanna Balaprakash
Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable, efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions. Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging, yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration. Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.

Title: Physics-informed neural network framework for solving forward and inverse flexoelectric problems
Authors: Hyeonbin Moon, Donggeun Park, Jinwook Yeo, Seunghwa Ryu
Abstract: Flexoelectricity, the coupling between strain gradients and electric polarization, poses significant computational challenges due to its governing fourth-order partial differential equations that require C1-continuous solutions. To address these issues, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework grounded in an energy-based formulation that treats both forward and inverse problems within a unified architecture. The forward problem is recast as a saddle-point optimization of the total potential energy, solved via the deep energy method (DEM), which circumvents the direct computation of high-order derivatives. For the inverse problem of identifying unknown flexoelectric coefficients from sparse measurements, we introduce an additional variational loss that enforces stationarity with respect to the electric potential, ensuring robust and stable parameter inference. The framework integrates finite element-based numerical quadrature for stable energy evaluation and employs hard constraints to rigorously enforce boundary conditions. Numerical results for both direct and converse flexoelectric effects show excellent agreement with mixed-FEM solutions, and the inverse model accurately recovers material parameters from limited data. This study establishes a unified, mesh-compatible, and scalable PINN approach for high-order electromechanical problems, offering a promising alternative to traditional simulation techniques.

Title: Implementation and representation of qudit multi-controlled unitaries and hypergraph states by many-body angular momentum couplings
Authors: F. E. S. Steinhoff
Abstract: We construct a representation of qudit multi-controlled unitary operators in terms of many-body angular momentum interactions. The representation is particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism. We illustrate the main points in the special case of qutrits, where simplifications and connections to dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be established. We describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum representation.

Title: Kinetic theories: from curved space to flat space
Authors: Shu Lin
Abstract: We show how to map kinetic theories for spinning particles in curved space to flat space through choice of inertial frame that eliminate forces acting on momentum and spin, thus putting the idea of mimicking off-equilibrium state by metric perturbation to equilibrium state on firm ground. The equivalence has been shown for hydrodynamic and elastic regimes. In the latter case, we predict spin polarization induced by time-variation of strain in elastic matter.

Title: First-order nuclear dipolar order in rotating solids
Authors: Kohei Suzuki, Kazuyuki Takeda
Abstract: Nuclear spins' dipolar order is created under magic angle spinning through the first-order process made possible by simultaneous implementation of dipolar recoupling and adiabatic demagnetization in a reference frame reached out through nested transformations, firstly from the laboratory frame into the rotating frame, and then into the spin coordinate system nutating inside its parent frame. In such a nutating frame, both the static and resonantly rotating radio-frequency (RF) fields are invisible, and the re-introduced dipolar interaction provides a secular eigenstate on which dipolar order develops with assist of an additional portion of RF field designed to implement adiabatic demagnetization in the nutating frame.

Title: Practical roadmap to measurement-altered criticality in Rydberg arrays
Authors: Stephen Naus, Yue Liu, Sara Murciano, Pablo Sala, Manuel Endres, Jason Alicea
Abstract: Weak measurements have been predicted to dramatically alter universal properties of quantum critical wavefunctions, though experimental validation remains an open problem. Here we devise a practical scheme for realizing measurement-altered criticality in a chain of Rydberg atoms tuned to Ising and tricritical Ising phase transitions. In particular, we show that projectively measuring a periodic subset of atoms alters quantum critical correlations in distinct ways that one can control via the choice of measured sites and the measurement outcomes. While our protocol relies on post-selection, the measurement outcomes yielding the most dramatic consequences occur with surprisingly large probabilities: O(10%) with chains featuring O(100) sites. Characterizing the proposed post-measurement states requires only an adjustment in the post-process averaging of outcomes used to characterize unmeasured critical states, resulting in minimal additional experimental overhead for demonstrating measurement-altered criticality.

Title: Ecosystems as adaptive living circuits
Authors: Ankit Dhanuka, Avi I. Flamholz, Arvind Murugan, Akshit Goyal
Abstract: Unlike many physical nonequilibrium systems, in biological systems, the coupling to external energy sources is not a fixed parameter but adaptively controlled by the system itself. We do not have theoretical frameworks that allow for such adaptability. As a result, we cannot understand emergent behavior in living systems where structure formation and non-equilibrium drive coevolve. Here, using ecosystems as a model of adaptive systems, we develop a framework of living circuits whose architecture changes adaptively with the energy dissipated in each circuit edge. We find that unlike traditional nonequilibrium systems, living circuits exhibit a phase transition from equilibrium death to a nonequilibrium dissipative state beyond a critical driving potential. This transition emerges through a feedback mechanism that saves the weakest edges by routing dissipation through them, even though the adaptive rule locally rewards the strongest dissipating edges. Despite lacking any global optimization principle, living circuits achieve near-maximal dissipation, with higher drive promoting more complex circuits. Our work establishes ecosystems as paradigmatic examples of living circuits whose structure and dissipation are tuned through local adaptive rules.

Title: Dipoles and Anyonic Directional Confinement via Twisted Toric Codes
Authors: Jose Garre Rubio
Abstract: We introduce a modified 2D toric code Hamiltonian that exhibits explicit anyon confinement along a single spatial direction. By bounding the motion of these confined anyons, we obtain dipolar excitations with restricted mobility. We analyze the resulting logical operators, whose existence depends on the system size, as well as the structure of gapped boundaries and a tensor network representation of the ground state. Furthermore, when confinement is enforced in both directions, fractal-like excitations emerge, resulting in unpaired logical operators. We extend our construction to 3D models, such as the surface code and the X-cube model, leading to novel dipole-loop and dipole-planon excitations that arise from bounding confined excitations. These modifications are implemented through group cohomological twistings--projective representations of finite groups--with most examples based on Z2xZ2.

Title: Complete insensitivity to ab initio data -- A new perspective on modeling collision-induced absorption of noble gas atoms
Authors: Nikhila Ambika Chandran, Tijs Karman
Abstract: In this study, we systematically investigate how the accuracy of CIA spectra depends on the quality of the ab initio data used. We evaluate quantitatively the impact of different quantum chemical methods and basis sets on spectral features, finding that even the lowest-level calculations are accurate to approximately 10 % at room temperature, and better at higher temperatures. This study also reveals a previously unreported double-peak structure for the He-Ne complex, which cannot be described by simple but commonly used single-exponential models for the short-range dipole. Our analysis shows that the range of internuclear distances relevant for CIA spectra varies with temperature, with short-range interactions becoming increasingly important at high temperatures. The long-range van der Waals induced dipoles never contribute. These findings provide new insights into the temperature-dependent behavior of CIA spectra and emphasize the importance of accurate modeling of short-range interactions for reliable astronomical modeling.

Title: Macroscopic fluctuation theory from a Lagrangian viewpoint and the Schr√∂dinger problem
Authors: L. Bertini, D. Gabrielli, G. Jona-Lasinio
Abstract: We formulate the Schr√∂dinger problem for interacting particle systems in the hydrodynamical regime thus extending the standard setting of independent particles. This involves the large deviations rate function for the empirical measure which is in fact a richer observable than the hydrodynamic observables density and current. In the case in which the constraints are the initial and final density, we characterize the optimal measure for the Schr√∂dinger problem. We also introduce versions of the Schr√∂dinger problem in which the constraints are related to the current and analyze the corresponding optimal measures.

Title: Code CFTs and Topological Matter
Authors: E.H Saidi, R. Sammani
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for modeling topological phases of matter using code-based Narain conformal field theories (NCFTs). We show that the algebraic structure of the NCFTs naturally embeds into critical lattice quantum field theory, yielding emergent topological features characteristic of gapless fermionic systems with non-zero Chern numbers. We develop a new representation of construction A of code CFT in terms of root and weight lattices of Lie algebras, focusing in particular on SU(2) and SU(3). We then derive the spectrum of particle states occupying the lattice and, with the help of fermionisation techniques, demonstrate that it hosts fermionic excitations with Dirac cones akin to tight binding systems namely the Haldane model of quantum anomalous hall effect on a honeycomb geometry.

Title: Perfect quantum state transfer through a chaotic spin chain via many-body scars
Authors: Shane Dooley, Luke Johnston, Patrick Gormley, Beth Campbell
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) offer a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, enabling non-thermal dynamics to persist in a chaotic many-body system. While most studies of QMBS focus on anomalous eigenstate properties or long-lived revivals of local observables, their potential for quantum information processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that \emph{perfect quantum state transfer} can be achieved in a strongly interacting, quantum chaotic spin chain by exploiting a sparse set of QMBS eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum. These results show that QMBS in chaotic many-body systems may be harnessed for information transport tasks typically associated with integrable models.

Title: Boosting Classification with Quantum-Inspired Augmentations
Authors: Matthias Tsch√∂pe, Vitor Fortes Rey, Sogo Pierre Sanon, Paul Lukowicz, Nikolaos Palaiodimopoulos, Maximilian Kiefer-Emmanouilidis
Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5 accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy and discuss the implications of this limitation.

Title: Two types of compressible isotropic neo-Hookean material models
Authors: Sergey N. Korobeynikov, Alexey Yu. Larichkin, Patrizio Neff
Abstract: In this book, we present a systematic study of the performance of two known types of compressible generalization of the incompressible neo-Hookean material model. The first type of generalization is based on the development of \emph{vol-iso} neo-Hookean models and involves the additive decomposition of the elastic energy into volumetric and isochoric parts. The second simpler type of generalization is based on the development of \emph{mixed} neo-Hookean models that do not use this decomposition. Theoretical studies of model performance and simulations of some homogeneous deformations have shown that when using volumetric functions $(J^q+J^{-q}-2)/(2q^2)$ ($J$ is the volume ratio, and $q\in \mathbb{R}$ is a parameter, $q\geq 0$) from the Hartmann--Neff family [Hartmann and Neff, Int. J. Solids Structures, 40: 2767--2791 (2003)] with parameter $q\geq 2$ (the preferred value is $q=5$), mixed and vol-iso models show similar performance in applications and have physically reasonable responses in extreme states, which is convenient for theoretical studies. However, contrary to vol-iso models, mixed models allow the use of a wider set of volumetric functions with physically reasonable responses in extreme states. A further feature of mixed models is simpler expressions for stresses and tangent stiffness tensors.

Title: Investigation of three-body F√∂rster resonance for various spatial configurations of the three interacting Rubidium Rydberg atoms
Authors: I.I.Ryabtsev, I.N.Ashkarin, I.I.Beterov, E.A.Yakshina, D.B.Tretyakov, V.M.Entin, P.Cheinet
Abstract: Three-body F√∂rster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms captured in optical traps and laser-excited into strongly interacting Rydberg states. In Ref. [P. Cheinet et al., Quantum Electronics 50(3), 213 (2020)], we proposed and analyzed a new type of three-body F√∂rster resonance ${\rm 3}\times nP_{3/2} \to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2}$ that can be realized with Rb Rydberg atoms for an arbitrary principal quantum number $n$. Its peculiarity is that the third atom goes into a state with a total angular moment $J=1/2$, which has no Stark structure, so two-body F√∂rster resonances are completely absent. In the present work, an extended theoretical study of this three-body F√∂rster resonance is performed for various spatial configurations of three interacting Rb Rydberg atoms and conditions for their experimental implementation are determined. It was found that one of the resonances has a weak dependence of the resonant electric field on the distance between atoms and is therefore most suitable for performing experiments to observe coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and implement three-qubit quantum gates based on them.

Title: Correcting astigmatism and ellipticity in Gaussian beams using a cylindrical lens pair with tunable focal lengths
Authors: Soroush Khoubyarian, Anastasiia Mashko, Alexandre Cooper
Abstract: Correcting astigmatism and ellipticity in laser beams is critical for improving performance in many applications like microscopy, atomic physics, quantum information processing, and advanced manufacturing. Passive correction methods based on cylindrical lens telescopes require choosing lenses with precise focal lengths, effectively limiting the range of tunability when using standard catalog optics. Active solutions based on diffractive optical elements can achieve superior performance, but they are bulky, expensive, and suffer from finite diffraction efficiency and added complexity. Here, we introduce a simple method to convert astigmatic elliptical beams into circular Gaussian beams without astigmatism. Our method comprises three cylindrical lenses. The first lens focuses the beam along its major axis to create a plane where the intensity profile is radially symmetric. The second and third lenses are placed one behind the other in that plane at a relative angle, acting as a biaxial lens pair with tunable focal lengths. By adjusting the relative angle of the lenses, the two separate beam waists of the astigmatic beam can be overlapped, resulting in a circular Gaussian beam without astigmatism. We theoretically validate our method, numerically quantify its robustness to experimental imperfections, and experimentally demonstrate its ability to circularize the output beam of a commercial laser source. Our method corrects astigmatism and ellipticity in laser beams without requiring precise focal length matching, offering greater flexibility than other passive solutions and greater cost-effectiveness than active methods. Its simple and compact design makes it well suited for integration into both tabletop optical setups and industrial systems.

Title: Towards Distributed Neural Architectures
Authors: Aditya Cowsik, Tianyu He, Andrey Gromov
Abstract: We introduce and train distributed neural architectures (DNA) in vision and language domains. DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts, Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.

Title: General many-body entanglement swapping protocol
Authors: Santeri Huhtanen, Yousef Mafi, Ali G. Moghaddam, Teemu Ojanen
Abstract: Sharing entangled pairs between non-signaling parties via entanglement swapping constitutes a striking demonstration of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics and a crucial building block for future quantum technologies. In this work, we generalize pair-swapping methods by introducing a many-body entanglement swapping protocol, which allows two non-signaling parties to share general many-body states along an arbitrary partitioning. The shared many-body state retains exactly the same Schmidt vectors as the target state and exhibits typically high fidelity, which approaches unity as the variance of the Schmidt coefficients vanishes. The cost of many-body swapping - arising from postselection in a third-party measurement - is determined by the 3rd R√©nyi entanglement entropy of the partitioning. We provide a proof of concept of the protocol on real quantum hardware and discuss how it enables new functionalities, such as flexible sharing of complex multi-qubit states and fault-tolerant entanglement swapping.

Title: Is Lindblad for me?
Authors: Martino Stefanini, Aleksandra A. Ziolkowska, Dmitry Budker, Ulrich Poschinger, Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler, Antoine Browaeys, Atac Imamoglu, Darrick Chang, Jamir Marino
Abstract: The Lindblad master equation is a foundational tool for modeling the dynamics of open quantum systems. As its use has extended far beyond its original domain, the boundaries of its validity have grown opaque. In particular, the rise of new research areas including open quantum many-body systems, non-equilibrium condensed matter, and the possibility to test its limits in driven-open quantum simulators, call for a critical revision of its regimes of applicability. In this pedagogical review, we re-examine the folklore surrounding its three standard approximations (Born, Markov, and Rotating Wave Approximation), as we build our narrative by employing a series of examples and case studies accessible to any reader with a solid background on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. As a synthesis of our work, we offer a checklist that contrasts common lore with refined expectations, offering a practical guideline for assessing the breakdown of the Lindblad framework in the problem at hand.

Title: Hybrid symmetry class topological insulators
Authors: Sanjib Kumar Das, Bitan Roy
Abstract: Traditional topological materials belong to different Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes (AZSCs) depending on their non-spatial symmetries. Here we introduce the notion of hybrid symmetry class topological insulators (HSCTIs): A fusion of two different AZSC topological insulators (TIs) such that they occupy orthogonal Cartesian hyperplanes and their universal massive Dirac Hamiltonian mutually anticommute, a mathematical procedure we name hybridization. The boundaries of HSCTIs can also harbor TIs, typically affiliated with an AZSC that is different from the ones for the parent two TIs. As such, a fusion or hybridization between planar class AII quantum spin Hall and vertical class BDI Su-Schrieffer-Heeger insulators gives birth to a three-dimensional class A HSCTI, accommodating quantum anomalous Hall insulators (class A) of opposite Chern numbers and quantized Hall conductivity of opposite signs on the top and bottom surfaces. Such a response is shown to be stable against weak disorder. We extend this construction to encompass crystalline HSCTI and topological superconductors (featuring half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity of opposite sings on the top and bottom surfaces), and beyond three spatial dimensions. Non-trivial responses of three-dimensional HSCTIs to crystal defects (namely edge dislocations) in terms of mid-gap bound states at zero energy around its core only on the top and bottom surfaces are presented.

Title: Swapping exchange and spin-orbit induced correlated phases in proximitized Bernal bilayer graphene
Authors: Yaroslav Zhumagulov, Denis Kochan, Jaroslav Fabian
Abstract: Ex-so-tic van der Waals heterostructures take advantage of the electrically tunable layer polarization to swap proximity exchange and spin-orbit coupling in the electronically active region. Perhaps the simplest example is Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG) encapsulated by a layered magnet from one side and a strong spin-orbit material from the other. Taking WS$_2$/BBG/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ as a representative ex-so-tronic device, we employ realistic \emph{ab initio}-inspired Hamiltonians and effective electron-electron interactions to investigate the emergence of correlated phases within the random phase approximation. We find that for a given doping level, exchange and spin-orbit coupling induced Stoner and intervalley coherence instabilities can be swapped, allowing to explore the full spectrum of correlated phases within a single device.

Title: Boundary phase transitions of two-dimensional quantum critical XXZ model
Authors: Hong-Hao Song, Long Zhang
Abstract: The boundary critical behavior of the two-dimensional (2D) quantum antiferromagnetic (AF) XXZ model coupled with either a dangling spin-1/2 XXZ chain or a dangling two-leg ladder on the boundary is studied with the bosonization and renormalization group analysis. A rich boundary phase diagram is obtained in each case. In the dangling chain case, the boundary either develops a long-range AF order in the easy-plane or the easy-axis direction with extraordinary critical behavior, or has a valence bond solid order with ordinary boundary critical behavior. In the case of a dangling two-leg ladder, besides the possible easy-plane or easy-axis AF ordered phases on the boundary with extraordinary critical behavior, the boundary can form a singlet phase with ordinary critical behavior without breaking any symmetry. These results are consistent with recent numerical simulations on the boundary critical behavior of 2D quantum spin models.

Title: Spring-block theory of feature learning in deep neural networks
Authors: Cheng Shi, Liming Pan, Ivan Dokmaniƒá
Abstract: Feature-learning deep nets progressively collapse data to a regular low-dimensional geometry. How this emerges from the collective action of nonlinearity, noise, learning rate, and other factors, has eluded first-principles theories built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. We exhibit a noise-nonlinearity phase diagram that identifies regimes where shallow or deep layers learn more effectively and propose a macroscopic mechanical theory that reproduces the diagram and links feature learning across layers to generalization.

Title: Spectroscopic Feature of Quantum Many-Body Scar States
Authors: Wenjie Wei, Long Zhang
Abstract: We study the dynamical correlations of nonintegrable systems with quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states generated by a ladder operator. The spectral function of the ladder operator has an exact $\delta$-function peak induced by the QMBS states. As a concrete example, we show that in the one-dimensional (1D) spin-$1$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, the spectral function of two-magnon excitations exhibits a characteristic bow-tie shape composed of a $\delta$-function resonance peak at momentum $k=\pi$ and a continuum spectrum elsewhere. The two-magnon excitations can be observed with the resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy on quasi-1D nickelates and other spin-$1$ antiferromagnetic materials, thus it paves the way to detecting the (approximate) QMBS states in realistic materials.

Title: Strong anharmonicity dictates ultralow thermal conductivities of type-I clathrates
Authors: Dipti Jasrasaria, Timothy C. Berkelbach
Abstract: Type-I clathrate solids have attracted significant interest due to their ultralow thermal conductivities and subsequent promise for thermoelectric applications, yet the mechanisms underlying these properties are not well understood. Here, we extend the framework of vibrational dynamical mean-field theory (VDMFT) to calculate temperature-dependent thermal transport properties of $X_8$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$, where $X=$ Ba, Sr, using a many-body Green's function approach. We find that nonresonant scattering between cage acoustic modes and rattling modes leads to a reduction of acoustic phonon lifetimes and thus thermal conductivities. Moreover, we find that the moderate temperature dependence of conductivities above 300 K, which is consistent with experimental measurements, cannot be reproduced by standard perturbation theory calculations, which predict a $T^{-1}$ dependence. Therefore, we conclude that nonperturbative anharmonic effects, including four- and higher-phonon scattering processes, are responsible for the ultralow thermal conductivities of type-I clathrates.

Title: Entangling color centers via magnon-antimagnon pair creation
Authors: Eric Kleinherbers, Shane P. Kelly, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak
Abstract: We present how entanglement between a spatially separated pair of color centers can be created by letting them weakly interact with the quantum fluctuations of a nonequilibrium magnetic environment. To this end, we consider two coupled ferromagnets, one in the ground state and one in an inverted state with respect to an applied magnetic field. The resulting energetic instability leads to a quantum spin current in the vacuum state that is sustained by the creation of magnon-antimagnon pairs at the interface. We show that these quantum fluctuations imprint a steady-state entanglement onto the two dipole-coupled color centers through nonlocal dissipation. We derive conditions for establishing a maximally entangled Bell state. This entanglement is absent in thermal equilibrium.

Title: Chirally-protected state manipulation by tuning one-dimensional statistics
Authors: F. Theel, M. Bonkhoff, P. Schmelcher, T. Posske, N. L. Harshman
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is broken by typical interactions in lattice models, but the statistical interactions embodied in the anyon-Hubbard model are an exception. This is an example for a correlated hopping model where chiral symmetry protects a degenerate zero-energy subspace. Complementary to the traditional approach of anyon braiding in real space, we adiabatically evolve the statistical parameter and find non-trivial Berry phases and holonomies in this chiral subspace. The corresponding states possess stationary checkerboard patterns in their $N$-particle densities which are preserved under adiabatic manipulation. We give an explicit protocol for how these chirally-protected zero-energy states can be prepared, observed, validated, and controlled.

Title: Unveiling the multiband metallic nature of the normal state in nickelate La3Ni2O7
Authors: Bowen Chen, Hengyuan Zhang, Jingyuan Li, Deyuan Hu, Mengwu Huo, Shuyang Wang, Chuanying Xi, Zhaosheng Wang, Hualei Sun, Meng Wang, Bing Shen
Abstract: The discovery of unconventional superconductivity around 80 K in perovskite nickelates under high pressure has furnished a new platform to explore high-temperature unconventional superconductivity in addition to cuprates. Understanding the normal state of nickelate superconductors is crucial to uncovering the origin of this unconventional superconductivity and gaining further insight into its underlying mechanism. In this study, we systemically studied the transport properties of La3Ni2O7 by tuning the pressure under high magnetic fields. Magnetoresistance (MR) consistently exhibits a quasi-quadratic dependence on the magnetic field across all measured pressures and temperatures. Increased pressure enhances the metallicity of the system and leads to a monotonic increase in MR, which follows the extended Kohler's rule. These results suggest that the normal state of La3Ni2O7 to be a multiband metallic nature.

Title: Thermodynamic Circuits: Association of thermoelectric converters in stationary non-equilibrium
Authors: Paul Raux, Christophe Goupil, Gatien Verley
Abstract: Following up on the recently published circuit theory for thermodynamic devices, we consider networks of Thermo-Electric Converters (TECs) in stationary non-equilibrium. Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.

Title: Deterministic role of chemical bonding in the formation of altermagnetism: Reflection from correlated electron system NiS
Authors: Arijit Mandal, Arindom Das, B.R.K. Nanda
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new collinear magnetic state, has gained significant attention in the last few years, and the underlying mechanisms driving this quantum phase are still evolving. Going beyond the group theoretical analyses, which focus on providing a binary description of the presence or absence of the altermagnetic state, in this work, we explore the role of crystal chemical bonding. As the latter successfully integrates the crystal and orbital symmetries and is tunable, it provides a quantitative and realistic mechanism to explain the formation of altermagnetism. From the first principles calculations and tight-binding models within the framework of the linear combination of atomic orbitals on NiS, we establish a set of selection rules for the formation of altermagnetism in the NiAs prototype compounds (e.g. CrSb, MnTe, etc.). Broadly, if single orbitals from Ni and S sites are involved in the bonding, the second neighbor interaction between the nonmagnetic atoms is a must to modulate the intra-sublattice interactions differently for the opposite spin sublattices so that the antiferromagnetic sublattice band degeneracy is lifted and momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin split (AMSS) appears. However, when multiple orbitals are involved from the Ni and S sites in the chemical bonding, altermagnetism is naturally present. Together, they amplify the AMSS. Further, we propose twelve antinodal regions in the NiAs type hexagonal crystals, where AMSS split is maximum. Specific to NiS, AMSS increases with correlation, and for the edge valence and conduction bands, it can go beyond 1eV. The present study opens up new pathways to design chemical bonding driven selection rules in addition to the existing crystal symmetry criteria to tailor tunable altermagnetism.

Title: Two Channel Multi impurity Kondo model
Authors: A. M. Tsvelik, G. Kotliar
Abstract: We show that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasua-Yoisida interaction between overscreened spins in two channel Kondo impurity systems is a relevant perturbation when the number of impurities N is greater than 3 driving the system to a new quantum critical point with anomalous dimensions $\frac{1}{ (N+1)} $ for the spin operator and the Sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat scales as $\gamma \sim T^{- \frac{3}{N+1}}$. The critical point universal properties are relevant to many strong correlation problems, such as impurity placed in a Majorana metal and the multichannel Kondo lattice model of heavy fermion materials. We discuss relevance of our results for cluster DMFT studies of quantum criticality.

Title: Thermal response functions and second sound in single-layer hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Patrick K. Schelling, Antonio Martinez Margolles, Logan Echazabal
Abstract: Ballistic heat transport and second sound propagation in solids is of direct relevance in electronic and energy applications at short length scales and low temperatures. Measurement or calculation of thermal conductivity, which is typically a primary objective, may be of limited usefulness for predicting heat transport which does not follow the heat-diffusion equation. In this paper, molecular-dynamics simulations of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are used to compute thermal response functions from equilibrium correlation functions defined in Fourier space. The response functions are useful for describing the time-dependent transport beyond the usual assumptions of Fourier's law. The results demonstrate that for length scales ~110nm at T=100K second sound should be experimentally observable. At higher temperatures and longer length scales, while second sound may not be directly observable, thermal transport can nevertheless strongly deviate from predictions based on the heat-diffusion equation. Along with classical simulations, we outline a first-principles, many-body theoretical approach for calculation of the response function based on solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The relevant expressions for heat current clarify the importance of phase coherence within a phonon branch to the observation of second sound. Previous work on one-dimensional chains is also discussed to show that materials characterized by linear dispersion and simple phonon band structure should more readily display second sound.

Title: Transparent Graphene-Superconductor Interfaces: Quantum Hall and Zero Field Regimes
Authors: Alexey Bondarev, Gu Zhang, Harold U. Baranger
Abstract: We study clean, edge-contacted graphene/superconductor interfaces in both the quantum Hall (QH) and zero field regimes. We find that Andreev reflection is substantially stronger than at an interface with a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas: the large velocity at graphene's conical Dirac points makes the requirement of current continuity to a metal much less restrictive. In both our tight-binding and continuum models, we find a wide range of parameters for which Andreev reflection is strong. For a transparent interface, we demonstrate the following for graphene in the lowest Landau level QH state: (i) Excellent electron-hole hybridization occurs: the electron and hole components in graphene are simply related by an exchange of sublattice. The spatial profile for the electron component is predominantly gaussian on one sublattice and peaked at the interface, and so very different from the QH edge state of a terminated lattice. (ii) The degree of hybridization is independent of the graphene filling: no fine-tuning is needed. (iii) The spectrum is valley degenerate: the dispersion of each chiral Andreev edge mode (CAEM) self-aligns to be antisymmetric about the center of each valley, independent of filling. Achieving a transparent interface requires the absence of any barrier as well as a superconductor that is suitably matched to graphene; we argue that the latter condition is not very stringent. We further consider the effect of reduced transparency and Zeeman splitting on both the wavefunctions of the CAEM and their dispersion.

Title: Strong-coupling high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity in doped correlated band insulators
Authors: Yusuke Nomura, Motoharu Kitatani, Shiro Sakai, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: We explore the superconducting properties of the bilayer Hubbard model, which exhibits a high transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) for an $s_{\pm}$ pairing, using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory. Unlike the single-layer Hubbard model, where the $d$-wave superconductivity emerges by doping the Mott insulator, the parent state of the bilayer system is a correlated band insulator. Above $T_{\rm c}$, slight hole (electron) doping introduces a striking dichotomy between electron and hole pockets: the electron (hole) pocket develops a pseudogap while the other becomes a nearly incipient band. We reveal that the superconductivity is driven by kinetic (potential) energy gain in the underdoped (overdoped) region. We also find a very short coherence length, for which we argue the relevance to multi-orbital physics. Our study offers crucial insights into the superconductivity in the bilayer Hubbard model potentially relevant to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Self-assembly of Dipolar Crystals from Magnetic Colloids
Authors: Anuj Kumar Singh, Sanjay Puri, Varsha Banerjee
Abstract: We study the self-assembly of magnetic colloids using the Stockmayer (SM) model characterized by short-range Lennard-Jones interactions and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we design cooling protocols that yield perfectly assembled single-domain magnetic crystals. We identify cooling rates at which the system transforms from an amorphous glass to a crystal, where magnetic ordering promotes crystalline order. Remarkably, we observe that the latter develops via a spontaneous transition rather than through the traditional nucleation and growth mechanism. For a weakly dipolar fluid ($\mu=1$), this self-assembly results in a face-centered cubic (FCC) colloidal crystal with dipole moments chained along the (111) direction. For fluids with higher dipole moment ($\mu = 2.5$), the crystal structure shifts towards a body-centered orthorhombic (BCO) arrangement due to the compression of chains from strong dipolar attractions. These results provide valuable insights into the mechanisms driving crystallization in magnetic fluids, opening new avenues for understanding the formation of magnetically responsive colloidal magnetic crystals with promising applications.

Title: Symplectic-Amoeba formulation of the non-Bloch band theory for one-dimensional two-band systems
Authors: Shin Kaneshiro, Robert Peters
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is a topological phenomenon, resulting in the condensation of bulk modes near the boundaries. Due to the localization of bulk modes at the edges, boundary effects remain significant even in the thermodynamic limit. This makes conventional Bloch band theory inapplicable and hinders the accurate computation of the spectrum. The Amoeba formulation addresses this problem by determining the potential from which the spectrum can be derived using the generalized Szeg√∂'s limit theorem, reducing the problem to an optimization of the Ronkin function. While this theory provides novel insights into non-Hermitian physics, challenges arise from the multiband nature and symmetry-protected degeneracies, even in one-dimensional cases. In this work, we investigate one-dimensional two-band class AII$^\dagger$ systems, where Kramers pairs invalidate the conventional Amoeba formalism. We find that these challenges can be overcome by optimizing the band-resolved Ronkin functions, which is achieved by extrapolating the total Ronkin function. Finally, we propose a generalized Szeg√∂'s limit theorem for class AII$^\dagger$ and numerically demonstrate that our approach correctly computes the potential and localization length.

Title: Novel Strontium Carbides Under Compression
Authors: Nikita Rybin, Evgeny Moerman, Pranab Gain, Artem R. Oganov, Alexander Shapeev
Abstract: Exploring the chemistry of materials at high pressures has lead to the discovery of previously unknown exotic compounds. Here, we systematically search for all thermodynamically stable Sr-C compounds under pressure (up to 100 GPa) using the ab initio evolutionary crystal structure prediction method. Our search lead to the discovery of hitherto unknown phases of SrC3, Sr2C5, Sr2C3, Sr2C, Sr3C2, and SrC. The newly discovered crystal structures feature a variety of different carbon environments ranging from isolated C anions and C-dimers to exotic polyatomic carbon anions including chains, stripes, and infinite ribbons consisting of pentagonal C5 and hexagonal C6 rings. Dynamical stability of all predicted compounds is confirmed by phonons calculations. Bader analysis unravels very diverse chemistry in these compounds and bonding patterns in some of them can be described using Zintl-Klemm rule.

Title: Interfacial strong coupling and negative dispersion of propagating polaritons in freestanding oxide membranes

Abstract: Membranes of complex oxides like perovskite SrTiO3 extend the multi-functional promise of oxide electronics into the nanoscale regime of two-dimensional materials. Here we demonstrate that free-standing oxide membranes supply a reconfigurable platform for nano-photonics based on propagating surface phonon polaritons. We apply infrared near-field imaging and -spectroscopy enabled by a tunable ultrafast laser to study pristine nano-thick SrTiO3 membranes prepared by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. As predicted by coupled mode theory, we find that strong coupling of interfacial polaritons realizes symmetric and antisymmetric hybridized modes with simultaneously tunable negative and positive group velocities. By resolving reflection of these propagating modes from membrane edges, defects, and substrate structures, we quantify their dispersion with position-resolved nano-spectroscopy. Remarkably, we find polariton negative dispersion is both robust and tunable through choice of membrane dielectric environment and thickness and propose a novel design for in-plane Veselago lensing harnessing this control. Our work lays the foundation for tunable transformation optics at the nanoscale using polaritons in a wide range of freestanding complex oxide membranes.

Title: Josephson vortices and persistent current in a double-ring supersolid system
Authors: Malte Schubert, Koushik Mukherjee, Tilman Pfau, Stephanie Reimann
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the properties of ultra-cold dipolar atoms in radially coupled, concentric annular traps created by a potential barrier. The non-rotating ground-state phases are investigated across the superfluid-supersolid phase transition, revealing a particle imbalance between the two rings and a preferential density modulation in the outer ring in the absence of rotation. Near the phase transition on the superfluid side, applying rotation can induce density modulations in either ring, depending on the angular momentum and barrier strength. For low angular momentum, such rotation-induced density modulation forms in the outer ring, while for high angular momentum and weak barriers, it emerges in the inner ring. Rotation can lead to persistent currents and the nucleation of a vortex residing either at the center (central vortex) or at the ring junction (Josephson vortex). Josephson vortices can also form at the junctions of the localized density sites induced by rotation in the inner ring, a behavior that is unique to our system. By switching off the trap and allowing the system to expand, distinct interference patterns emerge, which can be analyzed to identify and distinguish between various vortex configurations, and thus can be observed in current state-of-the-art experiments.

Title: The role of fluctuations in the nucleation process
Authors: Yuanpeng Deng, Peilin Kang, Xiang Xu, Hui Li, Michele Parrinello
Abstract: The emergence upon cooling of an ordered solid phase from a liquid is a remarkable example of self-assembly, which has also major practical relevance. Here, we use a recently developed committor-based enhanced sampling method [Kang et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460 (2024); Trizio et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 1-10 (2025)] to explore the crystallization transition in a Lennard-Jones fluid, using Kolmogorov's variational principle. In particular, we take advantage of the properties of our sampling method to harness a large number of configurations from the transition state ensemble. From this wealth of data, we achieve precise localization of the transition state region, revealing a nucleation pathway that deviates from idealized spherical growth assumptions. Furthermore, we take advantage of the probabilistic nature of the committor to detect and analyze the fluctuations that lead to nucleation. Our study nuances classical nucleation theory by showing that the growing nucleus has a complex structure, consisting of a solid core surrounded by an interface that is more disordered than bulk liquid. We also compute from the Kolmogorov's principle a nucleation rate that is consistent with the experimental results at variance with previous computational estimates.

Title: Shape instabilities driven by topological defects in nematic polymer networks
Authors: Silvia Paparini, Giulio G. Giusteri, L. Angela Mihai
Abstract: Liquid crystalline networks (LCNs) are stimuli-responsive materials formed from polymeric chains cross-linked with rod-like mesogenic segments, which, in the nematic phase, align along a non-polar director. A key characteristic of these nematic systems is the existence of singularities in the director field, known as topological defects or disclinations, and classified by their topological charge. In this study, we address the open question of modeling mathematically the coupling between mesogens disclination and polymeric network by providing a mathematical framework describing the out-of-plane shape changes of initially flat LCN sheets containing a central topological defect. Adopting a variational approach, we define an energy associated with the deformations consisting of two contributions: an elastic energy term accounting for spatial director variations, and a strain-energy function describing the elastic response of the polymer network. The interplay between nematic elasticity, which seeks to minimize distortions in the director field, variations in the degree of order, with the consequent tendency of monomers in the polymer chains to distribute anisotropically in response to an external stimulus, and mechanical stiffness, which resists deformation, determines the resulting morphology. We analyze the transition to instability of the ground-state flat configuration and characterize the corresponding buckling modes.

Title: All-electrical scheme for valley polarization in graphene
Authors: Sachchidanand Das, Abhiram Soori
Abstract: We propose an all-electrical setup to generate valley polarization in graphene. A finite graphene sheet is connected to two normal metal electrodes each with two terminals along its zigzag edges, while the armchair edges remain free. When a bias is applied to one terminal and the others are grounded, valley polarization emerges due to transverse momentum matching between the graphene and the metal electrodes. Significant valley polarization is achieved when the Fermi wavevector in the metal exceeds half the separation between the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys in graphene. We analyze how conductance and valley polarization depend on geometric and electronic parameters. While increasing the width enhances both conductance and polarization, increasing the length introduces Fabry--P√©rot oscillations and suppresses valley polarization due to enhanced intervalley mixing. We also examine the effects of disorder: on-site disorder in graphene increases conductance near the Dirac point but reduces valley polarization. Finally, we study the impact of imperfect armchair edges and interface roughness, finding that moderate deviations from ideal conditions still yield substantial valley polarization. Our results demonstrate a viable route to electrically controlling valley degrees of freedom in graphene-based devices.

Title: Probing the Quantum Capacitance of Rydberg Transitions of Surface Electrons on Liquid Helium via Microwave Frequency Modulation
Authors: Asher Jennings, Ivan Grytsenko, Yiran Tian, Oleksiy Rybalko, Jun Wang, Itay Josef Barabash, Erika Kawakami
Abstract: We present a method for probing the quantum capacitance associated with the Rydberg transition of surface electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency (RF) reflectometry. Resonant microwave excitation of the Rydberg transition induces a redistribution of image charges on capacitively coupled electrodes, giving rise to a quantum capacitance originating from adiabatic state transitions and the finite curvature of the energy bands. By applying frequency-modulated resonant microwaves to drive the Rydberg transition, we systematically measured a capacitance sensitivity of 0.34~aF/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ for our RF reflectometry scheme. This sensitivity is sufficient to detect the Rydberg transition of a single electron, offering a scalable pathway toward qubit readout schemes based on surface electrons on helium.

Title: Osmolyte-Modulated Differential Capacitance and Disjoining Pressure for Nanoconfined Electrolytes: A Modified Poisson-Boltzmann Theory
Authors: Victoria A. Vasileva, Daria A. Mazur, Petr E. Brandyshev, Yury A. Budkov
Abstract: This study employs modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory to systematically investigate the influence of zwitterionic osmolyte additives to an electrolyte solution on disjoining pressure and electric differential capacitance within charged slit-like nanopores with conductive walls. We demonstrate that increasing concentrations of zwitterionic osmolytes synergistically enhance both disjoining pressure and differential capacitance, highlighting their dual role in the potential improvement of supercapacitor performance. The insights gained underscore the unique capabilities of zwitterionic osmolytes as multifunctional additives for fine-tuning the properties of electric double layers, thereby bridging the gap between capacitive efficiency and microporous electrode longevity.

In particular, for ideal trees we show that Pr√ºfer labelling provides: (i) direct access to the exact configurational entropy as a function of the tree composition, (ii) computable exact expressions for partition functions and important experimental observables for tree ensembles with controlled branching activity and (iii) an efficient sampling scheme for corresponding tree configurations and arbitrary static properties.

Title: Ordering and association of patchy particles in quasi-one-dimensional channel
Authors: P√©ter Gurin, Szabolcs Varga
Abstract: We show that the formalism of Wertheim's first order thermodynamic perturbation theory can be generalised for the fluid of rotating sticky particles with anisotropic hard core confined to a quasi-one-dimensional channel. Using the transfer matrix method, we prove that the theory is exact if the hard body interaction is additive, only the first neighbors interact and the particles can stick together only along the channel. We show that the most convenient treatment of association in narrow channels is to work in NPT ensemble, where all structural and thermodynamic quantities can be expressed as a function of pressure and fraction of sites unbonded.

Abstract: The two-fluid theory for superfluid hydrodynamics is derived from the fountain pressure result that condensed bosons move at constant entropy and are driven by the chemical potential gradient. Explicit results for $^4$He show that the superfluid has vorticity, which is consistent with measured data but inconsistent with Landau's principle that superfluid flow is irrotational.

Authors: Carolina A. Marques, Luke C. Rhodes, Weronika Osmolska, Harry Lane, Izidor Benediƒçiƒç, Masahiro Naritsuka, Siri A. Berge, Rosalba Fittipaldi, Mariateresa Lettieri, Antonio Vecchione, Peter Wahl
Abstract: The interaction between the electronic and structural degrees of freedom is central to several intriguing phenomena observed in condensed-matter physics. In magnetic materials, magnetic interactions couple to lattice degrees of freedom, resulting in magnetoelastic coupling, which is typically small and only detectable in macroscopic samples. Here we demonstrate a giant magnetoelastic coupling in the correlated itinerant ferromagnet Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$. We establish an effective control of magnetism in the surface layer and utilize it to probe the impact of magnetism on its electronic and structural properties. By using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we reveal subtle changes in the electronic structure dependent on ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic alignment between the surface and subsurface layers. We further determine the consequences of the exchange force on the relaxation of the surface layer, which exhibits giant magnetostriction. Our results provide a direct measurement of the impact of exchange interactions and correlations on structural details in a quantum material, revealing how electronic correlations result in a strong electron-lattice coupling.

Title: Pressure Waves During Granular Flows in Varying Gravity Environments
Authors: Abigail Tadlock, Lori McCabe, Kerstin Nordstrom
Abstract: We present results of LAMMPS Molecular Dynamics simulations of 2D gravity-driven flows of 30,000 soft uniform spheres through a vertical silo. We vary the gravitational field (g), elastic modulus of the particles (E), and silo outlet diameter (D). We present results on upwards pressure waves observed in the system. We compare our results with previous work on granular acoustics. Despite the typical particle speed being substantially less than the measured wave speed, we posit these are nonlinear shock waves, as observed in other systems near jamming. We demonstrate that the wave speeds in all systems appear to follow a power law that is distinct from linear wave expectations.

Title: Sequential binding-unbinding based specific interactions influence exchange dynamics and size distribution of protein condensates
Authors: Bhanjan Debnath, Parag Katira
Abstract: The interaction lifetimes between condensate-forming biomolecules can dictate both the specificity of the condensate-forming species as well as the fluidity and exchange dynamics of these condensates. Using a heuristic modeling approach, we show that single-step vs. sequential, multistep binding-unbinding interactions between proteins can lead to similar average interaction lifetimes, but with either exponential or truncated power-law-like lifetime distributions, respectively. Combining this model with Brownian dynamics simulations, we find that the differences in these lifetime distributions influence the features of condensates, such as their fluidic nature, aging, and size distribution.

Title: A Heuristic Study of Temperature: Quantum Circuitry in Thermal Systems
Authors: HongZheng Liu, YiNuo Tian, Zhiyue Wu
Abstract: Classical thermodynamic singularities at phase transitions and in negative-temperature regimes arise because the equal-a-priori probability postulate overlooks the quantum dynamical complexity required to prepare microstates. We promote bounded dynamical complexity to a postulate and develop Complexity Windowed Thermodynamics (CWT). Introducing a finite complexity budget yields the windowed entropy, an entropy of ignorance that is smooth in energy and monotonically non-increasing in the budget. Smoothness guarantees a finite, continuous effective temperature and a non-negative complexity generation potential, thereby regularizing all classical singularities while recovering standard statistical mechanics as the complexity budget approaches infinity. CWT's generalized first law unveils an information processing work term. From unitary channel geometry we derive universal bounds on action and time: the action consumed must be proportional to the optimal circuit complexity, while the minimum required time is inversely proportional to the effective temperature. The framework unifies phenomena from critical point smoothing to black hole information flow, and predicts that the universe's total generatable complexity and its holographic entropy are of the same order bridging thermodynamics, quantum computation, and gravity.

The data generated is often well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems, benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation. Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization. Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth and standardized workflows. All related code is available at GitHub: this https URL

Title: Method of analysis of the spectra obtained by microfocused Brillouin light scattering
Authors: Nessrine Benaziz, Thibaut Devolder, Jean-Paul Adam
Abstract: Brillouin Light Scattering is a powerful technique to measure the microwave excitations present in a magnetic system. In microfocused mode, the light is focused on the sample using a microscope objective. This accelerates substantially the measurement but results in mixing the response of all microwave excitations into a single spectrum, such that modeling is required to disentangle the contribution of each spin wave. By assuming that a spectrum collected in microfocused mode can be approximated by the sum of all back-scattering spectra that can be collected by the microscope objective, we develop a simple and direct way of interpreting spectra. The model is compared to experimental data collected on a 50 nm thick CoFeB magnetic film. The model allows the understanding of the influence of the optical properties of a sample, of the dispersion relation of the spin wave eigenexcitations and of their thickness profiles, as well as of their populations onto the magnitudes and the lineshapes of the characteristic features of a spectrum

Title: Equations of state and stability condition of mixed p-spin glass model
Authors: Ali Talebi
Abstract: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) is a foundational model for understanding spin glass systems. It is based on the pairwise interaction between each two spins in a fully connected lattice with quenched disordered interactions. The nature of long-range interaction among spins in the (SK) model simplifies the study of this system by eliminating fluctuations. An advanced (SK) model, known as the p-spin model, introduces higher-order interactions that involve the interaction of P spins. This research focuses on the general Hamiltonian of the spin glass model with long-range interaction, referred to as the mixed p-spin glass model, which consists of adding all p-spin interaction terms. This research aims to derive the equation of states for this Hamiltonian, formulate the equation of state within the framework of the first replica symmetry breaking, and determine both the stability condition of the replica symmetric solution and the stability of the replicas belonging to the same group in the first step of replica symmetry breaking.

Title: Nanodroplet Condensation on Solid Surfaces
Authors: Matteo Teodori, Dario Abbondanza, Mirko Gallo, Carlo Massimo Casciola
Abstract: This paper deals with the condensation of liquid droplets on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. A stochastic mesoscale model based on the theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics and the thermodynamics of a diffuse interface approach shows how direct simulation of the vapour-liquid transition from the nucleation process to droplet hydrodynamics can be achieved. Such simulations explain the role of wettability in filmwise and dropwise condensation regimes and the main limitations of classical nucleation theory.

Title: Nano-silica based Aqueous Colloidal Gels as Eco-friendly Thixotropic Lubricant
Authors: Arun Kumar, Vivek Kumar, Yogesh M. Joshi, Manjesh K. Singh
Abstract: The environmental risks posed by traditional oil and grease-based lubricants can be significantly mitigated by adopting water-based alternatives engineered with superior rheological performance. In this work, we present a fundamentally new and environmentally sustainable aqueous thixotropic colloidal gel of silica nanoparticles formed in the presence of NaCl. We conducted a systematic and detailed investigation of their rheological and tribological characteristics. The tribological performance was evaluated against dry and water-lubricated conditions for steel-steel interface. Our experiments demonstrate that the tribological performance of the formulated nanoparticle gel can be optimized by tuning its rheological properties. A combination of super-low friction and negligible wear was observed. The friction coefficient reduced by up to 97.46% (from 0.63 to 0.016) compared to dry sliding, and by 97.04% (from 0.541 to 0.016) compared to water lubrication. Similarly, the specific wear rate decreased by up to 99.62% and 96.10% under dry conditions and water lubrication respectively. This performance is attributed to a thixotropic, chemically robust gel formed via van der Waals interactions between silica flocs, enabling self-repairing properties, continuous tribo-film formation, and a nano-bearing effect from silica nanoparticles. These attributes enable the gel to maintain and regain its structure during periods of non-shear while also forming a thin film with sufficiently low viscosity to slip into the interfacial contact zone and continuously replenish it with lubricant.

Title: Effect of Berry connection on attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in gapped graphene
Authors: Jiayu Yan, Hongxuan Er, Wei Dang, Jiahuan Ren, Chao Chen, Dianxiang Ren, Fulong Dong
Abstract: We investigate the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) in gapped graphene by numerically solving the four-band density matrix equations. Our results reveal that, in contrast to pristine graphene, whose fishbone-shaped spectra oscillate at twice the pump laser frequency, the ATAS of gapped graphene exhibits an additional component oscillating at the pump laser frequency, induced by the Berry connection. To gain insight into these interesting results, we employ a simplified model to derive an analytical expression for the spectral component stemming from the Berry connection. Our analytical results qualitatively reproduce the key features observed in the numerical simulations, revealing that the intensity of the fundamental-frequency spectral component depends not only on the Berry connection but also on the energy shifts associated with the effective mass of electrons at the van Hove singularities. These results shed light on the complex generation mechanism of the ATAS in symmetry-broken materials.

Title: Alternating Spintronics: Capacitive Behavior of Spin Valves and Resonator Applications
Authors: Yunwen Liu, Jiang Xiao
Abstract: This study explores the time-dependent spin transport phenomena in magnetic heterostructures under alternating currents (AC), advancing the relatively underdeveloped field of alternating spintronics. Employing a time-dependent spin diffusion model, we show that the interplay of AC frequencies and spin relaxation times reveals significant differences in spin accumulation patterns compared to conventional direct current (DC) scenarios. Of particular interest is the emergence of capacitive-like impedance in a spin valve under AC conditions, which is especially pronounced in antiparallel spin configurations. These findings open up possibilities for developing high-frequency spintronic devices, including the proposed "spin resonator", which functions like a standard LC resonator but without a traditional capacitor.

Title: A Hierarchical Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems in Structured Environments
Authors: Kai M√ºller, Kimmo Luoma, Christian Sch√§fer
Abstract: Open quantum systems that feature non-Markovian dynamics are routinely solved using techniques such as the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM). However, their usage of the entire system density-matrix renders them intractable for many-body systems. Here, we combine the HEOM with the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy to achieve a rigorous description of open many-body systems in contact with structured photonic and phononic baths. We first rationalize that this stacked hierarchy accounts for spin-squeezing and superradiant emission despite its applicability to arbitrarily many emitters. The full potential of BBGKY-HEOM is then illustrated for two relevant applications: (i) the explicit treatment of vibrational modes provides access to resonant enhancements in few-emitter lasing, and (ii) the impact of phononic coupling and charge noise on many-body electronic systems embedded in host materials (e.g. molecules in organic crystals) is as relevant as electronic correlation. Our work establishes an accessible, yet rigorous, route between condensed matter and quantum optics, fostering the growth of a new domain at their interface.

Title: Concomitant Entanglement and Control Criticality Driven by Collective Measurements
Authors: Thomas Iadecola, Justin H. Wilson, J. H. Pixley
Abstract: Adaptive quantum circuits-where a quantum many-body state is controlled using measurements and conditional unitary operations-are a powerful paradigm for state preparation and quantum error correction tasks. They can support two types of nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions: measurement-induced transitions between volume- and area-law-entangled steady states and control-induced transitions where the system falls into an absorbing state, or an orbit visiting several absorbing states. Within this context, nonlocal conditional operations can alter the critical properties of the two transitions and the topology of the phase diagram. Here, we consider the scenario where the measurements are nonlocal, to engineer efficient control onto dynamical trajectories. Motivated by Rydberg-atom arrays, we consider a locally constrained model with global sublattice magnetization measurements and local correction operations to steer the system's dynamics onto a many-body orbit. The model has a well-defined classical limit, which we leverage to aid our analysis of the control transition. As a function of the density of local correction operations, we find control and entanglement transitions with continuously varying critical exponents. For sufficiently high densities of local correction operations, we find that both transitions acquire a dynamical critical exponent $z<1$, reminiscent of criticality in long-range power-law interacting systems. At low correction densities, we find that the criticality reverts to a short-range nature with $z\gtrsim 1$. In the long-range regime, the control and entanglement transitions are indistinguishable to within the resolution of our numerics, while in the short-range regime we find evidence that the transitions become distinct. We conjecture that the long-range criticality mediated by collective measurements is essential in driving the two transitions together.

Title: Manifold-based transformation of probability distributions: application to the inverse problem of reconstructing distributions from experimental data
Authors: Tomotaka Oroguchi, Rintaro Inoue, Masaaki Sugiyama
Abstract: Information geometry is a mathematical framework that elucidates the manifold structure of the probability distribution space (p-space), providing a systematic approach to transforming probability distributions (PDs). In this study, we utilized information geometry to address the inverse problems associated with reconstructing PDs from experimental data. Our initial finding is that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, often considered non-metric owing to its asymmetry, can serve as a valid metric under specific geometric conditions on the manifold. Based on this finding, we formulated the manifold-based gradient descent (MBGD) method, which was employed to visualize the internal structures -- represented as PDs -- of two types of systems: those with static constituent elements and those with dynamic state transitions. Through the application of MBGD, we successfully reconstructed the underlying PDs for both types of systems, outperforming the standard gradient descent methods that neglect the manifold structure of p-space. Therefore, the present results demonstrate the essentiality of accounting for the manifold structure of p-space in the inverse problems of reconstructing PDs. The ability of MBGD to accurately reconstruct PDs for systems with dynamic state transitions underscores its potential to provide valuable physical insights by visualizing internal structures.

Title: Classifying Logical Gates in Quantum Codes via Cohomology Operations and Symmetry
Authors: Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi, Guanyu Zhu
Abstract: We systematically construct and classify fault-tolerant logical gates implemented by constant-depth circuits for quantum codes using cohomology operations and symmetry. These logical gates are obtained from unitary operators given by symmetry-protected topological responses, which correspond to generators of group cohomology and can be expressed explicitly on the lattice using cohomology operations including cup product, Steenrod squares and new combinations of higher cup products called higher Pontryagin powers. Our study covers most types of the cohomology operations in the literature. This hence gives rise to logical $C^{n-1}Z$ gates in $n$ copies of quantum codes via the $n$-fold cup product in the usual color code paradigm, as well as several new classes of diagonal and non-diagonal logical gates in increasing Clifford hierarchies beyond the color code paradigm, including the logical $R_k$ and multi-controlled $C^m R_k$ gates for codes defined in projective spaces. Implementing these gates could make it more efficient to compile specific types of quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm. We further extend the construction to quantum codes with boundaries, which generalizes the folding approach in color codes. We also present a formalism for addressable and parallelizable logical gates in LDPC codes via higher-form symmetries. We further construct logical Clifford gates in expander-based codes including the asymptotically good LDPC codes and hypergraph-product codes. As a byproduct, we find new topological responses of finite higher-form symmetries using higher Pontryagin powers.

Title: Breakdown of Bulk-Radiation Correspondence in Radiative Photonic Lattices
Authors: Xinyi Yuan, Lo√Øc Malgrey, Helgi Sigur√∞sson, Hai Son Nguyen, Grazia Salerno
Abstract: The topological characteristics of energy bands in crystalline systems are encapsulated in the Berry curvature of the bulk Bloch states. In photonic crystal slabs, far-field emission from guided resonances naturally provides a non-invasive way to probe the embedded wavefunctions, raising the question of how the information carried by escaping photons relates to the band topology. We develop a non-Hermitian model to describe the guided and leaky modes of photonic crystal slabs with long-range couplings and non-local responses. Within this framework, radiation Berry curvature is defined from the far-field polarization and compared to the conventional bulk Berry curvature of the crystal Bloch modes. We investigate this bulk-radiation correspondence in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point of the square lattice and the $K$-point of the honeycomb lattice. The results show that the comparability between the bulk topology and the radiation topology is not universal; the validity is contingent upon the specific bulk Bloch states. Notably, the correspondence completely breaks down surrounding the far-field singularities, while it can hold in smooth regions under special symmetry conditions, e.g., rotational symmetry. Besides, net Berry curvature concentration is captured at the valleys of the non-local honeycomb lattice, facilitating further exploration on generalized topological phases in photonic lattices beyond the regimes with localized couplings and Hermiticity.

Title: Collective excitations in Hydrogen across the pressure-induced transition from molecular to atomic fluid
Authors: I.-M. Ilenkov, T. Bryk
Abstract: Dispersion of collective excitations in fluid Hydrogen along the isothermal line T=2500~K, including the region of molecular-to-atomis fluid transition, is studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The obtained density dependence of the adiabatic and high-frequency speed of sound contains a plateau in the region of the molecular-to-atomic fluid transition. We show, that the five-variable thermo-viscoelastic model of generalized hydrodynamics for pure molecular H$_2$ and pure atomic (H) fluids is able to recover perfectly the AIMD-derived time correlation functions and sound eigenvalues nicely agree with the numerically estimated sound dispersion. In the region of the molecular-to-atomic fluid transition a dynamic model of chemical reacting mixture should be applied. We discuss the calculations of time correlation functions from molecular/atomic units in the reacting mixture from AIMD trajectories.
