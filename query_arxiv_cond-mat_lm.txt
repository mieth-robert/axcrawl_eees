Title: Inverse Single-sided Magnet
Authors: Takayuki Ishitobi
Abstract: A single-sided magnet generates a magnetic field on only one side while canceling it on the opposite side, a feature that has enabled diverse applications in both fundamental science and engineering. Here, we propose the {\it inverse} single-sided magnet: a non-ferromagnetic system that selectively attracts either the north or south pole of a ferromagnet while remaining unresponsive to the opposite pole. We demonstrate that such behavior can arise in microscopic octupolar magnets. To illustrate this, we analyze two minimal models: a coplanar magnetic structure with 120-degree ordering and a collinear magnetic structure with site-dependent anisotropy. In both cases, we find that the magnetization response is nonreciprocal with respect to the sign of the applied magnetic field. Notably, in the latter model, the system exhibits strong magnetization in one field direction and negligible response in the opposite direction. This diode-like behavior for magnetic fields suggests that inverse single-sided magnets could play a pivotal role in controlling magnetic interference, with potential impact comparable to conventional single-sided magnets.

Title: Performance optimization of Nernst-based thermionic engines
Authors: Wei Yan, Minglong Lv, Ousi Pan, Zhimin Yang, Jincan Chen, Shanhe Su
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the power and efficiency of the thermionic device utilizing the Nernst effect, with a specific focus on its potential application as an engine. The device operates by utilizing the vertical heat current to generate a horizontal particle current against the chemical potential. By considering the influence of a strong magnetic field, we derive analytical expressions for the current and heat flux. These expressions are dependent on the temperature and chemical potential of heat reservoirs, providing valuable insights into the device performance. The impact of driving temperatures on the performance of the thermionic engine has been assessed through numerical analysis. The research findings will guide the experimental design of Nernst-based thermionic engines.

Title: Elastic anisotropy and Surface Acoustic Wave propagation in CoFeB/Au multilayers: influence of thickness and light penetration depth
Authors: A. V. Achuthan, S. Janardhanan, P. Kuswik, A. Trzaskowska
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves in multilayered nanostructures represent a critical frontier in understanding material behavior at the nanoscale, with profound implications for emerging acoustic and spintronic technologies. In this study, we investigate the influence of the magnetic layer thickness on the propagation of surface acoustic waves in CoFeB based multilayers. Two approaches to effective medium modelling are considered: one treating the entire multilayer as a homogeneous medium and another focusing on the region affected by light penetration. The elastic properties of the system are analyzed using Brillouin light scattering and numerical modelling, with a particular emphasis on the anisotropy of Young s modulus and its dependence on CoFeB thickness. The results reveal a significant variation in surface acoustic wave velocity and elastic anisotropy as a function of the multilayer configuration, highlighting the role of the penetration depth in effective medium approximations. These findings provide valuable insights into the tunability of acoustic and spin-wave frequencies through structural modifications, which is crucial for the development of high-performance resonators, surface acoustic wave filters, and spin-wave-based information processing devices.

Title: Self-organization, detailed balance, and stress-structure correlations in 2D granular dynamics
Authors: Raphael Blumenfeld, Takashi Matsushima, Jie Zhang
Abstract: We argue that a number of recent experimental and numerical observations point to an ongoing cooperative stress-structure self-organisation (SO) in quasi-static granular dynamics. These observations include: a) detail-insensitive collapses of certain quantities; b) correlations between stress and structure and evidence of entropy-stability competition in settled packings, which cast doubt on most linear stress theories of granular materials; c) detailed balanced steady states, which seem contradictory to the common belief that only systems in thermal equilibrium satisfy detailed balance, but are not, as we explain. We then propose a new statistical mechanical formulation that takes into account the cooperative SO.

Title: Quantum hydrodynamics of a polariton fluid: pure energy relaxation terms
Authors: D. A. Saltykova, A. V. Yulin, I. A. Shelykh
Abstract: Cavity polaritons, hybrid half-light half-matter excitations in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime demonstrate clear signatures of quantum collective behavior, such as analogues of BEC and superfluidity at surprisingly high temperatures. The analysis of the formation of these states demands an account of the relaxation processes in the system. Although there are well-established approaches for the description of some of them, such as finite lifetime polariton, an external optical pump, and coupling with an incoherent excitonic reservoir, the treatment of pure energy relaxation in a polariton fluid still remains a puzzle. Here, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach, we derive the corresponding equations where the energy relaxation term appears naturally. We analyze in detail how it affects the dynamics of polariton droplets and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of bosonic condensates, where the processes of energy relaxation play an important role.

Title: On the interfacial properties of hydroquinone: realistic and coarse-grained molecular models from computer simulation
Authors: M. J. Torrejón, B. Rodríguez García, J. Algaba, J. M. Olmos, M. Peréz-Rodríguez, J. M. Míguez, A. Mejía, M. M. Piñeiro, F. J. Blas
Abstract: In this work, we determine the vapor-liquid (VL) coexistence and interfacial properties of the hydroquinone (HQ) pure system from $NVT$ molecular dynamics simulations. We employ the direct coexistence technique to put in contact both phases in the same simulation box and generate the VL interface. Five different models have been tested to describe the HQ molecule in order to assess the performance of different approaches. The first two models are based on the Transferable Parameters Potentials for Phase Equilibria (TraPPE) force field. The first TraPPE model is the original one based on an all-atoms approach (TraPPE-AA). The second TraPPE model is proposed for the first time in this work and is based on a united-atoms approach (TraPPE-UA) where the --CH groups from the aromatic ring are modeled as a single interaction site. We also use two HQ models based on the Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations (OPLS) force fields. Both OPLS models have already been reported in the literature, but this is the first time that are used to describe VLE and interfacial behavior. In addition, we propose a new Coarse grain (CG) HQ model based on the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) framework. We determine density profiles, coexistence densities, vapor pressure, interfacial thicknesses, and interfacial tensions as obtained from the $NVT$ simulations with the five different models. We explore the VL behavior of pure HQ system from 500 to $750\,\text{K}$. Remarkably good agreement has been found between the simulation results obtained by the TraPPE-AA, CG, and both OPLS models.

Title: Optical properties of TiS$_3$ as a novel thin film for single-junction and tandem solar cells
Authors: Cesar E. P. Villegas, Enesio Marinho Jr, A. C. Dias, Pedro Venezuela, Alexandre R. Rocha
Abstract: Sub-micrometer thin films are promising platforms for emerging flexible photovoltaic devices. Although the current market already produces efficient solar cells, the average wafer thickness of these devices remains far from the sub-micrometer scale, making them susceptible to cracking under bending stress and thus precluding their use in flexible device applications. Due to its earth abundance, non-toxicity, and low elastic modulus, titanium trisulfide (TiS$_3$) has emerged as a promising alternative for flexible device applications. Here, using excited-state density functional calculations combined with the transfer matrix approach, we perform an optical analysis and assess the efficiency of a prototype photovoltaic device based on sub-micrometer TiS$_3$ thin films. Using optical constants obtained from our first-principles calculations, we evaluate the photovoltaic response of a single-junction device in the radiative limit, finding that a 140-nm-thick active layer achieves a maximum power conversion efficiency of approximately 22%. Additionally, we investigate tandem solar cells that incorporate TiS$_3$ into perovskite thin films, and find that the lower and upper power conversion efficiencies range from approximately 18% to 33%. Overall, our results suggest great potential for using TiS$_3$ thin films as an active layer in the design of highly efficient flexible solar cells.

Title: Resistance hysteresis in twisted bilayer graphene: Intrinsic versus extrinsic effects
Authors: Ranit Dutta, Ayan Ghosh, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Anindya Das
Abstract: Hysteresis in resistance under magnetic field sweeps is a key signature for identifying magnetism in twisted bilayer graphene and similar systems. However, such sweeps can induce extrinsic thermal effects, complicating interpretations. Distinguishing intrinsic magnetic ordering from extrinsic thermal influences is crucial. In this study, we report hysteresis in the longitudinal resistance ($(R_{xx}$)) of a near magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) sample under an in-plane magnetic field ($(B_{||}$)). The hysteresis phase appears at the edge of the superconducting dome, diminishes deep within the superconducting regime, and reemerges near the superconducting critical temperature ($(T \sim T_c$)). The hysteresis magnitude and coercive fields strongly depend on the magnetic field sweep rate ($(dB/dt)$) and exhibit transient relaxation in time-series measurements. Notably, similar hysteresis behavior was observed in the temperature profile of the sample stage, measured using a calibrated temperature sensor under analogous magnetic field cycles, suggesting extrinsic thermal origins rather than intrinsic magnetic ordering. These findings underscore the importance of carefully distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic effects in resistance hysteresis observed in mesoscopic van der Waals systems.

Title: Polaron-induced modifications in the linear and nonlinear optical properties of graphene under electric and magnetic fields
Authors: S. Mounbou, S. I. Fewo, L. A. Ribeiro Jr, C. Kenfack-Sadem
Abstract: Polarons are the primary charge carriers in organic materials. A deep understanding of their properties can open channels for novel optoelectronic applications. By applying electric and magnetic fields, we investigate the influence of polaron interactions on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of a graphene monolayer between a substrate and air. Using the density matrix approach, we derive the linear and nonlinear optical absorption coefficients and the relative refractive index by incorporating the zero-energy level. Our numerical results reveal that the polaron effect and the magnetic field induce shifts in the peak positions of the optical absorption coefficients and refractive index. Moreover, while the presence of electric and magnetic fields significantly alters the amplitude of the absorption coefficients, only the magnetic field affects the refractive index amplitude. Additionally, we find that the magnetic field amplifies the influence of surface optical phonons on the optical properties of graphene. These findings provide deeper insights into the optical behavior of graphene in external fields, which could be relevant for optoelectronic applications.

Title: How to Make a Pristine Tellurium Atomic Helix
Authors: George Kirczenow
Abstract: Tellurium atomic helices are currently attracting increasing attention. However, to date individual tellurium atomic helices have only been grown encapsulated in host materials. A bare free-standing tellurium atomic helix has yet to be realized experimentally despite the fundamental interest of these systems. Here DFT-based simulations are presented that show that a pristine tellurium atomic helix can be drawn from a tellurium crystal with the help of a gold STM tip, paving the way to a better understanding of tellurium atomic helices.

Title: Quantized Artificial Neural Networks Implemented with Spintronic Stochastic Computing
Authors: Saadi Sabyasachi, Walid Al Misba, Yixin Shao, Pedram Khalili Amiri, Jayasimha Atulasimha
Abstract: An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) inference involves matrix vector multiplications that require a very large number of multiply and accumulate operations, resulting in high energy cost and large device footprint. Stochastic computing (SC) offers a less resource-intensive ANN implementation and can be realized through stochastic-magnetic tunnel junctions (s-MTJ) that generate random numbers, where the energy barrier to switch between the up and down states is designed to be small. While s-MTJs have previously been used to implement SC-ANNs, these studies have been limited to architectures with continuously varying (analog) weights. We study the use of SC for matrix vector multiplication with quantized synaptic weights and outputs. We show that a quantized SC-ANN, implemented by using experimentally obtained s-MTJ bitstreams and using a limited number of discrete quantized states for both weights and hidden layer outputs in an ANN, can effectively reduce latency and energy consumption in SC compared to an analog implementation, while largely preserving accuracy. We implemented quantization with 5 and 11 quantized states, along with SC configured with stochastic bitstream lengths of 100 to 500 on neural networks with one and three hidden layers. Inference was performed on the MNIST dataset for both training with SC and without SC. Training with SC provided better accuracy for all cases. For the shortest bitstream of 100 bits, the highest accuracies were 92% for one hidden layer and over 96% for three hidden layers. The overall system attained its peak accuracy of 96.82% using a 400-bit stochastic bitstream with three hidden layers and demonstrated 9X improvement in latency to implement neuron activations and 2.6X improvement in energy consumption using the quantized SC approach compared to a similar s-MTJ based ANN architecture without quantization.

Title: High critical current densities of body-centered cubic high-entropy alloy superconductors: recent research progress
Authors: Jiro Kitagawa, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi, Terukazu Nishizaki
Abstract: High-entropy alloy (HEA) superconductors have garnered significant attention due to their unique characteristics, such as robust superconductivity under extremely high pressure and irradiation, the cocktail effect, and the enhancement of the upper critical field. A high critical current density is another noteworthy feature observed in HEAs. Several body-centered cubic (bcc) HEAs have exhibited critical current densities comparable to those of Nb-Ti superconducting alloys. Such HEAs hold potential for applications as multifunctional superconducting wires, a capability rarely achieved in conventional alloys. In this context, we review recent advancements in research on critical current densities in bcc HEA superconductors, including Ta$_{1/6}$Nb$_{2/6}$Hf$_{1/6}$Zr$_{1/6}$Ti$_{1/6}$, (TaNb)$_{0.7}$(HfZrTi)$_{0.5}$, NbScTiZr, and others. Comparative analyses among these HEAs reveal that both eutectic microstructures, which accompany lattice strain, and nanosized precipitates play pivotal roles in achieving elevated critical current densities across wide magnetic field ranges. Furthermore, we propose several future directions for research. These include elucidating the origin of lattice strain, exploring more fine eutectic microstructures, artificially introducing nanoscale pinning sites, improving the superconducting critical temperature, and investigating the mechanical properties of these materials.

Title: Advances in quantum defect embedding theory
Authors: Siyuan Chen, Victor Wen-zhe Yu, Yu Jin, Marco Govoni, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) is a many-body embedding method designed to describe condensed systems with strongly correlated electrons localized within a given region of space, for example spin defects in semiconductors and insulators. Although the QDET approach has been successful in predicting the electronic properties of several point defects, several limitations of the method remain. In this work, we propose multiple advances to the QDET formalism. We derive a double-counting correction that consistently treats the frequency dependence of the screened Coulomb interaction, and we illustrate the effect of including unoccupied orbitals in the active space. In addition, we propose a method to describe hybridization effects between the active space and the environment, and we compare the results of several impurity solvers, providing further insights into improving the reliability and applicability of the method. We present results for defects in diamond and for molecular qubits, including a detailed comparison with experiments.

Title: Dynamics of Conducting Ferroelectric Domain Walls
Authors: Carson Carroll, W. A. Atkinson
Abstract: We report on the dynamics of a conducting domain wall under applied dc and ac voltages. These dynamics are modeled for a thin film that hosts an ideal charged domain wall via a combination of time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations for the polarization, the Schrödinger equation for the electron gas, and Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential. The electron dynamics are treated within a Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We find that the electron gas introduces an additional degree of freedom, beyond polarization relaxation, that modifies the dynamical response of the domain wall. While marginally relevant for the dc response, the electron dynamics have a pronounced effect on the film's ac dielectric function. The dielectric function has an intrinsic contribution, due to the bulk susceptibility of the film, and an extrinsic contribution due to the domain-wall displacement. The elecron gas affects the dielectric function by changing both the amplitude and phase of the displacement.

Title: Identifying Universal Spin Excitations in Spin-1/2 Kagome Quantum Spin Liquid Materials
Authors: Aaron T. Breidenbach, Arthur C. Campello, Jiajia Wen, Hong-Chen Jiang, Daniel M. Pajerowski, Rebecca W. Smaha, Young S. Lee
Abstract: A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is an exotic quantum state of matter characterized by fluctuating spins which may exhibit long-range entanglement. Among the possible host candidates for a QSL ground state, the $S$=1/2 kagome lattice antiferromagnet is particularly promising. Using high resolution inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Zn-barlowite (Zn$_\mathrm{x}$Cu$_\mathrm{4-x}$(OD)$_\mathrm{6}$FBr, $x\simeq 0.80$), we measure a spin excitation spectrum consistent with a QSL ground state. Continuum scattering above $\sim$1 meV matches that of herbertsmithite (Zn$_\mathrm{x}$Cu$_\mathrm{4-x}$(OD)$_6$Cl$_2$, $x\simeq 0.85$), another prominent kagome QSL material, indicating universal spinon excitations. A detailed analysis of the spin-spin correlations, compared with density matrix renormalization group calculations, further indicate a QSL ground state for the physically relevant Hamiltonian parameters. The measured spectra in Zn-barlowite are consistent with gapped behavior with a gap size $\Delta = 1.1(2)$ meV. Comparison with a simple pair correlation model allows us to clearly distinguish intrinsic kagome correlations from impurity-induced correlations. Our results clarify the behavior that is universal within this important family of QSL candidate materials.

Title: A critical theory for solidification of a liquid Fermi liquid
Authors: Tarun Grover, John McGreevy
Abstract: We give a simple description of a zero-temperature phase transition between a liquid metal and a solid. The critical point has a Fermi surface as well as a Bose surface, a sphere in momentum space of gapless bosonic excitations. We find a fixed point of the renormalization group governing such a non-Fermi liquid, using an expansion in the codimension of both the Fermi and Bose surfaces. We comment on the nature of the solid phase and possible physical realizations.

Title: Exceptionally large winding number of a finite-size topological superconductor
Authors: Satoshi Ikegaya, Shingo Kobayashi, Yasuhiro Asano
Abstract: We study finite-size-induced topological phenomena in unconventional superconductors. Specifically, we focus on a thin film with a persistent spin texture, fabricated on a high-$T_{\text{c}}$ cuprate $d_{xy}$-wave superconductors. In two-dimensional $d_{xy}$-wave superconductors, flat-band Andreev bound states appear at the edges. As the system narrows, these bound states acquire an energy gap due to finite-size hybridization and spin-orbit coupling of the persistent spin texture. This induced gap gives rise to the emergence of a topological phase, characterized by an exceptionally large one-dimensional winding number that scales with the film width. We demonstrate the appearance of highly degenerate zero-energy states, leading to anomalous perfect charge transport in dirty superconducting junctions. These findings provide a promising platform for exploring fascinating topological superconducting phases driven by gapped Andreev bound states.

Title: Weyl Phonons: The connection of topology and chirality
Authors: Tiantian Zhang, Shuichi Murakami, Hu Miao
Abstract: Topology and chirality of fermionic quasiparticles have enabled exciting discoveries, including quantum anomalous Hall liquids and topological superconductivity. Recently, topological and chiral phonons emerge as new and fast-evolving research directions. While these concepts are separately developed, they are intimately connected in the context of Weyl phonons. The couplings between chiral and topological phonons with various electronic and magnetic quasiparticles are predicted to give rise to new quantum states and giant magnetism with fundamental and applicational interests, ranging from quantum information science to dark matter detectors.

Abstract: Artificial spin ice, arrays of strongly interacting nanomagnets, are complex magnetic systems with many emergent properties, rich microstate spaces, intrinsic physical memory, high-frequency dynamics in the GHz range and compatibility with a broad range of measurement approaches. This tutorial article aims to provide the foundational knowledge needed to understand, design, develop, and improve the dynamic properties of artificial spin ice (ASI). Special emphasis is placed on introducing the theory of micromagnetics, which describes the complex dynamics within these systems, along with their design, fabrication methods, and standard measurement and control techniques. The article begins with a review of the historical background, introducing the underlying physical phenomena and interactions that govern artificial spin ice. We then explore standard experimental techniques used to prepare the microstate space of the nanomagnetic array and to characterize magnetization dynamics, both in artificial spin ice and more broadly in ferromagnetic materials. Finally, we introduce the basics of neuromorphic computing applied to the case of artificial spin ice systems with goal to help researchers new to the field grasp these exciting new developments.

Title: Giant Rashba splitting in PtTe/PtTe$_2$ heterostructure
Authors: Runfa Feng, Yang Zhang, Jiaheng Li, Qian Li, Changhua Bao, Hongyun Zhang, Wanying Chen, Xiao Tang, Ken Yaegashi, Katsuaki Sugawara, Takafumi Sato, Wenhui Duan, Pu Yu, Shuyun Zhou
Abstract: Achieving a large spin splitting is highly desirable for spintronic devices, which often requires breaking of the inversion symmetry. However, many atomically thin films are centrosymmetric, making them unsuitable for spintronic applications. Here, we report a strategy to achieve inversion symmetry breaking from a centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) bilayer PtTe$_2$, leading to a giant Rashba spin splitting. Specifically, the thermal annealing turns one layer of PtTe$_2$ sample into a transition metal monochalcogenide (TMMC) PtTe through Te extraction, thus forming PtTe/PtTe$_2$ heterostructure with inversion symmetry breaking. In the naturally-formed PtTe/PtTe$_2$ heterostructure, we observe a giant Rashba spin splitting with Rashba coefficient of $\alpha_{R}$ = 1.8 eV$\cdot$$Å$, as revealed by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Our work demonstrates a convenient and effective pathway for achieving pronounced Rashba splitting in centrosymmetric TMDC thin films by creating TMMC/TMDC heterostructure, thereby extending their potential applications to spintronics.

Title: Resistivity measurement for non-magnetic materials using high-order resonance mode of mfm-cantilever oscillation
Authors: Kazuma Okamoto, Takumi Imura, Satoshi Abo, Fujio Wakaya, Katsuhisa Murakami, Masayoshi Nagao
Abstract: A method to measure the electrical resistivity of materials using magnetic-force microscopy (MFM) is discussed, where MFM detects the magnetic field caused by the tip-oscillation-induced eddy current. To achieve high sensitivity, a high cantilever oscillation frequency is preferable, because it induces large eddy currents in the material. Higher-order resonance modes of the cantilever oscillation leads to higher frequency. To discuss such high-order-mode oscillation, a differential equation governing MFM cantilever oscillation in the high-order resonance mode is formulated, and an analytical solution of the phase difference is obtained. The result shows that the phase difference decreases at higher modes, because the effective spring constant increases faster than the force from the eddy current.

Title: Time-local stochastic equation of motion for solid ionic electrolytes
Authors: Aleksandr Rodin, Ben Andrew Olsen, Andrey Ustyuzhanin, Artem Maevskiy
Abstract: Numerical studies of ionic motion through solid electrolytes commonly involve static nudged-elastic band (NEB) methods or costly \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD). Building on a time-local model of current carrier-electrolyte interaction and incorporating thermal motion, we introduce an approach that is intermediate between the two well-established methodologies by treating the electrolyte as an effective medium that interacts with the mobile particle. Through this coupling, the thermally vibrating electrolyte imparts energy to the charge carriers while also absorbing energy from them due to its own finite elasticity. Using a simple model system, we validate our approach through a series of numerical simulations. Our methodology reproduces both dissipative and diffusive behavior, and helps link microscopic system parameters to measurable macroscopic properties.

Title: Localization of deformation in the central hub of hub-and-spoke kirigami
Authors: Jason Barckicke, Lucie Domino, Qun Zhang, Mingchao Liu, Dominic Vella
Abstract: A recent approach to the design of flexible electronic devices consists of cutting a two-dimensional sheet to form a central hub connected to several tapered `spokes', resembling the hub-and-spoke of a bicycle wheel. When radially compressed, the resulting cut sheet buckles out-of-plane forming a structure whose three-dimensional shape can be chosen by designing the tapering of the spokes. While the deformation of the spokes in this `hub-and-spoke' kirigami are approximately cylindrical (i.e.~zero Gaussian curvature and hence small elastic strain), this is not the case in the central hub. The central hub is deformed radially because of continuity with the spokes but, because of its own circular symmetry, it must develop Gaussian curvature, and hence strain. In this article we quantify this strain, focussing in particular on its magnitude and its location. We find that the strain is localized in a boundary layer near the edge of the hub region, whose size is controlled by the moment applied on it by the deformed spokes. We discuss the implications of our results for avoiding material failure in flexible-electronic devices.

Title: Entropy Production in Non-Gaussian Active Matter: A Unified Fluctuation Theorem and Deep Learning Framework
Authors: Yuanfei Huang, Chengyu Liu, Bing Miao, Xiang Zhou
Abstract: We present a general framework for deriving entropy production rates in active matter systems driven by non-Gaussian active fluctuations. Employing the probability flow equivalence technique, we rigorously derive an entropy production decomposition formula and demonstrate that the entropy production, $\Delta s_\mathrm{tot}$, satisfies the integral fluctuation theorem $\langle \exp[ -\Delta s_\mathrm{tot} + B_\mathrm{act}] \rangle = 1$ and the generalized second law of thermodynamics $\langle \Delta s_\mathrm{tot}\rangle \geq\langle B_\mathrm{act}\rangle$, where $B_\mathrm{act}$ is a path-dependent random variable associated with the active fluctuations. Our result holds generally for arbitrary initial conditions, encompassing both steady-state and transient finite-time regimes. In the limiting case where active fluctuations are absent (i.e., $B_\mathrm{act} \equiv 0$), the theorem reduces to the well-established results in stochastic thermodynamics. Building on the theoretical foundation, we propose a deep learning-based methodology to efficiently compute the entropy production, utilizing the Lévy score function we proposed. To illustrate the validity of this approach, we apply it to two representative systems: a Brownian particle in a periodic active bath and an active polymer system consisting of an active Brownian particle cross-linker interacting with passive Brownian beads. Our results provide a unified framework for analyzing entropy production in active matter systems while offering practical computational tools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behaviors.

Title: Two-Axis planar Hall magnetic field sensors with sub nanoTesla resolution
Authors: Proloy Taran Das, Hariharan Nhalil, Vladislav Mor, Moty Schultz, Nir Hasidim, Asaf Grosz, Lior Klein
Abstract: Planar Hall effect (PHE) magnetic sensors are attractive for various applications where the field resolution is required in the range of sub-nano Tesla or in Pico Tesla. Here we present a detailed noise study of the PHE sensors consisting of two or three intersecting ellipses. It can be used to measure two axes of the magnetic field in the sensor plane in particular along the two perpendicular easy axes in the overlapping region for two intersecting ellipses and three easy axes at an angle of 60 degrees for three crossing ellipses. Thus, for each remanent magnetic state in the overlap area, the sensor can measure the vector component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of the remanent magnetization. The two field components are measured with a field resolution less than 200 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz and 350 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 1 Hz in the same region, while maintaining a similar size and noise level of a single-axis sensor. Furthermore, we discuss here the possible route for future improvement of the field resolution

Title: Current-Enabled Optical Conductivity of Collective Modes in Unconventional Superconductors
Authors: Gerrit Niederhoff, Ryusei Kataoka, Kazuaki Takasan, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the current-enabled linear optical conductivity of collective modes in superconductors with unconventional pairing symmetries. After deriving general formulas for the optical conductivity of a superconductor featuring multiple pairing channels and bands using the path integral formalism, we apply these formulas to several models. Using a model of competing s- and d-wave pairing interactions, we find that several known collective modes generate peaks in the optical conductivity upon injection of a supercurrent. This includes single- and multiband versions of Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, mixed-symmetry Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, and Leggett modes. Using a model for interband p-wave superconductivity with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we find that in such a system Bardasis-Schrieffer modes are optically active even without introducing a supercurrent. In a p+ip chiral ground state, these modes turn out to produce peaks in the longitudinal and transverse optical conductivity. Other collective modes belonging to the chiral p+ip order parameter turn out to be unaffected by the spin-orbit coupling but contribute to the optical response when a supercurrent is introduced. These results promise new avenues for the observation of collective modes in a variety of superconducting systems, including multiband superconductors and superconductors that feature multiple pairing channels or multi-component order parameters, such as chiral p- or d-wave superconductors.

Title: Identifying the Nano Interface Through Phase
Authors: Madhuri Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: The quantum dots (QD) interface in solution can play significant roles in electron transfer dynamics for quantum dots-sensitized solar cells and different biological, environmental, and industrial systems. Here, we predict an avenue to identify the contribution of the quantum dots interface created static electric field on the nonlinear optical response (NLO) due to four-wave mixing (FWM), especially for the nanoparticles where surface contribution is high. We implement a way to disentangle the FWM response in QDs originating from the three incoming oscillating laser fields (NLOoscillating) and a contribution (NLOstatic) arising from the three oscillating laser fields and the static electric field caused by the interface. Advanced two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) employs phase-resolved heterodyne techniques where FWM response is measured in a particular phase-matched direction, and the response is distinctively phase sensitive. Theoretical analysis shows alteration in the interface can introduce phase variation in the NLOstatic signal, resulting in a distinct change in the 2D-spectra. Our studies establish a range of ionic strength, which can be important to untwine the usual NLO signal (NLOoscillating) from the NLO (NLOstatic) contributed by the interface of quantum dots. This analysis may open up the possibility to study the different kinds of dynamics occurring specifically in the interface and also will pave the path towards different ion interactions through phase change in 2D spectra, and enormous scope will be employing deep learning-assisted phase recognition.

Title: Defects in Silicon Carbide as Quantum Qubits: Recent Advances in Defect Engineering
Authors: Ivana Capan
Abstract: This review provides an overview of defects in silicon carbide (SiC) with potential applications as quantum qubits. It begins with a brief introduction to quantum qubits and existing qubit platforms, outlining the essential criteria a defect must meet to function as a viable qubit. The focus then shifts to the most promising defects in SiC, notably the silicon vacancy (VSi) and divacancy (VC-VSi). A key challenge in utilizing these defects for quantum applications is their precise and controllable creation. Various fabrication techniques, including irradiation, ion implantation, femtosecond laser processing, and focused ion beam methods, have been explored to create these defects. Designed as a beginner-friendly resource, this review aims to support early-career experimental researchers entering the field of SiC-related quantum qubits. Providing an introduction to defect-based qubits in SiC offers valuable insights into fabrication strategies, recent progress, and the challenges that lie ahead.

Title: Mechanical stability of resonant Bose-Fermi mixtures
Authors: Christian Gualerzi, Leonardo Pisani, Pierbiagio Pieri
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature in the presence of a tunable Feshbach resonance, which induces a competition between boson condensation and boson-fermion pairing when the boson density is smaller than the fermion density. Using a many-body diagrammatic approach validated by fixed-node Quantum Monte Carlo calculations and supported by recent experimental observations, we determine the minimal amount of boson-boson repulsion required to guarantee the stability of the mixture across the entire range of boson-fermion interactions from weak to strong coupling. Our stability phase diagrams indicate that mixtures with boson-to-fermion mass ratios near two, such as the $^{87}$Rb-$^{40}$K system, exhibit optimal stability conditions. Moreover, by applying our results to a recent experiment with a $^{23}$Na-$^{40}$K mixture, we find that the boson-boson repulsion was insufficient to ensure stability, suggesting that the experimental timescale was short enough to avoid mechanical collapse. On the other hand, we also show that even in the absence of boson-boson repulsion, Bose-Fermi mixtures become intrinsically stable beyond a certain coupling strength, preceding the quantum phase transition associated with the vanishing of the bosonic condensate. We thus propose an experimental protocol for observing this quantum phase transition in a mechanically stable configuration.

Title: Response to an external field of a generalized Langevin equation with stochastic resetting of the memory kernel
Authors: Petar Jolakoski, Lasko Basnarkov, Ljupco Kocarev, Aleksandra Popovska-Mitrovikj, Verica Bakeva, Trifce Sandev
Abstract: We study a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) framework that incorporates stochastic resetting of a truncation power-law memory kernel. The inclusion of stochastic resetting enables the emergence of resonance phenomena even in parameter regimes where conventional settings (without resetting) do not exhibit such behavior. Specifically, we explore the response of the system to an external field under three scenarios: (i) a free particle, (ii) a particle in a harmonic potential, and (iii) the effect of truncation in the memory kernel. In each case, the primary focus is on understanding how the resetting mechanism interacts with standard parameters to induce stochastic resonance. In addition, we explore the effect of resetting on the dielectric loss.

Title: Light-field dressing of transient photo-excited states above $E_F$
Authors: Fei Wang, Wanying Chen, Changhua Bao, Tianyun Lin, Haoyuan Zhong, Hongyun Zhang, Shuyun Zhou
Abstract: Time-periodic light-field provides an emerging pathway for dynamically engineering quantum materials by forming hybrid states between photons and Bloch electrons. So far, experimental progress on light-field dressed states has been mainly focused on the occupied states, however, it is unclear if the transient photo-excited states above the Fermi energy $E_F$ can also be dressed, leaving the dynamical interplay between photo-excitation and light-field dressing elusive. Here, we provide direct experimental evidence for light-field dressing of the transient photo-excited surface states above $E_F$, which exhibits distinct dynamics with a delay response as compared to light-field dressed states below $E_F$. Our work reveals the dual roles of the pump pulse in both photo-excitation and light-field dressing, providing a more comprehensive picture with new insights on the light-induced manipulation of transient electronic states.

Title: Properties and prevalence of false poor man's Majoranas in two- and three-site artificial Kitaev chains
Authors: Melina Luethi, Henry F. Legg, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja
Abstract: It was predicted that a minimal chain of two quantum dots (QDs) connected via a superconductor can host perfectly localized zero-energy states, known as poor man's Majoranas (PMMs). It is expected that these states are related to Majorana bound states (MBSs) in longer chains and that the tunable nature of this setup makes it a promising platform to study MBSs. However, realistic systems can only host highly, but not perfectly, localized near-zero-energy states, called imperfect PMMs. It has been shown that these imperfect PMMs can evolve into trivial states unrelated to MBSs when the chain is extended. Such states are called false PMMs, whereas PMMs that evolve into MBSs in long chains are called true PMMs. Here, using a microscopic model of QD-superconductor arrays, we consider properties of false PMMs and the circumstances under which they appear. In two-site systems, we find that the origin of many false PMMs can be related to zero-energy states occurring in the absence of superconductivity and we use this analytic understanding to characterize the false PMMs that are typical for different regions of parameter space. In three-site systems, we show that false PMMs can occur via the same mechanism as for two-site systems, but we also find them in regions of parameter space where they are not predicted to exist, thus hinting that the physics of false PMMs can be richer in longer chains. Finally, we demonstrate that the PMMs most stable to perturbations in chemical potential and with the largest excitation gaps appear in a region of parameter space that also has a large ratio of false to true PMMs.

Title: Selective Kondo screening and strange metallicity by sliding Dirac semimetals
Authors: Hanting Zhong, Shuxiang Yang, Chao Cao, Xiao-Yong Feng, Jianhui Dai
Abstract: Kondo screening of local moments in normal metals typically leads to hybridized conduction and valence bands separated by a Kondo gap, resulting in an insulating state at half-band filling. We show a dramatic change of this scenario in a Dirac-semimetal-based correlated system -- a bilayer honeycomb lattice heterostructure where the local moment lattice is stacked on a Dirac semimetal breaking the inversion symmetry. This system is modeled by an extended Anderson honeycomb lattice involving the real-space dependence of major interlayer hybridization parameters on the relative sliding distance along the armchair direction. First, we unveil the multiple Kondo scales and the successive Kondo breakdown transitions in this correlated heterostructure under sliding. Second, we demonstrate the existence of a genuine selective Kondo screening phase which is stabilized near the A-B stack pattern and is accessible by applying the interlayer voltage. Third, we find a nearly flat hybridized band located concomitantly within the Kondo gap, resulting in an unprecedented metallic state at the half-band filling. This unconventional heavy fermion state is characterized by the violation of Luttinger theorem and the appearance of a Van Hove singularity at the Fermi energy. The general sliding-driven band structure landscape and the implications of our results for the broad context of multiorbital Kondo physics are briefly discussed.

Title: Local equations describe unreasonably efficient stochastic algorithms in random K-SAT
Authors: David Machado, Jonathan González-García, Roberto Mulet
Abstract: Despite significant advances in characterizing the highly nonconvex landscapes of constraint satisfaction problems, the good performance of certain algorithms in solving hard combinatorial optimization tasks remains poorly understood. This gap in understanding stems largely from the lack of theoretical tools for analyzing their out-of-equilibrium dynamics. To address this challenge, we develop a system of approximate master equations that capture the behavior of local search algorithms in constraint satisfaction problems. Our framework shows excellent qualitative agreement with the phase diagrams of two paradigmatic algorithms: Focused Metropolis Search (FMS) and greedy-WalkSAT (G-WalkSAT) for random 3-SAT. The equations not only confirm the numerical observation that G-WalkSAT's algorithmic threshold is nearly parameter-independent, but also successfully predict FMS's threshold beyond the clustering transition. We also exploit these equations in a decimation scheme, demonstrating that the computed marginals encode valuable information about the local structure of the solution space explored by stochastic algorithms. Notably, our decimation approach achieves a threshold that surpasses the clustering transition, outperforming conventional methods like Belief Propagation-guided decimation. These results challenge the prevailing assumption that long-range correlations are always necessary to describe efficient local search dynamics and open a new path to designing efficient algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems.

Title: Rhombohedral graphite junctions as a platform for continuous tuning between topologically trivial and non-trivial electronic phases
Authors: Luke Soneji, Simon Crampin, Marcin Mucha-Kruczynski
Abstract: Manipulating the topological properties of quantum states can provide a way to protect them against disorder. However, typically, changing the topology of electronic states in a crystalline material is challenging because their nature is underpinned by chemical composition and lattice symmetry that are difficult to modify. We propose junctions between rhombohedral graphite crystals as a platform that enables smooth transition between topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes distinguished by the absence or presence of topological junction states. By invoking an analogy with the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the appearance of topological states is related to the symmetry of the atomic stacking at the interface between the crystals. The possibility to explore both the topological and non-topological phases is provided by sliding the crystals with respect to each other.

Title: Layer-dependent field-free switching of Néel vector in a van der Waals antiferromagnet
Authors: Haoran Guo, Zhongchong Lin, Jinhao Lu, Chao Yun, Guanghui Han, Shoutong Sun, Yu Wu, Wenyun Yang, Dongdong Xiao, Zhifeng Zhu, Licong Peng, Yu Ye, Yanglong Hou, Jinbo Yang, Zhaochu Luo
Abstract: Two-dimensional antiferromagnets, combining the dual advantages of van der Waals (vdW) and antiferromagnetic materials, provide an unprecedented platform for exploring emergent spin-related phenomena. However, electrical manipulation of Néel vectors in vdW antiferromagnets - the cornerstone of antiferromagnetic spintronics - remains challenging. Here, we report layer-dependent electrical switching of the Néel vector in an A-type vdW antiferromagnet $(Fe,Co)_3$$GaTe_2$ (FCGT) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The Néel vector of FCGT with odd-number vdW layers can be 180° reversed via spin-orbit torques. Furthermore, we achieve field-free switching in an all-vdW, all-antiferromagnet heterostructure of FCGT/CrSBr in which the noncollinear interfacial spin texture breaks the mirror symmetry. Our results establish layer-controlled spin symmetries and interfacial spin engineering as universal paradigms for manipulating antiferromagnetic order, paving the way for realising reliable and efficient vdW antiferromagnetic devices.

Title: Probing Remote Nuclear Magnetic Moments in hBN with VB Electron Spin

Abstract: Since the initial discovery of optically addressable spins of the negatively charged boron vacancy defect (VB) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), substantial progress has been made, enabling promising applications in quantum sensing, information processing, and simulations. A deep understanding of the VB (electron): hBN (nuclear) spin systems is crucial for realizing these potentials. In this article, we employ Electron Nuclear Double Resonance (ENDOR) to demonstrate the sensing of dis tant nuclear spins via the VB electron spin. We identify the nature and localization of the probed nuclear magnetic moments as 14N spins localized 0.4 nm away from the vacancy and resolve the energies of the corresponding interactions. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations further confirm these findings, providing a detailed description of the interactions between the VB electron spin and surrounding nitrogen atoms in different shells. The results establish the VB electron spin as a promising tool for developing novel van der Waals material-based nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probes, advancing the understanding of spin physics in hBN, and unlocking its potential to study distant nuclear spin interactions in the host.

Title: Solid-State Maser with Microwatt Output Power at Moderate Cryogenic Temperatures
Authors: Yefim Varshavsky, Oleg Zgadzai, Aharon Blank
Abstract: Solid-state masers are uniquely positioned to serve as ultra-low phase noise microwave sources due to their exceptionally low noise temperatures. However, their practical application has been historically limited by low output power and the need for deep cryogenic cooling. In this work, we present a novel design for a continuous-wave diamond-based maser oscillator operating at about 14.5 GHz and moderate cryogenic temperatures (about 180 K), achieving output power levels exceeding -30 dBm (1 microW). This performance represents a two-orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous diamond or ruby-based maser this http URL system integrates a high-Q (about 2460) compact metallic microwave cavity with optically pumped (111)-oriented NV-rich diamond crystals. The cavity supports efficient light coupling and thermal dissipation, enabling sustained high-power optical excitation (>1 W) using cost-effective green LEDs. We demonstrate stable maser operation with good spectral quality and validate its output through both frequency- and time-domain analysis with phase noise data when operated in "free running" mode. Additionally, we provide phase noise estimations based on Leeson's model and show that, when coupled to a high-Q external resonator, such masers could approach thermally limited phase noise levels. These predictions suggest strong potential for diamond masers to outperform traditional ruby-based or similar maser systems, especially given their ability to operate at higher temperatures using rugged, He-free Stirling coolers. Despite current limitations related to frequency stability and jitter, this work establishes diamond-based masers as promising candidates for next-generation ultra-low phase noise microwave oscillators. Further engineering optimization - particularly in field stability, thermal regulation, and feedback locking - will be key to unlocking their full potential.

Title: Extended study of crystal structures, optical properties and vibrational spectra of polar 2-aminopyrimidinium hydrogen phosphite and bis(2-aminopyrimidinium) sulfate monohydrate and two 2-aminopyrimidinium hydrogen sulfate polymorphs
Authors: Irena Matulkova, Ladislav Bohaty, Petra Becker, Ivana Cisarova, Robert Gyepes, Michaela Fridrichova, Jan Kroupa, Petr Nemec, Ivan Nemec
Abstract: This study aimed primarily at completing and extending the characterization of the crystallographic, spectroscopic and optical properties of polar, biaxial, optically negative 2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) hydrogen phosphite. Besides the redetermination of the low-temperature crystal structure (space group P21), high-quality single crystals of this salt were grown from an aqueous solution, and their optical properties were studied. The determination of the refractive indices in the wavelength range of 435-1083 nm showed anomalous dispersion of the refractive indices, resulting in a point of uniaxiality. The crystal allows phase matching for collinear second harmonic generation (SHG) processes of both type I and type II in a broad wavelength range. SHG properties were studied for powdered size-fractioned samples and oriented single-crystal cuts. The optical damage threshold experiments confirmed excellent optical resistance - at least 220 TWm-2 and 70 TWm-2 for 800 and 1000 nm irradiation, respectively. The low-temperature crystallographic study was also extended for three monoclinic salts of 2-aminopyrimidine and sulfuric acid - i.e. bis(2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) sulfate monohydrate (space group P21/n) and two polymorphs of 2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) hydrogen sulfate (both with space group P21/c). The vibrational spectra of all title compounds were assigned using single-molecule quantum chemical computations (including Potential Energy Distribution analysis) in combination with the nuclear site group analysis. Spectroscopic results concerning sulfates of 2-aminopyrimidine provided valuable reference materials for the vibrational spectroscopic study and also addressed the question of their polymorphism. An optimal computational approach employing solid-state DFT calculations has also been sought to model the vibrational spectra of 2-aminopyrimidinium (1+) hydrogen phosphite crystals.

Title: Numerical renormalization of glassy dynamics
Authors: Johannes Lang, Subir Sachdev, Sebastian Diehl
Abstract: The quench dynamics of glassy systems are challenging. Due to aging, the system never reaches a stationary state but instead evolves on emergent scales that grow with its age. This slow evolution complicates field-theoretic descriptions, as the weak long-term memory and the absence of a stationary state hinder simplifications of the memory, always leading to the worst-case scaling of computational effort with the cubic power of the simulated time. Here, we present an algorithm based on two-dimensional interpolations of Green's functions, which resolves this issue and achieves sublinear scaling of computational cost. We apply it to the quench dynamics of the spherical mixed $p$-spin model to establish the existence of a phase transition between glasses with strong and weak ergodicity breaking at a finite temperature of the initial state. By reaching times three orders of magnitude larger than previously attainable, we determine the critical exponents of this transition. Interestingly, these are continuously varying and, therefore, non-universal. While we introduce and validate the method in the context of a glassy system, it is equally applicable to any model with overdamped excitations.

Title: Quantum controlling and the topological properties of the magnon photo-transport in two-dimensional collinear ferromagnet
Authors: Jun-Cen Li, An Du
Abstract: In our work, we study magnon transport induced by light through Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect, including magnon spin photocurrent (MSPC) and magnon energy photocurrent (MEPC). Firstly, we regard the effect of the electric field on the magnon through the AC effect as a perturbation. Then we derived the expressions of MSPC and MEPC in two-dimensional collinear ferromagnetic system. And we apply our theory to the two-dimension ferromagnetic Hexagonal and Kagome lattice. We find that the optical frequency and the relaxation time of the material can be used to control the photo-transport of magnons. In addition, under the condition of low light frequncy and infinite relaxation time, the longitudinal magnon photo-transport is related to the topological property of the magnon system.

Title: Magnetic ground state discrimination of a Polyradical Nanog-raphene using Nickelocene-Functionalized Tips

Abstract: Molecular magnets are a promising class of materials with exciting properties and applications. However, a profound understanding and application of such materials depends on the accurate detection of their electronic and magnetic properties. Despite the availability of experimental techniques that can sense the magnetic signal, the exact determination of the spin ground states and spatial distribution of exchange interaction of strongly correlated single-molecule magnets remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that scanning probe microscopy with a nickelocene-functionalized probe can distinguish between nearly degenerate multireference ground states of single-molecule {\pi}-magnets and map their spatial distribution of the exchange interaction. This method expands the already outstanding imaging capabilities of scanning probe microscopy for characterizing the chemical and electronic structures of individual molecules, paving the way for the study of strongly correlated molecular magnets with unprecedented spatial resolution.

Title: Emergent Theory for Constitutive Relations in Classical Defect Systems
Authors: Hongrui Xu
Abstract: Optical, acoustic, hydrodynamic, and thermal defect systems are often studied by analogy with each other. This may indicate that we may find a emergent theory for constitutive relations of classical defect systems. Start with thermal systems, we put up with a bootstrap method to describe classical transport. We conjecture that Landau-Khalatnikov equation could provide heat constitutive relations when taking heat flux as order parameter. We show that the corresponding effctive Lagrangian has similar form of that of Wick-rotated complex scalar field theory at non-relativistic limit, and only in perfect conducting situation that this system is a canonical ensemble. We argue that our method could be generalized to other systems besides thermal ones. By analogy with ferroelectrics, we propose the thermal domain model, which is a conserved current XY model. Phase transition of the thermal system is qualitatively discussed in this model.

Title: Optical imaging of spontaneous electric polarizations in tetralayer graphene
Authors: Zhou Zhou, Xiyao Peng, Jianfeng Bi, Fei Xue, Jie Jiang, Huizhen Wu, Zhiwen Shi, Haoliang Qian, Toshikaze Kariyado, Sihan Zhao
Abstract: The recent discovery of sliding ferroelectricity has sparked intense interests in studying interfacial polarizations in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials. However, akin to the conventional ferroelectrics, the studies have predominantly reported semiconducting and/or insulating moiré systems and binary compounds. Spontaneous electric polarizations in elemental metallic phases remain scarcity. Here, we report the first optical imaging of intrinsic out-of-plane electric polarizations and domain wall (DW) sliding dynamics in tetralayer graphene, a 2D conductive layer composed entirely of carbon. Using scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), we directly visualize adjacent ABAC and ABCB stacking orders with intrinsic and opposite electric polarizations. Our gate-dependent SNOM measurements reveal distinct optical response that systematically changes upon carrier doping and unconventional interplay between DW sliding and electric polarizations, which are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Independent corroboration through Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and Raman spectroscopy confirms the polar nature and their polarization directions. Furthermore, reversible mechanical switching of polar states via atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip manipulation is also demonstrated. Our work establishes SNOM as a critical tool for probing sliding ferroelectricity in conductive 2D layers, opening avenues for exploring multiferroic behaviors and nonvolatile memory applications in atomically thin metals at room temperature.

Title: Surface Oxidation of SnTe Analyzed by Self-Consistent Fitting of all Emission Peaks in its X-ray Photoelectron Spectrum
Authors: Martin Wortmann, Beatrice Bednarz, Negin Beryani Nezafat, Klaus Viertel, Olga Kuschel, Jan Schmalhorst, Inga Ennen, Maik Gärner, Natalie Frese, Gerhard Jakob, Joachim Wollschläger, Gabi Schierning, Andreas Hütten, Timo Kuschel
Abstract: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is among the most widely used methods for surface characterization. Currently, the analysis of XPS data is almost exclusively based on the main emission peak of a given element and the rest of the spectrum is discarded. This makes quantitative chemical state analyses by peak fitting prone to substantial error, especially in light of incomplete and flawed reference literature. However, most elements give rise to multiple emission peaks in the x-ray energy range, which are virtually never analyzed. For samples with an inhomogeneous depth distribution of chemical states, these peaks show different but interdependent ratios of signal components, as they correspond to different information depths. In this work, we show that self-consistent fitting of all emission peaks lends additional reliability to the depth profiling of chemical states by angular-resolved (AR-)XPS. We demonstrate this using a natively oxidized thin film of the topological crystalline insulator tin telluride (SnTe). This approach is not only complementary to existing depth profiling methods, but may also pave the way towards complete deconvolution of the XPS spectrum, facilitating a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of the surface chemistry of solids.

Title: CRYSIM: Prediction of Symmetric Structures of Large Crystals with GPU-based Ising Machines
Authors: Chen Liang, Diptesh Das, Jiang Guo, Ryo Tamura, Zetian Mao, Koji Tsuda
Abstract: Solving black-box optimization problems with Ising machines is increasingly common in materials science. However, their application to crystal structure prediction (CSP) is still ineffective due to symmetry agnostic encoding of atomic coordinates. We introduce CRYSIM, an algorithm that encodes the space group, the Wyckoff positions combination, and coordinates of independent atomic sites as separate variables. This encoding reduces the search space substantially by exploiting the symmetry in space groups. When CRYSIM is interfaced to Fixstars Amplify, a GPU-based Ising machine, its prediction performance was competitive with CALYPSO and Bayesian optimization for crystals containing more than 150 atoms in a unit cell. Although it is not realistic to interface CRYSIM to current small-scale quantum devices, it has the potential to become the standard CSP algorithm in the coming quantum age.

Title: Brillouin Platycosms and Topological Phases
Authors: Chen Zhang, Peiyuan Wang, Junkun Lyu, Y. X. Zhao
Abstract: There exist ten distinct closed flat $3$D manifolds, known as platycosms, which hold significance in mathematics and have been postulated as potential geometric models for our universe. In this work, we demonstrate their manifestation as universes of Bloch particles, namely as momentum-space units referred to as Brillouin platycosms, which are natural extensions of the Brillouin torus within a broader framework of projective crystallographic symmetries. Moreover, we provide exact K-theoretical classifications of topological insulators over these platycosms by the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, and formulate a complete set of topological invariants for their identification. Topological phase transitions are generically characterized by Weyl semimetals, adhering to the generalized Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem: the total chirality number over a Brillouin platycosm is even (zero) if the platycosm is non-orientable (orientable). Our work generalizes the notion of Brillouin torus to ten Brillouin platycosms and therefore fundamentally diversifies the stages on which Block wavefunctions can perform their topological dance.

Title: Identifying and mitigating errors in hole spin qubit readout

Bedell, Stephan Paredes, Felix J. Schupp, Matthias Mergenthaler, Andreas Fuhrer, Gian Salis, Patrick Harvey-Collard
Abstract: High-fidelity readout of spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots can be achieved by combining a radio-frequency (RF) charge sensor together with spin-to-charge conversion and Pauli spin blockade. However, reaching high readout fidelities in hole spin qubits remains elusive and is complicated by a combination of site-dependent spin anisotropies and short spin relaxation times. Here, we analyze the different error processes that arise during readout using a double-latched scheme in a germanium double quantum dot hole spin qubit system. We first investigate the spin-to-charge conversion process as a function of magnetic field orientation, and configure the system to adiabatically map the $\lvert \downarrow\downarrow \rangle$ state to the only non-blockaded state. We reveal a strong dependence of the spin relaxation rates on magnetic field strength and minimize this relaxation by operating at low fields. We further characterize and mitigate the error processes that arise during the double-latching process. By combining an RF charge sensor, a double-latching process, and optimized magnetic field parameters, we achieve a single-shot single-qubit state-preparation-and-measurement fidelity of 97.0%, the highest reported fidelity for hole spin qubits. Unlike prior works and vital to usability, we simultaneously maintain universal control of both spins. These findings lay the foundation for the reproducible achievement of high-fidelity readout in hole-based spin quantum processors.

Title: Activated solids: Spontaneous deformations, non-affine fluctuations, softening, and failure
Authors: Parswa Nath, Debankur Das, Surajit Sengupta, Debasish Chaudhuri
Abstract: We investigate spontaneous deformations in activated solids by analyzing crystal deformations through non-affine fluctuations. A scaling law for non-affinity is derived, showing it scales quadratically with activity and inversely with density. At high activity, the non-affine parameter diverges, signaling defect proliferation and melting to a hexatic phase. This softening is marked by reduced shear modulus, solid order, and hexatic order. At a higher activity, the hexatic melts to a fluid. We propose locally tuned activity to control non-affinity, demonstrated through numerical simulations. Our predictions are testable in active colloids performing persistent random motion.

Title: Kinetic phase diagram for two-step nucleation in colloid-polymer mixtures
Authors: Willem Gispen, Peter G. Bolhuis, Marjolein Dijkstra
Abstract: Two-step crystallization via a metastable intermediate phase is often regarded as a non-classical process that lies beyond the framework of classical nucleation theory (CNT). In this work, we investigate two-step crystallization in colloid-polymer mixtures via an intermediate liquid phase. Using CNT-based seeding simulations, we construct a kinetic phase diagram that identifies regions of phase space where the critical nucleus is either liquid or crystalline. These predictions are validated using transition path sampling simulations at nine different relevant state points. When the critical nucleus is liquid, crystallization occurs stochastically during the growth phase, whereas for a crystalline critical nucleus, the crystallization process happens pre-critically at a fixed nucleus size. We conclude that CNT-based kinetic phase diagrams are a powerful tool for understanding and predicting `non-classical' crystal nucleation mechanisms.

Title: Generic deformation channels for critical Fermi surfaces including the impact of collisions
Authors: Kazi Ranjibul Islam, Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: This paper constitutes a sequel to our theoretical efforts to determine the nature of the generic low-energy deformations of the Fermi surface of a quantum-critical metal, which arises at the stable non-Fermi liquid (NFL) fixed point of a quantum phase transition. The emergent critical Fermi surface, arising right at the Ising-nematic quantum critical point (QCP), is a paradigmatic example where an NFL behaviour is induced by the strong interactions of the fermionic degrees of freedom with those of the bosonic order parameter. It is an artifact of the bosonic modes becoming massless at the QCP, thus undergoing Landau damping at the level of one-loop self-energy. We resort to the well-tested formalism of the quantum Boltzmann equations (QBEs)for identifying the excitations. While in our earlier works, we have focussed on the collisionless regime by neglecting the collision integral and assuming the bosons to be in equilibrium, here we embark on a full analysis. In particular, we take into account the bosonic part of the QBEs. The final results show that that the emergent modes are long-lived and robust against the damping effects brought about the collision integral(s), exhibiting the same qualitative features as obtained from the no-collision approximations.

Title: Exact Ground States of Two Dimensional $\pm J$ Spin Glasses
Authors: Chaoming Song
Abstract: We derive exact analytical expressions for the ground-state energy and entropy of the two-dimensional $\pm J$ Ising spin glass, uncovering a nested hierarchy of frustrations. Each level in this hierarchy contributes through the kernel and pseudo-determinant of effective operators, capturing the energy and entropy, respectively. At leading order, the structure coincides with geometric plaquette frustrations, while subleading corrections arise from magnetic adjacency matrices defined on percolated clusters in the dual lattice. Our results, supported by numerical simulations, provide a systematic framework for analyzing spin-glass ground states and offer new insight into glass order in finite dimensions.

Title: Signatures of unconventional superconductivity near reentrant and fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulators

Abstract: Two-dimensional moiré Chern bands provide an exceptional platform for exploring a variety of many-body electronic liquid and solid phases at zero magnetic field within a lattice system. One particular intriguing possibility is that flat Chern bands can, in principle, support exotic superconducting phases together with fractional topological phases. Here, we report the observation of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects, the reentrant quantum anomalous Hall effect, and superconductivity within the first moiré Chern band of twisted bilayer MoTe2. The superconducting phase emerges from a normal state exhibiting anomalous Hall effects and sustains an large perpendicular critical magnetic field. Our results present the first example of superconductivity emerging within a flat Chern band that simultaneously hosts fractional quantum anomalous effects, a phenomenon never observed in any other systems. Our work expands the understanding of emergent quantum phenomena in moiré Chern bands, and offers a nearly ideal platform for engineering Majorana and parafermion zero modes in gate-controlled hybrid devices.

Title: Exact Current Fluctuations in a Tight-Binding Chain with Dephasing Noise
Authors: Taiki Ishiyama, Kazuya Fujimoto, Tomohiro Sasamoto
Abstract: For a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise on an infinite interval, we exactly calculate the variance of the integrated current for a step initial condition with average densities, $\rho_a$ on the negative axis and $\rho_b$ on the positive axis. Our exact solution reveals that the presence of dephasing, no matter how small, alters the nature of current fluctuations from ballistic to diffusive in the long-time limit. The derivation relies on the Bethe ansatz on the infinite interval and a nontrivial parameter dependence, referred to as the $\omega$-dependence, of the moment generating function for the integrated current. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the asymptotic form of the variance and a numerically obtained cumulant generating function coincide with those in the symmetric simple exclusion process.

Title: Enhancing TiFe Alloy Activation for Hydrogen Storage Through Al, Cr, Co, and Cu Substitutions as a Step Towards Future Recycling
Authors: Francesca Garelli, Erika Michela Dematteis, Vitalie Stavila, Giuseppe Di Florio, Claudio Carbone, Alessandro Agostini, Mauro Palumbo, Marcello Baricco, Paola Rizzi
Abstract: This study investigates the activation behavior of $TiFe_{0.80}$-$X_{0.20}$ (X = Co, Cu, Cr, Al) alloys to identify the most effective materials for producing hydrogen storage alloys from recycled sources in view of a circular economy perspective. Activation was tested using two methods: a Sievert Volumetric Apparatus at room temperature and 64 bar of hydrogen, and high-pressure differential scanning calorimetry with 50 bar hydrogen under thermal cycles up to 400 °C. Activation properties were analyzed by assessing time for incubation and for full charging, that are influenced, respectively, by surface and bulk diffusion of hydrogen. Results showed that Cr-substituted alloys are rapidly activated, due to the presence of $TiCr_{2}$ compound, while Al-containing alloys absorbed hydrogen immediately. In contrast, Co- and Cu-substituted alloys required extended activation times, due to less quantity of secondary phases and limited diffusion channels.

Title: Screening of material defects using universal machine-learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Ethan Berger, Mohammad Bagheri, Hannu-Pekka Komsa
Abstract: Finding new materials with previously unknown atomic structure or materials with optimal set of properties for a specific application greatly benefits from computational modeling. Recently, such screening has been dramatically accelerated by the invent of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials that offer first principles accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. Their application to the screening of defects with desired properties or to finding new stable compounds with high density of defects, however, has not been explored. Here, we show that the universal machine-learning interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to enable large-scale screening of defective materials. We carried out vacancy calculations for 86 259 materials in the Materials Project database and analyzed the formation energies in terms of oxidation numbers. We further demonstrate the application of these models for finding new materials at or below the convex hull of known materials and for simulated etching of low-dimensional materials.

Title: Data-Driven Insights into Rare Earth Mineralization: Machine Learning Applications Using Functional Material Synthesis Data
Authors: Juejing Liu, Xiaoxu Li, Yifu Feng, Zheming Wang, Kevin M. Rosso, Xiaofeng Guo, Xin Zhang
Abstract: Quantitative understanding of rare earth element (REE) mineralization mechanisms, crucial for improving industrial separation, remains limited. This study leverages 1239 hydrothermal synthesis datapoints from material science as a surrogate for natural REE mineralization. We trained machine learning models (KNN, RF, XGBoost) using precursor, additive, and reaction data to predict product elements and phases, validating predictions with new experiments. XGBoost exhibited the highest accuracy, with feature importance analysis indicating thermodynamic properties were critical for predictions. Observed correlations among reaction parameters aligned with classical crystallization theory. Further XGBoost models successfully predicted reaction temperature and pH from precursor/product data. Our findings demonstrate the cross-disciplinary utility of material science data for geochemical understanding, underscore the need for research on less-studied REE minerals (e.g., carbonates, heavy REEs), and suggest potential to accelerate REE resource development.

Title: Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold: gaplessness, order parameter, and scaling in $d$-dimensions
Authors: Gennady Y. Chitov
Abstract: We study several models of $d$-dimensional fermions ($d=1,2,3$) with an emphasis on the properties of their gapless (metallic) phase. It occurs at $T = 0$ as a continuous transition when zeros of the partition function reach the real range of parameters. Those zeros define the $(d-1)$-manifold of quantum criticality (Fermi surface). Its appearance or restructuring correspond to the Lifshitz transition. Such $(d-1)$-membrane breaks the symmetry of the momentum space, leading to gapless excitations, a hallmark of metallic phase. To probe quantitatively the gapless phase we introduce the geometric order parameter as $d$-volume of the Fermi sea. From analysis of the chain, ladder, and free fermions with different spectra, this proposal is shown to be consistent with scaling near the Lifshitz points of other quantities: correlation length, oscillation wavelength, susceptibilities, and entanglement. All the (hyper)scaling relations are satisfied. Two interacting cases of the Tomonaga-Luttinger ($d=1$) and the Fermi ($d=2,3$) liquids are analysed, yielding the same universality classes as free fermions.

Title: Non-Hermitian Numerical Renormalization Group: Solution of the non-Hermitian Kondo model
Authors: Phillip C. Burke, Andrew K. Mitchell
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonians describe open quantum systems, nonequilibrium dynamics, and dissipative processes. Although a rich range of single-particle NH physics has been uncovered, many-body phenomena in strongly correlated NH systems have been far less well studied. The Kondo effect, an important paradigm for strong correlation physics, has recently been considered in the NH setting. Here we develop a NH generalization of the numerical renormalization group (NRG) and use it to solve the NH Kondo model. Our non-perturbative solution applies beyond weak coupling, and we uncover a nontrivial phase diagram. The method is showcased by application to the NH pseudogap Kondo model, which we show supports a completely novel phase with a genuine NH stable fixed point and complex eigenspectrum. Our NH-NRG code, which can be used in regimes and for models inaccessible to, e.g., perturbative scaling and Bethe ansatz, is provided open source.

Title: Hydrogen-Mediated Control of Phase Formation and Microstructure Evolution
Authors: Lukas Schweiger, Florian Spieckermann, Peter Cengeri, Alexander Schökel, Michael Zehetbauer, Erhard Schafler, Daniel Kiener, Jürgen Eckert
Abstract: Hydrogen is key in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in materials production. At the same time, it significantly affects mechanical properties, often causing unwanted embrittlement. However, rather than solely addressing these disadvantages, hydrogens inevitable role in sustainable metallurgy should be leveraged to create new and potentially superior materials. Here, we show that using hydrogen in the form of metal hydrides introduces a barrier to mechanical alloying, stabilizing otherwise unattainable microstructures. Severe plastic deformation of a composite of the high entropy alloy (HEA) TiVZrNbHf and Cu leads to amorphization while substituting the HEA by its hydride preserves the two-phase structure. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the significantly different hydrogen affinities, together with the restricted dislocation motion in the hydride, create a barrier to mechanical alloying. This hydride route enables new microstructural states, even in well-studied material systems. It opens an additional dimension in designing materials with diverging hydrogen affinities, offering tighter control over mechanical alloying.

Title: Harnessing non-equilibrium forces to optimize work extraction
Authors: Kristian Stølevik Olsen, Rémi Goerlich, Yael Roichman, Hartmut Löwen
Abstract: While optimal control theory offers effective strategies for minimizing energetic costs in noisy microscopic systems over finite durations, a significant opportunity lies in exploiting the temporal structure of non-equilibrium forces. We demonstrate this by presenting exact analytical forms for the optimal protocol and the corresponding work for any driving force and protocol duration. We also derive a general quasistatic bound on the work, relying only on the coarse-grained, time-integrated characteristics of the applied forces. Notably, we show that the optimal protocols often automatically act as information engines that harness information about non-equilibrium forces and an initial state measurement to extract work. These findings chart new directions for designing adaptive, energy-efficient strategies in noisy, time-dependent environments, as illustrated through our examples of periodic driving forces and active matter systems. By exploiting the temporal structure of non-equilibrium forces, this largely unexplored approach holds promise for substantial performance gains in microscopic devices operating at the nano- and microscale.

Title: Minimal mechanism for fluidic flocks in interacting active colloids
Authors: Arvin Gopal Subramaniam, Sagarika Adhikary, Rajesh Singh
Abstract: Collective motion as a flock is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. Finding possible mechanisms of attaining a global polar order via dynamical mechanisms - without any explicit alignment interaction - is an area of active current research. Here, we report a flocking transition sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities in a system of chemically interacting colloidal particles. The basic requirements to sustain the flock are excluded volume repulsions and deterministic long-ranged net repulsive torques, with the time scale individual colloids move a unit length being dominant with respect to the time they deterministically sense chemicals. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. The generality of this phenomenon is displayed for a range of attractive translational forces to which the flock is robust. We rationalize these results with a phenomenological hydrodynamical model.

Title: Universal neural wave functions for high-pressure hydrogen
Authors: David Linteau, Saverio Moroni, Giuseppe Carleo, Markus Holzmann
Abstract: We leverage the power of neural quantum states to describe the ground state wave function of solid and liquid dense hydrogen, including both electronic and protonic degrees of freedom. For static protons, the resulting Born-Oppenheimer energies are consistently lower than all previous projector Monte Carlo calculations for systems containing up to $128$ hydrogen atoms. In contrast to conventional methods, we introduce a universal trial wave function whose variational parameters are optimized simultaneously over a large set of proton configurations spanning a wide pressure-temperature spectrum and covering both molecular and atomic phases. This global optimization not only yields lower energies compared to benchmarks but also brings an enormous reduction in computational cost. By including nuclear quantum effects in the zero-temperature ground state, thus going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, our description overcomes major limitations of current wave functions, notably by avoiding any explicit symmetry assumption on the expected quantum crystal and sidestepping efficiency issues of imaginary time evolution with disparate mass scales. As a first application, we examine crystal formation in an extremely high-density region where pressure-induced melting is expected.

Title: Intertwining Josephson and Vortex Topologies in Conventional Superconductors
Authors: Zhuo Chen, Jiangxu Li, Lun-Hui Hu, Zhen Bi, Rui-Xing Zhang
Abstract: Recent experimental advances have unveiled promising evidence of vortex-bound Majorana quasiparticles in multiple superconducting compounds. However, theoretical progress in understanding these phenomena, especially from ab initio approaches, has been limited by the computational complexity of simulating vortex structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Josephson-vortex correspondence (JVC), a theoretical framework that systematically maps the bound-state topological properties of vortices to those of $\pi$-phase Josephson junctions in the same superconductor. This correspondence allows vortex phase diagrams to be constructed directly from junction calculations, thereby eliminating the need for large-scale vortex calculations. We demonstrate the validity and predictive power of JVC across a variety of effective models, and further extend the framework to the first-principles level. Applying our approach to 2M-WS$_2$ and Sr$_3$SnO, we identify them as realistic, doping-tunable platforms for realizing vortex Majorana zero modes. Our theory will pave the way for ab initio Majorana material discovery and design.

Title: Spin state of iron in I-42d-type Mg2SiO4 at ultra-high pressures
Authors: Tianqi Wan, Yang Sun, Renata M. Wentzcovitch
Abstract: At extreme pressures of approximately 500 GPa, conditions characteristic of the deep interiors of super-Earths, the combination of NaCl-type MgO and post-perovskite-type MgSiO3 (PPv) has been reported to produce a post-PPv phase of Mg2SiO4 with an I-42d symmetry. This post-PPv (pppv) silicate is proposed as the primary mantle silicate in these massive rocky exoplanets. Understanding the fundamental properties of pppv, particularly in solid solutions with Fe2SiO4, is crucial for insights into the interior dynamics and compositions of such planets. In this study, we conduct an ab initio investigation of the properties of Fe2+-bearing pppv at pressures ranging from 400 GPa to 1 TPa. Given the localized nature of 3d-electrons in iron, we employ the LDA+Usc method alongside conventional DFT functionals to probe the electronic structure of this system. The dependence of the Hubbard parameter U on volume and spin state is carefully evaluated. Furthermore, we systematically explore the effects of pressure, temperature, and structural variations on the spin state of iron in Fe2+-bearing pppv, providing valuable data to improve mantle modeling for super-Earth-type exoplanets.

Title: Chiral superconductivity from spin polarized Chern band in twisted MoTe$_2$
Authors: Cheng Xu, Nianlong Zou, Nikolai Peshcherenko, Ammar Jahin, Tingxin Li, Shi-Zeng Lin, Yang Zhang
Abstract: Superconductivity has been observed in twisted MoTe2 within the anomalous Hall metal parent state. Key signatures-including a fully spin/valley polarized normal state, anomalous Hall resistivity hysteresis, superconducting phase adjacent to the fractional Chern insulating state and a narrow superconducting dome at zero gating field-collectively indicate chiral superconductivity driven by intravalley pairing of electrons. Within the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism, we compute the superconducting phase diagram via random phase approximation, incorporating Coulomb repulsion in a realistic continuum model. Our results identify a dominant intravalley pairing with a narrow superconducting dome of p+ip type at zero gate field. This chiral phase contrasts sharply with the much weaker time-reversal-symmetric intervalley pairing at finite gating field. Our work highlights the role of band topology in achieving robust topological superconductivity, and supports the chiral and topological nature of the superconductivity observed in twisted MoTe2.

Title: Pauli 'unlimited': magnetic field induced-superconductivity in UTe$_2$
Authors: Josephine J. Yu, Yue Yu, Chaitanya Murthy, Srinivas Raghu
Abstract: Inspired by the observation of extreme field-boosted superconductivity in uranium ditelluride, we present a scenario in which superconductivity can be induced by a strong Zeeman field, rather than destroyed by it, as is the case in Pauli-limited superconductivity. The resulting superconducting state has an upper critical field far greater than the superconducting transition temperature, and with spin-orbit coupling, it is sensitive to the field orientation. We demonstrate the interplay between superconductivity and metamagnetism in a simple effective theory.

Title: Variational approach to multimode nonlinear optical fibers
Authors: Francesco Lorenzi, Luca Salasnich
Abstract: We analyze the spatiotemporal solitary waves of a graded-index multimode optical fiber with a parabolic transverse index profile. Using the nonpolynomial Schrödinger equation approach, we derive an effective one-dimensional Lagrangian associated with the Laguerre-Gauss modes with a generic radial mode number p and azimuthal index m. We show that the form of the equations of motion for any Laguerre-Gauss mode is particularly simple, and we derive the critical power for the collapse for every mode. By solving the nonpolynomial Schrödinger equation, we provide a comparison of the stationary mode profiles in the radial and temporal coordinates.

Title: PT -symmetry breaking and universal spectral statistics in quantum kicked rotors
Authors: Guang Li, Fuxing Chen, Ping Fang
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous parity-time (PT )-symmetry breaking and spectral properties of a PT symmetric quantum kicked rotor under resonance conditions. At resonance, the QKR reduces to a finite-dimensional system. In the localized regime, we find that increasing the non-Hermitian parameter always induces a transition from a phase where the states exhibit PT symmetry to one where PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. In contrast, in the delocalized regime, the existence of such a transition depends on whether the reduced system is PT symmetric. If the reduced system is not PT symmetric, PT symmetry remains in the broken phase regardless of the non-Hermitian parameter. We further analyze the spectral statistics of the system in the delocalized regime. For real energy spectra, the level-spacing distribution transitions from Wigner-Dyson statistics, associated with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, to Poisson statistics as the non-Hermitian parameter increases, with the intermediate regime well described by the Brody distribution. For complex spectra, the level-spacing ratios and distributions are governed by time-reversal symmetry. The spectral statistics align with predictions for non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles in classes AI† and A, depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry. Our results provide insights into the spectral characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum chaotic systems and their connection to PT symmetry.

Title: Have you tried turning it off and on again? Stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling
Authors: Ofir Blumer, Barak Hirshberg
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used across chemistry, physics, and biology, providing quantitative insight into complex processes with atomic detail. However, their limited timescale of a few microseconds is a significant obstacle in describing phenomena such as conformational transitions of biomolecules and polymorphism in molecular crystals. Recently, stochastic resetting, i.e., randomly stopping and restarting the simulations, emerged as a powerful enhanced sampling approach, which is collective variable-free, highly parallelized, and easily implemented in existing molecular dynamics codes. Resetting expedites sampling rare events while enabling the inference of kinetic observables of the underlying process. It can be employed as a standalone tool or in combination with other enhanced sampling methods, such as Metadynamics, with each technique compensating for the drawbacks of the other. Here, we comprehensively describe resetting and its theoretical background, review recent developments in stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling, and provide instructive guidelines for practitioners.

Title: Modelling Lateral Spread in Wire Flat Rolling
Authors: Mozhdeh Erfanian, Carl D. Slater, Edward James Brambley
Abstract: A mathematical model for wire rolling is presented, focusing on predicting the lateral spread. This provides, for the first time, an analytic model of lateral spread without any fitting parameters. The model is derived directly from the governing equations; in order to obtain a simple model, a rigid perfectly plastic material is assumed and simplified with the assumption of small thickness and width compared to the length of the roll gap (effectively a thin-wire large-roller assumption). The mathematical model is compared against experiments performed on stainless steel wire using a 100mm diameter roller, and is shown to provide accurate predictions of lateral spread across a wide range of wire diameters (2.96mm-7.96mm) and reduction ratios (20%-60%), all without the need for fitting parameters. The model requires only seconds to compute and serves as a robust tool for validating FE results, guiding process design, and laying the foundation for future improved models.

Title: A comprehensive framework to simulate real-time chemical dynamics on a fault-tolerant quantum computer
Authors: Felipe H. da Jornada, Matteo Lostaglio, Sam Pallister, Burak Şahinoğlu, Karthik I. Seetharam
Abstract: We present a comprehensive end-to-end framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of chemical systems on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, incorporating both electronic and nuclear quantum degrees of freedom. An all-particle simulation is nominally efficient on a quantum computer, but practically infeasible. Hence, central to our approach is the construction of a first-quantized plane-wave algorithm making use of pseudoions. The latter consolidate chemically inactive electrons and the nucleus into a single effective dynamical ionic entity, extending the well-established concept of pseudopotentials in quantum chemistry to a two-body interaction. We explicitly describe efficient quantum circuits for initial state preparation across all degrees of freedom, as well as for block-encoding the Hamiltonian describing interacting pseudoions and chemically active electrons, by leveraging recent advances in quantum rejection sampling to optimize the implementations. To extract useful chemical information, we first design molecular fingerprints by combining density-functional calculations with machine learning techniques, and subsequently validate them through surrogate classical molecular dynamics simulations. These fingerprints are then coherently encoded on a quantum computer for efficient molecular identification via amplitude estimation. We provide an extensive analysis of the cost of running the algorithm on a fault-tolerant quantum computer for several chemically interesting systems. As an illustration, simulating the interaction between $\mathrm{NH_3}$ and $\mathrm{BF_3}$ (a 40-particle system) requires 808 logical qubits to encode the problem, and approximately $10^{11}$ Toffoli gates per femtosecond of time evolution. Our results establish a foundation for further quantum algorithm development targeting chemical and material dynamics.

Title: Successive randomized compression: A randomized algorithm for the compressed MPO-MPS product
Authors: Chris Camaño, Ethan N. Epperly, Joel A. Tropp
Abstract: Tensor networks like matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) are powerful tools for representing exponentially large states and operators, with applications in quantum many-body physics, machine learning, numerical analysis, and other areas. In these applications, computing a compressed representation of the MPO--MPS product is a fundamental computational primitive. For this operation, this paper introduces a new single-pass, randomized algorithm, called successive randomized compression (SRC), that improves on existing approaches in speed or in accuracy. The performance of the new algorithm is evaluated on synthetic problems and unitary time evolution problems for quantum spin systems.

Title: One-Dimensional Relativistic Self-Gravitating Systems
Authors: Robert B. Mann
Abstract: One of the oldest problems in physics is that of calculating the motion of $N$ particles under a specified mutual force: the $N$-body problem. Much is known about this problem if the specified force is non-relativistic gravity, and considerable progress has been made by considering the problem in one spatial dimension. Here, I review what is known about the relativistic gravitational $N$-body problem. Reduction to one spatial dimension has the feature of the absence of gravitational radiation, thereby allowing for a clear comparison between the physics of one-dimensional relativistic and non-relativistic self-gravitating systems. After describing how to obtain a relativistic theory of gravity coupled to $N$ point particles, I discuss in turn the two-body, three-body, four-body, and $N$-body problems. Quite general exact solutions can be obtained for the two-body problem, unlike the situation in general relativity in three spatial dimensions for which only highly specified solutions exist. The three-body problem exhibits mild forms of chaos, and provides one of the first theoretical settings in which relativistic chaos can be studied. For $N\geq 4$, other interesting features emerge. Relativistic self-gravitating systems have a number of interesting problems awaiting further investigation, providing us with a new frontier for exploring relativistic many-body systems.

Title: The Power of the Pareto Front: Balancing Uncertain Rewards for Adaptive Experimentation in scanning probe microscopy
Authors: Yu Liu, Sergei V. Kalinin
Abstract: Automated experimentation has the potential to revolutionize scientific discovery, but its effectiveness depends on well-defined optimization targets, which are often uncertain or probabilistic in real-world settings. In this work, we demonstrate the application of Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) to balance multiple, competing rewards in autonomous experimentation. Using scanning probe microscopy (SPM) imaging, one of the most widely used and foundational SPM modes, we show that MOBO can optimize imaging parameters to enhance measurement quality, reproducibility, and efficiency. A key advantage of this approach is the ability to compute and analyze the Pareto front, which not only guides optimization but also provides physical insights into the trade-offs between different objectives. Additionally, MOBO offers a natural framework for human-in-the-loop decision-making, enabling researchers to fine-tune experimental trade-offs based on domain expertise. By standardizing high-quality, reproducible measurements and integrating human input into AI-driven optimization, this work highlights MOBO as a powerful tool for advancing autonomous scientific discovery.

Title: Coherence-decoherence interplay in quantum systems due to projective stochastic pulses: The case of Rabi oscillations
Authors: Sushanta Dattagupta, Shamik Gupta
Abstract: The interplay of coherence and decoherence is played out in a three-level quantum system, in which the third level is incoherently coupled to the second one which itself is in coherent interaction with the first level. The study is based on a stochastic scenario in which the coherent, unitary evolution of the system is randomly interrupted by a Poisson-driven pulse sequence. In the absence of an external pulse, the system undergoes coherent, unitary evolution restricted to the subspace spanned by the first level (level $1$) and the second level (level $2$). The application of a pulse induces transitions between the second and the third level (level $3$), thereby introducing non-unitary effects that perturb the otherwise isolated two-level dynamics. The pulses are assumed to have infinitesimal duration, with strengths modeled as random variables that are uncorrelated across different pulses. A representative model for the stochastically-averaged transition (super)operator mimicking the dynamics induced by the application of pulses allows for an analytical derivation of the matrix elements of the averaged density operator. When the system is initially in level $1$, we obtain in particular the temporal behavior of the stay-put probability, that is, the probability $P_1(t)$ that the system is still in level $1$ at time $t$. As a function of time, the quantity $P_1(t)$ exhibits a coherence-to-decoherence crossover behavior. At short times $t \ll 1/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the average frequency at which pulses are applied to the system, coherent dynamics dominate. Consequently, $P_1(t)$ displays pronounced Rabi-like oscillations. At long times $t \gg 1/\lambda$, decoherence effects prevail, leading to an exponential decay of the form $P_1(t) \sim \exp(-\lambda t)$.

Title: The curious case of operators with spectral density increasing as $Ω(E)\sim e^{\,\mathrm{Const.}\, E^2}$
Authors: Erik Aurell, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: Motivated by a putative model of black holes as quantum objects we consider what types of operators would have a corresponding spectrum. We find that there are indeed such operators, but of a rather unusual types, and for which the wave functions are only barely localized. We point out a tension between such almost delocalized states and black holes as compact objects.

Title: Transport of electrolytes across nanochannels: the role of slip
Authors: F. Carusela, J. Harting, P. Malgaretti
Abstract: We characterize the electrokinetic flow due to the transport of electrolytes embedded in nanochannels of varying cross-section with inhomogeneous slip on their walls, modeled as an effective slip length on the channel wall. We show that, within linear response and Debye-Huckel regime, the transport coefficients, and so the fluxes, can be significantly improved by the presence of a hydrophobic surface coating located at the narrowest section of the nanochannel. Our model indicates that the enhancement is larger when considering electric conductive walls in comparison to dielectric microchannel walls, and it is produced by a synergy between the entropic effects due to the geometry and the presence of the slip boundary layer. Our results show that a tailored hydrophobic coating design can be an effective strategy to improve transport properties in the broad areas of lab-on-a-chip, biophysics, and blue energy harvesting and energy conversion technologies.

Title: Plastic tensor networks for interpretable generative modeling
Authors: Katsuya O. Akamatsu, Kenji Harada, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Naoki Kawashima
Abstract: A structural optimization scheme for a single-layer nonnegative adaptive tensor tree (NATT) that models a target probability distribution is proposed. The NATT scheme, by construction, has the advantage that it is interpretable as a probabilistic graphical model. We consider the NATT scheme and a recently proposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where the objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our results show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the single-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine scheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary bitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks given only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical clustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences. In doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and the versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a candidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these tensor tree generative models including their information content and interpretability.

Title: Semi-classical geometric tensor in multiparameter quantum information
Authors: Satoya Imai, Jing Yang, Luca Pezzè
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) captures the variations of quantum states with parameters, serving as a central concept in modern quantum physics. Its real part, the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), has a measurement-dependent counterpart that links statistics to distinguishability. However, an analogous extension for the QGT is hindered by the fundamental inaccessibility of its imaginary part through measurement probabilities. Here we introduce a counterpart to the QGT that includes measurement operators, termed the \textit{semi-classical} geometric tensor (SCGT). We show that the SCGT provides a lower bound to the QGT that is tight for pure states. Moreover, we use the SCGT to derive sharp multiparameter information bounds and discuss extensions of the Berry phase.

Title: A modified-residue prescription to calculate dynamical correlation functions
Authors: Igor Benek-Lins, Jonathan Discenza, Saurabh Maiti
Abstract: One of the challenges in using numerical methods to address many-body problems is the multi-dimensional integration over poles. More often that not, one needs such integrations to be evaluated as a function of an external variable. An example would be calculating dynamical correlations functions that are used to model response functions, where the external variable is the frequency. The standard numerical techniques rely on building an adaptive mesh, using special points in the Brillouin zone or using advanced smearing techniques. Most of these techniques, however, suffer when the grid is coarse. Here we propose that, if one knows the nature of the singularity in the integrand, one can define a residue and use it to faithfully estimate the integral and reproduce all the resulting singular features even with a coarse grid. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for different scenarios of calculating correlation functions with different resulting singular features, for calculating collective modes and densities of states. We also present a quantitative analysis of the error and show that this method can be widely applicable.

Title: Swinging small quantum systems out of available values of control parameters
Authors: Xikun Li, Tomasz Sowiński
Abstract: When a quantum system is prepared in its many-body ground state, it can be adiabatically driven to another ground state by changing its control parameter. However, relying on adiabaticity is experimentally unjustified. Moreover, the target value of the control parameter may occur outside the experimentally accessible range. The indicated target state, however, can still be reached within a clever protocol of temporal changes of the control parameter provided its decomposition into some basis is known. It turns out that such a protocol can be obtained in the framework of the optimal control theory. In this paper, we show how to apply such an optimization scheme to small quantum systems treating interaction strength as the control parameter. We believe that the proposed approach can be creatively extended to various complex quantum systems.

Title: Computing Canonical Averages with Quantum and Classical Optimizers: Thermodynamic Reweighting for QUBO Models of Physical Systems
Authors: Francesco Slongo, Cristian Micheletti
Abstract: We present a general method to compute canonical averages for physical models sampled via quantum or classical quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). First, we introduce a histogram reweighting scheme applicable to QUBO-based sampling constrained to specific intervals of an order parameter, e.g., physical energy. Next, we demonstrate that the scheme can accurately recover the density of states, which in turn allows for calculating expectation values in the conjugate ensemble, e.g., at a fixed temperature. The method can thus be used to advance the state-of-the-art characterization of physical systems that admit a QUBO-based representation and that are otherwise intractable with real-space sampling methods. A case in point are space-filling melts of lattice ring polymers, recently mapped in QUBO form, for which our method reveals that the ring catenation probability is non-monotonic with the bending rigidity.

Title: Nonhermitian topological zero modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions
Authors: Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence predicts the existence of boundary modes localized at the edges of topologically nontrivial systems. The wavefunctions of hermitian boundary modes can be obtained as the eigenmode of a modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation. Recently, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been extended to nonhermitian systems, which describe physical phenomena such as gain and loss in open and non-equilibrium systems. Nonhermitian energy spectra can be complex-valued and exhibit point gaps or line gaps in the complex plane, whether the gaps can be continuously deformed into points or lines, respectively. Specifically, line-gapped nonhermitian systems can be continuously deformed into hermitian gapped spectra. Here, we find the analytical form of the wavefunctions of nonhermitian boundary modes with zero energy localized at smooth domain boundaries between topologically distinct phases, by solving the generalized Jackiw-Rebbi equation in the nonhermitian regime. Moreover, we unveil a universal relation between the scalar fields and the decay rate and oscillation wavelength of the boundary modes. This relation quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in nonhermitian line-gapped systems in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities and is not affected by the details of the spatial dependence of the scalar fields. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of boundary modes in nonhermitian and topologically nontrivial states of matter.

Title: Transition from edge- to bulk-currents in the quantum Hall regime
Authors: Serkan Sirt, Vladimir Y. Umansky, Afif Siddiki, Stefan Ludwig
Abstract: The integer quantum Hall effect can be observed in a two-dimensional conductor penetrated by a perpendicular magnetic field and with edges connecting the current carrying contacts. Its signature is a state of quantized Hall and simultaneously vanishing longitudinal resistances. A widely accepted model is the Landauer-Büttiker picture, which assumes an incompressible, i.e., electrically insulating bulk state surrounded by current carrying one-dimensional edge channels. This single-particle model is challenged by the screening theory. It derives, that electron-electron interaction leads to a fragmentation of the Hall bar into compressible and incompressible strips, where the current flows inside the incompressible strips. Because the latter gradually shift from the sample edges into the bulk as the magnetic field is increased, it suggests a transition from edge- to bulk-current. We present a direct experimental proof of this transition. Our results support the screening theory.

Title: Bias driven circular current in a ring nanojunction: Critical role of environmental interaction
Authors: Moumita Mondal, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: The specific role of environmental interaction on bias driven circular current in a ring nanojunction is explored within a tight-binding framework based on wave-guide theory. The environmental interaction is implemented through disorder in backbone sites where these sites are directly coupled to parent lattice sites of the ring via single bonds. In absence of backbone disorder circular current becomes zero for a lengthwise symmetric nanojunction, while it increases with disorder which is quite unusual, and after reaching a maximum it eventually drops to zero in the limit of high disorder. The effects of ring-electrode interface configuration, ring-backbone coupling, different types of backbone disorder and system temperature are critically investigated. All the studied results are valid for a broad range of physical parameters, giving us confidence that the outcomes of this theoretical work can be verified experimentally. To make this study self-contained, we also discuss the feasibility of detecting bias-driven circular current and provide design guidelines for implementing our proposed quantum system in a laboratory.

Title: Topological and fractal defect states in non-Hermitian lattices
Authors: Gan Liang, Linhu Li
Abstract: Higher dimensions provide fertile ground for diverse topological phases and their associated localization phenomena, thanks to the rich geometric features of boundaries and defects. In this paper, we investigate non-Hermitian lattices with defects and establish a correspondence between spectral winding topology, fractal structures, and defect-localized states in arbitrary dimensions. Through analytical derivation and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that defect states emerge only when the spectral winding number exceeds a threshold determined by the defect size, which is linked to their fractal characteristics. By utilizing the Green's function, we identify amplified responses at defects under external driving fields, strengthening the physical correspondence between these topological and fractal features. Our findings offer a universal framework for understanding defect-localized states in higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Behavior of water and aqueous LiCl solutions confined in cylindrical silica pores: A wide temperature range molecular dynamics simulation study
Authors: Siddharth Gautam, Lukas Vlcek, Eugene Mamontov, David Cole
Abstract: We report here a molecular dynamics simulation study on water and aqueous LiCl solutions confined in 1.6 nm cylindrical pores of silica to investigate a dynamical cross-over, observed earlier experimentally, wherein LiCl slows down confined water at high temperatures but makes it faster at lower temperatures. The cross-over observed in the experiments is reproduced in the simulations, albeit at lower temperature. Moreover, the cross-over encompasses all aspects of dynamics including translation as well as rotation. Both addition of LiCl and confinement result in a breaking of hydrogen bond network in confined water, eliminating the need for long jumps via exchange of hydrogen bonded partner molecules. This lowers the activation energy for diffusion in the electrolyte solution compared to pure confined water and leads to the dynamical cross-over seen at lower temperatures. Our results thus provide an explanation to the experimentally observed phenomena and provide important insights on the interplay of confinement, temperature and presence of electrolytes on the dynamical behavior of nano-confined water.

Abstract: Integrable systems feature an infinite number of conserved charges and on hydrodynamic scales are described by generalised hydrodynamics (GHD). This description breaks down when the integrability is weakly broken and sufficiently large space-time-scales are probed. The emergent hydrodynamics depends then on the charges conserved by the perturbation. We focus on nearly-integrable Galilean-invariant systems with conserved particle number, momentum and energy. Basing on the Boltzmann approach to integrability-breaking we describe dynamics of the system with GHD equation supplemented with a collision term. The limit of large space-time-scales is addressed using Chapman-Enskog expansion adapted to the GHD equation. For length scales larger than $\sim \lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is integrability-breaking parameter, we recover Navier-Stokes equations and find transport coefficients: viscosity and thermal conductivity. At even larger length scales, this description crosses over to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, characteristic to generic non-integrable one-dimensional fluids. Employing nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics we estimate this crossover length scale as $ \sim \lambda^{-4}$.

Title: Spectroscopy of collective modes in a Bose-Einstein condensate: From single to double excitation periods
Authors: Leandro A. Machado, Lucas Madeira, Mônica A. Caracanhas, Vanderlei S. Bagnato
Abstract: Collective modes are coherent excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), and their study provides insight into the macroscopic quantum phenomena that govern these systems. Collective mode frequencies can be used to probe the properties of BECs, such as the trap geometry, the interatomic interactions, and the presence of defects; hence, it is essential to develop methods for high-resolution determination of collective mode frequencies. A standard technique consists of a single pulse of an external oscillatory field, which we denote Rabi-like due to the analogy with the field of nuclear magnetic resonances. In this work, we propose a method to achieve a better resolution than the Rabi-like protocol, which consists of two oscillating fields separated in time, which we call Ramsey-like. We focus on BECs in harmonic traps, considering mainly the quadrupole and breathing modes for different trap anisotropy values and comparing the results using single and double excitation zones. First, we employ a variational approach with a Thomas-Fermi ansatz, which gives rise to dynamical equations that are numerically solved. Then, we modeled the problem as a three-level system, offering a concise and alternative description of the same dynamics, enabling the idea of coherent control of these collective modes. Both approaches show that the Ramsey-like protocol provides a better resolution than the Rabi-like. This offers the possibility of measuring collective mode frequencies with higher precision, which is important in experiments where they are used as indirect measurements of properties that are difficult to probe.

Title: Multifunctional spintronic transistors: Sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local GMR, and NDR in spin gapless semiconductor and/or spin gapped metal FETs
Authors: Ersoy Şaşıoğlu, Paul Bodewei, Nicki F. Hinsche, Ingrid Mertig
Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, enabling functions beyond conventional electronics. This study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike traditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60 mV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs for low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications like logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support computing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for these multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for simulations. Using a non-equilibrium Green's function method with density functional theory, we simulate transfer ($I{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{G}}$) and output ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{D}}$) characteristics of a VS$_2$/Ga$_2$O$_2$ FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS$_2$, predicting a sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 10$^8$, and a notable non-local GMR effect, demonstrating potential for low-power, high-performance applications.

Title: Measuring pair correlations in Bose and Fermi gases via atom-resolved microscopy
Authors: Ruixiao Yao, Sungjae Chi, Mingxuan Wang, Richard J. Fletcher, Martin Zwierlein
Abstract: We demonstrate atom-resolved detection of itinerant bosonic $^{23}$Na and fermionic $^6$Li quantum gases, enabling the direct in situ measurement of interparticle correlations. In contrast to prior work on lattice-trapped gases, here we realize microscopy of quantum gases in the continuum. We reveal Bose-Einstein condensation with single-atom resolution, measure the enhancement of two-particle $g^{(2)}$ correlations of thermal bosons, and observe the suppression of $g^{(2)}$ for fermions; the Fermi or exchange hole. For strongly interacting Fermi gases confined to two dimensions, we directly observe non-local fermion pairs in the BEC-BCS crossover. We obtain the pairing gap, the pair size, and the short-range contact directly from the pair correlations. In situ thermometry is enabled via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our technique opens the door to the atom-resolved study of strongly correlated quantum gases of bosons, fermions, and their mixtures.

Title: Glassy disordered ground states in the frustrated pyrochlore and fluorite antiferromagnets NaCd$M_2$F$_7$ ($M$ = Ni$^{2+}$, Mn$^{2+}$)
Authors: Andrej Kancko, Cinthia Antunes Corrêa, Ross Harvey Colman
Abstract: We report the crystal structures, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of two magnetically frustrated $A$'$A$"$M_2$F$_7$-type antiferromagnets, NaCdNi$_2$F$_7$ and NaCdMn$_2$F$_7$. While NaCdNi$_2$F$_7$ forms a stable pyrochlore structure (SG: $Fd \overline{3} m$, #227) with magnetic $S$ = 1 Ni$^{2+}$ ions on the frustrated pyrochlore 16$c$ site and fully disordered non-magnetic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ ions on the pyrochlore 16$d$ site, NaCdMn$_2$F$_7$ favors the defect-fluorite structure (SG: $Fm \overline{3} m$, #225) with magnetic $S$ = 5/2 Mn$^{2+}$ and non-magnetic Na$^+$ and Cd$^{2+}$ ions fully disordered on the fluorite 4$a$ site. This is a result of the Mn$^{2+}$ ionic radius being too close to the average Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ ionic radius, hindering the cationic site ordering towards the stable pyrochlore structure. In both cases, dominant antiferromagnetic interactions $\theta_{CW,Ni}$ = -91.2(5) K and $\theta_{CW,Mn}$ = -42.4(4) K are noted, with no magnetic transition until $T_{f,Ni}$ = 3.2 K and $T_{f,Mn}$ = 2.0 K, implying substantial frustration, with frustration indices $f_{Ni}$ = 28.5 and $f_{Mn}$ = 21. AC susceptibility measurements and bifurcation of ZFC/FC low-field magnetization indicate a glassy ground-state, precipitated by the magnetic-bond-disorder stemming from the inherent structural disorder.

Title: Molten salt ion source using glass capillaries as emitter
Authors: M. Leger, E. Giglio, S. Guillous, A. Houel
Abstract: A proof of concept of an ion source using a molten salt mixture rich in Cs and O ions, able to emit an ion current both in positive and negative polarities, is presented. Similar to liquid metal ion sources, the ions of the salt are emitted by field evaporation from a Taylor cone formed under the influence of an intense electric field. In contrast to an "open" source design in which the conducting liquid covers the surface of a metallic needle, the presented setup uses a conical glass capillary as an emitter tip. {\ffcol The latter is observed by a camera, which revealed the formation of a bubble in the tip containing the molten salt. A glow was also observed during beam emission revealing the anchoring point of the stressed meniscus.} A stable ion beam emission of about 50 min and an intensity of several $\mu$A was obtained. The behavior of the molten salt mixture in vacuum conditions is discussed, as its properties are essential to the design of the presented ion source.

Title: Detecting the topological winding of superconducting nodes via Local Density of States
Authors: Lena Engström, Pascal Simon, Andrej Mesaros
Abstract: Many systems are topologically trivial in the bulk, but still have non-trivial wavefunctions locally in the Brillouin zone. For example, in a small-gap Dirac material the Berry curvature is strongly peaked, but cancels over the full Brillouin zone, while in semimetals and in nodal superconductors there may be a lower-dimensional winding topology associated to the nodes. Experimentally, it is difficult to directly observe such topology. We consider general bulk Hamiltonians with nodes and chiral symmetry, extending to them the method developed in Dutreix et al. [Nature, 574(7777):219-222 (2019)], which in particular detected the winding around Dirac cones in graphene using charge modulations around an impurity. We apply our method to nodal superconductors in 2d, in presence of a (non)magnetic impurity, measured by standard or spin-polarized STM tip. We derive general conditions on the impurity scattering and on the STM tip, expressed in terms of their preference among the two chiralities, for when the measurement near the impurity captures the winding difference between any chosen pair of (Bogoliubon) Dirac cones. We emphasize the robustness of observing vortices in momentum space, in contrast to dislocations in real space, in STM data. Testing the conditions on the topological nodal superconductor proposed for monolayer NbSe2 under an in-plane magnetic field, we find that spin-polarized STM on a magnetic impurity can detect the winding of each of the 12 nodes. We conclude that a judicious choice of impurity can be a powerful tool to determine topological quantities in 2d superconducting systems as well as any nodal chiral system.

Title: Growth of hexagonal BN crystals by traveling-solvent floating zone
Authors: Eli Zoghlin, Juliette Plo, Gaihua Ye, Cynthia Nnokwe, Reina Gomez, Austin Ferrenti, Satya Kushwaha, Rui He, Stephen D. Wilson, Pierre Valvin, Bernard Gil, Guillaume Cassabois, James H. Edgar, Tyrel M. McQueen
Abstract: Large, high-purity single-crystals of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are essential for exploiting its many desirable and interesting properties. Here, we demonstrate via X-ray tomography, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy that h-BN crystals can be grown by traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ). The diameters of grown boules range from 3 - 5 mm with lengths from 2 - 10 mm. Tomography indicates variable grain sizes within the boules, with the largest having areas of $\approx$ 1 mm $\times$ 2 mm and thickness $\approx$ 0.5 mm. Although the boules contain macroscale flux inclusions, the h-BN lattice itself is of high quality for samples grown under optimized conditions. The currently optimized growth procedure employs an Fe flux, moderate N$_2$ pressure ($P_{N2} \approx$ 6 bar), and a growth rate of 0.1 mm/h. Raman spectroscopy for an optimized sample gives an average linewidth of 7.7(2) cm$^{-1}$ for the E$_{\mathrm{2g}}$ intralayer mode at 1365.46(4) cm$^{-1}$ and 1.0(1) cm$^{-1}$ for the E$_{\mathrm{2g}}$ interlayer shear mode at 51.78(9) cm$^{-1}$. The corresponding photoluminescence spectrum shows sharp phonon-assisted free exciton peaks and minimal signal in the energy range corresponding to carbon-related defects ($E$ = 3.9 4.1 eV). Our work demonstrates the viability of growing h-BN by the TSFZ technique, thereby opening a new route towards larger, high-quality crystals and advancing the state of h-BN related research.

Title: Anomalous bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear Rice-Mele model
Authors: Chenxi Bai, Zhaoxin Liang
Abstract: Bulk-edge correspondence (BEC) constitutes a fundamental concept within the domain of topological physics, elucidating the profound interplay between the topological invariants that characterize the bulk states and the emergent edge states. A recent highlight along this research line consists of establishing BEC under the eigenvalue's nonlinearity in a linear Hamiltonian by introducing auxiliary eigenvalues [\href{this https URL}{ T. Isobe {\it et al.,} Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)}]. The purpose of this work aims to extend Isobe's analysis to uncover BEC of eigenvalue's nonlinearity in intrinsic nonlinear Hamiltonians. To achieve this, we numerically solve the nonlinear Rice-Mele (RM) model and identify two distinct types of nonlinear eigenvalues: the intrinsically nonlinear eigenvalues and the eigenvalue's nonlinearity introduced through the incorporation of auxiliary eigenvalues. Furthermore, we establish a novel form of BEC based on these auxiliary nonlinear eigenvalues, which we term the anomalous BEC of a nonlinear physical system. The concept of the anomalous BEC defined herein provides a novel perspective on the intricate interplay between topology and nonlinearity in the context of BEC.

Title: Stability of the long-range corrected exchange-correlation functional and the Proca procedural functional in time-dependent density-functional theory
Authors: Jared R. Williams, Carsten A. Ullrich
Abstract: Excitonic effects in the optical absorption spectra of solids can be described with time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) in the linear-response regime, using a simple class of approximate, long-range corrected (LRC) exchange-correlation functionals. It was recently demonstrated that the LRC approximation can also be employed in real-time TDDFT to describe exciton dynamics. Here, we investigate the numerical stability of the time-dependent LRC approach using a two-dimensional model solid. It is found that the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation with an LRC vector potential becomes more and more prone to instabilities for increasing exciton binding energies. The origin of these instabilities is traced back to time-averaged violations of the zero-force theorem, which leads to a simple and robust numerical stabilization scheme. This explains and justifies a recently proposed method by Dewhurst et al. [Phys. Rev. B 111, L060302 (2025)] to stabilize the LRC vector potential, known as the Proca procedural functional.

Title: Machine learning-guided construction of an analytic kinetic energy functional for orbital free density functional theory
Authors: Sergei Manzhos, Johann Luder, Pavlo Golub, Manabu Ihara
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) of kinetic energy functionals (KEF) for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) holds the promise of addressing an important bottleneck in large-scale ab initio materials modeling where sufficiently accurate analytic KEFs are lacking. However, ML models are not as easily handled as analytic expressions; they need to be provided in the form of algorithms and associated data. Here, we bridge the two approaches and construct an analytic expression for a KEF guided by interpretative machine learning of crystal cell-averaged kinetic energy densities ({\tau}) of several hundred materials. A previously published dataset including multiple phases of 433 unary, binary, and ternary compounds containing Li, Al, Mg, Si, As, Ga, Sb, Na, Sn, P, and In was used for training, including data at the equilibrium geometry as well as strained structures. A hybrid Gaussian process regression - neural network (GPR-NN) method was used to understand the type of functional dependence of {\tau} on the features which contained cell-averaged terms of the 4th order gradient expansion and the product of the electron density and Kohn-Sham effective potential. Based on this analysis, an analytic model is constructed that can reproduce Kohn-Sham DFT energy-volume curves with sufficient accuracy (pronounced minima that are sufficiently close to the minima of the Kohn-Sham DFT-based curves and with sufficiently close curvatures) to enable structure optimizations and elastic response calculations.

Title: Probing $p$-wave effects in spin-density separation of Bose mixtures by dynamic structure factor
Authors: Xiaoran Ye, Zhaoxin Liang
Abstract: Quantum mixtures of Bose gases with tunable $s$- and $p$-wave interactions offer a versatile platform to explore strongly correlated phases and exotic phenomena. While repulsive interactions often drive phase separation, the interplay of $p$-wave interactions with spin-density decoupling remains underexplored. In this work, we employ the path integal field theory to investigate the role of $p$-wave interactions in three-dimensional two-component Bose gas. We derive the Lee-Huang-Yang corrections to the ground-state energy and quantum depletion, revealing how $p$-wave interactions modify equations of state of the model system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $p$-wave interactions predominantly renormalize the spin-sector effective mass in the language of decoupling the density and spin-density degrees of freedom. This effect manifests in the dynamic structure factor, computed via hydrodynamic theory, where Bragg spectroscopy can detect a tunable splitting between spin and density modes. Our results bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, offering insights into anisotropic interaction effects in quantum gases and their implications for probing emergent phases.

Title: Ab Initio Theory of Large Phonon Magnetic Moments Induced by Electron-Phonon Coupling in Magnetic Materials
Authors: Fuyi Wang, Xinqi Liu, Hong Sun, Huaiqiang Wang, Shuichi Murakami, Lifa Zhang, Haijun Zhang, Dingyu Xing
Abstract: Chiral phonons, characterized by nonzero angular momenta and magnetic moments, have attracted extensive attention. However, a long-standing critical issue in this field is the lack of an approach to accurately calculate phonon magnetic moments resulting from electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in realistic materials. Here, based on the linear response framework, we develop an ab initio theory for calculating EPC-induced magnetic properties of phonons, applicable to both insulating and metallic materials. Then, we evidently demonstrate EPC-induced large phonon magnetic moments and phonon Zeeman splittings resulting from spin-phonon coupling in magnetic metals. Interestingly, these splittings can open substantial topologically nontrivial phonon gaps, generating intrinsic phonon Chern states. Further, by constructing an inertially decoupled lattice model, we predict candidate materials exhibiting such intrinsic phonon Chern states with robust edge phonon currents which are proposed to detect neutral particles, such as dark matter particles. Our work enables \emph{ab initio} calculations for EPC-induced magnetic properties of phonons and long-sought magnetic phonon spectra.

Title: On the Automation of High Throughput Modeling of Adsorption In Porous Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks
Authors: Michael O. Atambo, Korir Kiptiemoi
Abstract: The zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) have emerged as a promising candidate for catalysis, carbon-dioxide (CO$_{2}$) capture and storage as well as flue gas separation due to their tunable porosity and chemical stability. ZIFs consists of transition metals in a tetrahedral coordination with imidazolate linkers, allowing for structural modifications that can enhance CO$_{2}$ adsorption and storage. To systematically design and optimize ZIFs for superior CO$_{2}$ capture performance, theoretical modelling provides an effective approach, though hindered by the sheer size of the search space, with hundred to thousands of possible sites per ZIF, and thousands of possible ZIF that can be synthesized. In this work, we employ a high-throughput techniques underpinned by first-principle Density Functional Theory (DFT) to develop a systematic automated method for characterizing adsorption energetics in ZIFs, guiding the rational design and selection of desirable ZIF structures. Using high-throughput computing tools, we perform pore and pore size analysis, and implement automated CO$_{2}$ molecule placement algorithm, accounting for positional symmetry, crystallographic orientation, and collision detection. The results obtained are in good agreement with previous studies, demonstrating the reliability of the approach in accelerating the discovery of next-generation ZIFs for CO$_{2}$ capture and storage.

Title: Magnetic moment of electrons in systems with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: I. A. Ado, M. Titov, Rembert A. Duine, Arne Brataas
Abstract: Magnetic effects originating from spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been attracting major attention. However, SOC contributions to the electron magnetic moment operator are conventionally disregarded. In this work, we analyze relativistic contributions to the latter operator, including those of the SOC-type: in vacuum, for the semiconductor 8 band Kane model, and for an arbitrary system with two spectral branches. In this endeavor, we introduce a notion of relativistic corrections to the operation $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $\boldsymbol B$ is an external magnetic field. We highlight the difference between the magnetic moment and $-\partial H/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $H$ is the system Hamiltonian. We suggest to call this difference the abnormal magnetic moment. We demonstrate that the conventional splitting of the total magnetic moment into the spin and orbital parts becomes ambiguous when relativistic corrections are taken into account. The latter also jeopardize the ``modern theory of orbital magnetization'' in its standard formulation. We derive a linear response Kubo formula for the kinetic magnetoelectric effect projected to individual branches of a two branch system. This allows us, in particular, to identify a source of this effect that stems from noncommutation of the position and $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$ operators' components. This is an analog of the contribution to the Hall conductivity from noncommuting components of the position operator. We also report several additional observations related to the electron magnetic moment operator in systems with SOC and other relativistic corrections.

Title: Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D
Authors: Yantao Wu, Wen-Yuan Liu
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which simplifies existing algorithms already for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient variational optimization for (2+1)D LGT ground states with gauge and matter fields. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate simulation of pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory, odd-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32\times 32$. Our work establishes gauge-invariant PEPS as a powerful approach to simulate (2+1)D Abelian LGTs.

Title: SEMIDV: A Compact Semiconductor Device Simulator with Quantum Effects
Authors: Chien-Ting Tung
Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.

Title: Typical reconstruction limit and phase transition of maximum entropy method
Authors: Masaru Hitomi, Masayuki Ohzeki
Abstract: We investigate the dependence of the maximum entropy method (MEM) reconstruction performance on the default model. The maximum entropy method is a reconstruction technique that utilizes prior information, referred to as the default model, to recover original signals from observed data, and it is widely used in underdetermined systems. The broad applications have been reported in fields ranging from the analysis of observational data in seismology and astronomy, to large-scale computations in quantum chemistry, and even in social sciences such as linguistics. However, a known drawback of MEM is that its results depend on the assumed default model. In this study, we employ the replica method to elucidate how discrepancies in the default model affect the reconstruction of signals with specific distributions. We report that in certain cases, even small discrepancies can induce phase transitions, leading to reconstruction failure. Additionally, by comparing MEM with reconstruction based on L1-norm optimization, a method proposed in recent years, we demonstrate that MEM exhibits lower reconstruction accuracy under certain conditions.

Title: Symmetrizing the Constraints -- Density Matrix Renormalization Group for Constrained Lattice Models
Authors: Ting-Tung Wang, Xiaoxue Ran, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: We develop a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for constrained quantum lattice models that successfully implements the local constraints as symmetries in the contraction of the matrix product states and matrix product operators. Such an implementation allows us to investigate a quantum dimer model in DMRG with substantial circumference on cylindrical geometry for the first time in the literature. We have thence computed the ground state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on triangular lattice, with the symmetry-breaking characteristics of the columnar solid phase and $\sqrt{12}\times\sqrt{12}$ valence bond solid phase fully captured, as well as the topological entanglement entropy of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase that extends to the RK point on non-bipartite lattice accurately revealed. Our DMRG algorithm on constrained quantum lattice models opens new opportunities for matrix and tensor-based algorithms for these systems that have immediate relevance towards the frustrated quantum magnets and synthetic quantum simulators.

Title: Pyroelectric doping reversal of MoS2 p-n junctions on ferroelectric domain walls probed by photoluminescence
Authors: Javier Fernández-Martínez, Joan J. Ronquillo, Guillermo López-Polín, Herko P. van der Meulen, Mariola O Ramírez, Luisa E. Bausá
Abstract: Tailoring the optical properties and electronic doping in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a central strategy for developing innovative systems with tunable characteristics. In this context, pyroelectric materials, which hold the capacity for charge generation when subjected to temperature changes, offer a promising route for this modulation. This work employs spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) to explore the impact of pyroelectricity on the electronic doping of monolayer MoS2 deposited on periodically poled LiNbO3 (LN) substrates. The results demonstrate that pyroelectricity in LN modulates the charge carrier density in MoS2 on ferroelectric surfaces acting as doping mechanism without the need for gating electrodes. Furthermore, upon cooling, pyroelectric charges effectively reverse the doping of p-n junctions on DWs, converting them into n-p junctions. These findings highlight the potential of pyroelectric substrates for tunable and configurable charge engineering in transition metal dichalcogenides and suggest their applicability to other combinations of 2D materials and ferroelectric substrates. They also open avenues for alternative device architectures in nanoelectronic or nanophotonic devices including switches, memories or sensors.

Title: Towards "on-demand" van der Waals epitaxy with hpc-driven online ensemble sampling
Authors: Soumendu Bagchi, Ankita Biswas, Prasanna V. Balachandran, Ayana Ghosh, Panchapakesan Ganesh
Abstract: Traditional approaches to achieve targeted epitaxial growth involves exploring a vast parameter space of thermodynamical and kinetic drivers (e.g., temperature, pressure, chemical potential etc). This tedious and time-consuming approach becomes particularly cumbersome to accelerate synthesis and characterization of novel materials with complex dependencies on local chemical environment, temperature and lattice-strains, specifically nanoscale heterostructures of layered 2D materials. We combine the strength of next generation supercomputers at the extreme scale, machine learning and classical molecular dynamics simulations within an adaptive real time closed-loop virtual environment steered by Bayesian optimization to enable asynchronous ensemble sampling of the synthesis space, and apply it to the recrystallization phenomena of amorphous transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) bilayer to form stack moiré heterostructures under various growth parameters. We show that such asynchronous ensemble sampling frameworks for materials simulations can be promising towards achieving on-demand epitaxy of van der Waals stacked moiré devices, paving the way towards a robust autonomous materials synthesis pipeline to enable unprecedented discovery of new functionalities.

Title: Computable and Faithful Lower Bound on Entanglement Cost
Authors: Xin Wang, Mingrui Jing, Chengkai Zhu
Abstract: Quantifying the minimum entanglement needed to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes is a key challenge in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop computable and faithful lower bounds on the entanglement cost under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT operations), by introducing logarithmic $k$-negativity, a generalization of logarithmic negativity. Our bounds are efficiently computable via semidefinite programming and provide non-trivial values for all states that are not PPT, establishing their faithfulness. Notably, we find and affirm the irreversibility of asymptotic entanglement manipulation under PPT operations for full-rank entangled states. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost of both point-to-point and bipartite quantum channels. Our bound demonstrates improvements over previously known computable bounds for a wide range of states and channels. These findings push the boundaries of understanding the structure of entanglement and the fundamental limits of entanglement manipulation.

Title: Optical pumping through the Liouvillian skin effect
Authors: De-Huan Cai, Wei Yi, Chen-Xiao Dong
Abstract: The Liouvillian skin effect describes the boundary affinity of Liouvillian eignemodes that originates from the intrinsic non-Hermiticity of the Liouvillian superoperators. Dynamically, it manifests as directional flow in the transient dynamics, and the accumulation of population near open boundaries at long times. Intriguingly, similar dynamic phenomena exist in the well-known process of optical pumping, where the system is driven into a desired state (or a dark-state subspace) through the interplay of dissipation and optical drive. In this work, we show that typical optical pumping processes can indeed be understood in terms of the Liouvillian skin effect. By studying the Liouvillian spectra under different boundary conditions, we reveal that the Liouvillian spectra of the driven-dissipative pumping process sensitively depend on the boundary conditions in the state space, a signature that lies at the origin of the Liouvillian skin effect. Such a connection provides insights and practical means for designing efficient optical-pumping schemes through engineering Liouvillian gaps under the open-boundary condition. Based on these understandings, we show that the efficiency of a typical side-band cooling scheme for trapped ions can be dramatically enhanced by introducing counterintuitive dissipative channels. Our results provide a useful perspective for optical pumping, with interesting implications for state preparation and cooling.

Title: Exact closed-form unitary transformations of fermionic operators
Authors: Francesco A. Evangelista, Ilias Magoulas
Abstract: Unitary transformations play a fundamental role in many-body physics, and except for special cases, they are not expressible in closed form. We present closed-form expressions for unitary transformations generated by a single fermionic operator for Hermitian and anti-Hermitian generators. We demonstrate the usefulness of these expressions in formal analyses of unitary transformations and numerical applications involving block-diagonalization and Heisenberg dynamics. This work paves the way for new analytical treatments of unitary transformations and numerical many-body methods for fermions.

Title: Compressing Hamiltonians with \emph{ab initio} downfolding for simulating strongly-correlated materials on quantum computers
Authors: Antonios M. Alvertis, Abid Khan, Norm M. Tubman
Abstract: The accurate first-principles description of strongly-correlated materials is an important and challenging problem in condensed matter physics. \emph{Ab initio} downfolding has emerged as a way of deriving compressed many-body Hamiltonians that maintain the essential physics of strongly-correlated materials. The solution of these material-specific models is still exponentially difficult to generate on classical computers, but quantum algorithms allow for a significant speed-up in obtaining the ground states of these compressed Hamiltonians. Here we demonstrate that utilizing quantum algorithms for obtaining the properties of downfolded Hamiltonians can indeed yield high-fidelity solutions. By combining \emph{ab initio} downfolding and variational quantum eigensolvers, we correctly predict the antiferromagnetic state of one-dimensional cuprate $\text{Ca}_2\text{CuO}_3$, the excitonic ground state of monolayer $\text{WTe}_2$, and the charge-ordered state of correlated metal $\text{SrVO}_3$. Numerical simulations utilizing a classical tensor network implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers allow us to simulate large models with up to $54$ qubits and encompassing up to four bands in the correlated subspace, which is indicative of the complexity that our framework can address. Through these methods we demonstrate the potential of classical pre-optimization and downfolding techniques for enabling efficient materials simulation using quantum algorithms.

Title: Quantum resources of quantum and classical variational methods
Authors: Thomas Spriggs, Arash Ahmadi, Bokai Chen, Eliska Greplova
Abstract: Variational techniques have long been at the heart of atomic, solid-state, and many-body physics. They have recently extended to quantum and classical machine learning, providing a basis for representing quantum states via neural networks. These methods generally aim to minimize the energy of a given ansätz, though open questions remain about the expressivity of quantum and classical variational ansätze. The connection between variational techniques and quantum computing, through variational quantum algorithms, offers opportunities to explore the quantum complexity of classical methods. We demonstrate how the concept of non-stabilizerness, or magic, can create a bridge between quantum information and variational techniques and we show that energy accuracy is a necessary but not always sufficient condition for accuracy in non-stabilizerness. Through systematic benchmarking of neural network quantum states, matrix product states, and variational quantum methods, we show that while classical techniques are more accurate in non-stabilizerness, not accounting for the symmetries of the system can have a severe impact on this accuracy. Our findings form a basis for a universal expressivity characterization of both quantum and classical variational methods.

Title: Design and development of advanced Al-Ti-V alloys for beampipe applications in particle accelerators
Authors: Kamaljeet Singh, Kangkan Goswami, Raghunath Sahoo, Sumanta Samal
Abstract: The present investigation reports the design and development of an advanced material with a high figure of merit (FoM) for beampipe applications in particle accelerators by bringing synergy between computational and experimental approaches. Machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the phase(s), low density, and high radiation length of the designed Al-Ti-V alloys. Al-Ti-V alloys with various compositions for single-phase and dual-phase mixtures, liquidus temperature, and density values are obtained using the Latin hypercube sampling method in TC Python Thermo-Calc software. The obtained dataset is utilized to train the machine-learning algorithms. Classification algorithms such as XGBoost and regression models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest regressor have been used to compute the number of phases, radiation length, and density respectively. The XGBoost algorithms show an accuracy of $98\%$, the Linear regression model shows an accuracy of $94\%$, and the Random Forest regressor model is accurate up to $99\%$. The developed Al-Ti-V alloys exhibit high radiation length as well as a good combination of high elastic modulus and toughness due to the synergistic effect of the presence of hard $Al_3Ti$ phase along with a minor volume fraction of FCC $(Al)_{ss}$ solid solution phase mixture. The comparison of our alloys, alloy-1 ($Al_{75.2}Ti_{22.8}V_{2}$) and alloy-2 ($Al_{89}Ti_{10}V_{1}$) shows an increase in the radiation length by seven-times and a decrease in the density by two to three times as compared to stainless steel 304, the preferred material for constructing beampipes in low-energy particle accelerators. Further, we experimentally verify the elastic modulus of the alloy-1 and compute the FoM equal to 0.416, which is better than other existing materials for beampipes in low-energy experiments.

Title: Surface data imputation with stochastic processes
Authors: Arsalan Jawaid, Samuel Schmidt, Marvin Lotz, Jörg Seewig
Abstract: Spurious measurements frequently occur in surface data from technical components. Excluding or ignoring these spurious points may lead to incorrect surface characterization if these points inherit features of the surface. Therefore, data imputation must be applied to ensure that the estimated data points at spurious measurements do not deviate strongly from the true surface and its characteristics. Traditional surface data imputation methods rely on simple assumptions and ignore existing knowledge of the surface, resulting in suboptimal estimates. In this paper, we propose the use of stochastic processes for data imputation. This approach, which originates from surface texture simulation, allows a straightforward integration of a priori knowledge. We employ Gaussian processes with both stationary and non-stationary covariance structures to address missing values in surface data. In addition, we apply the method to a real-world scenario in which a spurious turned profile is obtained from an actual measurement. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method fills the missing values by maintaining the surface characteristics, particularly when surface features are missing.

Title: Training the parametric interactions in an analog bosonic quantum neural network with Fock basis measurement
Authors: Julien Dudas, Baptiste Carles, Elie Gouzien, Julie Grollier, Danijela Marković
Abstract: Quantum neural networks have the potential to be seamlessly integrated with quantum devices for the automatic recognition of quantum states. However, performing complex tasks requires a large number of neurons densely connected through trainable, parameterized weights - a challenging feat when using qubits. To address this, we propose leveraging bosonic modes and performing Fock basis measurements, enabling the extraction of an exponential number of features relative to the number of modes. Unlike qubits, bosons can be coupled through multiple parametric drives, with amplitudes, phases, and frequency detunings serving dual purposes: data encoding and trainable parameters. We demonstrate that these parameters, despite their differing physical dimensions, can be trained cohesively using backpropagation to solve benchmark tasks of increasing complexity. Notably, we show that the network can be trained even though the number of trainable parameters scales only linearly with the number of modes, whereas the number of neurons grows exponentially. Furthermore, we show that training not only reduces the number of measurements required for feature extraction compared to untrained quantum neural networks, such as quantum reservoir computing, but also significantly enhances the expressivity of the network, enabling it to solve tasks that are out of reach for quantum reservoir computing.

Title: Characterizing the Yang-Lee zeros of the classical Ising model through dynamic quantum phase transitions
Authors: Mingtao Xu, Wei Yi, De-Huan Cai
Abstract: In quantum dynamics, the Loschmidt amplitude is analogous to the partition function in the canonical ensemble. Zeros in the partition function indicate a phase transition, while the presence of zeros in the Loschmidt amplitude indicates a dynamical quantum phase transition. Based on the classical-quantum correspondence, we demonstrate that the partition function of a classical Ising model is equivalent to the Loschmidt amplitude in non-Hermitian dynamics, thereby mapping an Ising model with variable system size to the non-Hermitian dynamics. It follows that the Yang-Lee zeros and the Yang-Lee edge singularity of the classical Ising model correspond to the critical times of the dynamic quantum phase transitions and the exceptional point of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, respectively. Our work reveals an inner connection between Yang-Lee zeros and non-Hermitian dynamics, offering a dynamic characterization of the former.

Title: Noise-based Local Learning using Stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions
Authors: Kees Koenders, Leo Schnitzpan, Fabian Kammerbauer, Sinan Shu, Gerhard Jakob, Mathis Kläui, Johan Mentink, Nasir Ahmad, Marcel van Gerven
Abstract: Brain-inspired learning in physical hardware has enormous potential to learn fast at minimal energy expenditure. One of the characteristics of biological learning systems is their ability to learn in the presence of various noise sources. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel noise-based learning approach for physical systems implementing multi-layer neural networks. Simulation results show that our approach allows for effective learning whose performance approaches that of the conventional effective yet energy-costly backpropagation algorithm. Using a spintronics hardware implementation, we demonstrate experimentally that learning can be achieved in a small network composed of physical stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions. These results provide a path towards efficient learning in general physical systems which embraces rather than mitigates the noise inherent in physical devices.

Title: Short two-qubit pulse sequences for exchange-only spin qubits in 2D layouts

Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43\% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction. Our work guides hardware and software design choices for future implementations of scalable quantum dot architectures.

Title: Learning Latent Hardening (LLH): Enhancing Deep Learning with Domain Knowledge for Material Inverse Problems
Authors: Qinyi Tian, Winston Lindqwister, Manolis Veveakis, Laura E. Dalton
Abstract: Advancements in deep learning and machine learning have improved the ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships, such as those encountered in complex material inverse problems. However, the effectiveness of these methods often depends on large datasets, which are not always available. In this study, the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge of the mechanical behavior of material microstructures is investigated to evaluate the impact on the predictive performance of the models in data-scarce scenarios. To overcome data limitations, a two-step framework, Learning Latent Hardening (LLH), is proposed. In the first step of LLH, a Deep Neural Network is employed to reconstruct full stress-strain curves from randomly selected portions of the stress-strain curves to capture the latent mechanical response of a material based on key microstructural features. In the second step of LLH, the results of the reconstructed stress-strain curves are leveraged to predict key microstructural features of porous materials. The performance of six deep learning and/or machine learning models trained with and without domain knowledge are compared: Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term Memory, and Random Forest. The results from the models with domain-specific information consistently achieved higher $R^2$ values compared to models without prior knowledge. Models without domain knowledge missed critical patterns linking stress-strain behavior to microstructural changes, whereas domain-informed models better identified essential stress-strain features predictive of microstructure. These findings highlight the importance of integrating domain-specific knowledge with deep learning to achieve accurate outcomes in materials science.

Title: Mixed-state geometric phases of coherent and squeezed spin states
Authors: Xin Wang, Jia-Chen Tang, Xu-Yang Hou, Hao Guo, Chih-Chun Chien
Abstract: Two mixed-state geometric phases, known as the Uhlmann phase and interferometric geometric phase (IGP), of spin coherent states (CSSs) and spin squeezed states (SSSs) are analyzed. While each phase follows its parallel-transport condition, we also consider the non-adiabatic IGP for arbitrary unitary evolution beyond parallel transport. For the $j=3/2$ CSS, the Uhlmann phase shows temperature-induced topological phase transitions with jumps. The IGP and non-adiabatic IGP for the $j=3/2$ CSS also exhibits temperature-induced jumps. In contrast, the Uhlmann phase of the $j=1$ one-axis SSS exhibits smooth behavior without any temperature-induced transition. Interestingly, the parallel-transport condition of the IGP of the $j=1$ one-axis SSS only admits a trivial solution at finite temperature while the non-adiabatic IGP for the $j=1$ one-axis SSS has a solution showing smooth behavior as the squeezing parameter and temperature change. By considering $j=1$ two-axis SSS, the IGP and its non-adiabatic generalization exhibit smooth behavior at finite temperatures. We also briefly discuss possible experimental implications and simulations.

Title: Making Truncated Wigner for dissipative spins 'plain easy'
Authors: Hossein Hosseinabadi, Oksana Chelpanova, Jamir Marino
Abstract: We put forward a user-friendly framework of the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for dissipative quantum many-body systems. Our approach is computationally affordable and it features a straightforward implementation. The leverage of the method can be ultimately traced to an intimate connection between the TWA and the semi-classical limit of the quantum Langevin equation, which we unveil by resorting to a path integral representation of the Lindbladian. Our approach allows us to explore dynamics from early to late times in a variety of models at the core of modern AMO research, including lasing, central spin models, driven arrays of Rydbergs and correlated emission in free space. Notably, our TWA approach outperforms the cumulant expansion method in certain models and performs comparably well in others, all while offering significantly lower computational costs and a much simpler formulation of the dynamical equations. We therefore argue that TWA could become in the near future a primary tool for a fast and efficient first exploration of driven-dissipative many-body dynamics on consumer grade computers.

Title: How to build transfer matrices, one wave at a time
Authors: Joaquin Garcia-Suarez
Abstract: We show how to build the closed-form expression of transfer matrices for wave propagation in layered media. The key is to represent the propagation across the piece-wise constant medium as a superposition of a finite number of paths ($2^{N-1}$ paths for a medium with $N$ layers), each one of them contributing a certain phase change (corresponding to signed sums of the phase change in each individual layer) and amplitude change (corresponding to the pattern of transmission and/or reflection associated to each path). The outlined technique is combinatorial in nature: it begins with the linear governing equations in frequency domain, whose fundamental solution is known, then it enumerates the finite number of paths across the overall system, then computes their associated phase and amplitude change, and finally adds all the possible paths to find the final result. Beyond providing physical insight, this ''path-by-path'' construction can also circumvent the need for transfer matrix numerical multiplication in many practical applications, potentially enabling substantial computational savings.

Title: Breakdown of Bulk-Radiation Correspondence in Radiative Photonic Lattices
Authors: Xinyi Yuan, Loïc Malgrey, Helgi Sigurðsson, Hai Son Nguyen, Grazia Salerno
Abstract: The topological characteristics of energy bands in crystalline systems are encapsulated in the Berry curvature of the bulk Bloch states. In photonic crystal slabs, far-field emission from guided resonances naturally provides a non-invasive way to probe the embedded wavefunctions, raising the question of how the information carried by escaping photons relates to the band topology. We develop a non-Hermitian model to describe the guided and leaky modes of photonic crystal slabs with long-range couplings and non-local responses. Within this framework, radiation Berry curvature is defined from the far-field polarization and compared to the conventional bulk Berry curvature of the crystal Bloch modes. We investigate this bulk-radiation correspondence in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point of the square lattice and the $K$-point of the honeycomb lattice. The results show that the comparability between the bulk topology and the radiation topology is not universal; the validity is contingent upon the specific bulk Bloch states. Notably, the correspondence completely breaks down surrounding the far-field singularities, while it can hold in smooth regions under special symmetry conditions, e.g., rotational symmetry. Besides, net Berry curvature concentration is captured at the valleys of the non-local honeycomb lattice, facilitating further exploration on generalized topological phases in photonic lattices beyond the regimes with localized couplings and Hermiticity.

Title: Effective Method for Inverse Ising Problem under Missing Observations in Restricted Boltzmann Machines
Authors: Kaiji Sekimoto, Muneki Yasuda
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are energy-based models analogous to the Ising model and are widely applied in statistical machine learning. The standard inverse Ising problem with a complete dataset requires computing both data and model expectations and is computationally challenging because model expectations have a combinatorial explosion. Furthermore, in many applications, the available datasets are partially incomplete, making it difficult to compute even data expectations. In this study, we propose a approximation framework for these expectations in the practical inverse Ising problems that integrates mean-field approximation or persistent contrastive divergence to generate refined initial points and spatial Monte Carlo integration to enhance estimator accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed method effectively and accurately tunes the model parameters in comparison to the conventional method.
