Title: A Universal Chern Model on Arbitrary Triangulations
Authors: Nigel Higson, Emil Prodan
Abstract: Given a triangulation of a closed orientable surface, we consider the lattice with sites at the vertices, edges and facets of the triangulation. Borrowing from mathematics literature, we introduce on this lattice a pair of tight-binding Hamiltonians derived from the boundary and Poincaré duality maps of finite simplicial manifolds. These Hamiltonians have been proved to have clean topological spectral gaps carrying non-trivial Chern numbers in the limit of infinite refinement of the triangulation. We confirm this via numerical simulations, and demonstrate how these models enable topological edge modes at the surfaces of real-world objects. Furthermore, we describe a metamaterial whose dynamics reproduces that of the proposed model, thus bringing the topological metamaterials closer to real-world applications.

Title: Fluxoid solitons in superconducting tapered tubes and bottlenecks
Authors: Tim Kokkeler, Mateo Uldemolins, Francisco Lobo, F. Sebastian Bergeret, Elsa Prada, Pablo San-Jose
Abstract: A thin-walled tubular superconductor develops a quantized fluxoid in the presence of an axial magnetic field. The fluxoid corresponds to the number of phase windings of the superconducting order parameter and is topological in nature. When the tube has a radius variation along the axial direction, forming a bottleneck structure between sections with different radius, a fluxoid mismatch can appear depending on the applied magnetic field. The bottleneck then becomes a topological boundary and is host to topologically protected solutions for the order parameter, dubbed fluxoid solitons, that are free to move around bottlenecks with cylindrical symmetry. Fluxoid solitons are a new type of vortex with non-quantized flux, loosely related to Pearl vortices in thin superconducting films and fluxons in Corbino Josephson junctions. We characterize their properties as a function of system parameters using the self-consistent quasiclassical theory of diffusive superconductors. We consider both short bottleneck structures and long tapered tubes, where multiple trapped fluxoid solitons adopt elaborate arrangements dictated by their mutual repulsion.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories: fermionic gauging, transmutation, and Kramers-Wannier dualities
Authors: Lei Su
Abstract: We generalize the gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries by inserting Majorana fermions, establishing parallel duality correspondences for bosonic and fermionic lattice systems. Using this fermionic gauging, we construct fermionic analogs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories dual to the transverse-field Ising model, interpretable as Majorana stabilizer codes. We demonstrate a unitary equivalence between the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory obtained by gauging the fermion parity of a free fermionic system and the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with potentially nonlocal terms on the square lattice with toroidal geometry. This equivalence is implemented by a linear-depth local unitary circuit, connecting the bosonic and fermionic toric codes through a direction-dependent anyonic transmutation. The gauge theory obtained by gauging fermion parity is further shown to be equivalent to a folded Ising chain obtained via the Jordan--Wigner transformation. We clarify the distinction between the recently proposed Kramers--Wannier dualities and those obtained by gauging the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry along a space-covering path. Our results extend naturally to higher-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, providing a unified framework for bosonic and fermionic dualities and offering new insights for quantum computation and simulation.

Title: The generic Mott transition in the sine-Gordon model through an embedded worm algorithm
Authors: Oscar Bouverot-Dupuis, Laura Foini, Alberto Rosso
Abstract: The generic Mott transition in one-dimensional quantum systems can be described by the sine-Gordon model with a tilt via bosonization. Because the configuration space of the sine-Gordon model separates into distinct topological sectors, standard local Monte Carlo schemes are limited to very small system sizes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the smooth worm (SmoWo) Monte Carlo algorithm which enlarges the configuration space to allow smooth transitions between topological sectors. The method combines worm updates with event-chain Monte Carlo moves. We explicitly prove its validity and quantify its performance. Thanks to the substantial acceleration achieved by the SmoWo algorithm, we are able to simulate large system sizes, providing a precise picture of the different phases and critical behaviour of the sine-Gordon model.

Title: Tensor-Network study of Ising model on infinite hyperbolic dodecahedral lattice
Authors: Matej Mosko, Andrej Gendiar
Abstract: We propose a tensor-network-based algorithm to study the classical Ising model on an infinitely large hyperbolic lattice with a regular 3D tesselation of identical dodecahedra. We reformulate the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) algorithm from 2D to 3D to reproduce the known results on the cubic lattice. Consequently, we generalize the CTMRG to the hyperbolic dodecahedral lattice, which is an infinite-dimensional lattice. We analyze the spontaneous magnetization, von Neumann entropy, and correlation length to find a continuous non-critical phase transition on the dodecahedral lattice. The phase transition temperature is estimated to be $T_{\rm pt} \approx 4.66$. We find the magnetic critical exponents $\beta= 0.4999$ and $\delta=3.007$ that confirm the mean-field universality class in accord with predictions of Monte Carlo and high-temperature series expansions. The algorithm can be applied to arbitrary multi-state spin models.

Title: Floating zone growth of high-purity MgO substrate single crystals
Authors: Christo Guguschev, Michael Schulze, Andrea Dittmar, Detlef Klimm, Kaspars Dadzis, Thomas Schroeder, Knut Peters, Aakash Pushp
Abstract: MgO single crystals with diameters between 3.5 and 5 mm and lengths up to 40 mm were grown by the optical floating zone technique (OFZ). Despite challenging material properties such as the high melting point of 2825 °C, very high evaporation rate and perfect {100} cleaving characteristics, crack-free crystals were grown at high growth rates exceeding 40 mm/h and at high thermal gradients. Chemical investigations revealed that the OFZ technique is suitable for the preparation of substrate crystals with a purity of 5N to facilitate the development of novel demonstrator devices based on epitaxially grown thin films. The achieved purity level is improved by more than one order of magnitude if compared to commercial MgO substrate single crystals graded as high purity.

Title: Landau Polarons as Generators of Quantum-Coherent States
Authors: Arnab Ghosh, Patrick Brosseau, Dmitry N. Dirin, Rui Tao, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Patanjali Kambhampati
Abstract: Since Landau's theory, polarons have been understood as quasiparticles in which charges are dressed by the lattice field, yet decades of transport and spectroscopic studies have yielded only static indirect renormalizations. Whether such dressing can dynamically reorganize electronic spectra to generate new quantum-coherent states has remained unresolved. Here we use femtosecond coherent multidimensional spectroscopy on size and composition controlled perovskite quantum dots to track polaronic field-induced dynamics in real time, revealing their consequences. We observe a delayed condensation into a confined spectrum of coherent states on 50-150 fs timescales, with couplings between these states evolving dynamically on the same timescale. The splittings are robust, exhibit anomalous linear size dependence, exceed single-particle splittings and manifest at 300 K. A Raman-constrained spin-boson Hamiltonian captures both the anomalous scaling and dynamical onset, establishing polarons as generators of coherent manifolds that enable collective quantum phenomena including superradiance, superfluorescence and superabsorption.

Title: Elastic moduli of blue phases of cholesteric liquid crystals with low chirality
Authors: V.A.Chizhikov, V.E.Dmitrienko
Abstract: A new theoretical approach has been developed to describe the elastic properties of cubic blue phases of cholesteric liquid crystals (LCs). Blue phases are three-dimensional periodic chiral liquids with local anisotropy of the average orientation of molecules, and due to their periodicity, they have lattice elastic moduli characteristic of ordinary crystalline solids. The rigid tensor approximation, which works well at low chirality parameter ($\kappa\ll1$), was used to calculate the elastic moduli of the experimentally observed blue phases $O^8$ (BPI) and $O^2$ (BPII). It is shown that in the one-constant approximation for Frank moduli of LCs ($K_{11}=K_{22}=K_{33}$), the cubic lattice of blue phases has isotropic elasticity, and the Lamé's first parameter $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and Poisson's ratio $\nu$ are equal to zero. It is found that the sign of the Poisson's ratio is determined by the ratio of elastic moduli $K_0/K_1$; in particular, when $K_0>K_1$, the Poisson's ratio is negative.

Title: Photoinduced Metal-to-Insulator Transitions in 2D Moiré Devices

Abstract: Photoexcitation has been utilized to control quantum matter and to uncover metastable phases far from equilibrium. Among demonstrations to date, the most common is the photo-induced transition from correlated insulators to metallic states; however, the reverse process without initial orders has not been observed. Here, we show ultrafast metal-to-insulator transition in gate-doped WS2/WSe2 and WSe2/WSe2 moiré devices using photo-thermionic hole injection from graphite gates. The resulting correlated insulators are metastable, with lifetimes exceeding microseconds. These findings establish an effective mechanism for the ultrafast control of correlated electronic phases in van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Ultrafast Charge-Doping via Photo-Thermionic Injection in van der Waals Devices

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials have become a rich playground for the exploration of correlated quantum phases, and recent studies have begun to probe their non-equilibrium dynamics under femtosecond laser excitation. In a time-resolved experiment, optical excitation of the multilayer structure can lead not only to rich dynamic responses from the target layers, such as moiré interfaces, but also to additional device functionality from the layer degree of freedom. Here, we investigate optical excitation in a prototypical moiré device of dual-gated twisted WSe2 bilayers, with few-layer graphite gates and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spacers. We establish an ultrafast photodoping mechanism in the moiré bilayer from photo-thermionic emission of the graphite gates. Using transient reflectance experiments, we reveal photo-induced hole injection evidenced by: (i) a shift of gate voltages at which optical signatures of correlated insulators are observed, (ii) a persistent optical signature indicative of charge diffusion at microsecond timescales and local charge buildup from pulse-to-pulse accumulation, and (iii) photoinduced absorption due likely to transient formation of correlated insulators. We further demonstrate that the injected holes can be selectively controlled by tuning the excitation energy, fluence, and gate bias.

Title: Characterizing Neon Thin Film Growth with an NbTiN Superconducting Resonator Array
Authors: Kyle Matkovic, Patrick Russell, Andrew Palmer, Eric Helgamo, Lukas Delventhal, Kun Zuo, Kundan Surse, Rajib Rahman, Maja C. Cassidy
Abstract: Electrons levitating above the surface of solid neon have recently emerged as a promising platform for high-quality qubits. The morphology and uniformity of the neon growth in these systems is crucial for qubit performance in a scalable architecture. Here we report on the controlled growth and characterization of thin solid neon films using multiplexed superconducting microwave resonators. By monitoring changes in the resonant frequency and internal quality factor ($Q_i$) of an array of frequency multiplexed quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators, we quantify the spatial uniformity of the film. A pulsed gas deposition protocol near the neon triple point results in repeatable film formation, generating measurable shifts in frequency and variations in $Q_i$ across the resonator array. Notably, introducing a post-deposition anneal at 12 K for one hour improves the film homogeneity, as shown by the reduced resonator-to-resonator variance in frequency and $Q_i$, consistent with enhanced wetting. These results demonstrate resonator-based metrology as an in-situ tool for characterising neon film growth, directly supporting the development of electron on inert quantum solid qubit platforms.

Title: Chocolate suspensions as a model for jamming and nonlinear rheology
Authors: Michel Orsi, Veeraj Shah, Mahesh Padmanabhan, Thomas Curwen, Jeffrey F. Morris
Abstract: We investigate the rheology of dark chocolate pastes in both industrially relevant pre-refined form and simplified model systems. Steady and oscillatory shear experiments reveal yielding, pronounced shear-thinning, and stress-dependent hysteresis governed by solid loading. Fitting the viscosity data with the Maron-Pierce model provides stress-dependent maximum flowable fractions $\phi_{\rm{m}}(\sigma)$, defining yield loci in the $(\phi, \sigma)$ plane. Their variation with stress quantifies the coupled roles of friction and adhesion in setting flow limits. Large-amplitude oscillatory shear tests characterize transitions from elastic to viscous behavior and identify distinct recovery pathways near jamming. Contact-stress decomposition separates hydrodynamic and frictional contributions, confirming that adhesive contact networks dominate stress transmission in pre-refined pastes. These results establish chocolate pastes as dense, adhesive suspensions whose flow is controlled by the interplay of friction and adhesion, offering quantitative benchmarks for constitutive modeling and linking chocolate processing to the broader physics of constraint rheology.

Title: The spinterface mechanism for the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect: A Critical Perspective
Authors: Subhajit Sarkar, Amos Sharoni, Oliver L. A. Monti, Yonatan Dubi
Abstract: The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, whereby chiral molecules preferentially transmit electrons of one spin orientation, remains one of the most intriguing and debated phenomena at the interface of spintronics, molecular electronics, and quantum materials. Despite extensive experimental observations across diverse platforms - including transport junctions, photoemission, and enantioselective chemistry - a comprehensive theoretical framework is still lacking. In this perspective, we critically examine the spinterface mechanism as a unifying explanation for the CISS effect. The spinterface model, which hypothesizes a feedback interaction between electron motion in chiral molecules and fluctuating surface magnetic moments, is shown to quantitatively reproduce experimental data across various systems and conditions. We contrast it with some existing theoretical models, highlighting key experimental features. Importantly, we also address open questions and criticisms of this model, including the nature of surface magnetism, the role of dissipation, and the applicability of the mechanism to non-helical or electrode-free systems. By offering falsifiable predictions and reconciling theory with experimental raw data, this work aims to sharpen the dialogue surrounding the microscopic origin of CISS and stimulate further experimental and theoretical progress.

Title: The geometry and dynamics of annealed optimization in the coherent Ising machine with hidden and planted solutions
Authors: Federico Ghimenti, Adithya Sriram, Atsushi Yamamura, Hideo Mabuchi, Surya Ganguli
Abstract: The coherent Ising machine (CIM) is a nonconventional hardware architecture for finding approximate solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization this http URL operates by annealing a laser gain parameter to adiabatically deform a high-dimensional energy landscape over a set of soft spins, going from a simple convex landscape to the more complex optimization landscape of interest. We address how the evolving energy landscapes guides the optimization dynamics against problems with hidden planted solutions. We study the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass with ferromagnetic couplings that favor a hidden configuration by combining the replica method, random matrix theory, the Kac-Rice method and dynamical mean field theory. We characterize energy, number, location, and Hessian eigenspectra of global minima, local minima, and critical points as the landscape evolves. We find that low energy global minima develop soft-modes which the optimization dynamics can exploit to descend the energy landscape. Even when these global minima are aligned to the hidden configuration, there can be exponentially many higher energy local minima that are all unaligned with the hidden solution. Nevertheless, the annealed optimization dynamics can evade this cloud of unaligned high energy local minima and descend near to aligned lower energy global minima. Eventually, as the landscape is further annealed, these global minima become rigid, terminating any further optimization gains from annealing. We further consider a second optimization problem, the Wishart planted ensemble, which contains a hidden planted solution in a landscape with tunable ruggedness. We describe CIM phase transitions between recoverability and non-recoverability of the hidden solution. Overall, we find intriguing relations between high-dimensional geometry and dynamics in analog machines for combinatorial optimization.

Title: Multistability of interstitial magnesium and its carrier recombined migration in gallium nitride
Authors: Yuansheng Zhao, Kenji Shiraishi, Tetsuo Narita, Atsushi Oshiyama
Abstract: We present density-functional-theory calculations which provide a microscopic picture of the recombination-enhanced migration of interstitial Mg in GaN. We determine stable structures and migration pathways with accurate HSE approximation to the exchange-correlation energy, and also computed recombination rates using the obtained energy spectrum and wavefunctions. It is found that the migration between the most stable octahedral sites (Mg$_{\textrm{O}}$) via newly found interstitial complex structure shows the lowest migration energy in which one or two electrons are captured during the migration, that the most stable charge state of 2+ changes to 1+ or neutral, and that by this recombination of carriers the migration barrier is significantly reduced. Starting from Mg$_{\textrm{O}}^{2+}$, Mg captures an electron becoming the 1+ charge state and overcomes the barrier of 1.65 eV, much reduced from 2.23 eV in case of the migration with the 2+ charge state kept. Moreover, further electron capture is realized accompanied by substantial structural relaxation, thus Mg becoming neutral. Detailed HSE calculations for this second capture show that the migration barrier is 1.55 eV, thus clarifying the important role of the carrier recombination for Mg migration in GaN. These findings are corroborated by the present quantitative calculations of recombination rates based on electronic Hamiltonian constructed from our DFT-obtained energy spectrum. The timescale of the recombination is clarified to be in or under the timescale of the migration with typical electron density and the enhancement is expected to be significant.

Title: Paramagnetic electron-nuclear spin entanglement in HoCo2Zn20
Authors: Takafumi Kitazawa, Yasuyuki Shimura, Takahiro Onimaru, Shun Tsuchida, Katsunori Kubo, Yoshinori Haga, Hironori Sakai, Yoshifumi Tokiwa, Shinsaku Kambe, Yo Tokunaga
Abstract: We investigated electron-nuclear spin entanglement in the paramagnetic ground state of the Ho-based cubic compound HoCo2Zn20. From analyses of magnetization and specific heat data, we determined the cubic crystalline electric field (CEF) parameters, the magnetic exchange constant, and the hyperfine coupling constant between the 4f magnetic moment and the 165Ho nuclear spin. Our results show that the Gamma5 CEF ground state is split by the hyperfine coupling, with an energy width of 1.3 K at 0 T, and that the true paramagnetic ground state is a quasi-sextet arising primarily from entanglement between the f-electron effective spin S = 1 and the 165Ho nuclear spin I = 7/2. We further demonstrate that, depending on the CEF parameters, the paramagnetic ground state can switch to an electron-nuclear coupled dectet. These findings underscore the importance of accurately identifying the electron-nuclear level scheme for understanding the low-temperature properties of rare-earth compounds containing spin-active nuclei.

Title: One-dimensional moiré engineering in zigzag graphene nanoribbons on hBN
Authors: Ryosuke Okumura, Naoto Nakatsuji, Takuto Kawakami, Mikito Koshino
Abstract: We study the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a one-dimensional (1D) moiré system composed of a zigzag graphene nanoribbon (GNR) placed on a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Using an effective grid model derived from continuum elasticity theory, we calculate the relaxed atomic structure of the GNR/hBN system for various twist angles and ribbon widths. The relaxation gives rise to a characteristic 1D domain structure consisting of alternating commensurate AB$'$ regions and two distinct types of domain boundaries. At finite twist angles, the ribbon adopts a wavy shape, locally tracing the hBN zigzag direction but occasionally sliding to adjacent atomic rows. The resulting moiré potential strongly modulates the electronic structure: the zero-energy zigzag edge states are modulated by the local stacking, leading to densely packed subbands in the AB$'$ domains and sharply localized domain-wall states in the energy gaps between domain plateaus, which together realize gate-tunable one-dimensional arrays of quantum-confined electronic states. Our results demonstrate that moiré modulation in GNR/hBN heterostructures provides a versatile platform for electronic structure engineering and the design of 1D moiré nanodevices.

Title: Versatile tunable optical injection of chiral polarized Weyl fermions in a magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2
Authors: Zipu Fan, Junchao Ma, Jinying Yang, Yan Sun, Zhuocheng Lu, Shuxia Chen, Delang Liang, Dehong Yang, Chang Xu, Qinsheng Wang, Anlian Pan, Ji Feng, Enke Liu, JinLuo Cheng, Dong Sun
Abstract: Precise probe and control of various quantum degrees of freedom in novel quantum matter are central to understanding fundamental quantum physics and hold promise for innovative routes to encode and process information. Chirality is one such degree of freedom that has recently attracted intense research interest, especially for Weyl fermions in topological Weyl semimetals. The coupling of chiral degrees of freedom through light-matter interactions and the versatile control of these couplings through external fields can lead to precise quantum control of Weyl fermions. In this work, we demonstrate the observation of light chirality-dependent photocurrent in the mid-infrared regime. Excitation wavelength-dependent measurements reveal that the photocurrent originates from the injection of chiral polarized Weyl fermions by chiral polarized mid-infrared photons. The optical process that generates unbalanced chiral polarized Weyl fermions is determined to be a third-order nonlinear photocurrent process. Compared with nonmagnetic Weyl semimetals, such coupling is versatilely tunable in magnetic Weyl semimetals with the magnetization direction and external electric field in addition to the chirality of light. Our results are not only directly applicable to tunable circular-polarization-sensitive photodetection in the mid-infrared regime, but also pave the way toward functional quantum devices that utilize the chiral quantum degrees of freedom of Weyl fermions.

Title: Unveiling the BEC-droplet transition with Rayleigh superradiant scattering
Authors: Mithilesh K. Parit, Mingchen Huang, Ziting Chen, Yifei He, Haoting Zhen, Gyu-Boong Jo
Abstract: Light scattering plays an essential role in uncovering the properties of quantum states through light-matter interactions. Here, we explore the transition from Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to droplets in a dipolar $^{166}$Er gas by employing superradiant light scattering as both a probing and controlling tool. We observe that the efficiency of superradiant scattering exhibits a non-monotonic behavior akin to the rate of sample expansion during the transition, signaling its sensitivity to the initial quantum state, and in turn, revealing the BEC-droplet transition. Through controlled atom depletion via superradiance, we analyze the sample's expansion dynamics and aspect ratio to identify the BEC-droplet phases distinctly, supported by Gaussian variational ansatz calculations. Finally, using these two approaches, we track how the BEC-droplet transition points shift under varying magnetic field orientations. Our work opens new avenues for studying quantum states through superradiance, advancing our understanding of both the BEC-droplet crossover and its coherence properties.

Title: Temperature-Dependent Spectroscopy of Cr3+:YGG Nanophosphors with Multisite Emission
Authors: Mykhailo Chaika
Abstract: An important feature of Cr3+ is the ability to tune the absorption and emission spectra by changing the host. However, in some cases, different emission spectra can be detected in samples with similar Racah parameters. The present paper reports changes in the luminescence properties of Cr3+:YGG nanocrystals. Cr3+:YGG nanocrystals were synthesized by a modified Pechini method to obtain nanocrystals containing two fractions of Cr3+:YGG nanocrystals with different lattice parameters and crystalline sizes. The increase in the concentration of Cr3+ ions leads to a redshift of the 4T2g emission from 750 nm to 850 nm for luminescence spectra measured at 80K. In contrast, room temperature luminescence spectra showed similarity in the shape of the emission spectra. The calculated crystal field strength was found to increase with the concentration of Cr3+ ions, so the detected patterns in low-temperature luminescence spectra were explained by energy transfer chain processes.

Title: Optimal spin-charge interconversion in graphene through spin-pseudospin entanglement control
Authors: Joaquín Medina Dueñas, Santiago Giménez de Castro, Jose H. Garcia, Stephan Roche
Abstract: The electrical generation of spin signals is of central interest for spintronics, where graphene stands as a relevant platform as its spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is tuned by proximity effects. Here, we propose an enhancement of spin-charge interconversion in graphene by controlling the intraparticle entanglement between the spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that, although the spin alone is not conserved in Rashba-Dirac systems, a combined spin-pseudospin operator is conserved. This conserved quantity represents the interconversion between pure spin and pseudospin textures to a spin-pseudospin entangled structure, where Kane-Mele SOC tunes this balance. By these means, we achieve spin-charge interconversion of 100\% efficiency via the Rashba-Edelstein effect. Quantum transport simulations in disordered micron-size systems demonstrate the robustness of this effect, and also reveal a disorder resilient spin Hall effect generated by the interplay between Rashba and Kane-Mele SOC. Our findings propose a platform for maximally efficient spin-charge interconversion, and establish spin-pseudospin correlations as a mechanism to tailor spintronic devices.

Title: Toward more performant eye safe lasers: effect of increasing sensitizer amount in Yb3+,Er3+:YAG transparent ceramic on its spectral characteristics
Authors: Agnieszka Szysiak, Robert Tomala, Helena Węglarz, Juraj Kajan, Mirosław Słobodzian, Mykhailo Chaika
Abstract: Developing efficient Er3+,Yb3+:YAG eye-safe lasers is a priority of modern laser technology. This paper focuses on the influence of the concentration of Yb3+ ions on the spectroscopic properties of Er3+,Yb3+:YAG transparent ceramics. Four samples with different concentrations of Yb3+ ions were prepared by solid-state reaction sintering. The study revealed the influence of Yb3+ ions on the microstructure and the sintering process. A high concentration of Yb3+ ions leads to the formation of Y3+-rich impurity phases and causes segregation of Er3+ and Yb3+ and Si4+ into these phases. The influence of Yb3+ ions on the shape of emission spectra and the lifetimes of both Er3+ and Yb3+ ions was shown. Changes in the spectroscopic properties were ascribed to increase in neat transfer between Yb3+ and Er3+ ions. IQE of Er3+ and Yb3+ luminescence were calculated, and optimal Er3+/Yb3+ ions ratio were proposed

Title: Tracer Diffusion in Granular Suspensions: Testing the Enskog Kinetic Theory with DSMC and Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Antonio M. Puertas, Rubén Gómez González
Abstract: We investigate the diffusion of an intruder in a granular gas, with both components modeled as smooth hard spheres, both immersed in a low viscosity carrier fluid to form a particle-laden suspension. In this system, dissipative particle collisions coexist with the action of a solvent. The latter is modeled via a viscous drag force and a stochastic Langevin-like force proportional to the background fluid temperature. Building on previous kinetic theory and random-walk results of the tracer diffusion coefficient [R. Gómez González, E. Abad, S. Bravo Yuste, and V. Garzó, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{108}, 024903 (2023)], where random-walk predictions were compared with Chapman--Enskog results up to the second Sonine approximation, we assess the robustness of the Enskog framework by incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, using direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results as an intermediate reference. In particular, we focus on the intruder velocity autocorrelation function, considering intruders different masses (from 0.01 to 100 times the mass of the granular particles), and analyse the behavior of the intruder temperature and diffusion coefficient. Our results clarify the influence of the friction parameter and the conditions under which Enskog kinetic theory reliably describes intruder diffusion in granular suspensions.

Authors: Yu.N. Chiang (Tszyan), M.O. Dzyuba
Abstract: The relativistic Rashba contribution to the spin-Hall effect in external electric and magnetic fields in Al and Pt was investigated. Schemes of edge accumulation of spins are proposed that take into account the flip of spins when they do not coincide with the direction of the magnetic field. Based on the obtained experimental data on the spin-Hall effect, an assessment of the spin-orbit interaction in the studied paramagnets was made.

Title: Tensor Renormalization-Group study of the surface critical behavior of a frustrated two-layer Ising model
Authors: Christophe Chatelain (LPCT)
Abstract: Two replicas of a 2D Ising model are coupled by frustrated spin-spin interactions. It is known that this inter-layer coupling is marginal and that the bulk critical behavior belongs to the Ashkin-Teller (AT) universality class, as the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model. In this work, the surface critical behavior is studied numerically by Tensor Renormalization-Group calculations. The Bond-Weight Tensor Renormalization Group algorithm is extended to tackle systems with boundaries. It is observed that the two-fold degeneracy of the surface magnetic scaling dimension of the AT model is lifted in the frustrated two-layer Ising model (F2LIM). The splitting is explained by the breaking of the ${\mathbb Z}_2$-symmetry under spin reversal of a single Ising replica in the F2LIM. The two distinct surface magnetic scaling dimensions $x_1^s$ and $x_2^s$ of the F2LIM satisfies a simple duality relation $x_1^s=1/4x_2^s$.

Title: Altermagnetism in an interacting model of Kagome materials
Authors: Alejandro Blanco Peces, Jaime Merino
Abstract: The Hubbard model on the Kagome lattice is a widely used interacting model for describing the electronic properties of various transition metal-based Kagome materials. We find altermagnetism driven by Coulomb interaction in the Kagome Hubbard model at Dirac filling with no spin-orbit coupling nor explicit spatial symmetry breaking present. We show how this insulating altermagnet is relevant to other lattices with larger unit cells such as the Lieb-Kagome lattice. The ALM found displays a characteristic magnon splitting which can be detected in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on interacting Kagome materials.

Abstract: Ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers host maze-like stripe domains that transform into a disordered bubble/skyrmion lattice under out-of-plane magnetic fields at ambient temperature. Femtosecond magneto-optics distinguishes these textures via their distinct coherent breathing dynamics. Crucially, applying a brief in-plane ``set'' magnetic field to the stripe state enhances both frequency and amplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, and micromagnetic simulations reveal that this enhancement arises from field-aligned stripes nucleating a dense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice upon out-of-plane field application, with strong indications for a pure skyrmion lattice. Thus, modifying the initial domain configuration by in-plane fields enables precise control of coherent magnetization dynamics on picosecond to nanosecond timescales and potentially even of topology.

Title: Faradaic and capacitive charging of an electrolyte-filled pore in response to a small applied potential
Authors: Timur Aslyamov, Massimiliano Esposito, Mathijs Janssen
Abstract: Electrochemical devices often charge both through Faradaic reactions and electric double layer formation. Here, we study these coupled processes in a model system of a long electrolyte-filled pore subject to a small suddenly-applied potential, close to the equilibrium potential $\Psi^\text{eq}$ at which there is no net Faradaic charge transfer. Specifically, we solve the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Frumkin-Butler-Volmer equations by asymptotic approximations, using the pore's small inverse aspect ratio as the small parameter. In the early-time limit, the reaction-diffusion equations yield an extended Faradaic transmission line model that includes a voltage source, $\Psi_\text{eq}$, biasing the Faradaic reactions, captured by the resistance $R_F$. In the long-time limit, the model exhibits a nontrivial potential of zero charge, $\Psi_\text{pzc} = \Psi_\text{eq}[1 - \hat{Z}(0)/R_F]$, where $\hat{Z}(0)$ is the experimentally accessible zero-frequency impedance of the system. This expression provides a new means to experimentally measure the Faradaic contribution to $\Psi_\text{pzc}$.

Title: High Pressure Superconducting transition in Dihydride BiH$_2$ with Bismuth Open-Channel Framework
Authors: Liang Ma, Xin Yang, Mei Li, Pengfei Shan, Ziyi Liu, Jun Hou, Sheng Jiang, Lili Zhang, Chuanlong Lin, Pengtao Yang, Bosen Wang, Jianping Sun, Yang Ding, Huiyang Gou, Haizhong Guo, Jinguang Cheng
Abstract: Metal hydrides MHx with low hydrogen content are not expected to show high-Tc superconductivity owing to the low hydrogen-derived electronic density of states at Fermi level and the limited hydrogen contribution to electron-phonon coupling strength. In this work, we report on the successful synthesis of a novel bismuth dihydride superconductor, Cmcm-BiH$_2$, at approximately 150 GPa, and the discovery of superconductivity with Tc about 62 K at 163 GPa, marking the first instance of superconductor among the MH$_2$-type metal dihydrides. Cmcm-BiH$_2$ adopts a unique host-guest type structure, in which the Bi atoms via weak Bi-Bi covalent bonds form a three-dimensional open-channel framework that encapsulates H$_2$-like molecules as guests, thereby broadening the structural diversity of hydrides under high pressures. The occurrence of superconductivity is evidenced by a sharp drop of resistivity to zero and the characteristic downward shift of Tc under applied magnetic fields. Notably, Cmcm-BiH$_2$ remains stable down to at least 97 GPa during decompression, with the calculated lowest pressure for dynamic stability of 10 GPa. In-depth analysis reveals that the covalent bismuth open-channel structure forms metallic conduction channels, dominates the electronic states near the Fermi level, and contributes approximately 51% of the total $lambda$ in Cmcm-BiH$_2$, distinguishing it from known high-pressure hydride superconductors. These findings highlight the critical role of non-hydrogen elements in producing superconductivity and open new avenues for the design and optimization of high-Tc hydride superconductors.

Title: Koopman Mode Decomposition of Thermodynamic Dissipation in Nonlinear Langevin Dynamics
Authors: Daiki Sekizawa, Sosuke Ito, Masafumi Oizumi
Abstract: Nonlinear oscillations are commonly observed in complex systems far from equilibrium, such as living organisms. These oscillations are essential for sustaining vital processes, like neuronal firing, circadian rhythms, and heartbeats. In such systems, thermodynamic dissipation is necessary to maintain oscillations against noise. However, due to their nonlinear dynamics, it has been challenging to determine how the characteristics of oscillations, such as frequency, amplitude, and coherent patterns across elements, influence dissipation. To resolve this issue, we employ Koopman mode decomposition, which recasts nonlinear dynamics as a linear evolution in a function space. This linearization allows the dynamics to be decomposed into temporal oscillatory modes coherent across elements, with the Koopman eigenvalues determining their frequencies. Using this method, we decompose thermodynamic dissipation caused by nonconservative forces into contributions from oscillatory modes in overdamped nonlinear Langevin dynamics. We show that the dissipation from each mode is proportional to its frequency squared and its intensity, providing an interpretable, mode-by-mode picture. In the noisy FitzHugh--Nagumo model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in quantifying the impact of oscillatory modes on dissipation during nonlinear phenomena like stochastic resonance and bifurcation. For instance, our analysis of stochastic resonance reveals that the greatest dissipation at the optimal noise intensity is supported by a broad spectrum of frequencies, whereas at non-optimal noise levels, dissipation is dominated by specific frequency modes. Our work offers a general approach to connecting oscillations to dissipation in noisy environments and improves our understanding of diverse oscillation phenomena from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective.

Title: Strain-induced structural change and nearly-commensurate diffuse scattering in the model high-temperature superconductor HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+δ}$
Authors: Mai Ye, Wenshan Hong, Tom Lacmann, Mehdi Frachet, Igor Vinograd, Gaston Garbarino, Sofia-Michaela Souliou, Michael Merz, Rolf Heid, Amir-Abbas Haghighirad, Yuan Li, Matthieu Le Tacon
Abstract: We investigate the strain response of underdoped HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ (Hg1201), by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and corresponding simulations of thermal diffuse scattering. The compression in the crystallographic $a$ direction leads to relatively small expansion in the $b$ and $c$ directions, with Poisson ratios $\nu_{ba}$=0.16 and $\nu_{ca}$=0.11, respectively. However, the Cu-O distance in the $c$ direction exhibits a notable 0.9% increase at 1.1% $a$-axis compression. We further find strain-induced diffuse scattering which corresponds to a new type of two-dimensional charge correlation. Interestingly, this signal is insensitive to the onset of superconductivity and instead corresponds to a short-range, nearly commensurate modulation with a wave vector close to (0.5, 0, 0) and a correlation length of approximately four unit cells. It closely resembles the charge order theoretically predicted in the phase diagram of the spin-liquid model with resonating valence bonds on a square lattice.

Title: Universal Thickness-Dependent Absorption in Solids at the Nanoscale
Authors: Bhumika Chauhan, Nikhil Singh, Subhrajit Dalai, Abhisek Saidarsan, Sayantan Patra, Sourabh Jain, Aparna Deshpande, Ashish Arora
Abstract: Through systematic experimental and theoretical studies of layer-thickness-dependent absorption in semiconducting MoSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ across the visible to near-infrared spectral range, we demonstrate a universal absorption behavior in solids at nanoscale thicknesses. With increasing thickness, a non-monotonic evolution of absorption integrated over the measured spectral region is revealed which is accompanied by pronounced oscillatory features. This strongly deviates from the expected Beer-Lambert law. The observed behavior has origins in the electromagnetic interference effects taking place between the two surfaces of the thin crystals. The present work on 2D semiconductors is extendable to all kinds of solids such as conventional semiconductors (e.g. Si, GaAs, GaN, InP), (semi)metals (e.g. Al, Ag, Au, c-HOPG) and 2D magnetic materials (e.g. CrSBr and NiPS$_3$). Our results provide fundamental insights into light-matter interactions in solids at the nanoscale and are vital for optimally designing the new generation of absorption-based flexible optoelectronic devices.

Title: Lossy phononic metamaterials for valley manipulation
Authors: Shunda Yin, Qiuyan Zhou, Yuxiang Xi, Weiyin Deng, Wei Chen, Jiuyang Lu, Manzhu Ke, Zhengyou Liu
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics characterized by complex band spectra has established a new paradigm in condensed matter systems and metamaterials. Recently, non-Hermitian gain and nonreciprocity are deliberately introduced to valley manipulation, leading to various phenomena beyond the Hermitian scenarios, such as the amplified topological whispering gallery modes as an acoustic laser. In contrast, pure loss is inevitable in practice and generally regarded as a detrimental factor. Here, we reveal that the coupling loss can manipulate valley degrees of freedom in a phononic metamaterial. Three distinct valley-related effects, including valley-resolved nonreciprocity that functions as a valley filter, valley-dependent skin effects where bulk states from different valleys localize at opposite boundaries, and valley-projected edge states with boundary-dependent lifetimes that leads to an anomalous beam splitting, are demonstrated through theoretical analysis and airborne sound experiments. Owing to the easy preparation of loss, our findings shed light on both non-Hermitian and valley physics and may facilitate innovative applications of valley-related devices.

Title: Suppressing excitations using quantum-Brachistochrone and nearest-neighbour interactions
Authors: S John Sharon Sandeep, Dibyajyoti Sahu, Suhas Gangadharaiah
Abstract: We examine excitation suppression in the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where finite-time drive across a quantum critical point is assisted by the presence of a time-dependent coupling parameter. While conventional counterdiabatic protocols are designed to eliminate excitations, they often require complex many-body terms that are difficult to realize experimentally. In contrast, our approach employs a local, time-dependent modulation of an existing coupling term in the Hamiltonian. Within the framework of quantum optimal control, we find that under a linear ramp of the transverse field, the optimal evolution of the second parameter follows a non-monotonic trajectory. For the TFIM, this protocol yields higher fidelity and improved robustness against noise compared to several orders of approximate counterdiabatic driving. Furthermore, we provide an analytical demonstration of anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling in the presence of noise acting on either the transverse field or the longitudinal coupling. These results highlight the potential of this approach for developing simple, noise-resilient protocols for finite-time quantum state preparation.

Title: Optimal superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ where the Van Hove singularity crosses half-filling
Authors: Michał Zegrodnik, Waseem Akbar, Andrzej Biborski, Louk Rademaker
Abstract: The recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity has pointed to twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer as a versatile platform for studying the correlated and topological phases of matter. Here we analyze the effect of the displacement field and electron interactions on the formation of a topological paired state in twisted WSe$_2$. Our approach is based on the effective single band $t$-$J$-$U$ model supplemented with intersite Coulomb interaction term and treated within the Gutzwiller approximation. We show that the superconducting phase is stabilized in a small range of displacement fields where the Van Hove singularity crosses half-filling, which is in qualitative agreement with recent experimental data. According to our analysis, such a circumstance comes as a result of a subtle interplay between the large density of states of the Van Hove singularity, in combination with the renormalization effects that appear in the weak-to-moderate correlations regime. The two factors create favorable conditions for the SC pairing only in a small area of the phase diagram.

Title: Spin filtering on demand via localized states in an atomic-scale resonant tunneling magnetic tunnel junction
Authors: Maciej Bazarnik, Anika Schlenhoff
Abstract: Spin filtering and its back-action spin transfer torque (STT) are key ingredients of latest spintronic devices based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Resonant tunneling (RT), implemented by design or occurring as parasitic effects, is known to crucially affect macroscopic device performance, but direct experimental access to its individual microscopic processes has remained difficult. Here we apply the RT scheme from MTJs to spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) for ultimate miniaturization obtained by addressing distinct sites on individual nanomagnets. Combined with energy selectivity, our experimental model set-up enables to study the spin filtering capabilities of RT through an individual spin-split vacuum resonance state and of the corresponding STT exerted on the nanomagnet. We find, that the sign and magnitude of the STT follow the effective spin-polarization of the resonance state, which, as we show, can by tailored on demand either by adjusting the applied bias or the current injection point on the nanostructure. We anticipate, that our atomic-scale RT-MTJ approach and the discovery of a versatile tunable spin-filter at smallest scale will prove invaluable for studying and designing next generation MTJs potentially based on recently discovered 2D van-der-Waals magnets or altermagnets.

Title: 2D Excitonics with Atomically Thin Lateral Heterostructures

Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$, exhibit unique optical and electronic properties. Vertical stacking of layers of one or more TMDs, to create heterostructures, has expanded the fields of moiré physics and twistronics. Bottom-up fabrication techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition, have advanced the creation of heterostructures beyond what was possible with mechanical exfoliation and stacking. These techniques now enable the fabrication of lateral heterostructures, where two or more monolayers are covalently bonded in the plane of their atoms. At their atomically sharp interfaces, lateral heterostructures exhibit additional phenomena, such as the formation of charge-transfer excitons, in which the electron and hole reside on opposite sides of the interface. Due to the energy landscape created by differences in the band structures of the constituent materials, unique effects such as unidirectional exciton transport and excitonic lensing can be observed in lateral heterostructures. This review outlines recent progress in exciton dynamics and spectroscopy of TMD-based lateral heterostructures and offers an outlook on future developments in excitonics in this promising system.

Title: An Experimental Validation of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Achieving Pulse Width-Modulated Singular Reflection Angles Without External Power Sources
Authors: Eisuke Omori, Kairi Takimoto, Atsuko Nagata, Ashif Fathnan, Shinya Sugiura, Hiroki Wakatsuchi
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a design concept that leverages pulse width variation to enable a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and to autonomously switch reflection properties between two angles without any active control system. Our RIS alters its beam pattern from a singular specular reflection to another unique singular anomalous reflection when the incoming waveform changes from a short pulse to a continuous wave, even at the same frequency. Unlike conventional RISs, our passive control mechanism eliminates the requirements of active components and precise symbol-level synchronization with the transmitting antennas, reducing the system complexity level while offering dynamic material adaptability. We numerically show that the proposed RIS design is capable of varying the received magnitude of an incident wave by a factor of ten, which is also experimentally validated for the first time. Employing binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, we further report that the communication characteristics can be varied by 7 dB or more, which indicates that the proposed design is not limited to a single frequency component as long as the bandwidth of the given signal is covered by that of the RIS design. These results may present new opportunities for exploring and deploying pulse width-dependent RISs in practical scenarios involving next-generation communication systems.

Title: Probing and modeling cell-cell communication in 2D biomimetic tissues
Authors: Cécile Marie Vincent, Sapna Ravindran, Alexis Michel Prevost, Léa-Laetitia Pontani, Olivier Bénichou, Elie Wandersman
Abstract: In tissues, cells in direct physical contact with each other can exchange ions or molecules via protein clusters called gap junctions that form channels across the membranes of adjacent cells. Here, we use a simplified biomimetic approach, coupled with theoretical modeling, to unravel the physical mechanisms controlling such transport. Tissues are mimicked with 2D hexagonal networks of monodisperse aqueous droplets connected by lipid membranes called Droplet Interface Bilayers (DIBs), decorated with $\alpha$-Hemolysin ($\alpha$HL) transmembrane proteins forming nanopores through heptamerization in the membrane. The diffusion of calcein across 2D DIB networks is thoroughly studied using epifluorescence microscopy at various $\alpha$HL concentrations. The results are successfully confronted with a Continuous Time Random Walk model in hexagonal networks, with an average waiting time increasing nonlinearly with the concentration of pore monomers.

Title: Examining the Spin Structure of Altermagnetic Candidate MnTe Grown with Near Ideal Stoichiometry

Abstract: Altermagnets are a recently-discovered class of materials with magnetic ordering that have a zero net magnetization and a momentum-dependent spin splitting in their band structure, arising from a collinear spin arrangement with alternating polarizations in the crystal lattice. The nickeline-structured manganese telluride ({\alpha}-MnTe) is an attractive altermagnet candidate due to its predicted large spin splitting energy and a transition temperature near 300K. In this work, we present a thorough investigation of the spin structure of {\alpha}-MnTe thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy with very high crystal quality and low residual magnetization. The epitaxial {\alpha}-MnTe films have a full-width-at-half-maximum of 0.1° as measured by x-ray-diffraction rocking curves and a root-mean-square roughness below 1 nm. Neutron diffraction measurements confirm the antiferromagnetic order in the {\alpha}-MnTe film and show a Néel temperature of 307 K. Polarized neutron reflectometry detects a vanishingly small net magnetization which may be confined to the MnTe/InP interface, highlighting the near-ideal stoichiometry in the sample. In vacuo angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that the bulk band spectrum of the MnTe films is consistent with the weak altermagnetic order as theoretically predicted and observed for the high symmetry nodal plane in the center of the Brillouin zone. This study establishes optimized growth conditions for the synthesis of stoichiometric {\alpha}-MnTe thin films which exhibit exceptional structural and magnetic ordering, thereby providing a robust platform for the precise characterization of their altermagnetic properties.

Title: Exciton-based sensing of remote electron correlations in 2D heterostructures
Authors: Tobias M. R. Wolf, Tian Xie, Chenhao Jin, Allan H. MacDonald
Abstract: Many monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, including MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$, are direct bandgap two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors with sharp optical resonances at excitonic bound state frequencies. Recent experiments have demonstrated that excitonic resonance frequencies in multilayer van der Waals stacks are altered by long-range Coulomb interactions with electrons in nearby but electrically isolated 2D materials. These modulations have been successfully used to detect transitions between distinct states of remote strongly correlated 2D electron fluids. In this Letter we provide a theory of these frequency shifts, enabling a more quantitative interpretation of excitonic-sensing experiments, and apply it as an example to WSe$_2$ that is proximate to graphene bilayers and multilayers.

Title: Hexagonal InOI monolayer: a 2D phase-change material combining topological insulator states and piezoelectricity
Authors: Wenhui Wan, Xinyue Liu, Yanfeng Ge, Ziqang Li, Yong Liu
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) phase-change materials (PCMs) with moderate transition barriers and distinctly contrasting properties are highly desirable for multifunctional devices, yet such systems remain scarce. Using first-principles calculations, we propose a hexagonal InOI monolayer as a promising 2D PCM. This material exhibits two distinct polymorphs: an energetically favorable T$^{\prime}$ phase and a metastable T phase, differentiated by iodine atom positions. The T$^{\prime}$-to-T structural phase transition features a moderate energy barrier $E_b$ of 72.1 meV per formula unit, facilitating reversible switching. Notably, strain engineering tailors the electronic transition, inducing either a metal-to-topological-insulator or a metal-to-normal-insulator transformation. Additionally, this phase transition modulates the piezoelectric response and shifts optical absorption from the infrared to the visible range. These multifunctional properties make 2D hexagonal InOI highly promising for applications in non-volatile memory, low-contact-resistance spintronics, and optical switching devices.

Title: Swimming patterns of a multi-mode bacterial swimmer in fluid shear flow
Authors: Valeriia Muraveva, Agniva Datta, Jeungeun Park, Veronika Pfeifer, Yongsam Kim, Wanho Lee, Sookkyung Lim, Carsten Beta
Abstract: Bacterial swimming is well characterized in uniform liquids at rest. The natural habitat of bacterial swimmers, however, is often dominated by moving fluids and interfaces, resulting in shear flows that may strongly alter bacterial navigation strategies. Here, we study how fluid shear flow affects the swimming motility of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida, a bacterial swimmer that moves in a versatile pattern composed of three different swimming modes, where the flagella may push, pull, or wrap around the cell body (multi-mode swimmer). We introduce a computer automated cell tracking and swimming mode detection tool to show that shear induced alignment depends on the swimming mode, while motility and proximity to surfaces counteract the alignment effect. Moreover, filament wrapping becomes less efficient with increasing shear stress. Numerical simulations of realistic swimmer geometries complement our experimental results, providing more detailed mechanistic insights into movement patterns of bacterial swimmers in a shear flow.

Title: Kinetic theory of emulsions with matter supply
Authors: Jacqueline Janssen, Frank Jülicher, Christoph A. Weber
Abstract: In this work, we propose a theory for the kinetics of emulsions in which a continuous supply of matter feeds droplet growth. We consider cases where growth is either limited by bulk diffusion or the transport through the droplets' interfaces. Our theory extends the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory by two types of matter supply, where either the supersaturation is maintained or the supply rate is constant. In emulsions with maintained supersaturation, we find a decoupling of droplets at all times, with the droplet size distribution narrowing in the diffusion-limited regime and a drifting distribution of a fixed shape in the interface-resistance-limited case. In emulsions with a constant matter supply, there is a transition between narrowing and broadening in the diffusion-limited regime, and the distribution is non-universal. For the interface-resistance-limited regime, there is no transition to narrowing, and we find a universal law governing coarsening kinetics that is valid for any constant matter supply. The average radius evolves according to a power law that is independent of the matter supply, and we find a closed-form expression for the droplet size distribution function. Our theory is relevant to biological systems, such as biomolecular condensates in living cells, since droplet material is not conserved and the growth of small droplets is proposed to be interface-resistance-limited.

Title: ARPES of Bi2212 interpreted via a particle in a system of dynamic scatterers
Authors: Udomsilp Pinsook
Abstract: In this work, I employ parabolic cylinder functions to quantitatively describe the ARPES spectra of an over-doped Bi2212 across the temperature range 6 - 140K at the antinode k-point. These functions come from the solutions of a particle moving in a system of random scatterers. The parameters, i.e. the overall amplitude (A), the spectral coherence scale (C), and the energy shift (EG), are determined directly by fitting to experimental data. At 140K, the dominated feature of the ARPES spectrum resembles the solution of a particle moving in a one-dimensional random system. According to the present model, the electronic states of the over-doped Bi2212 at the antinode k-point can be viewed as a realization of the theory of a particle moving in dynamic scatterers in 1D with corrections from the ground state solutions at lower temperature.

Title: Critical Exponent of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transition in One-Dimensional Bose-Hubbard Model in the Strong Interacting Limit
Authors: Jia Li, Yajiang Hao
Abstract: We analytically investigated the dynamical quantum phase transitions in the Bose-Hubbard model using the Loschmidt echo as an observable, revealing that after a quench, the global Loschmidt echo exhibits cusp singularities with a logarithmically divergent rate function near criticality and a critical exponent of zero. Through extensive calculations across various system sizes and initial states, we have demonstrated that in the strongly interacting regime, the critical singularity of dynamical quantum phase transitions exhibits consistency across different model details and initial product states (charge-density wave states). Moreover, we find that modifying the harmonic potential well not only preserves the phase transition but also enables precise control over the transition timing.

Title: Direct observation of the crystal electric-field splitting under magnetic field and uncovering field-induced magnetic phase transition in triangular rare-earth magnet CsErSe$_2$

Abstract: An indispensable step toward understanding magnetic interaction in rare-earth magnets is the determination of spatially anisotropic single-ion properties resulting from the crystal electric field (CEF) physics. The CEF Hamiltonian exhibits a discrete energy spectrum governed by a set of independent parameters that reflect the site symmetry of the magnetic ion. However, experimentally determining these parameters for magnetic ions at low-symmetry sites has been proven highly challenging. In this study, we directly measured the CEF level splitting under magnetic fields (B) using optical spectroscopy and extracted both CEF parameters and the exchange energies of a triangular insulating magnet CsErSe$_2$ as a model system. With increasing field, we find many CEF levels undergo level-crossing, which accompanies switching of the eigenstate. Particularly, such a crossing occurring at the ground state results in a step-like increase in magnetization that we captured with the low-temperature AC magnetic susceptibility measurements. Our work demonstrates that the accurately determined CEF Hamiltonian parameters enable uncovering the rich physics of field-induced collective magnetic phenomena, and potentially lead to a new route to magnetic frustration.

Title: Zeeman Spectroscopy of Vacancy-Charge-Compensated Er3+ Sites in CaWO4 under Vector Magnetic Fields
Authors: Fabian Becker, Sudip KC, Lorenz J. J. Sauerzopf, Tim Schneider, Luis Risinger, Christian Schmid, Kai Müller
Abstract: We present polarization-resolved optical absorption measurements on Er3+ ions in CaWO4 under vector magnetic fields, focusing on charge-compensated sites arising from local Ca2+ vacancies. While the known axial Er3+ site displays a single symmetric Zeeman-split transition pattern consistent with S4 symmetry, two additional sites exhibit more complex spectral behavior, including sets of transitions that interchange under 90° crystal rotations-evidence of reduced, rhombic-like symmetry. From these polarization- and temperature-dependent spectra, we extract effective g-factors. Our findings are corroborated by electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and support a model of multiple inequivalent Ca2+ vacancies around Er3+ sites in the host lattice. This detailed characterization contributes to understanding defect-engineered rare-earth sites for quantum information applications.

Title: Tailoring dispersion and evanescent modes in multimodal nonlocal lattices using positive-only interactions
Authors: Lucas Rouhi, Christophe Droz
Abstract: Metamaterials derive their unconventional properties from engineered microstructures, with periodic lattices providing a versatile framework for modeling wave propagation. Dispersion relations, obtained from Bloch-Floquet theory, govern how waves propagate, attenuate, or localize within such systems. Extending interactions beyond nearest neighbors, through nonlocality, substantially enriches the design space of band diagrams, enabling phenomena such as negative or zero group velocities, roton-like extrema, and band-gap localization. However, existing approaches to dispersion tailoring often rely on analytical formulations or Fourier-based identifications, which become impractical for complex coupling mechanisms and offer limited control over physical constraints such as stiffness positivity. This work introduces a general interpolation-based framework for customizing dispersion relations in uniform nonlocal lattices. Rather than reconstructing full dispersion curves, the method enforces prescribed frequency-wavenumber points as interpolation constraints, enabling localized and tunable control of wave behavior. The formulation is applied to both spring- and beam-interaction lattices, and demonstrated on an Euler-Bernoulli beam model with adjustable nonlocal couplings. Through systematic parameter tuning, the framework enables the creation of rotons, the adjustment of group-velocity dispersion, and the design of evanescent waves with controlled exponential decay within band gaps, all while ensuring real, positive-only stiffness parameters and passive mechanical behavior. Altogether, this parametric interpolation strategy provides a physically consistent and computationally efficient route for engineering advanced phononic functionalities in periodic nonlocal systems.

Title: Identification of 2D colloidal assemblies in images: a threshold processing method versus machine learning
Authors: L. T. Khusainova, K.S. Kolegov
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the problem of identification of colloidal assemblies using the example of two-dimensional coatings (monolayer assemblies). Colloidal systems are used in various fields of science and technology, for example, in applications for photonics and functional coatings. The physical properties depend on the morphology of the structure of the colloidal assemblies. Therefore, effective identification of particle assemblies is of interest. The following classification is considered here: isolated particles, dimers, chains and clusters. We have studied and compared two identification methods: image threshold analysis using the OpenCV library and machine learning using the YOLOv8 model as an example. The features and current results of training a neural network model on a dataset specially prepared for this work are described. A comparative characteristic of both methods is given. The best result was shown by the machine learning method (97% accuracy). The threshold processing method showed an accuracy of about 68%. The developed algorithms and software modules may be useful to scientists and engineers working in the field of materials science in the future.

Title: Beyond Poisson: First-Passage Asymptotics of Renewal Shot Noise
Authors: Julien Brémont
Abstract: The first-passage time (FPT) of a stochastic signal to a threshold is a fundamental observable across physics, biology, and finance. While renewal shot noise is a canonical model for such signals, analytical results for its FPT have remained confined to the Poisson (Markovian) case, despite the prevalence of non-Poisson arrival statistics in applications from neuronal spiking to gene expression. We break this long-standing barrier by deriving the first universal asymptotic formula for the mean FPT $\langle T_b \rangle$ to reach level $b$ for renewal shot noise with general arrival statistics and exponential marks. Our central result is a closed-form expression that reveals precisely how general inter-arrival statistics impact the naive Arrhenius law. We show that the short-time behavior of the interarrival distribution dictates universal scaling corrections, ranging from stretched-exponential to algebraic, that can dramatically accelerate threshold crossing. Furthermore, we argue and confirm numerically that the full FPT distribution becomes exponential at large thresholds, implying that $\langle T_b \rangle$ provides a complete asymptotic characterization. Our work, enabled by a novel exact solution for the moments of the noise, establishes a general framework for analyzing extreme events in non-Markovian systems with relaxation.

Title: The Piezochiral Effect
Authors: Z. Zeng, M. Först, M. Fechner, X. Deng, A. Cavalleri, P.G. Radaelli
Abstract: Chirality is a pervasive property of matter that underpins many important phenomena across physics, chemistry and biology. Given its broad significance, the development of protocols for rational control of chirality in solid state systems is highly desirable, especially if this effect can be tuned continuously and in two directions. Yet, this goal has remained elusive due to the absence of a universal conjugate field that couples linearly to this structural order. Here, we introduce the piezochiral effect, which enables control of chirality through mechanical strain. We first show by symmetry analysis that uniaxial strain induces chirality in a broad class of achiral crystals that host fragments of opposite chirality within each unit cell, an effect that has so far remained unrecognized. The strain-induced handedness can be tuned either by changing the strain direction or by switching between compressive and tensile strain. We experimentally verify this effect in AgGaS2, using measurements of the optical activity under strain. Our discovery establishes a new scheme for chirality control, with potential applications that range from spintronics to asymmetric catalysis, and enantioselective interactions in biosystems.

Title: Markov Inequality as a Tool for Linear-Scaling Estimation of Local Observables
Authors: H. P. Veiga, D. R. Pinheiro, J. P. Santos Pires, J. M. Viana Parente Lopes
Abstract: We introduce a linear-scaling stochastic method to compute real-space maps of any positive local spectral operator in a tight-binding model. By employing positive-definite estimators, the sampling error at each site can be rigorously bounded relative to the mean via the Markov inequality, overcoming the lack of self-averaging and enabling accurate estimates even under strong spatial fluctuations. The approach extends to non-diagonal observables, such as local currents, through local unitary transformations and its effectiveness is showcased by benchmark calculations in the disordered two-dimensional (2D) $\pi$-flux model, where the LDoS and steady-state current maps are computed. This method will enable simulations of disorder-driven mesoscopic phenomena in realistically large lattices and accelerate real-space self-consistent mean-field calculations.

Title: ComProScanner: A multi-agent based framework for composition-property structured data extraction from scientific literature
Authors: Aritra Roy, Enrico Grisan, John Buckeridge, Chiara Gattinoni
Abstract: Since the advent of various pre-trained large language models, extracting structured knowledge from scientific text has experienced a revolutionary change compared with traditional machine learning or natural language processing techniques. Despite these advances, accessible automated tools that allow users to construct, validate, and visualise datasets from scientific literature extraction remain scarce. We therefore developed ComProScanner, an autonomous multi-agent platform that facilitates the extraction, validation, classification, and visualisation of machine-readable chemical compositions and properties, integrated with synthesis data from journal articles for comprehensive database creation. We evaluated our framework using 100 journal articles against 10 different LLMs, including both open-source and proprietary models, to extract highly complex compositions associated with ceramic piezoelectric materials and corresponding piezoelectric strain coefficients (d33), motivated by the lack of a large dataset for such materials. DeepSeek-V3-0324 outperformed all models with a significant overall accuracy of 0.82. This framework provides a simple, user-friendly, readily-usable package for extracting highly complex experimental data buried in the literature to build machine learning or deep learning datasets.

Title: A Probability Space at Inception of Stochastic Process
Authors: Liteng Yang, Yuliang Liu, Jing Liu, Hongxuan Li, Wei Chen
Abstract: Recently, progress has been made in the theory of turbulence, which provides a framework on how a deterministic process changes to a stochastic one owing to the change in thermodynamic states. It is well known that, in the framework of Newtonian mechanics, motions are dissipative; however, when subjected to periodic motion, a system can produce nondissipative motions intermittently and subject to resonance. It is in resonance that turbulence occurs in fluid flow, solid vibration, thermal transport, etc. In this, the findings from these physical systems are analyzed in the framework of statistics with their own probability space to establish their compliance to the stochastic process. In particular, a systematic alignment of the inception of the stochastic process with the signed measure theory, signed probability space, and stochastic process was investigated. It was found that the oscillatory load from the dissipative state excited the system and resulted in a quasi-periodic probability density function with the negative probability regimes. In addition, the vectorial nature of the random velocity splits the probability density function along both the positive and negative axes with slight asymmetricity. By assuming that a deterministic process has a probability of 1, we can express the inception of a stochastic process, and the subsequent benefit is that a dynamic fractal falls on the probability density function. Moreover, we leave some questions of inconsistency between the physical system and the measurement theory for future investigation. We believe that the establishment of the probability density function of resonance nondissipative dynamics in contemporary statistics should make many mathematical tools available and the analytical formulas for the random velocity and probability density function can provide a convenient platform for the development of statistics.

Title: Philip Warren Anderson
Authors: Premala Chandra, Piers Coleman, Clare C. Yu
Abstract: Philip Warren Anderson was a pioneering theoretical physicist whose work fundamentally shaped our understanding of complex systems. Anderson received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 for his groundbreaking research on localization and magnetism, yet he did so much more. His work on magnetism included antiferromagnetism, superexchange, the Kondo problem and local magnetic moments in metals. Anderson pointed out the importance of disorder through his work on localization, non-crystalline solids and spin glasses. In superconductivity, he is known for the dirty superconductor theorem, showing the gauge-invariance of the BCS theory, his study of flux creep, and for his collaboration with experimentalists to realize the Josephson effect. Anderson's resonating valence bond theory may yet play an important role in high temperature superconductivity. Anderson was also fascinated by broken symmetry, and he laid the theoretical groundwork for what is now known as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, showing how gauge bosons can acquire mass - an insight that played a foundational role in the Standard Model of particle physics. In his seminal "More is Different" paper, Anderson argued that the collective emergent phenomena that arise in complex interacting systems cannot be deduced from their fundamental parts. Anderson's legacy endures not only through the lasting impact of his scientific work but also through his influence on generations of physicists who continue to explore the rich landscape of collective behavior in nature.

Title: Hybrid Lattice Surgery: Non-Clifford Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes
Authors: Sheng-Jie Huang, Alison Warman, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Yanzhu Chen
Abstract: In universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, implementing logical non-Clifford gates often demands substantial spacetime resources for many error-correcting codes, including the high-threshold surface code. A critical mission for realizing large-scale quantum computing is to develop simple and resource-efficient implementations of logical non-Clifford gates. We propose a novel way of implementing non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code based on hybrid lattice surgery. First we generalize the standard lattice surgery to hybrid lattice surgery, where operations of rough merge and rough split happen across different topological codes. Then we apply such procedures between Abelian and non-Abelian codes and show that this can provide non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code, in the form of a magic state or a non-Clifford gate teleportation. Complementing this, we provide a continuum topological field theory description of this hybrid lattice surgery utilizing interfaces between (2+1)d topological orders. From these considerations, we can generalize our protocol to non-Clifford gates and magic states at all finite levels of the Clifford hierarchy, as well as gates beyond the hierarchy. We also discuss protocols extending this framework to qutrits.

Title: Searching for emergent spacetime in spin glasses
Authors: Dimitris Saraidaris, Leo Shaposhnik
Abstract: Recent work on algebraic formulations of holographic dualities in terms of large $N$ algebras has revealed a deep connection between the properties of the associated spectral functions and the emergence of a semiclassical spacetime and causal horizons therein. One of the main lessons is that, for a radial direction to emerge, the spectral function has to exhibit non-compact support. Furthermore, there exist conjectures upon a possible duality between complex gravitational configurations and glassy systems. The goal of this paper is to combine these ideas by studying many-body quantum-mechanical systems and assess in which parameter regimes they could potentially be holographic. Thus, we compute the spectral functions of three many-body systems with quenched disorder, the SYK model, the $p$-spin model and the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg chain in the large $N$ limit and present results in different parameter regimes. Our main finding is that in the quantum spin glass phase of the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg model, the spectral function develops an exponential tail, similar to the large $q$ limit of SYK. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of an infinite family of quasiparticle excitations deep in the spin liquid phase of the $p$-spin model, which could point towards an emergent type I von Neumann algebra. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of an exponential tail in the spectral function for all cases without compact support and conformal symmetry. Motivated by this observation, we prove that no low-energy operator can detect a nontrivial bulk causal structure, if the spectral function has exponentially decaying tails.

Title: Local-to-Global Entanglement Dynamics by Periodically Driving Impurities
Authors: Zhi-Xing Lin, Abhinav Prem, Shinsei Ryu, Bastien Lapierre
Abstract: We study the entanglement dynamics of a one-dimensional spin chain subject to a local Floquet drive of a two-site impurity. We uncover a sharp transition in the entanglement dynamics as a function of the driving frequency. For large drive periods $T$, we observe a linear growth in entanglement entropy (EE), indicating a heating phase with volume law entanglement. Surprisingly, for driving periods below a critical value $T_\ast$, the EE grows subextensively with time, characteristic of a local quantum quench. In the non-interacting limit, we analytically trace the origin of this phenomenon to a transition in the single-particle Floquet quasi-energy spectrum. We also find that for $T>T_*$, the so-called ``average energy" operator develops non-local, rainbow-like couplings that are responsible for the rapid entanglement growth in the heating phase, but remains local for $T<T_*$. Using extensive matrix-product-state simulations, we show that the non-heating phase and the subextensive entanglement growth persist in the presence of weak interactions for numerically accessible timescales. Our results establish that local Floquet engineering can generate emergent bulk phenomena, shedding new light on energy localization and thermalization in driven many-body systems.

Title: Thermodynamic decoupling in the deep-strong coupling regime
Authors: S. Palafox, M. Salado-Mejía, M. Santiago-García, R. Román-Ancheyta
Abstract: In the deep-strong coupling (DSC) regime, the interaction between light and matter exceeds their bare frequencies, leading to an effective decoupling. Theoretical and experimental evidence for this behavior has relied solely on measurements of local observables at equilibrium. However, such a local approach is insufficient to accurately describe energy fluxes in critical and nonequilibrium phenomena. Here, we use a two-terminal quantum junction to derive a thermodynamically consistent global master equation. We demonstrate that the associated heat current, a key nonlocal observable in any quantum thermal machine, also approaches zero in this extreme coupling scenario, underscoring the role of virtual photons in the vacuum ground state. Our results indicate that the decoupling is a more general feature of the DSC regime, with implications for quantum thermotronics.

Title: Grain Boundary Diffusion in Yukawa Crystals
Authors: Matthew E. Caplan, Nevin T. Smith, Dany Yaacoub, Roberto F. Serrano, Elias Taira, Ashley Bransgrove
Abstract: We present calculations of diffusion coefficients in grain boundaries in Yukawa crystals for astrophysics. Our methods follow from our recent work calculating diffusion coefficients in perfect body-centered cubic crystals. These diffusion coefficients show only a weak dependence on the crystal orientations at the grain boundary and are consistent with those expected for a supercooled liquid scaled down by one to two orders of magnitude. We argue that the local disorder at the grain boundary produces a landscape of potential barriers similar to that of an amorphous liquid thin film, significantly reducing activation barriers to diffusive hops relative to the bulk solid. This also introduces a screening dependence, such that boundary diffusion does not exhibit the same universality as the bulk crystal. These diffusion coefficients suggest that grain boundaries may be a dominant source of viscous dissipation in neutron star crusts.

Title: Kramers rate for Brownian particles in excitable media with deformable double-well substrates
Authors: Alain M. Dikande
Abstract: We address the Kramers escape problem for Brownian particles in bistable substrates with deformable double-well shapes. The shape deformability is considered of three distinct forms: in one, the positions of the two degenerate minima can be shifted continuously without affecting the barrier height. In the second the minima positions are kept fix while the barrier height is continuously shifted. In the third the minima positions and barrier height can be tuned simultaneously by changing a single real parameter that we refer to as deformability parameter. We obtain the analytical expression of the Kramers escape rate for the three different double-well models, and identify a critical value of the deformability parameter above which non-Gaussian corrections become relevant. Remarkable enough in the latter region, statistical mechanics predicts a first-order transition in quantum tunneling using the functional action associated with the family of deformable double-well potentials.

Title: Scrambling Without Chaos in Random Free-Fermionic Systems
Authors: Ali Mollabashi, Mohammad-Javad Vasli
Abstract: We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.

Title: Ground state energy of a dilute inhomogeneous Fermi gas
Authors: Thomas Gamet (UMPA-ENSL)
Abstract: We study the ground state energy of a system of N fermions with two spin states in the large N limit. The particles are placed in an inhomogeneous trapping potential and interact via scaled interactions. We study a dilute limit where the range of the interaction potential is much smaller than the typical inter-particle distance. We show that the energy per particle converges to the Thomas-Fermi energy of the system, with a perturbative term corresponding tot he interaction and exhibiting the scattering length of the potential. The proof is decomposed into two bounds. First, we construct an appropriate test-state to prove the upper bound. Then, we prove the lower bound by the Dyson lemma, which allows us to regularize the interaction potential, and several semi-classical tools.

Title: Combining metal dewetting and lateral etching for the scalable top-down fabrication of GaN nanowire arrays with independently tunable diameter and spacing
Authors: Jingxuan Kang, Rose-Mary Jose, Oliver Brandt, Lutz Geelhaar
Abstract: The top-down fabrication of nanowires based on patterning via metal dewetting is a cost-effective and scalable approach that is particularly suited for applications requiring large arrays of nanowires. Advantageously, the nanowire diameter can be tailored by the initial metal film thickness. However, we show here that metal dewetting inherently leads to a coupling between the nanowire diameter and spacing. To overcome this limitation, we introduce two strategies that are exemplified for GaN nanowires: (i) modification of the surface and interface energies within the dewetting system, and (ii) thinning of the nanowires by lateral etching. In the first strategy, GaN(0001), SiOx, and SiNx substrate surfaces are combined with Au, Pt, and Pt-Au alloy dewetting metals to tune the dewetting behavior. The differences in interface energies affect the relation between nanowire diameter and spacing, albeit within a limited range. The second strategy adds a lateral etching step to the conventional top-down nanowire fabrication process. This step at the same time reduces the nanowire diameter and increases the spacing, thus enabling combinations beyond the constraints of metal dewetting alone. When in addition different initial nanowire diameters are employed, it is possible to independently control diameter and spacing over a substantially extended range. Therefore, the inherent limitation of conventional dewetting-based patterning approaches for the top-down fabrication of nanowires is overcome.

Title: Cell Competition Driven by Secreted Ligands: Modeling Liver Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer
Authors: Hossein Nemati, Saskia Jacoba Elisabeth Suijkerbuijk, Joost de Graaf
Abstract: Cell competition in multicellular organisms has been shown to play a critical role during the development of organisms, cancer progression, and in the establishment and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Various mechanisms of cell competition have been identified, including active elimination via mechanical forces or induced apoptosis, as well as competition for nutrients and other beneficial factors. A recent experiment demonstrated hallmarks of cell competition, associated with cell cycle dynamics, between liver progenitor cells and colorectal cancer cells [Krotenberg Garcia et al., iScience 27, 109718 (2024)]. However, a mechanistic explanation for this form of competition remains lacking. Here, we present a mean-field model of competition for signaling ligands, coupled with cell cycle dynamics, to provide such an understanding. Our model captures the salient features of the experiment, including population dynamics and cell cycle variations. We demonstrate that secretion of a beneficial factor by cells, coupled with the enhanced uptake efficiency of cancer cells, suffices to reproduce the experimental outcome. Our model, reminiscent of competition for secreted growth factors, provides insight into the minimal level of complexity required to achieve the observed competitive outcome as well as its link to cell cycle dynamics. It can also serve as a general framework for studying biological populations with growth-stage-dependent competition over consumer-produced products.

Title: Exciton and biexciton preparation via coherent swing-up excitation in a GaAs quantum dot embedded in micropillar cavity
Authors: Claudia Piccinini, Aleksander Rodek, Abdulmalik A. Madigawa, Ailton Garcia Jr., Saimon F. Covre da Silva, Vikas Remesh, Luca Vannucci, Gregor Weihs, Armando Rastelli, Niels Gregersen, Battulga Munkhbat
Abstract: Coherent control of quantum emitters is essential for scalable quantum photonic technologies. The recently proposed swing-up of quantum emitter (SUPER) scheme enables the coherent preparation of excitons via off-resonant, red-detuned laser pulses, offering highly efficient single-photon generation. We present a systematic study of SUPER excitation applied to a single GaAs quantum dot in a low-Q micropillar cavity. After identifying optimal excitation conditions, we benchmark the SUPER scheme against above-band, p-shell, and two-photon biexciton excitation (TPE). Despite requiring higher excitation powers, SUPER achieves near-unity population inversion ($\sim$95 %) and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}=0.03$), comparable to TPE, while also yielding a shortened exciton decay time ($\sim$200 ps), indicative of direct, efficient exciton preparation. A polarization-resolved analysis reveals that, when both excitation and collection are aligned with the exciton dipole, SUPER results in a highly polarized single-photon emission exceeding resonant TPE saturation by a factor of 1.45. Under optimal excitation conditions, we also observe biexciton preparation via a distinct SUPER resonance, confirmed by unpolarized exciton emission, extended lifetime due to the biexciton-exciton cascade, and biexciton emission, constituting the first experimental demonstrations of biexciton preparation under SUPER. These findings are in good agreement with a proposed four-level theoretical model including the biexciton. We also report that, strikingly, a slight misalignment of laser polarization induces an additional SUPER resonance that selectively populates the orthogonal exciton state without altering the nominal excitation polarization. These findings establish the SUPER scheme as a versatile tool for state-selective exciton and biexciton control, with strong potential for quantum photonic applications.

Title: Wide-field stroboscopic imaging of topologically protected phononic modes
Authors: Ilia Chernobrovkin, Maurice Debray, Frederik Holst Knudsen, Thibault Capelle, Mads Bjerregaard Kristensen, Michael Pitts, Xiang Xi, Albert Schliesser
Abstract: Imaging spatial mode profiles is important for understanding the behavior of mechanical resonators. The recent development of phononic circuits has increased the demand for a fast imaging method based on principles of coherent detection. However, it becomes complicated to perform measurements on a large surface area. Here, we present a frequency-detuned collimated-beam interferometry measurement scheme with in-plane spatial resolution of about 6 um, which can provide information about the phase dynamics of the entire mechanical oscillation cycle on a time scale of a few seconds. We employ a stroboscopic pulse probing method to resolve high-frequency vibrational motion with a standard CMOS camera. We use this setup to image megahertz frequency resonant mode profiles present in a Valley-Hall topological triangular cavity, over an area of more than 20 mm2. We relate the obtained data to numerical simulations of the topological edge modes to reveal the relation between backscattering and the mode profile distribution. The presented protocol can become a staple for characterizing mesoscopic mechanical resonators.

Title: Solidification of Icosahedral Quasicrystals: Viewpoint Based on a Quaternion Orientational Order Parameter and the Formation of the E8 Lattice
Authors: Caroline S. Gorham, David E. Laughlin
Abstract: In this article, the solidification phase transition between isotropic liquids and icosahedral quasicrystalline structures is classified by the application of a quaternion orientational order parameter. We suggest that the formation of the E8 lattice in 8-dimensions, from which three-dimensional icosahedral quasicrystals derive by projection, occurs without dimensionally restricting the degrees of freedom of the quaternion orientational order parameter to the quaternion plane. This is different from the development of regular crystalline solids in three-dimensions, which occurs in "restricted dimensions" and requires topological-ordering, as previously discussed by the authors. In other words, herein, the formation of lattices in eight-dimensions is considered as a higher-dimensional analogy to the formation of "bulk" superfluidity. It follows that, the solidification of lattices in 8-dimensions (and derivative icosahedral quasicrystalline solids) should occur without the necessity of topological defects.

Title: Doping-induced nematic and stripe orders within the charge density wave state of TiSe$_2$
Authors: Daniel Muñoz-Segovia, Jörn W. F. Venderbos, Adolfo G. Grushin, Fernando de Juan
Abstract: In this work, we present a theory to address conflicting experimental claims regarding the charge density wave (CDW) state in TiSe$_2$, including whether there is a single or multiple CDW transitions and whether threefold rotation symmetry ($C_3$) is broken. Using a continuum $\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{p}$ model coupled to the CDW order parameter, we show how commonplace conduction band doping induces a nematic transition from a $C_3$-symmetric $3Q$ CDW to a $C_3$-breaking $3Q$ CDW, which is favored by the large ellipticity of the conduction bands of TiSe$_2$. We also find that a $1Q$ stripe CDW is generically stabilized for sufficiently high electron doping. We then show how both stripe and nematic CDW states emerge self-consistently from a minimal interacting tight-binding model, for both positive and negative initial gaps. Our theory provides a new scenario in which, as temperature is lowered, a second $C_3$-breaking transition may occur or not depending on the doping level, potentially explaining the experimental variability. These predictions can be further verified with a variety of probes including transport, photoemission and tunneling.

Title: Unvortex Lattice and Topological Defects in Rigidly Rotating Multicomponent Superfluids
Authors: Roy Rabaglia, Ryan Barnett, Ari M. Turner
Abstract: By examining rotating ferromagnetic spinor condensates through the perspective of large spin, we identify a novel type of topological point defects in the magnetization texture. These defects are not predicted by conventional homotopy analysis but rather by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The magnetization texture in the system is described by an equal-area mapping from the plane to the sphere of magnetization, forming a lattice of uniformly charged Skyrmions. This lattice contains doubly-quantized (winding number = 2) point defects arranged on the sphere in a tetrahedral configuration. The fluid found to be rotating rigidly, except at the point defects, where the vorticity vanishes. This vorticity structure describes an unconventional "unvortex" lattice, which contrasts with the well-known vortex lattice in scalar rotating superfluids, where vorticity is concentrated exclusively within defect points. Numerical results are presented, confirming these predictions and demonstrating their persistence in smaller-spin condensates.

Title: Room temperature Planar Hall effect in nanostructures of trigonal-PtBi2

Abstract: Trigonal-PtBi2 has recently garnered significant interest as it exhibits unique superconducting topological surface states due to electron pairing on Fermi arcs connecting bulk Weyl nodes. Furthermore, topological nodal lines have been predicted in trigonal-PtBi2, and their signature was measured in magnetotransport as a dissipationless, i.e. odd under a magnetic field reversal, anomalous planar Hall effect. Understanding the topological superconducting surface state in trigonal-PtBi2 requires unravelling the intrinsic geometric properties of the normal state electronic wavefunctions and further studies of their hallmarks in charge transport characteristics are needed. In this work, we reveal the presence of a strong dissipative, i.e. even under a magnetic field reversal, planar Hall effect in PtBi2 at low magnetic fields and up to room temperature. This robust response can be attributed to the presence of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy. While this effect generally follows the theoretical prediction for a planar Hall effect in a Weyl semimetal, we show that it deviates from theoretical expectations at both low fields and high temperatures. We also discuss the origin of the PHE in our material, and the contributions of both the topological features in PtBi2 and its possible trivial origin. Our results strengthen the topological nature of PtBi2 and the strong influence of quantum geometric effects on the electronic transport properties of the low energy normal state.

Title: Lower Bound of Entropy Production in an Underdamped Langevin System with Normal Distributions
Authors: Futa Watabe, Koji Okuda
Abstract: We study the lower bound of the entropy production in a one-dimensional underdamped Langevin system constrained by a time-dependent parabolic potential. We focus on minimizing the entropy production during transitions from a given initial distribution to a given final distribution taking a given finite time. We derive the conditions for achieving the minimum entropy production for the processes with normal distributions, using the evolution equations of the mean and covariance matrix to determine the optimal control protocols for stiffness and center of the potential. Our findings reveal that not all covariance matrices can be given as the initial and final conditions due to the limitations of the control protocol. This study extends existing knowledge of the overdamped systems to the underdamped systems.

Title: Stochastic field effects in a two-state system: symmetry breaking and symmetry restoring
Authors: Sara Oliver-Bonafoux, Raul Toral, Amitabha Chakrabarti
Abstract: We study the Ising model under a time-varying, but spatially homogeneous, Gaussian random magnetic field. In the Monte Carlo simulations, we go beyond the standard analysis of the order parameter by measuring the magnetization probability distribution as a function of temperature and field strength, and by computing the time required for the system to escape from a completely ordered state of the magnetization. We identify three distinct phases: a soft-paramagnetic phase, a soft-ferromagnetic phase and a bona-fide ferromagnetic phase. These soft phases display broad magnetization distributions that tend to limiting forms that remain finite in both height and width in the thermodynamic limit. The transition between the soft-paramagnetic and soft-ferromagnetic phases is a noise-induced transition and, for small field amplitudes, occurs at the critical temperature of the field-free Ising model. The transition from the soft-ferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase occurs at lower temperatures and is discontinuous, yet it does not fall into the conventional first-order class. Instead, it is characterized by a diverging escape time from an ordered magnetization state.

Title: Spectral Analysis of Representational Similarity with Limited Neurons
Authors: Hyunmo Kang, Abdulkadir Canatar, SueYeon Chung
Abstract: Understanding representational similarity between neural recordings and computational models is essential for neuroscience, yet remains challenging to measure reliably due to the constraints on the number of neurons that can be recorded simultaneously. In this work, we apply tools from Random Matrix Theory to investigate how such limitations affect similarity measures, focusing on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). We propose an analytical framework for representational similarity analysis that relates measured similarities to the spectral properties of the underlying representations. We demonstrate that neural similarities are systematically underestimated under finite neuron sampling, mainly due to eigenvector delocalization. Moreover, for power-law population spectra, we show that the number of localized eigenvectors scales as the square root of the number of recorded neurons, providing a simple rule of thumb for practitioners. To overcome sampling bias, we introduce a denoising method to infer population-level similarity, enabling accurate analysis even with small neuron samples. Theoretical predictions are validated on synthetic and real datasets, offering practical strategies for interpreting neural data under finite sampling constraints.

Title: Flat band driven itinerant magnetism in the Co-pnictides CaCo$_2$As$_2$ and LaCo$_2$P$_2$

Abstract: Flat bands can induce strong electron correlation effects that help stabilize both magnetic and superconducting states. Here, we carry out angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to study the electronic structure of the Co-pnictides CaCo$_2$As$_2$ and LaCo$_2$P$_2$. We find that, while the $k_z$ Fermi topology of ferromagnetic LaCo$_2$P$_2$ is markedly 2-dimensional, antiferromagnetic CaCo$_2$As$_2$ develops a 3D Fermi surface described by a $zig-zag$-like band dispersion perpendicular to the Co-As plane. Furthermore, the magnetism is driven by the electronic correlations of the flat bands with $d_{xy}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbital character at the Fermi level. Our results link the electronic dimensionality and the magnetic order, and emphasize the critical role of the As-As and P-P bond strength along the $c$-direction to understand the electronic band structure and the rich phase diagram of transition metal pnictides.

Title: Cooper pair condensation from entanglement-entropy collapse of many-body states in sheared bilayer graphene
Authors: Jose Gonzalez, Tobias Stauber
Abstract: It is known that the sheared graphene bilayers can be tuned to have flat low-energy bands for sufficiently large size of their moiré supercell. In this regime, we show by means of a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation that the interacting system becomes prone to develop broken-symmetry phases, with valley symmetry breaking as the dominant pattern. We adopt an exact diagonalization approach, on top of the Hartree-Fock approximation, to show how the condensation of Cooper pairs takes place in the strong-coupling limit of a valley-polarized flat band. A key factor of our proposal is the existence of zero entanglement-entropy many-body states, just made of a single Slater determinant, which are immune to the hybridization with the rest of the states under the strong Coulomb interaction. Moreover, we show that single-particle states with reverse sign of valley symmetry breaking have complementary charge distributions in the supercell, leading to a ground state where the Coulomb repulsion is minimized by placing electrons with opposite spin in different valleys. We argue that the collapse of the entanglement entropy causes the formation of many-body ground states with Cooper pairs made of electrons and their respective partners under valley symmetry, unveiling a strong-coupling mechanism of condensation in a flat band with initially no Fermi line.

Title: Generic power laws in higher-dimensional lattice models with multidirectional hopping
Authors: Animesh Hazra, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Anirban Mukherjee, Punyabrata Pradhan
Abstract: We show that, on a $d-$dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d>1$, conserved-mass transport processes, with {\it multidirectional} hopping that respect all symmetries of the lattice, exhibit power-law correlations for generic parameter values $-$ even {\it far} from phase transition point, if any. The key idea for generating the algebraic decay is the notion of {\it multidirectional} hopping, which means that several chunks of masses, or several particles, can hop out simultaneously from a lattice site in multiple directions, consequently breaking detailed balance. Notably, the systems we consider are described by a continuous-time Markov process, are diffusive, {\it lattice-rotation symmetric}, spatially homogeneous and thus have {\it no} net mass current. Using hydrodynamic and exact microscopic theory, we show that, for spatial dimensions $d > 1$, the steady-state static density-density and ``activity''-density correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit typically decay as $\sim 1/r^{(d+2)}$ at large distance $r=|{\bf r}|$; the strength of the power law is exactly calculated for several models and expressed in terms of the density-dependent bulk-diffusion coefficient and Onsager matrix (or, mobility tensor). In particular, our theory explains why center-of-mass-conserving dynamics, used to model novel disordered {\it hyperuniform} state of matter, result in generic long-ranged correlations. However, in a restricted parameter regime, the correlations can also be short ranged and are characterized through the Onsager matrix.

Title: Polarization-dependent photocurrent in a quadrilateral-shaped bulk crystalline tellurium chip with near-infrared light excitation
Authors: Hiro Munekata, Gakuto Kusuno, Kohei Miyazaki, Takuya Satoh
Abstract: We report the detection of zero-bias photocurrents induced by interband excitation using oblique near-infrared light ({\lambda}=0.780 {\mu}m) along the directions parallel and perpendicular to the helical axis in a millimeter-sized Te crystal. The photocurrent parallel to the helical axis exhibits a circular-polarization-dependent component, namely circular photogalvanic effect. We create a framework for estimating the gyrotropic photoconductivity tensor \b{eta}, the ratio between the circular-polarization-dependent photocurrent density and intensity of light, through which extrinsic \b{eta} values ranging from a few to a few tens of nA/W are obtained. Searching the \b{eta} values through existing literatures reveals that these values vary significantly with sample conditions, excitation wavelengths, and forms of crystallite samples. A particular interesting point found in our study is that the \b{eta} values for the interband excitation may be greater than those for intraband excitation as far as bulk Te is concerned.

Title: Developments in the applications of density functional theory to fractional quantum Hall systems
Authors: Yi Yang, Yayun Hu, Zi-Xiang Hu
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect remains a captivating area in condensed matter physics, characterized by strongly correlated topological order, which manifests as fractionalized excitations and anyonic statistics. Numerical simulations, such as exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, matrix product states, and Monte Carlo methods, are essential to examine the properties of strongly correlated systems. Recently, density functional theory has been employed in this field within the framework of composite fermion theory. This paper systematically evaluates how density functional theory approaches have addressed fundamental challenges in fractional quantum Hall systems, including ground state and low-energy excitations. Special attention is given to the insights provided by density functional theory regarding composite fermion behavior, edge effects, and the nature of fractional charge and magnetoroton excitations. The discussion critically examines both the advantages and limitations of these approaches, while highlighting the productive interplay between numerical simulations and theoretical models. Future directions are explored, particularly the promising potential of time-dependent density functional theory for modeling non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum Hall systems.

Title: Space Group Equivariant Crystal Diffusion
Authors: Rees Chang, Angela Pak, Alex Guerra, Ni Zhan, Nick Richardson, Elif Ertekin, Ryan P. Adams
Abstract: Accelerating inverse design of crystalline materials with generative models has significant implications for a range of technologies. Unlike other atomic systems, 3D crystals are invariant to discrete groups of isometries called the space groups. Crucially, these space group symmetries are known to heavily influence materials properties. We propose SGEquiDiff, a crystal generative model which naturally handles space group constraints with space group invariant likelihoods. SGEquiD-iff consists of an SE(3)-invariant, telescoping discrete sampler of crystal lattices; permutation-invariant, transformer-based autoregressive sampling of Wyckoff positions, elements, and numbers of symmetrically unique atoms; and space group equivariant diffusion of atomic coordinates. We show that space group equivariant vector fields automatically live in the tangent spaces of the Wyckoff positions. SGEquiDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets as assessed by quantitative proxy metrics and quantum mechanical calculations.

Title: Quantum stochastic resonance in a single-photon emitter
Authors: H. Mannel, J. Zöllner, E. Kleinherbers, M. Zöllner, N. Schwarz, F. Rimek, A. D. Wieck, A. Ludwig, A. Lorke, J. König, M. Geller
Abstract: Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which fluctuations enhance an otherwise weak signal. It has been found in many different systems in paleoclimatology, biology, medicine, and physics. The classical stochastic resonance due to thermal noise has recently been experimentally extended to the quantum regime, where the fundamental randomness of individual quantum events provides the noise source. Here, we demonstrate quantum stochastic resonance in the single-electron tunneling dynamics of a periodically driven single-photon emitter, consisting of a self-assembled quantum dot that is tunnel-coupled to an electron reservoir. Such highly-controllable quantum emitters are promising candidates for future applications in quantum information technologies. We monitor the charge dynamics by resonant optical excitation and identify quantum stochastic resonance with the help of full counting statistics of tunneling events in terms of the Fano factor and extend the statistical evaluation to factorial cumulants to gain a deeper understanding of this far-reaching phenomenon.

Abstract: The low-energy physics of quantum spin ice is known to support an emergent form of quantum electrodynamics (QED), where magnetic monopoles exist and the fine structure constant is material dependent. In this article, we show how this QED is modified via a coupling to dynamical matter on the centered pyrochlore lattice, a structure which has recently been synthesized using metal-organic frameworks. Specifically, we study the low-energy properties of the $S = 1/2$ quantum XXZ model on the centered pyrochlore lattice, with a focus on the sign-problem free region. At fourth order in degenerate perturbation theory this model hosts a quantum spin liquid distinct from the well-known U(1) quantum spin ice on the pyrochlore due to the presence of dynamical matter in the ground state. Exact diagonalization results are consistent with this quantum spin liquid over an extended region of the ground state phase diagram although potential quantum critical points within this region could indicate a richer phase structure. Our work thus expands the physics of quantum spin ice in an experimentally motivated geometry, showing how the emergent QED can be coupled to dynamical matter at zero temperature.

Title: Nonlinear Transport Signatures of Hidden Symmetry Breaking in a Weyl Altermagnet
Authors: Yufei Zhao, Zhiqiang Mao, Binghai Yan
Abstract: Phase transitions in solids are often accompanied by structural changes, but subtle lattice distortions can remain hidden from conventional crystallographic probes, hindering the identification of the correct order parameters. A case in point is Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, a correlated polar ruthenate with well-characterized phase transitions, whose ground state structure has recently become a subject of debate. This uncertainty stems from extremely small atomic displacements ($\sim$0.001 Å) between competing phases, beyond the resolution of X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, or optical second-harmonic generation. In this work, we propose a method to detect hidden symmetry breaking by leveraging nonlinear transport induced by quantum geometry. We show that Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ is a Weyl chain semimetal in both phases. The low-symmetry phase, classified as an altermagnet by symmetry, features distorted topological surface states that are asymmetric along the polar ($b$) axis. However, the nonrelativistic spin splitting is too weak ($\sim$0.1 meV) to be resolved directly, regarding the altermagnetism. In contrast, Weyl chains generate a large quantum metric at the Fermi surface, leading to nonlinear conductivities that are orders of magnitude stronger in the low-symmetry phase. A longitudinal nonlinear conductivity along the polar axis emerges exclusively in this phase, providing a sensitive probe to qualitatively distinguish it from the high-symmetry structure and demonstrate the emergence of altermangetism, which is confirmed by a recent experiment. Our work establishes a route for identifying hidden symmetry breaking in complex quantum materials through the interplay of crystal symmetry, topology and nonlinear quantum transport.

Title: Multimode NOON-state generation with ultracold atoms via geodesic counterdiabatic driving
Authors: Simon Dengis, Sandro Wimberger, Peter Schlagheck
Abstract: We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms, leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By the means of an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap, facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in ultracold atomic systems.

Title: Dynamic formation of supersolid phase in a mixture of ultracold bosonic and fermionic atoms
Authors: Maciej Lewkowicz, Tomasz Karpiuk, Mariusz Gajda, Mirosław Brewczyk
Abstract: We numerically study the dynamical properties of a mixture consisting of a dipolar condensate and a degenerate Fermi gas in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. In particular, we focus on the system's response to a temporal variation in the interaction strength between bosons and fermions. When the interspecies attraction becomes sufficiently strong, we observe a phase transition to a supersolid state. This conclusion is supported by the emergence of an out-of-phase Goldstone mode in the excitation spectrum.

Title: Improving deep neural network performance through sampling
Authors: Lakshmi A. Ghantasala, Ming-Che Li, Risi Jaiswal, Behtash Behin-Aein, Joseph Makin, Shreyas Sen, Supriyo Datta
Abstract: Energy efficient sampling with probabilistic neurons or p-bits has been demonstrated in the context of Boltzmann machines and it is natural to ask if these approaches can be extended to the field of generative AI where energy costs have become prohibitively large. However, this very active field is dominated by feedforward deep neural networks (DNNs) which primarily use multi-bit deterministic neurons with no role for sampling. In this paper we first show that it is feasible to obtain superior accuracy through the use of multiple samples generated by probabilistic networks. This possibility raises the question of which option is energetically preferable for improving accuracy: generating more samples, or adding more bits to a single deterministic sample. We provide a simple expression that can be used to estimate these energy tradeoffs and illustrate it with results for different algorithms and architectures.

Title: Integral fractional viscoelastic models in SPH: LAOS simulations versus experimental data
Authors: Luca Santelli, Adolfo Vázquez-Quesada, Aizzati Burgoa, Aitor Arriaga, Ritardo Hernandez, Marco Ellero
Abstract: The rheological behaviour of a polymer was investigated by performing numerical simulations in complex flow and comparing them to experiments. For our simulations, we employed a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics scheme, utilizing an integral fractional model based on the K-BKZ framework. The results are compared with experiments performed on melt-state isotactic polypropylene under medium and large amplitude oscillatory shear. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data, and the model is able to capture and predict both the linear and the non-linear viscoelastic behaviours of the polymer melt. Results show that equipping SPH with an integral fractional model is promising approach for the simulation of complex polymeric materials under realistic conditions.

Title: Exact downfolding and its perturbative approximation
Authors: Jonas B. Profe, Jakša Vučičević, P. Peter Stavropoulos, Malte Rösner, Roser Valentí, Lennart Klebl
Abstract: Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.

Title: Multivalent linkers mediated ultra-sensitive bio-detection
Authors: Xiuyang Xia, Yuhan Peng, Ran Ni
Abstract: In biosensing and diagnostic applications, a key objective is to design detection systems capable of identifying targets at very low concentrations, i.e., achieving high sensitivity. Here, we propose a linker-mediated detection scheme in which the presence of target molecules (linkers) facilitates the adsorption of ligand-coated guest nanoparticles onto a receptor-coated host substrate. Through a combination of computer simulations and mean-field theory, we demonstrate that, at fixed overall binding strength, increasing the valency of linkers exponentially lowers the concentration threshold for detection. This enables the identification of targets at extremely low concentrations, which is critical for early-stage disease and pathogen diagnostics. Furthermore, superselectivity with respect to binding strength is preserved for multivalent linkers, allowing for effective discrimination between targets and non-targets. Our findings highlight multivalency engineering of linkers as a powerful strategy to dramatically enhance the sensitivity of biodetection systems.

Title: Hybrid magnon -- Nambu-Goldstone excitations in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator thin-film heterostructures
Authors: T. Karabassov, I. V. Bobkova, A. M. Bobkov, A. S. Vasenko, A. A. Golubov
Abstract: We address a previously unexplored type of dynamical proximity effect that occurs in s-wave topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) heterostructures. It is predicted that magnons in the FI and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) collective superconducting phase mode in the TS are coupled, forming composite magnon-NG excitations. The mechanism of this coupling is associated with the complete spin-momentum locking of electrons in the helical surface state of the TS. The strength of the magnon-NG coupling is strongly anisotropic with respect to the mutual orientation of the magnon wave vector and the equilibrium magnetization of the FI. This effect provides a mechanism for the interconversion of spin signals and the spinless signals carried by collective superconducting excitations, thereby giving new impetus to the development of superconducting spintronics.

Title: Dopant site occupancy determined by core-loss-filtered, position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction
Authors: Michael Deimetry, Timothy C. Petersen, Matthew Weyland, Scott D. Findlay
Abstract: In the elastic scattering regime, probe position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED) patterns have proven robust for estimating specimen thickness and mistilt. Through simulation, we show that core-loss-filtered PACBED patterns can be used to measure the site occupancy of a small concentration of dopants in an otherwise known crystal structure. By leveraging the reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy, we interpret core-loss PACBED patterns using a strategy traditionally used for determining dopant concentrations via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We show that differences in the interaction range of different elements hinder a purely measurement-based quantification strategy, but that this can be overcome through comparison with simulations that generalize the Cliff-Lorimer k-factors.

Title: Spinning mixtures: nonreciprocity transfers chirality across scales in scalar densities
Authors: Giulia Pisegna, Suropriya Saha
Abstract: A mixture of spinning particles of two different types represents a system where both nonreciprocity and chirality determine the emergent dynamics. In this work we present a minimal model for a two-species mixture of chiral active particles, formulated solely in terms of the number densities of the species. Both nonreciprocity and chirality enter the bulk part of the chemical potential, taking the form of local and non-local contributions, respectively. The chiral term manifests as the curl of the nonreciprocal current, which is non-zero when chasing interactions produces a local phase shift between the number densities. Chiral domains are localised and, as a result of number conservation, they have either positive or negative sign. The chiral domains pull in or push out particles depending on their sign and strongly modify the nonreciprocal dynamics. Their interplay generates distinctive dynamical states, including phase separation with edge currents and a spatio-temporally disordered phase with both chiral and nonreciprocal signatures.

Title: Measuring the measurement problem: controlling decoherence with measurement duration in molecular MCB junctions
Authors: C.J. Muller
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the measurement duration on quantum coherence in molecular mechanically controlled break junctions operating in a tetrahydrofuran (THF) partially wet phase. These systems represent a distinct class of enclosed open quantum systems with unusually long decoherence times at ambient conditions, on the order of 1-20 ms. By tuning the integration time of the current measurement in current-voltage (IV) characteristics, relative to the decoherence time, we observe a transition from quantum interference patterns, manifested as structured bands of data points, to classical behavior characterized by a single averaged response. This demonstrates that the duration of a measurement acts as a controllable parameter for probing quantum behavior in molecular junctions, offering new insights into decoherence dynamics in quantum mechanics.

Title: Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential
Authors: Léo Touzo, Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.

Title: Breaking of scale invariance in a strongly dipolar 2D Bose gas
Authors: Haoting Zhen, Yifei He, Sampriti Saha, Mithilesh K. Parit, Mingchen Huang, Nicolò Defenu, Gyu-Boong Jo
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) dipolar atomic gases present unique opportunities for exploring novel quantum phases due to their anisotropic and long-range interactions. However, the behavior of strongly dipolar Bose gases in 2D remains unclear, especially when dipoles are tilted. Here, we demonstrate the creation and characterization of strongly dipolar 2D condensates in a quasi-2D harmonic trap with tunable dipole orientation. By investigating scale invariance properties through breathing collective mode measurements, we observe significant breaking of scale invariance when dipoles are tilted in-plane indicating the dominance of the nonlocal dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs) in this regime. Interestingly, the breaking of the scale invariant dynamics is accompanied by an increase in quantum fluctuations, as shown by comparison with mean-field and beyond mean-field theoretical studies. Our experiments also reveal that at critical tilt angles around 70°, stripe-type density modulations emerge, suggesting the presence of a roton spectrum in 2D, while the system still shows hydrodynamic nature with the phase-locking breathing behavior. This observation elucidates the many-body effect induced by DDIs in 2D, thus marking a crucial step toward realizing 2D supersolids and other exotic quantum phases.

Title: Crossed surface flat bands in three-dimensional superconducting altermagnets
Authors: Yuri Fukaya, Bo Lu, Keiji Yada, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for emergent phenomena but their study has involved two dimensional systems. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the underlying symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, while the number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed surface flat bands, surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to distinct signals in charge conductance, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.

Title: Surface-induced ordering and continuous breaking of translational symmetry in conjugated polymers
Authors: Anton Sinner, Alexander J. Much, Oleksandr Dolynchuk
Abstract: Surface-induced liquid crystalline phase transitions evoke fundamental interest and can provide deeper insight into the nature of low-dimensional phase transitions. Board-like conjugated polymers are particularly interesting because they exhibit novel sanidic liquid crystalline mesophases that remain largely unexplored. Specifically, although preferential molecular orientation near the free surface has been observed in films of conjugated polymers, the mechanism of its formation remains unclear. Here, we use grazing-incidence X-ray scattering to monitor the formation and breaking of positional order in situ in thin films of two conjugated polymers representative of two classes: polythiophenes and polydiketopyrrolopyrroles. Our results reveal that the surface induces positional order in films of both conjugated polymers through the formation of a highly oriented, sanidic disordered mesophase at the surface. This ordering process continues upon cooling and undergoes multiple liquid crystalline transitions into more ordered phases, both at the surface and in the bulk, which can compete with each other. The positional smectic-like order parameter exhibits continuous temperature dependence near the transition, signifying a continuous breaking of translational symmetry by the surface. Theoretical analysis enables us to accurately describe the order parameter when critical behavior is considered.

Title: High-Efficiency Nonrelativistic Charge-Spin Conversion in X-Type Antiferromagnets
Authors: Jiabin Wang, Wancheng Zhang, Yong Liu, Rui Xiong, Zhenhua Zhang, Zhihong Lu
Abstract: Altermagnets have attracted considerable interest due to the symmetry-induced anisotropic spin splitting while preserving zero net magnetization, which enables efficient generation of spin currents. This work proposes a distinct class of antiferromagnetic materials, termed X-type antiferromagnets, which are shown to produce more efficient $\cal T$-odd spin currents than common altermagnets along specific crystallographic directions due to their unique Fermi surface geometry. The spin current polarization is controlled by the Néel vector orientation. As a prototype conducting X-type antiferromagnet, the Fermi surface of $\beta-\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{PO}_5$ exhibits a distinct $d$-wave altermagnetic characteristic, which compresses into a nearly X-shaped configuration. This results in highly efficient $\cal T$-odd spin currents, achieving a charge-spin conversion efficiency of up to 90%. Moreover, when the Néel vector tilts to the out-of-plane direction, an in-plane injected charge current can generate a special spin current component with both spin polarization and propagation along the out-of-plane direction, whose charge-spin conversion efficiency substantially exceeds that of known ferromagnets, altermagnets, noncollinear antiferromagnets, and low-symmetry materials. The highly efficient charge-spin conversion in X-type antiferromagnets provides a novel and highly effective spin source system for the development of low-power spintronic devices.

Title: Phase Separation in Kitaev Chain
Authors: Kazuhiro Kuboki
Abstract: Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional spinless fermion model that has $p$-wave superconducting (SC) states and Majorana zero modes at the edge. Usually this model is analyzed by taking only SC order parameter (OP) into account, but the situation significantly changes when OPs other than the SCOP are included. It turns out that the SC state in the latter case is prone to phase separation for moderate to strong attractiive interactions.

Title: Synthesis of graphene aerogels toward the absorption of liquid and gas pollutants
Authors: George Gorgolis, Natalia Pastra, George Paterakis, Costas Galiotis
Abstract: Environmental disasters, such as the oil spill in Mexico gulf or, more recently, the Mauritius oil spill caused by a bulk carrier vessel, are some of the ecological issues that the modern society faces frequently. These accidents highlight the need for development of efficient materials that can be employed to eliminate pollutants including crude oil and its derivatives, as well as toxic organic solvents. The objective of the present study is to achieve the synthesis of graphene aerogels with two main methods and to determine their efficiency as absorbents of liquid and gas pollutants. Graphene aerogels were prepared according to the information given by Hong et al. (2015) and Yang et al. (2015). Both methods are based on the chemical reduction of graphene oxide as the first step and the formation of the aerogel as the second, providing a more cost-effective solution and resulting in a lattice structure similar to graphene. The fabricated materials were investigated for their absorption capacity for liquid and gas pollutants. The specimens were mounted in airtight microenvironments saturated with a specific Volatile Organic Compound (VOC). Three VOCs were tested; formaldehyde, acetic acid and hydrochloric acid and the results were based on gravimetric measurements. In order to increase the accuracy of the obtained data, a VOCs sensor was used to measure the change of voltage before and after the introduction of graphene aerogels in a saturated microenvironment. Furthermore, the graphene aerogels were evaluated as absorbents in organic solvents, namely acetone, ethanol and methanol.

Title: The probability of almost all eigenvalues being real for the elliptic real Ginibre ensemble
Authors: Gernot Akemann, Sung-Soo Byun, Yong-Woo Lee
Abstract: We investigate real eigenvalues of real elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $n$, indexed by the parameter of asymmetry $\tau \in [0,1]$. In both the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes, where $\tau \in [0,1)$ is fixed or $1-\tau=O(1/n)$, respectively, we derive the asymptotic expansion of the probability $p_{n,n-2l}$ that all but a finite number $2l$ of eigenvalues are real. In particular, we show that the expansion is of the form \begin{align*} \log p_{n, n-2l} = \begin{cases} a_1 n^2 +a_2 n + a_3 \log n +O(1) &\text{at strong non-Hermiticity}, \\ b_1 n +b_2 \log n + b_3 +o(1) &\text{at weak non-Hermiticity}, \end{cases} \end{align*} and we determine all coefficients explicitly. Furthermore, in the special case where $l=1$, we derive the full-order expansions. For the proofs, we employ distinct methods for the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes. In the former case, we utilise potential-theoretic techniques to analyse the free energy of elliptic Ginibre matrices conditioned to have $n-2l$ real eigenvalues, together with the strong Szegő limit theorems. In the latter case, we utilise the skew-orthogonal polynomial formalism and the asymptotic behaviour of the Hermite polynomials.

Title: Experimental demonstration of kinetic proofreading inherited in ligation-based information replication
Authors: Hiroyuki Aoyanagi, Yasuhiro Magi, Shoichi Toyabe
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that information replication by templated ligation of DNA strands inherits a kinetic proofreading mechanism and achieves significant error suppression through cascade replication. A simple simulation model derived from the experimental results shows that templated ligation has a significant advantage over replication by polymerization for error suppression of long strands. Specifically, longer chains show lower error rates, significantly distinct from the chain-growth polymerization where errors typically accumulate with chain length. This mechanism provides a plausible route for high-fidelity replication in prebiotic chemistry and illustrates how physical principles such as nonequilibrium kinetics and network architecture can drive reliable molecular information replication. The approach also offers new strategies for error suppression in biotechnology.

Title: Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning
Authors: Liu Ziyin, Yizhou Xu, Isaac Chuang
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.

Title: Recurrent Self-Attention Dynamics: An Energy-Agnostic Perspective from Jacobians
Authors: Akiyoshi Tomihari, Ryo Karakida
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, we show that analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the state is highly valuable when investigating more general SA architectures without necessarily admitting an energy function. It reveals that the normalization layer plays an essential role in suppressing the Lipschitzness of SA and the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, which correspond to the oscillatory components of the dynamics. In addition, the Lyapunov exponents computed from the Jacobians demonstrate that the normalized dynamics lie close to a critical state, and this criticality serves as a strong indicator of high inference performance. Furthermore, the Jacobian perspective also enables us to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.

Title: Adiabatic echo protocols for robust quantum many-body state preparation
Authors: Zhongda Zeng, Giuliano Giudici, Aruku Senoo, Alexander Baumgärtner, Adam M. Kaufman, Hannes Pichler
Abstract: Entangled many-body states are a key resource for quantum technologies. Yet their preparation through analog control of interacting quantum systems is often hindered by experimental imperfections. Here, we introduce the adiabatic echo protocol, a general approach to state preparation designed to suppress the effect of static perturbations. We provide an analytical understanding of its robustness in terms of dynamically engineered destructive interference. By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.

Title: Emission Properties of a Hybrid Metallized Diamond(001) Photocathode
Authors: Louis A. Angeloni, Ir-Jene Shan, W. Andreas Schroeder
Abstract: The spectral emission characteristics of a proof-of-concept hybrid metallized diamond(001) photocathode are presented. The quantum efficiency (QE) is shown to be determined by the photo-injection efficiency across the ohmic contact at the back metallized face, whereas the mean transverse energy (MTE) of the photoemitted electrons is consistent with a (optical)phonon-assisted and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon mechanism [Phys. Rev. Applied 23, 054065 (2025)] following electron drift transport to the untreated diamond(001) front emission face. Emission is observed from both the lower and upper conduction bands of diamond with positive and negative electron affinity respectively. A potential route to the realization of a red-visible photocathode based on this concept with a sub-50meV MTE and a QE greater than 0.1% is discussed.

Title: Deconstructing the Origins of Interfacial Catalysis: Why Electric Fields are Inseparable from Solvation
Authors: Solana Di Pino, Debarshi Banerjee, Marta Monti, Gonzalo Diaz Miron, Giuseppe Cassone, Ali Hassanali
Abstract: In the last decade, there has been a surge of experiments showing that certain chemical reactions undergo an enormous boost when taken from bulk aqueous conditions to microdroplet environments. The microscopic basis of this phenomenon remains elusive and continues to be widely debated. One of the key driving forces invoked are the specific properties of the air-water interface including the presence of large electric fields and distinct solvation at the surface. Here, using a combination of classical molecular dynamics simulations, the chemical physics of solvation, and unsupervised learning approaches, we place these assumptions under close scrutiny. Using phenol as a model system, we demonstrate that the electric field at the surface of water is not anomalous or unique compared to bulk water conditions. Furthermore, the electric field fluctuations de-correlate on a timescale of ~10 ps implying that their role in activating much slower chemical reactions remains inconclusive. We deploy a recently developed unsupervised learning approach, dubbed information balance, which detects in an agnostic fashion the relationship between the electric field and solvation collective variables. It turns out that the electric field on the hydroxyl group of the phenol is mostly determined by phenol hydration including the proximity and orientation of nearby water molecules. We caution that the growing attention of the role that electric fields have garnered in enhancing chemical reactivity at the air-water interface, may not reflect their actual importance.

Title: Anatomy of Non-Hermitian Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: Yongxu Fu, Gao Xianlong
Abstract: We establish a unified framework for dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in non-Hermitian systems that encompasses both biorthogonal and self-norm non-biorthogonal formulations for pure and mixed states under quantum quench protocols. Our framework provides explicit expressions for the Loschmidt amplitude, Loschmidt echo, and rate function, revealing a universal geometric signature of DQPTs in the two-band model: orthogonality of two related vectors in two-dimensional real space. Strikingly, we demonstrate that non-biorthogonal quenches from non-Hermitian to Hermitian Hamiltonians under chiral symmetry exhibit emergent topological characteristics of DQPTs, unveiling their fundamental features beyond conventional Hermitian regimes. This work establishes fundamental geometric and topological principles governing quantum criticality in open systems, with implications for quantum sensing and many-body physics in dissipative environments.

Title: From Confinement to Chaos in AdS/CFT Correspondence via Non-equilibrium Local States
Authors: Dmitry S. Ageev, Vladimir A. Bykov
Abstract: In this paper, we study excited states in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space prepared by local operator insertions of a massive scalar field, corresponding to local operator quenches in a free bulk scalar theory. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the time evolution of boundary observables in the dual CFT states. We then introduce a hard wall in AdS Poincare coordinates to impose an infrared cutoff (hard-wall), creating a confining deformation of the dual conformal field theory, and analyze the dynamics of excited states in this confining background. By comparing the evolution of boundary two-point correlation functions in the deformed theory to the statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles, we show that for sufficiently heavy operators, the spacing-ratio statistics of peaks in temporal dynamics are closest to those of the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE). Finally, we extend the analysis to the compact BTZ black hole and to its hard-wall deformation, finding qualitatively similar trends.

Title: Digital Quantum Simulation of Flat-Band and All-Bands-Flat Dynamics for Tunable Quantum Transport
Authors: Mrinal Kanti Giri, Pochung Chen
Abstract: Flat-band systems offer a uniquely powerful tool for quantum control in dynamics due to their characteristic feature of having a dispersionless energy band. Simulating such highly sensitive systems on current digital quantum computers is a challenging task, due to the intrinsic limitations of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Here we present high-fidelity digital quantum simulations of flat-band (FB) and all-bands-flat (ABF) lattices, using an advanced tensor-network-based circuit compression method. With the compressed quantum circuits, we first explore single-particle dynamics and observe two distinct behaviours: strong localization in ABF lattices and delocalization in FB lattices. By integrating FB and ABF lattices into a one-dimensional hybrid structure, we achieve controllable quantum transport, where the ABF lattice acts as a quantum switch. Extending to two-particle dynamics, we show that transport remains controllable by tuning the hopping amplitude alone, even in the presence of interactions. These results establish flat-band engineered systems as a promising pathway for scalable control of quantum transport in emerging quantum technologies, with potential applications in qubit isolation, particle trapping, and state transfer.

Title: A Tale of Two Uplifts: Parisi-Sourlas with Defects
Authors: Kausik Ghosh, Emilio Trevisani
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theories (CFTs) play a key role in critical phenomena by modifying scaling behaviors and generating new universality classes. We introduce Parisi-Sourlas (PS) supersymmetry in the presence of extended operators and demonstrate that any $p$-dimensional defect in a CFT$_d$ can be uplifted to a defect in a PS-supersymmetric CFT$_{d+2}$. Surprisingly, there are actually two distinct uplifted defects--of dimensions $p$ and $p+2$--which reduce to the original one. We show how this reduction works for correlators with insertions both in the bulk and on the defect. As a byproduct, we find new relations between defect conformal blocks in dimensions $d$ and $d+2$. We further show that the reduction of the $p$-dimensional defect implies and extend a "global symmetry reduction" previously considered in the literature. Finally, we provide various examples of these uplifts, including perturbative computations in epsilon expansion of the uplift of the Ising magnetic line defect, as well as exact computations of observables in the four-dimensional uplift of minimal models with boundaries.

Title: Scattering and induced false vacuum decay in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model
Authors: Luka Pavešić, Marco Di Liberto, Simone Montangero
Abstract: We study scattering in the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.

Title: Quantum Corrections in the Low-Temperature Fluid/Gravity Correspondence
Authors: Jun Nian, Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas, Cong-Yuan Yue
Abstract: Attempts to construct a low-temperature version of the fluid/gravity correspondence have faced obstacles manifested in the form of logarithmic terms in the frequency, $\log(\omega)$, leading to non-local in time constitutive relations for the stress tensor and the charge current. These difficulties can be broadly presented as a breakdown of the hydrodynamic description due to additional infrared modes. We employ new quantum insights into the physics of near-extremal black holes, brought about in the context of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, as an effective description of quantum fluctuations in the throat, to revisit the fluid/gravity correspondence at very low temperatures. The quantum corrections naturally include a new length scale, $C$, and an effective action that parametrizes the breaking of near-horizon symmetries. We show that with an appropriate choice of order of limits in the derivative expansion within the low-temperature regime, the $\log(\omega)$ infrared divergence can be resolved. By quantum averaging the infrared Schwarzian modes as an effective extra contribution to the long-wavelength fluid modes, the resulting low-temperature effective fluid description is consistent. We present the dispersion relations for all the relevant hydrodynamic modes. We also revisit the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio and find that at very low temperatures the universal $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ bound is violated due to quantum correction.

Title: Ab Initio Free Energy Surfaces for Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer
Authors: Ethan Abraham, Martin Z. Bazant, Troy Van Voorhis
Abstract: The Marcus theory of electron transfer assumes that diabatic energy gaps are sampled from a single ensemble. This assumption can break down in spatially anisotropic environments, such as electrochemical interfaces or biomolecular structures, where distinct solvent ensembles arise along a collective variable describing the anisotropy. Treating this collective variable as an additional reaction coordinate linearly independent from the Marcus reaction coordinate, we develop a formalism that enables calculation of the resulting Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer (CIET) free-energy surface directly from constrained ab initio trajectories. Applied to CO2 redox on a gold electrode, this method reveals strong coupling to the anisotropy, predicting significantly different activation barriers compared to either coordinate alone.

Title: Memory Effects in Time-Modulated Radiative Heat Transfer
Authors: Riccardo Messina, Philippe Ben-Abdallah
Abstract: We develop a general theory of radiative heat exchange between dipoles with time-modulated optical properties. This framework extends fluctuational electrodynamics beyond equilibrium by incorporating nonstationary correlations and memory effects induced by temporal modulation. Closed-form expressions for the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale heat transfer.
