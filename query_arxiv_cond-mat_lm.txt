Title: Eta-pairing state in flatband lattice: Interband coupling effect on entanglement entropy logarithm
Authors: Seik Pak, Hanbyul Kim, Chan Bin Bark, Sang-Jin Sin, Jae-yoon Choi, Moon Jip Park
Abstract: The eta-pairing state is the eigenstate of the hypercubic Hubbard model, which exhibits anomalous logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. In multi-band systems, eta-pairing can be exact eigenstate when the band is flat without interband coupling. However, typical flatband systems such as Lieb and Kagome lattices often feature band touchings, where interband coupling effects are non-negligible. Using the Creutz ladder, we investigate the deformation of eta-pairing states under the interband coupling effect. Our results show corrections to entanglement entropy scaling, with modified eta-pairing states displaying broadened doublons, nonuniform energy spacing, and deviations from exact behavior for configurations with more than one eta-pair, even in the large band gap limit, except at t = 0. Through a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we quantify corrections to the spectrum generating algebra, offering insights into the interplay between interaction-driven phenomena and band structure effects. These findings illuminate the robustness and limitations of eta-pairing in realistic flatband systems.

Title: Anisotropic spin-blockade leakage current in a Ge hole double quantum dot
Authors: Zhanning Wang, S. D. Liles, Joe Hillier, A. R. Hamilton, Dimitrie Culcer
Abstract: Group IV quantum dot hole spin systems, exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling, provide platforms for various qubit architectures. The rapid advancement of solid-state technologies has significantly improved qubit quality, including the time scales characterizing electrical operation, relaxation, and dephasing. At this stage of development, understanding the relations between the underlying spin-orbit coupling and experimental parameters, such as quantum dot geometry and external electric and magnetic fields, has become a priority. Here we focus on a Ge hole double quantum dot in the Pauli spin blockade regime and present a complete analysis of the leakage current under an out-of-plane magnetic field. By considering a model of anisotropic in-plane confinement and $k^3$-Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we determine the behaviour of the leakage current as a function of detuning, magnetic field magnitude, interdot distance, and individual dot ellipticities. We identify regions in which the leakage current can be suppressed by quantum dot geometry designs. Most importantly, by rotating one of the quantum dots, we observe that the quantum dot shape induces a strongly anisotropic leakage current. These findings provide guidelines for probing the spin-orbit coupling, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the precision of Pauli spin blockade readout in hole qubit architectures.

Title: Evidence of electronic states driving current-induced insulator-to-metal transition
Authors: V. K. Bhartiya, R. Hartmann, F. Forte, F. Gabriele, T. Kim, G. Cuono, C. Autieri, S. Fan, K. Kisslinger, F. Camino, M. Lettieri, R. Fittipaldi, C. Mazzoli, D. N. Basov, J. Pelliciari, A. Di Bernardo, A. Vecchione, M. Cuoco, V. Bisogni
Abstract: On demand current-driven insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) is pivotal for the next generation of energy-efficient and scalable microelectronics. IMT is a key phenomenon observed in various quantum materials, and it is enabled by the complex interplay of spin, lattice, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom (DOF). Despite significant prior work, the underlying mechanism of the current-driven IMT remains elusive, primarily due to the difficulty in simultaneously obtaining bulk fingerprints of all the electronic DOF. Here, we employ in-operando resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) on Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, a prototypical strongly correlated material, to track the evolution of the electronic DOF encoded in the RIXS spectra during the current-driven IMT. Upon entering the conductive state, we observe an energy-selective suppression of the RIXS intensity, proportional to the current. Using complementary RIXS cross-section calculations, we demonstrate that the non-equilibrium conductive state emerges from the formation of correlated electronic states with a persistent Mott gap.

Title: Ferroelastic Domain Induced Electronic Modulation in Halide Perovskites
Authors: Ganesh Narasimha, Maryam Bari, Benjamin J Lawrie, Ilia N Ivanov, Marti Checa, Sumner B. Harris, Zuo-Guang Ye, Rama Vasudevan, Yongtao Liu
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their exceptional properties. In the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskites, ferroelastic domains formed during phase transitions enhance bulk transport and emissive efficiency. However, the microscopic mechanisms governing carrier dynamics remain poorly understood. In this study, we employ cathodoluminescence (CL) and micro-Raman spectroscopy to image and investigate the electronic properties of the ferroelastic domain walls in CsPbBr3 single crystals. CL measurements reveal a reduced emissive yield and a slight redshift in emission at the domain walls. Further, micro-Raman studies provide spatially resolved mapping of vibrational modes, exhibiting second-order phonon modes localized at the domain boundaries. Our findings suggest that electron-phonon coupling at twin domain walls plays a critical role in facilitating efficient charge separation, thereby improving the optoelectronic performance of the CsPbBr3 perovskites.

Title: Eliashberg theory prediction of critical currents in superconducting thin films under DC electric fields
Authors: Giovanni Alberto Ummarino, Alessio Zaccone, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: Superconducting thin metallic films, functioning as supercurrent gate-tunable transistors, have considerable potential for future quantum electronic devices. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive microscopic quantitative mechanism that elucidates the control or suppression of supercurrents in thin films remains elusive. Focusing on NbN, a prototypical material, and starting from a phenomenological ansatz that links the critical electric field with the kinetic energy parameter needed to break Cooper pairs, we provide a quantitative analysis of the critical current using Eliashberg theory in the dirty limit without adjustable parameters. The critical kinetic energy value is identified, corresponding to the maximum supercurrent that can flow in the thin film. The peak in supercurrent density as a function of the Cooper pairs' kinetic energy arises from the interplay between the increase in supercurrent due to increased kinetic energy and the depairing effect when the kinetic energy becomes sufficiently large. The critical value of the pair's kinetic energy is subsequently employed to estimate the critical value of an external electric field required to suppress superconductivity in the sample. This estimation is in parameter-free agreement with the experimental observations. Although the disorder reduces the temperature dependence of the gating effect on the critical current, at the same time, it increases the unscreened critical electric field needed to suppress superconductivity. This enables the proposal of methods to control and reduce the critical field value necessary to suppress superconductivity in superconducting electronics.

Title: Revealing domain wall stability during ultrafast demagnetization
Authors: Hung-Tzu Chang, Sergey Zayko, Timo Schmidt, Ofer Kfir, Murat Sivis, Johan H. Mentink, Manfred Albrecht, Claus Ropers
Abstract: The ultrafast control of nanoscale spin textures such as magnetic domain walls or skyrmions is essential for advancing high-speed, high-density spintronics. However, imaging their dynamics will require a technique that combines nanometer spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution. Introducing ultrafast sub-wavelength imaging in the extreme ultraviolet, we track domain wall properties during ultrafast demagnetization in ferro- and ferrimagnetic thin films. We reveal that domain walls remain invariant in position, shape, and width, down to a demonstrated sub-nanometer precision, for up to 50% demagnetization. Stronger excitation causes stochastic nanoscale domain switching. This previously unobservable robustness of laser-excited domain walls highlights the localized nature of photoinduced demagnetization and presents both challenges and opportunities for all-optical magnetic control. The presented technique can be generalized to directly probe nanoscale dynamics in spintronic materials and devices.

Title: Spin wave propagation in a ring-shaped magnonic waveguide
Authors: Franz Vilsmeier, Takuya Taniguchi, Michael Lindner, Christian Riedel, Christian Back
Abstract: We experimentally investigate frequency-selective spin wave (SW) transmission in a micrometre-scale, ring-shaped magnonic resonator integrated with a linear Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) stripe. Using super-Nyquist-sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy (SNS-MOKE) and micro-focused Brillouin light scattering ({\mu}-BLS), we probe SW dynamics in the dipolar regime under in-plane magnetisation. Spatially resolved measurements reveal a sharp transmission peak at 3.92 GHz for an external field of 74 mT, demonstrating strong frequency selectivity. Our results show that this selectivity arises from scattering and interference between multiple SW modes within the ring. These modes are governed by the anisotropic dispersion relation, transverse mode quantisation due to geometric confinement, and inhomogeneities of the effective magnetic field. In addition, the anisotropy enforces fixed group velocity directions, leading to caustic-like propagation that limits efficient out-coupling. Fourier analysis reveals discrete wavevector components consistent with quantised transverse eigenmodes. Additional {\mu}-BLS measurements at 70 mT show a shift of the transmission peak, confirming that the filtering characteristics are tunable by external parameters.

Title: First-principles open quantum dynamics for solids based on density-matrix formalism
Authors: Jacopo Simoni, Gabriele Riva, Yuan Ping
Abstract: The theoretical description of materials' properties driven out of equilibrium has important consequences in various fields such as semiconductor spintronics, nonlinear optics, continuous and discrete quantum information science and technology. The coupling of a quantum many-body system to an external bath can dramatically modify its dynamics compared to that of closed systems, new phenomena like relaxation and decoherence appear as a consequence of the nonunitary evolution of the quantum system. In addition, electron-electron correlations must be properly accounted for in order to go beyond a simple one-electron or mean-field description of the electronic system. Here we discuss a first-principles methodology based on the evolution of the electronic density matrix capable of treating electron-environment interactions and electron-electron correlations at the same level of description. The effect of the environment is separated in a coherent contribution, like the coupling to applied external electro-magnetic fields, and an incoherent contribution, like the interaction with lattice vibrations or the thermal background of radiation. Electron-electron interactions are included using the nonequilibrium Green's function plus generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz. The obtained non-Markovian coupled set of equations reduce to ordinary Lindblad quantum master equation form in the Markovian limit.

Title: Correlated insulating states in slow Dirac fermions on a honeycomb moir{é} superlattice
Authors: Dongyang Yang, Jing Liang, Haodong Hu, Nitin Kaushal, Chih-En Hsu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jerry. I Dadap, Zhenglu Li, Marcel Franz, Ziliang Ye
Abstract: Strong Coulomb repulsion is predicted to open a many-body charge gap at the Dirac point of graphene, transforming the semimetal into a Mott insulator. However, this correlated insulating phase has remained inaccessible in pristine graphene, where a large Fermi velocity dominates the interaction effects. To overcome this limitation, we realize a honeycomb moir{é} superlattice in a twisted MoSe$_2$ homobilayer, where a graphene-like band structure forms with a Fermi velocity reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude. These slow moir{é} bands are folded from the valence band maximum at the $\Gamma$ valley of the extended Brillouin zone with negligible spin-orbital coupling, and can therefore simulate massless Dirac fermions in the strongly correlated regime with full SU(2) symmetry. By correlating Rydberg exciton sensing with moir{é} trions of different spatial characters, we detect a Mott gap at the Dirac point that persists up to 110 K. We further identify correlated insulating states at $\nu=-1$ with a weak ferromagnetic coupling as well as at several fractional fillings. Our results highlight the potential of studying a wide range of quantum many-body phenomena in twisted two-dimensional materials.

Title: Lowering Insulator-to-Metal Transition Temperature of Vanadium Dioxide Thin Films via Co-Sputtering, Furnace Oxidation and Thermal Annealing
Authors: Vishwa Krishna Rajan, Jeremy Chao, Sydney Taylor, Liping Wang
Abstract: Thermochromic vanadium dioxide thin films have attracted much attention recently for constructing variable-emittance coatings upon its insulator-metal phase transition for dynamic thermal control. However, fabrication of high-quality vanadium dioxide thin films in a cost-effective way is still a challenge. In addition, the phase transition temperature of vanadium dioxide is around 68°C, which is higher than most of terrestrial and extraterrestrial applications. In this study, we report the fabrication and characterization of tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide thin films with lowered phase transition temperatures via co-sputtering, furnace oxidation and thermal annealing processes for wider application needs. The doping is achieved by co-sputtering of tungsten and vanadium targets while the doping level is varied by carefully controlling the sputtering power for tungsten. Doped thin film samples of 30-nm thick with different tungsten atomic concentrations are prepared by co-sputtering onto undoped silicon wafers. Optimal oxidation time of 4 hours is determined to reach full oxidation in an oxygen-rich furnace environment at 300°C. Systematic thermal annealing study is carried out to find the optimal annealing temperature and time. By using an optical cryostat coupled to an infrared spectrometer, the temperature-dependent infrared transmittance of fully annealed tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide thin films are measured in a wide temperature range from -60°C to 100°C. The phase transition temperature is found to decrease at 24.5°C per at.% of tungsten doping, and the thermal hysteresis between heating and cooling shrinks at 5.5°C per at.% from the fabricated vanadium dioxide thin films with tungsten doping up to 4.1 at.%.

Title: Role of On-site and Inter-site Coulomb Interactions in KV$_3$Sb$_5$: A first-principles DFT+$U$+$V$ study
Authors: Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, Sayandeep Ghosh, Bongjae Kim, Chang-Jong Kang
Abstract: Nonlocal Coulomb interactions play a crucial role in stabilizing distinct electronic phases in kagome materials. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Coulomb interactions on the electronic structure and stability of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases in the kagome metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT+$U$+$V$) calculations. We demonstrate that $V$ promotes the formation and stability of CDW phases, whereas $U$ suppresses these phases, highlighting a fundamental competition between local and nonlocal electronic correlations. By directly comparing our theoretical results with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data, we identify realistic values of $U$ and $V$ that accurately describe the electronic band structure of KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings establish a detailed $U$-$V$ phase diagram for KV$_3$Sb$_5$, offering valuable insights into the correlated electronic states in kagome metals and serving as a foundation for future explorations of correlation-driven phenomena in related materials.

Title: Why Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ has higher Curie temperature than Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$?
Authors: Bomin Kim, Tumentsereg Ochirkhuyag, Dorj Odkhuu, S. H. Rhim
Abstract: Physics of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ having higher Curie temperature ($T_C$) than Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ is explored theoretically in the framework of magnetic exchange interactions. Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ are isostructural, with Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ having one less valence electron and smaller nearest-neighbor exchange coefficients ($J_1$ and $J_2$), challenging the conventional notion that larger $J_1$ or $J_2$ leads to a higher $T_C$. We show that higher order exchange coefficients, $J_3$ or higher, of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ are positive whereas those of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ are negative. As a consequence, total sum of all possible exchange coefficients in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ are larger than Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, which accounts for higher $T_C$. To validate these findings, $T_C$ are computed using both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulation. Indeed, higher-order exchange interactions, when properly accounting for the number of neighbors, confirm the higher $T_C$ of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$.

Title: Tunable topological phase in 2D ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome material
Authors: Chidiebere I. Nwaogbo, Sanjib K. Das, Chinedu E. Ekuma
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the vanadium-based 2D kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, a ferromagnetic material with a magnetic moment of 0.86 $\mu_B$ per atom. Using ab initio methods, we explore spin-orbit coupling-induced gapped states and identify multiple Weyl-like crossings around the Fermi energy, confirming a Chern number $|C| = 1$ and a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of 257 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$. Our calculations reveal a transition from a topological semimetal to a trivial metallic phase at an electric field strength of $\approx$0.40 eV/Å. These findings position 2D ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ as a promising candidate for applications in modern electronic devices, with its tunable topological phases offering the potential for future innovations in quantum computing and material design.

Title: Quantum effects in rotationally invariant spin glass models
Authors: Yoshinori Hara, Yoshiyuki Kabashima
Abstract: This study investigates the quantum effects in transverse-field Ising spin glass models with rotationally invariant random interactions. The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.

Title: Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Single Organic Radicals with Sub-Molecular Resolution
Authors: Gregory Czap, Christoph Wolf, Jose Reina-Gálvez, Mark H. Sherwood, Christopher P. Lutz
Abstract: Interest in the magnetism of organic compounds is growing because of new organic magnets, spin-based electronics and the diverse properties of magnetic edge states in graphene nanoribbons. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy combined with the scanning tunneling microscopy has recently been developed as a powerful tool to address individual magnetic atoms and molecules at the atomic scale. Here we demonstrate electron spin resonance and magnetic resonance imaging of all-organic radical anions adsorbed on a protective thin insulating film grown on a metal support. We show that using the highly localized exchange field of the magnetic tip apex allows visualization of the delocalized spin density with sub-molecular resolution, enabling spin-density tomography that can distinguish similar molecular species. These results provide new opportunities for visualizing spin density and magnetic interactions at the atomic scale.

Title: Stability and Response of Vortex Solid Formed in Second Landau Level
Authors: Yuto Yokota, Dai Nakashima, Ryusuke Ikeda
Abstract: Physical properties of the vortex solid phase formed in the second Landau level (2LL), which may be stabilized by strong paramagnetic pairbreaking (PPB), are examined in type II limit with no magnetic screening. First, it is shown that the spectrum of the low energy mode of this vortex solid has the same form as that of the conventional vortex solid in the first (i.e., the lowest) Landau level. Using this result, the melting line of the 2LL vortex solid is examined according to the Lindemann criterion. In contrast to the properties in equlibrium, the electromagnetic response of this vortex solid is quite unusual: Reflecting the presence of antivortices supporting the stability of the lattice structure, the superfluid stiffness measuring the response for a current perpendicular to the magnetic field is found to be nonvanishing, and its sign depends upon the applied current direction. Consequences of this response property are briefly discussed.

Title: Observation of gauge field induced non-Hermitian helical spin skin effects
Authors: Yi Li, Jia-Hui Zhang, Yang Kou, Liantuan Xiao, Suotang Jia, Linhu Li, Feng Mei
Abstract: Synthetic gauge fields and non-Hermitian skin effects are pivotal to topological phases and non-Hermitian physics, each recently attracting great interest across diverse research fields. Notably, realizing skin effects typically require nonreciprocal couplings or on-site gain and loss. Here, we theoretically and experimentally report that, under gauge fields, non-Hermitian systems with reciprocal couplings and without gain and loss, can nontrivially give rise to an unprecedented nonreciprocal skin effect, featuring helical spin-dependent skin accumulations, dubbed as the ``helical spin skin effect". Specifically, we construct a lattice model with reciprocal dissipative couplings and gauge fields, implemented in circuit metamaterials. Before introducing the gauge fields, this model exhibits localized spin edge modes and extended bulk modes, without skin effects. As the gauge field strength is applied from $0$ to $\pi$, we observe the emergence of two distinct spin skin effects and their transitions: the hybrid-order and second-order helical spin skin effects. Furthermore, we show that these effects can be harnessed to realize helical spin-dependent nonreciprocal transmissions. Our findings not only highlight gauge field induced and enriched non-Hermitian topology, but also brings spin-dependent helicity into skin effects and nonreciprocality.

Title: Phonon-Assisted Radiative Lifetimes and Exciton Dynamics from First Principles
Authors: Chunhao Guo, Gabriele Riva, Jacopo Simoni, Junqing Xu, Yuan Ping
Abstract: Exciton-phonon interactions play a fundamental role in phonon-assisted radiative recombination and exciton dynamics in solids. In this work, we present a first-principles framework for computing phonon-assisted radiative lifetimes and exciton dynamics at finite temperatures. Starting from the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we construct an effective excitonic Hamiltonian that incorporates both exciton-photon and exciton-phonon interactions. Phonon-assisted radiative lifetimes in anisotropic media are evaluated using time-dependent second-order perturbation theory. We further analyze the temperature and phonon-mode dependence of phonon-assisted radiative lifetime and compare our results with available experimental data. We explain the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the phonon-assisted radiative lifetime by different mechanisms at low and high-temperature regimes. Finally, we perform real-time exciton relaxation at the diagonal approximation of Lindbladian dynamics for time-resolved exciton occupation, providing insights into ultrafast thermalization and scattering pathways. Our ab-initio theory offers a detailed microscopic understanding of phonon-mediated exciton relaxation and recombination processes, and provides in-depth perspectives on phonon-assisted many-body interactions and their influence on optical properties for light-emitting and optoelectronic applications.

Title: DFT Investigations of Major Defects in Quartz Crystal: Implications for Luminescence and ESR Dosimetry and Dating
Authors: Jalaja Pandya, Malika Singhal, Navinder Singh, Naveen Chauhan
Abstract: Quartz is extensively used for luminescence and ESR dosimetry as well as dating. These techniques use inherent defects introduced in quartz crystal during its crystallization in nature. The defect comprises both intrinsic as well as extrinsic defects. These defects give important luminescence properties to quartz but are not yet well understood from a theoretical perspective. Specifically, in case of luminescence dosimetry the nature of traps and their involvement in luminescence production is not exactly known. Thus, present work attempts to understand the basic physics of defects and their implication for luminescence and ESR techniques via Density Functional Theory (DFT) modelling. The work uses DFT to model the presence of some possible major impurities in quartz. Several interesting novel results are obtained that will have implications for ongoing research in Luminescence and ESR methods. The DFT modelling suggested that Oxygen deficiency in quartz crystal results in the formation of both electron and hole trapping centres. However, it is observed that these centres can be passivated by the introduction of charge compensating OH or H ions. Further, it is found that peroxy defects can be formed in the presence of either excess Oxygen or due to the absence of Silicon (Si4+), however, the nature of the traps formed in both cases is different. Besides these intrinsic defects, Al and Fe are the major impurities which are observed as defects in quartz. The modelling of these impurities suggested that negligible change in DOS is observed for Al defect and Fe generally forms a recombination centre or hole trap. In addition to these, there are several interesting first-time observations that are not reported and will be helpful for progressing luminescence and ESR dosimetry research.

Title: Chalcogen Vacancies Rule Charge Recombination in Pnictogen Chalcohalide Solar-Cell Absorbers
Authors: Cibrán López, Seán R. Kavanagh, Pol Benítez, Edgardo Saucedo, Aron Walsh, David O. Scanlon, Claudio Cazorla
Abstract: Pnictogen chalcohalides (MChX, M = Bi, Sb; Ch = S, Se; X = I, Br) represent an emerging class of nontoxic photovoltaic absorbers, valued for their favorable synthesis conditions and excellent optoelectronic properties. Despite their proposed defect tolerance, stemming from the antibonding nature of their valence and conduction bands, their experimentally reported power conversion efficiencies remain below 10%, far from the ideal Shockley-Queisser limit of 30%. Using advanced first-principles calculations and defect sampling techniques, we uncover a complex point-defect landscape in MChX materials, exemplified by BiSeI. Previously overlooked selenium vacancies are identified as critical nonradiative charge-recombination centers, which exist in high concentrations and, although exhibit modest capture coefficients, can reduce the maximum power conversion efficiency of BiSeI down to 24%. We argue that such detrimental effects can be mitigated by cation-poor synthesis conditions and strategic anion substitutions. Building on these insights, and supported by further simulations, we predict BiSBr to be a more defect-tolerant light absorber. This study not only identifies efficiency-limiting factors in MChX but also provides a roadmap for their improvement, paving the way for next-generation solution-processed chalcogenide photovoltaics.

Title: Finite-$q$ antiferro and ferri magnetic toroidal order in a distorted kagome structure
Authors: Akimitsu Kirikoshi, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: A highly geometrically frustrated lattice structure such as a distorted kagome (or quasikagome) structure enriches physical phenomena through coupling with the electronic structure, topology, and magnetism. Recently, it has been reported that an intermetallic HoAgGe exhibits two distinct magnetic structures with the finite magnetic vector $q=(1/3,1/3,0)$: One is the partially ordered state in the intermediate-temperature region, and the other is the kagome spin ice state in the lowest-temperature region. We theoretically elucidate that the former is characterized by antiferro magnetic toroidal (MT) ordering, while the latter is characterized by ferri MT ordering based on the multipole representation theory, which provides an opposite interpretation to previous studies. We also show how antiferro MT and ferri MT orderings are microscopically formed by quantifying the magnetic toroidal moment activated in a multiorbital system. As a result, we find that the degree of distortion for the kagome structure plays a significant role in determining the nature of antiferro MT and ferri MT orderings, which brings about the crossover between the antiferro MT and ferri MT orders. We confirm such a tendency by evaluating the linear magnetoelectric effect. Our analysis can be applied irrespective of lattice structures and magnetic vectors without annoying the cluster origin.

Title: Anisotropic dynamic excitations in a two-dimensional Fulde-Ferrell superfluid
Authors: Jinrui Ru, Yanxiang Zhu, Shuning Tan, Huaisong Zhao
Abstract: By calculating the dynamical structure factor of a two-dimensional (2D) Fulde-Ferrell superfluid system, the anisotropic dynamical excitations are studied systematically using random phase approximation (RPA). Our calculation results not only establish the interaction strength and the Zeeman field dependencies of the phase diagram, but also reveal the evolution of the collective modes and the single-particle excitations during the phase transition from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid to the FF superfluid, particularly their competition with each other. The calculation results demonstrate that the optimal combination of two parameters (the interaction strength and Zeeman field) exists for finding an FF superfluid. With the increase of the angle between the transferred momentum and the center-of-mass (COM) momentum, the collective phonon mode exhibits a sharp resonance signature at small angles, which gradually diminishes as it merges into the single-particle excitations, then reappears at large angles. In an FF superfluid, the sound speed along the COM momentum direction increases with the Zeeman field strength while decreases with the interaction strength, displaying contrasting behavior compared to a BCS superfluid whereas the sound speed remains nearly constant. Notably, a remarkable roton-like dispersion emerges along the COM momentum direction while it is absent in the opposite direction. These theoretical predictions provide crucial guidance for the experimental search and study of an FF superfluid.

Title: Electric-field independent spin-orbit coupling gap in hBN-encapsulated bilayer graphene
Authors: Fang-Ming Jing, Zhen-Xiong Shen, Guo-Quan Qin, Wei-Kang Zhang, Ting Lin, Ranran Cai, Zhuo-Zhi Zhang, Gang Cao, Lixin He, Xiang-Xiang Song, Guo-Ping Guo
Abstract: The weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in bilayer graphene (BLG) is essential for encoding spin qubits while bringing technical challenges for extracting the opened small SOC gap {\Delta}_SO in experiments. Moreover, in addition to the intrinsic Kane-Mele term, extrinsic mechanisms also contribute to SOC in BLG, especially under experimental conditions including encapsulation of BLG with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and applying an external out-of-plane electric displacement field D. Although measurements of {\Delta}_SO in hBN-encapsulated BLG have been reported, the relatively large experimental variations and existing experimental controversy make it difficult to fully understand the physical origin of {\Delta}_SO. Here, we report a combined experimental and theoretical study on {\Delta}_SO in hBN-encapsulated BLG. We use an averaging method to extract {\Delta}_SO in gate-defined single quantum dot devices. Under D fields as large as 0.57-0.90 V/nm, {\Delta}_SO=53.4-61.8 {\mu}eV is obtained from two devices. Benchmarked with values reported at lower D field regime, our results support a D field-independent {\Delta}_SO. This behavior is confirmed by our first-principle calculations, based on which {\Delta}_SO is found to be independent of D field, regardless of different hBN/BLG/hBN stacking configurations. Our calculations also suggest a weak proximity effect from hBN, indicating that SOC in hBN-encapsulated BLG is dominated by the intrinsic Kane-Mele mechanism. Our results offer insightful understandings of SOC in BLG, which benefit SOC engineering and spin manipulations in BLG.

Title: Dark Superradiance in Cavity-Coupled Polar Molecular Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Yuqi Wang, Su Yi, Yuangang Deng
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to realize phase transition from {\it dark superradiance} to conventional superradiance in a microwave cavity coupled to polar molecules. The competition between cavity-mediated infinite-range repulsions and finite-range attractive dipolar interactions stabilizes a variety of exotic quantum phases, including vortex, vortex anti-vortex pairs, and superradiant phase, all emerging without external driving fields. In vortex phase associated with {\it dark superradiance}, cavity remains in vacuum state while profoundly reshaping the condensate's ground-state wave functions. In particular, the spin configuration locally parallel but globally anti-parallel is a direct consequence of competing for two nonlocal interactions. Beyond Dicke paradigm, dipolar dressing of condensate enables access to an unexplored regime of repulsion-dominated superradiance. A Bogoliubov analysis of low-energy excitation spectrum confirms that the condensate remains stable, avoiding roton-maxon induced collapse even in strongly dipolar regime.

Title: Higher-order topological corner states and edge states in grid-like frames
Authors: Yimeng Sun, Jiacheng Xing, Li-Hua Shao, Jianxiang Wang
Abstract: Continuum grid-like frames composed of rigidly jointed beams, wherein bending is the predominant deformation mode, are classic subjects of study in the field of structural mechanics. However, their topological dynamical properties have only recently been revealed. As the structural complexity of the frame increases along with the number of beam members arranged in the two-dimensional plane, the vibration modes also increase significantly in number, with frequency ranges of topological states and bulk states overlapped, leading to hybrid mode shapes. Therefore, concise theoretical results are necessary to guide the identification of topological modes in such planar continuum systems with complex spectra. In this work, within an infinitely long frequency spectrum, we obtain analytical expressions for the frequencies of higher-order topological corner states, edge states, and bulk states in kagome frames and square frames, as well as the criteria of existence of these topological states and patterns of their distribution in the spectrum. Additionally, we present the frequency expressions and the existence criterion for topological edge states in quasi-one-dimensional structures such as bridge-like frames, along with an approach to determine the existence of topological edge states based on bulk topological invariants. These theoretical results fully demonstrate that the grid-like frames, despite being a large class of continuum systems with complex spectra, have topological states (including higher-order topological states) that can be accurately characterized through concise analytical expressions. This work contributes to an excellent platform for the study of topological mechanics, and the accurate and concise theoretical results facilitate direct applications of topological grid-like frame structures in industry and engineering.

Abstract: The spectral dependence of the Bragg peak position under conditions of extremely asymmetric diffraction has been analyzed in the kinematical and dynamical approximations of the diffraction theory. Simulations have been performed for the L$_3$ absorption edge of yttrium in a single crystal YFe$_2$ film; they have shown that the magneto optical constants (or, equivalently, the dispersion corrections to the atomic scatter ing factor) for hard X rays can be determined from this dependence. Comparison with the experimental data obtained for a Nb(4 nm)/YFe$_2$(40 nm $\langle 110 \rangle$)/Fe(1.5 nm)/Nb(50 nm)/sapphire sample at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility has been made.

Title: Enhanced Backgate Tunability on Interfacial Carrier Concentration in Ionic Liquid-Gated MoS2 Devices
Authors: Qiao Chen, Chengyu Yan, Changshuai Lan, Qiyang Song, Yi Yan, Shun Wang
Abstract: The periodic spatial modulation potential arising from the zig-zag distribution of ions at large gate voltage in an ionic liquid gated device may enable functionalities in a similar way as nanopatterning and moiré engineering. However, the inherent coupling between periodic modulation potential and carrier concentration in ionic liquid devices has hindered further exploration. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of decoupling manipulation on periodic modulation potential and carrier density in an ionic liquid device by using a conventional backgate. The backgate is found to have a tunability on carrier concentration comparable to that of ionic gating, especially at large ionic liquid gate voltage, by activating the bulk channels mediated back tunneling between the trapped bands and interfacial channel.

Title: The structural effects of (111) growth of La$_2$CoMnO$_6$ on SrTiO$_3$ and LSAT -- new insights from 3D crystallographic characterisation with 4D-STEM and Digital Dark Field imaging
Authors: Ian MacLaren, Andrew T. Fraser, Matthew R. Lipsett
Abstract: The 3-dimensional orientation of La atom modulations has been mapped in two thin films of La$_2$CoMnO$_6$ grown on SrTiO$_3$ and LSAT ([La,Sr,Al,Ta] oxide) using a 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) method based on the recently developed Digital Dark Field method. This images the shifts of diffraction spots and the azimuthal intensity distribution in the First Order Laue Zone, and then uses them to reconstruct and map the 3D crystallography. This clearly shows a flip from out-of-plane modulation with tensile strain on SrTiO3 to in-plane modulation with compressive strain on LSAT. This hitherto unobserved crystallographic change had a significant influence on the out-of-plane lattice parameter which left more room for the full incorporation of the larger CoO6 octahedra on LSAT and therefore explained the improved Mn-Co ordering and better properties for this film. Moreover, the method would be applicable to many other systems of epitaxial growth of complex oxides, revealing crystallographic details of crucial importance to properties which are not visible in conventional atomic resolution imaging.

Title: Graphene Enhanced Resonant Raman Spectroscopy of Gallium Nitride Nanocrystals
Authors: Marek Kostka, Jindřich Mach, Miroslav Bartošík, David Nezval, Martin Konečný, Vojtěch Mikerásek, Linda Supalová, Jakub Piastek, Tomáš Šikola
Abstract: The scattering of lattice excitations (phonons) with the photoexcited charge carriers is of a major concern in optoelectronic devices. Here, the resonant Raman scattering will be utilized to study an exciton-phonon interaction in GaN nanocrystals, further enhanced by the underlying graphene. Raman spectroscopy using various excitation energies shows how the exciton-phonon interaction behaves, unveiling the scattering strength. The origin of the interaction is in the condition of resonance, which is directly observed in the temperature resolved spectra. Most importantly, the underlying graphene strongly enhances the coupling of phonons and excitons. Consequently, an enhanced resonant Raman spectrum of GaN nanocrystals possessing clearly observable phonon overtones up to the 4th order has been obtained. It has been demonstrated that the responsible effect is the electron transfer between nanocrystals and the underlying graphene. The utilization of such an increased coupling effect can be beneficial for a study of the charge carrier scattering in semiconducting nanomaterials, analysis of their crystal quality, improvement of sensor sensitivity and in the subsequent development of new-generation optoelectronic devices.

Title: How ferromagnetic plane drives magnetocrystalline anisotropy in antiferromagnetic CoO and FeO
Authors: Ilya V. Kashin, Alexander S. Iakovlev, Sergei N. Andreev
Abstract: In this study we present a theoretical investigation of the role that ferromagnetic plane (111) plays in the formation of magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) effects in CoO and FeO monoxides. For this purpose, a first-principles calculations of the electronic structure is performed within the GGA$+U$ approach. Based on the low-energy model in the Wannier functions basis, the MCA energy angular profile and the isotropic exchange environment of the transition metal atom are estimated using $\bf{k}$-dependent Green's functions. We have revealed a clear regularity in the direction of the easy and hard axes in both systems as lying in the (111) plane or along [111]. While for CoO the easy / hard axis orientation is (111) / [111], for FeO it appears reversed and thus emphasises the fundamental importance of (111) as the geometrical driver of the magnetism in the crystals. The identification of the contributions that individual sublattices make to the MCA energy allowed us to reveal the decisive role of the electron hopping mechanisms in easy axis orientation. Considering the MCA and exchange environment with orbital decomposition in CoO and FeO under directional pressure in the (111) plane and along [111] showed a direct interrelation between the ferro- and antiferromagnetic contributions to the exchange environment and the energetic stability of the easy axis.

Title: Monitoring charge separation of individual cells in perovskite/silicon tandems via transient surface photovoltage spectroscopy
Authors: Maxim Simmonds, Ke Xu, Steve Albrecht, Lars Korte, Igal Levine
Abstract: Identification of charge carrier separation processes in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells and recombination at buried interfaces of charge selective contacts is crucial for photovoltaic research. Here, intensity- and wavelength- dependent transient surface photovoltage (tr-SPV) is used to investigate slot-die-coated perovskite top layers deposited on n-type Heterojunction Silicon bottom cells. We show that using an appropriate combination of photon energy and/or bottom cell polarity, one can individually probe the buried interfaces of the bottom silicon cell or the perovskite`s buried interfaces of a tandem solar cell: For excitation with higher energy photons, time delays before the onset of a strong SPV signal indicate significant hole minority drift before separation in the silicon bottom cells. Furthermore, symmetric bottom Si heterojunction solar cell stacks can serve to investigate the top perovskite stack including its junction to the bottom cell, unhampered by photovoltages from the silicon substrate. Thus, investigation of the buried interfaces in tandem devices using time-resolved surface photovoltage is found to yield valuable information on charge carrier extraction at buried interfaces and demonstrates its unique potential compared to more conventional approaches that rely on photoluminescence decay kinetics.

Title: Acoustic phonons, spin-phonon coupling and spin relaxation via the lattice reorientation mechanism in hexagonal germanium nanowires
Authors: Baksa Kolok, György Frank, András Pályi
Abstract: Spin relaxation via electron-phonon interaction is an important decoherence mechanism for spin qubits. In this work, we study spin relaxation in hexagonal (2H) germanium, a novel direct-gap semiconductor showing great potential to combine highly coherent spin qubits with optical functionality. Focusing on electrostatically defined quantum dots in hexagonal germanium nanowires, we (i) identify geometries where spin qubit experiments are feasible, (ii) compute the nanowire phonon modes, and (iii) describe spin relaxation of hole spin qubits due to phonon-induced lattice reorientation, a direct spin-phonon coupling mechanism that is absent in cubic semiconductors typically used for spin qubits (GaAs, cubic Si, cubic Ge). We obtain the spin relaxation time as a function of nanowire cross section, quantum dot confinement length, and magnetic field. For realistic parameters, we find relaxation times above 10 ms, and reveal that the magnetic field direction maximizing the relaxation time depends on the qubit Larmor frequency. Our results facilitate the design of nanowire quantum dot experiments with long qubit relaxation times.

Title: Quantum droplets in a beyond-mean-field density-dependent gauge theory
Authors: Matthew Edmonds, Patrik Öhberg
Abstract: The beyond-mean-field corrections appropriate to a bosonic many-body system experiencing a density-dependent gauge potential are derived, and from this the dimensional hierarchy of quantum droplet solutions are explored. Non-stationary quantum droplet solutions are supported by a single interaction parameter characterising the strength of the gauge potential, while in one dimension the beyond-mean-field theory can be solved exactly to yield chiral quantum droplets and dark soliton-like excitations. Numerical simulations of single and pairs of chiral droplets indicate a rich dynamics in the beyond-mean-field regime.

Title: Topological phases of coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires
Authors: Anas Abdelwahab
Abstract: The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires away from the gapless regions.

Title: Multi-site mixing and entropy stabilization of CsPbI$_{3}$ with potential application in photovoltaics
Authors: Namitha Anna Koshi, Krishnamohan Thekkepat, Doh-Kwon Lee, Seung-Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee
Abstract: Metal halide perovskite solar cells have achieved dramatic improvements in their power conversion efficiency in the recent past. Since compositional engineering plays an important role in optimizing material properties, we investigate the effect of alloying at Cs and Pb sites on the energetics and electronic structure of CsPbI$_{3}$ using cluster expansion method in combination with first-principles calculations. For Ge-mixing at Pb-site, the $\alpha$ and $\beta$-phases are considered with emphasis on the electronic structure, transition probability, absorption coefficient, efficiency, and carrier mobility of higher-symmetry configurations. CsPb$_{0.50}$Ge$_{0.50}$I$_{3}$ (Cs$_{2}$PbGeI$_{6}$) which takes up a double perovskite (elpasolite) structure has a direct band gap with no parity-forbidden transitions. Further, we utilize the alloy entropic effect to improve the material stability and optoelectronic properties of CsPbI$_{3}$ by multi-element mixing. For the proposed mixed compositions, the Fr{ö}hlich electron-phonon coupling constant is determined. Scattering rates and electron mobility are obtained from first-principles inputs. These lower Pb-content inorganic perovskites offer great promise as efficient solar cell materials for photovoltaic applications.

Title: Translocation of Active Polymerlike Worms
Authors: Marin Vatin, Rosa Sinaasappel, Renske Kamping, Chantal Valeriani, Emanuele Locatelli, Antoine Deblais
Abstract: Active polymer translocation through confined spaces is a key biological process underlying DNA transport through nuclear pores and actin filament dynamics in cell migration. Here, we use living polymer-like Tubifex tubifex worms as a model system to explore how contour length and activity-modulated via environmental temperature-affect translocation dynamics in confined geometries. Using 3D-printed chambers connected by a narrow bridge, we track worm conformation and motion under confinement. In contrast to passive polymers, contour length has no influence, while activity strongly modulates escape dynamics. At an intermediate temperature of 20°C, an optimal balance between directed propulsion and reorientation-characterized by the Péclet number-maximizes translocation efficiency. Our findings suggest that active filaments achieve optimal exploration of confined spaces at intermediate activity levels. We further validate our results through simulations of tangentially driven polymer models which quantitatively reproduce the experimental findings at ambient temperature.

Title: Dressed basis sets for the modeling of exchange interactions in double quantum dots
Authors: Mauricio J. Rodríguez, Esteban A. Rodríguez-Mena, Ahmad Fouad Kalo, Yann-Michel Niquet
Abstract: We discuss the microscopic modeling of exchange interactions between double semiconductor quantum dots used as spin qubits. Starting from a reference full configuration interaction (CI) calculation for the two-particle wave functions, we build a reduced basis set of dressed states that can describe the ground-state singlets and triplets over the whole operational range with as few as one hundred basis functions (as compared to a few thousands for the full CI). This enables fast explorations of the exchange interactions landscape as well as efficient time-dependent simulations. We apply this methodology to a double hole quantum dot in germanium, and discuss the physics of exchange interactions in this system. We show that the net exchange splitting results from a complex interplay between inter-dot tunneling, Coulomb exchange and correlations. We analyze, moreover, the effects of confinement, strains and Rashba interactions on the anisotropic exchange and singlet-triplet mixings at finite magnetic field. We finally illustrate the relevance of this methodology for time-dependent calculations on a singlet-triplet qubit.

Title: The impact of electrical contacts on the optical properties of a MoS$_{2}$ monolayer
Authors: Agata Zielińska, Mateusz Dyksik, Alessandro Surrente, Jonathan Eroms, Dieter Weiss, Paulina Płochocka, Mariusz Ciorga
Abstract: Achieving high performance in transition-metal-dichalcogenide-based optoelectronic devices is challenging -- the realization of an efficient electrical contacting scheme should not be obtained at the expense of their optical quality. Here we present the optical properties of MoS$_{2}$ monolayers which have been electrically contacted with bismuth and gold. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the samples contacted with both materials is significantly broadened. In the case of the bismuth contacted sample we note an additional, low energy band in the PL spectrum, attributed to a defect state formed during the evaporation of Bi. Comparing the intensity of the excitonic peak and of the defect-related peak, we note that there is a correlation between the type of contacts and the optical properties.

Title: Orientation- and pressure-dependence of the vibrational response of a monolayer crystal on a vicinal diamond surface
Authors: Yi Zhao, Lingxiao Zhao, Chengjiang Du, Ruirui Liu, John A. McGuire, Yanpeng Qi
Abstract: We systematically investigate polarization-dependent Raman spectra of a monolayer crystal of WS2 on the (100) and (230) surfaces of diamond. At ambient pressure, identical polarization dependence of the Raman spectra is observed on the different surfaces, independent of the orientation of the monolayer crystal relative to the diamond crystal. However, when monolayer WS2 is compressed to about 4 GPa, an abrupt drop of the intensity of the 2LA mode relative to the A' mode occurs on the (100) surface and the (230) surface with the zigzag direction along the atomic step edges of the (230) surface. In contrast, no such drop is observed when the armchair direction is along or at 15° to the atomic steps of the (230) surface. We also observe a shift of the polarization angle of the intensity maxima of the 2LA and A' modes on (230) surface during compression. These results demonstrate that the atomic steps of a vicinal surface strongly modify the vibrational response under high pressure.

Title: Valley Polarization and Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in Altermagnet Ti2Se2S with Multipiezo Properties
Authors: Xin Hu, Weihang Zhao, Wenjun Xia, Hanbo Sun, Chao Wu, Yin-Zhong Wu, Ping Li
Abstract: Recently, altermagnets demonstrate numerous newfangle physical phenomena due to their inherent antiferromagnetic coupling and spontaneous spin splitting, that are anticipated to enable innovative spintronic devices. However, the rare two-dimensional altermagnets have been reported, making it difficult to meet the requirements for high-performance spintronic devices on account of the growth big data. Here, we predict a stable monolayer Ti2Se2S with out-of-plane altermagnetic ground state and giant valley splitting. The electronic properties of altermagnet Ti2Se2S are highly dependent on the onsite electron correlation. Through symmetry analysis, we find that the valleys of X and Y points are protected by the mirror Mxy symmetry rather than the time-reversal symmetry. Therefore, the multipiezo effect, including piezovalley and piezomagnetism, can be induced by the uniaxial strain. The total valley splitting of monolayer Ti2Se2S can be as high as ~500 meV. Most interestingly, the direction of valley polarization can be effectively tuned by the uniaxial strain, based on this, we have defined logical "0", "+1", and "-1" states for data transmission and storage. In addition, we have designed a schematic diagram for observing the anomalous Hall effect in experimentally. Our findings have enriched the candidate materials of two-dimensional altermagnet for the ultra-fast and low power consumption device applications.

Title: Anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnetic RGaGe (R = Nd, Gd) single crystals
Authors: Weizheng Cao, Yuze Xu, Yi Liao, Cuiying Pei, Juefei Wu, Qi Wang, Yanpeng Qi
Abstract: Recently, the non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetallic candidate family RTX (R = rare-earth element, T= poor metal, X = Si and Ge) has recently attracted significant attention due to its exotic quantum states and potential applications in quantum devices. In this study, our comprehensive investigations of high-quality NdGaGe and GdGaGe single crystals reveal distinct magnetic and electrical responses. Both compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic transitions with TN - 7.6 K and 22.4 K for NdGaGe and GdGaGe, respectively. NdGaGe exhibits strong magnetic anisotropy (\c{hi}c /\c{hi}a - 70). In contrast, GdGaGe displays weak magnetic anisotropic behavior (\c{hi}c /\c{hi}a - 1) with a distinctive spin-flop transition. Below TN, NdGaGe shows significant negative magnetoresistance due to the reduced spin-disorder scattering arising from the field-induced spin alignment. GdGaGe exhibits more complex magnetoresistance behavior: positive values at low fields transitioning to negative values attributed to the reduced spin-flop scattering. Specially, NdGaGe demonstrates a large anomalous Hall conductance (AHC) of approximately 368 {\Omega}-1 cm-1, which is dominated by the intrinsic mechanism. These reveal the pivotal role of rare-earth elements in modulating the electronic structure, magnetic properties, and transport characteristics of the RGaGe system, thereby providing valuable insights for developing next-generation spintronic devices.

Title: Computational search for materials having a giant anomalous Hall effect in the pyrochlore and spinel crystal structures
Authors: Sean Sullivan, Seungjun Lee, Nathan J. Szymanski, Amil Merchant, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, Tony Low, Christopher J. Bartel
Abstract: Ferromagnetic pyrochlore and spinel materials with topological flat bands are of interest for their potential to exhibit a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE). In this work, we present computational predictions of stability and electronic structure for 448 compositions within the pyrochlore (A2B2O7) and spinel (AB2O4) frameworks. Of these, 92 are predicted to be thermodynamically stable or close (< 100 meV/atom) to the convex hull, with trends deviating from expectations based on ionic radius-ratio rules. Among these 92 materials, 13 are predicted to adopt a ferromagnetic ground state at 0 K. Two additional materials meeting these criteria were also identified from open materials databases. Calculations of anomalous Hall angles (AHA) and conductivities reveal that 11 out of these 15 materials are promising candidates for spintronic applications requiring high electronic conductivity and a giant AHE. Our results suggest that the AHA can be further enhanced by tuning the Fermi level, for example through chemical doping. Using this approach, we identify five materials whose AHA may exceed 0.2. Notably, In2Ir2O7 exhibits an exceptionally high AHA of 0.728 when its Fermi level is optimized. These findings provide a roadmap for the targeted synthesis of new pyrochlore and spinel compounds with enhanced AHE properties. They also broaden the compositional design space for these structures and support the discovery of high-performance materials for next-generation spintronic applications.

Title: The possible frustrated superconductivity in the kagome superconductors
Authors: Hong-Min Jiang, Wen-Qian Dong, Shun-Li Yu, Z. D. Wang
Abstract: Geometric frustration has long been a subject of enduring interest in condensed matter physics. While geometric frustration traditionally focuses on magnetic systems, little attention is paid to the "frustrated superconductivity" which could arise when the superconducting interaction conflicts with the crystal symmetry. The recently discovered kagome superconductors provide a particular opportunity for studying this due to the fact that the frustrated lattice structure and the interference effect between the three sublattices can facilitate the frustrated superconducting interaction. Here, we propose a theory that supports the frustrated superconducting state, derived from the on-site $s$-wave superconducting pairing in conjunction with the nearest-neighbor pairings hoping and the unique geometrical frustrated lattice structure. In this state, whereas the mutual $2\pi/3$ difference of the superconducting pairing phase causes the six-fold modulation of the amplitude and breaks the time-reversal symmetry with $4\pi$ phase changes of the superconducting pairing as one following it around the Fermi surface, it is immune to the impurities without the impurity-induced in-gap states and produces the pronounced Hebel-Slichter peak of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate below $T_{c}$. Notably, the theory also reveals a disorder-induced superconducting pairing transition from the frustrated superconducting state to an isotropic $s$-wave superconducting state without traversing the nodal points, recovering and explaining the behavior found in experiment. This study not only serves as a promising proposal to mediate the divergent or seemingly contradictory experimental outcomes regarding superconducting pairing symmetry, but may also pave the way for advancing investigations into the frustrated superconducting state.

Title: Coupled-wire Construction of a Non-crystalline Fractional Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Justin Schirmann, Peru d'Ornellas, Adolfo G. Grushin
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, has been realised in two-dimensional strongly correlated quantum gases and Chern bands of crystals. Here we construct a non-crystalline analogue by coupling quantum wires that are not periodically placed in real-space. Remarkably, the model remains solvable using bosonisation techniques. Due to the non-uniform couplings between the wires, the ground state has different degeneracy compared to the crystalline case. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), anyons confined to hop between two wires (s-lineons), and anyonic excitations that are free to travel across the system. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires. By providing an analytically solvable model of a non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effect, our work showcases that topological order can display richer phenomenology beyond crystals. More broadly, the non-uniform wire construction we develop can serve as a tool to explore richer many-body phenomenology in non-crystalline systems.

Title: More is less in unpercolated active solids
Authors: Jack Binysh, Guido Baardink, Jonas Veenstra, Corentin Coulais, Anton Souslov
Abstract: A remarkable feat of active matter physics is that systems as diverse as collections of self-propelled particles, nematics mixed with molecular motors, and interacting robots can all be described by symmetry-based continuum theories. These descriptions rely on reducing complex effects of individual motors to a few key active parameters, which increase with activity. Here we discover a striking anomaly in the continuum description of non-reciprocal active solids, a ubiquitous class of active materials. We find that as microscopic activity increases, macroscale active response can vanish: more is less. In this highly active regime, non-affine and localized modes prevail and destroy the large-scale signature of microscopic activity. These modes exist in any dilute periodic structure and emerge in random lattices below a percolation transition. Our results unveil a counterintuitive facet of active matter, offering new principles for engineering materials far from equilibrium.

Title: Anisotropic Piezomagnetism in Noncollinear Antiferromagnets
Authors: Vu Thi Ngoc Huyen, Yuki Yanagi, Michi-To Suzuki
Abstract: In 3d-electron magnetic systems, the magnetic structures that transform each other by spin rotation have very close degenerate energies due to small spin-orbit coupling and can be easily controlled by chemical substitution and external magnetic fields. We investigate anisotropic piezomagnetic effects, exhibiting the different magnetic responses depending on the type of strain and the magnetic structures, for non-collinear magnetic states in Mn$_3A$N ($A=$ Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga) and Mn$_3X$ ($X$= Sn and Ge) based on detailed symmetry analysis using spin group and magnetic group and first-principles calculations of piezomagnetic responses. In Mn$_3A$N, magnetization develops along two distinct directions under the same applied stress, corresponding to two AFM states connected by spin rotation. Analysis of the piezomagnetic tensor based on magnetic and spin point groups for the states with and without spin-orbit coupling, respectively, shows that the difference in the magnitude of magnetization along different directions is attributed to the spin-orbit coupling. Mn$_3X$ are known to stabilize different AFM structures in the directions of the applied in-plane magnetic fields. Under uniaxial stress along the orthorhombic $x$ and $y$ axes, magnetization is induced without breaking the magnetic symmetry, but it develops in the opposite direction due to exchange interaction. Our study demonstrates that the direction and sign of strain-induced magnetization in Mn$_3A$N and Mn$_3X$ can be effectively controlled by strain in combination with magnetic fields. These findings highlight the potential for strain-tunable magnetic devices in noncollinear AFMs.

Title: Ab initio modeling of TWIP and TRIP effects in $β$-Ti alloys
Authors: David Holec, Johann Grillitsch, Jose L. Neves, David Obersteiner, Thomas Klein
Abstract: Transformations in bcc-$\beta$, hcp-$\alpha$, and the $\omega$ phases of Ti alloys are studied using Density Functional Theory for pure Ti and Ti alloyed with Al, Si, V, Cr, Fe, Cu, Nb, Mo, and Sn. The $\beta$-stabilization caused by alloying Si, Fe, Cr, and Mo was observed, but the most stable phase appears between the $\beta$ and the $\alpha$ phases, corresponding to the martensitic $\alpha''$ phase. Next, the $\{112\}\langle11\bar1\rangle$ bcc twins are separated by a positive barrier, which further increases by alloying w.r.t. pure Ti. The $\{332\}\langle11\bar3\rangle$ twinning yields negative barriers for all species but Mo and Fe. This is because the transition state is structurally similar to the $\alpha$ phase, which is preferred over the $\beta$ phase for the majority of alloying elements. Lastly, the impact of alloying on twin boundary energies is discussed. These results may serve as design guidelines for novel Ti-based alloys with specific application areas.

Title: Bridging the Gap Between Avalanche Relaxation and Yielding Rheology
Authors: Leonardo Relmucao-Leiva, Carlos Villarroel, Gustavo Düring
Abstract: The yielding transition in amorphous materials, whether driven passively (simple shear) or actively, remains a fundamental open question in soft matter physics. While avalanche statistics at the critical point have been extensively studied, the emergence of the dynamic regime at yielding and the steady-state flow properties remain poorly understood. In particular, the significant variability observed in flow curves across different systems lacks a clear explanation. We introduce the Controlled Relaxation Time Model (CRTM), a novel simulation framework that treats relaxation time as a tunable parameter, seamlessly bridging quasistatic avalanche statistics and dynamic flow regimes. CRTM reproduces known results in both limits and enables direct analysis of the transition between them, providing precise measurements of avalanche relaxation times. Applying CRTM to different microscopic dynamics, we find that a previously proposed scaling relation connecting critical exponents holds for passive systems. However, active systems exhibit significant deviations, suggesting a missing ingredient in the current understanding of active yielding.

Title: Analytic solution for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles to large amplitude oscillatory fields
Authors: Patrick Ilg
Abstract: Nonlinear responses of physical systems to strong perturbations are notoriously difficult to tackle analytically. Here, we present analytic results for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles to large amplitude oscillatory magnetic fields based on a particular model for the magnetization dynamics. A number of characteristic features of the in-phase and out-of-phase higher-harmonic response are found and analyzed. In particular we find that the magnitude of higher harmonic contributions Rn depends on the field amplitude and frequency only via a single scaling variable that combines the two quantities. The decrease of |Rn|with increasing order nof harmonics is a key quantity monitored in biomedical applications such as magnetic particle spectroscopy and magnetic particle imaging. Except for the first few harmonics, we find that this decrease is exponential with a rate that depends on the scaling variable only. For not too high frequencies and not loo large amplitudes, we find that these exact results for one particular model of magnetization dynamics hold approximately also for other, more frequently used models. Our results therefore offer not only deeper insight into strongly nonlinear responses of magnetic nanoparticles, especially for higher harmonics that are very difficult to determine numerically, but also suggest analyzing data in terms of a scaling variable.

Title: Interface phonon modes governing the ideal limit of thermal transport across diamond/cubic boron nitride interfaces
Authors: Xiaonan Wang, Xin Wu, Penghua Ying, Zheyong Fan, Huarui Sun
Abstract: Understanding the ideal limit of interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) across semiconductor heterointerfaces is crucial for optimizing heat dissipation in practical applications. By employing a highly accurate and efficient machine-learned potential trained herein, we perform extensive non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the ITC of diamond/cubic boron nitride ($c$BN) interfaces. The ideal diamond/$c$BN interface exhibits an unprecedented ITC of 11.0 $\pm$ 0.1 GW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, setting a new upper bound for heterostructure interfaces. This exceptional conductance originates from extended phonon modes due to acoustic matching and localized C-atom modes that propagate through B-C bonds. However, atomic diffusion across the ideal interface creates mixing layers that disrupt these characteristic phonon modes, substantially suppressing the thermal transport from its ideal limit. Our findings reveal how interface phonon modes govern thermal transport across diamond/$c$BN interfaces, providing insights for thermal management in semiconductor devices.

Title: Nature of the 1/3 Magnetization Plateau in Spin-1/2 Kagome Antiferromagnets
Authors: Li-Wei He, Xinzhe Wang, Shun-Li Yu, Jian-Xin Li
Abstract: We investigate the origin of the 1/3 magnetization plateau in the $S=1/2$ kagome antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model using the variational Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization methods, to account for the recent experimental observations in YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6+x}$Br$_{3-x}$ and YCu$_3$(OD)$_{6+x}$Br$_{3-x}$. We identify three degenerate valence-bond-solid (VBS) states forming a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ unit cell. These states exhibit David-star patterns in the spin moment distribution with only two fractional values $-1/3$ and $2/3$, and are related through translational transformations. While the spin correlations in these VBS states are found to be short-range, resembling a quantum spin liquid, we show that they have a vanishing topological entanglement entropy and thus are topologically trivial many-body states. Our theoretical results provide strong evidence that the 1/3 magnetization plateau observed in recent experiments arises from these $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ VBS states with fractional spin moments.

Title: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy of materials under high pressure in a diamond anvil cell
Authors: Tim Suter, Zia Macdermid, Zekai Chen, Steven Lee Johnson, Elsa Abreu
Abstract: We present the combination of a broadband terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system (0.1 - 8 THz), a diamond anvil cell capable of generating high pressure conditions of up to 10 GPa and a cryostat reaching temperatures as low as 10 K. This combination allows us to perform equilibrium and time-resolved THz spectroscopy measurements of a sample while continuously tuning its temperature and pressure conditions. In this work, the procedures and characterizations necessary to carry out such experiments in a tabletop setup are presented. Due to the large modifications of the terahertz beam as it goes through the diamond anvil cell (DAC), standard terahertz time-domain spectroscopy analysis procedures are no longer applicable. New methods to extract the pressure dependent material parameters are presented, both for samples homogeneously filling the DAC sample chamber as well as for bulk samples embedded in pressure media. Different pressure media are tested and evaluated using these new methods, and the obtained material parameters are compared to literature values. Time resolved measurements under pressure are demonstrated using an optical pump - THz probe scheme.

Title: Comment on "Superconductivity and Mott Physics in Organic Charge Transfer Materials"
Authors: Rupali Jindal, Sumit Mazumdar, R. Torsten Clay
Abstract: Menke et al. recently claimed that superconductivity (SC) in the $\kappa$-phase organic charge-transfer solids (CTS) can be understood within the two-dimensional half-filled anisotropic triangular-lattice Hubbard model. Experimentally, $\kappa$-CTS are mostly but not always antiferromagnetic (AFM) at ambient pressure and SC appears under pressure. In apparent agreement with this observation, Menke et al. found AFM ground states for small $t/U$ and SC over a small region at the interface of AFM and Fermi liquid ground states with increasing $t/U$ at fixed $t'/t$, where $U$ is the Hubbard repulsion. Menke et al's computational results directly contradict those obtained using exact diagonalization and Path Integral Renormalization Group approaches. It is clearly of interest to determine the origin of this discrepancy, especially in view of the facts that (a) related arguments continue to persist in the context of cuprate SC superconductivity (which however involves doping), and (b) there exist CTS in which SC is not proximate to AFM, but is separated by an intermediate charge-disproportionated phase. Here we show that Menke et al's conclusion regarding SC is incorrect and originates from a flawed assumption.

Title: Hall Angle of a Spatially Random Vector Model
Authors: Yi-Li Wang, Young-Kwon Han, Xian-Hui Ge, Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We investigate the physics of the spatially random coupling between a Fermi surface and a vector bosonic field in the presence of the magnetic field. We evaluated the propagators of the fermion and vector as well as the self energy and polarization and their dependence on the magnetic field. We also evaluated the temperature dependence of the Hall angle, no strange-metal behaviour is obtained, but the linear-$T$ resistivity is preserved under the magnetic field.

Title: Equivalence of effective actions
Authors: Kevin Falls
Abstract: For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge.

Title: Efficient witnessing and testing of magic in mixed quantum states
Authors: Tobias Haug, Poetri Sonya Tarabunga
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a crucial resource for quantum computers which can be distilled from noisy quantum states. However, determining the magic of mixed quantum has been a notoriously difficult task. Here, we provide efficient witnesses of magic based on the stabilizer Rényi entropy which robustly indicate the presence of magic and quantitatively estimate magic monotones. We also design efficient property testing algorithms to reliably distinguish states with high and low magic, assuming the entropy is bounded. We apply our methods to certify the number of noisy T-gates under a wide class of noise models. Additionally, using the IonQ quantum computer, we experimentally verify the magic of noisy random quantum circuits. Surprisingly, we find that magic is highly robust, persisting even under exponentially strong noise. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, revealing that subsystems of many-body quantum states can contain extensive magic despite entanglement. Finally, our work also has direct implications for cryptography and pseudomagic: To mimic high magic states with as little magic as possible, one requires an extensive amount of entropy. This implies that entropy is a necessary resource to hide magic from eavesdroppers. Our work uncovers powerful tools to verify and study the complexity of noisy quantum systems.

Title: Preparing the Gutzwiller wave function for attractive SU(3) fermions on a quantum computer
Authors: Han Xu, Kazuhiro Seki, Seiji Yunoki
Abstract: We implement the Gutzwiller wave function for attractive SU(3) fermion systems on a quantum computer using a quantum-classical hybrid scheme based on the discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. In this approach, the nonunitary Gutzwiller operator is decomposed into a linear combination of unitaries constructed from two-qubit fermionic Givens rotation gates, whose rotation angles are dictated by the auxiliary fields. We develop and reformulate two complementary methods to perform the sum over these auxiliary fields. In the first method, the Gutzwiller wave function is probabilistically prepared on the register qubits by projectively postselecting the desired state via measurements of ancilla qubits. We analyze the success rate both analytically and numerically as a function of the Gutzwiller variational parameter $g$ for the Fermi-sea and BCS-like trial states at half filling. The success rate is found to decay exponentially for small $|g|$, but remains finite in the $|g|\to\infty$ limit, with increasing $|g|$. In the second method, we employ importance sampling to address the Gutzwiller variational problem, where the central objective is to estimate the expectation values of observables. We demonstrate the proposed scheme by calculating the energy and triple occupancy of the attractive SU(3) Hubbard model in the framework of digital quantum simulation. Moreover, we present experimental results obtained on a trapped-ion quantum computer for the two-site attractive SU(3) Hubbard model, showing good agreement with exact values within statistical errors.

Title: Incoherent population trapping in quantum emitters
Authors: Sergei Lepeshov, Søren Stobbe
Abstract: Deterministic emitters transform electronic excitations to photons with unity efficiency. Their development is crucial for both energy-efficient optical interconnects and photonic quantum technologies, but neither rigorous theoretical frameworks nor systematic experimental methods governing deterministic emitters and their identification were so far available. A central -- and seemingly obvious -- assumption underpinning previous works is that the radiative emission probability is proportional to the internal quantum efficiency. Here, we introduce a stochastic model of the decay dynamics in quantum emitters that disproves this assumption and provides a systematic framework for the development of deterministic quantum light sources. Our model agrees with a wide range of experimental findings, including time-resolved spectroscopy, autocorrelation measurements, and saturation spectroscopy, and it also explains a number of hitherto unexplained experiments. For example, our model shows that above-band continuous-wave excitation selects the exciton transitions with the lowest quantum efficiency, which is of direct importance for photonic quantum technologies relying on aligning nanostructures to emitters. We show that the underlying physics is governed by incoherent trapping of the population in metastable states, which has profound consequences for the physics of quantum emitters. Finally, we provide a straightforward experimental protocol for obtaining deterministic emitters.

Title: Spin decoherence in molecular crystals: nuclear v.s. electronic spin baths
Authors: Conor Ryan, Valerio Briganti, Cathal Hogan, Mark O'Neill, Alessandro Lunghi
Abstract: The loss of information about the relative phase between two quantum states, known as decoherence, strongly limits resolution in electron paramagnetic spectroscopy and hampers the use of molecules for quantum information processing. At low temperatures, the decoherence of an electronic molecular spin can be driven by its interaction with either other electron spins or nuclear spins. Many experimental techniques have been used to prolong the coherence time of molecular qubits, but these efforts have been hampered by the uncertainty about which of the two mechanisms is effectively limiting coherence in different experimental conditions. Here, we use the Cluster-Correlation Expansion (CCE) to simulate the decoherence of two prototypical molecular qubits and quantitatively demonstrate that nuclear spins become the leading source of decoherence only when the electron spin concentration is below 1 mM. Moreover, we show that deuterated samples, much easier to achieve than fully spin-free environments, could achieve record coherence times of 0.1 ms for an electron spin concentration of 0.1 mM. Alternatively, hydrogen-rich molecular crystals with electron spins concentration below 1 mM can still achieve coherence times of 10 ms through dynamical decoupling, showing that the potential of molecular spins for quantum technologies is still untapped.

Title: Large time cumulants of the KPZ equation on an interval
Authors: Guillaume Barraquand, Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation on the interval $[0,L]$ with Neumann type boundary conditions and boundary parameters $u,v$. We show that the $k$-th order cumulant of the height behaves as $c_k(L,u,v)\, t$ in the large time limit $t \to +\infty$, and we compute the coefficients $c_k(L,u,v)$. We obtain an expression for the upper tail large deviation function of the height. We also consider the limit of large $L$, with $u=\tilde u/\sqrt{L}$, $u=\tilde v/\sqrt{L}$, which should give the same quantities for the two parameter family $(\tilde u, \tilde v)$ KPZ fixed point on the interval. We employ two complementary methods. On the one hand we adapt to the interval the replica Bethe ansatz method pioneered by Brunet and Derrida for the periodic case. On the other hand, we perform a scaling limit using previous results available for the open ASEP. The latter method allows to express the cumulants of the KPZ equation in terms a functional equation involving an integral operator.

Title: Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics
Authors: Oliver Lunt, Thomas Kriecherbauer, Kenneth T-R McLaughlin, Curt von Keyserlingk
Abstract: The memory function description of quantum operator dynamics involves a carefully chosen split into 'fast' and 'slow' modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. One common approach is to form a Krylov operator basis $\{O_m \}_{m\ge 0}$, and then approximate the dynamics restricted to the 'fast space' $\{O_m \}_{m\ge n}$ for $n\gg 1$. Denoting the fast space Green's function by $G_n (z)$, in this work we prove that $G_n (z)$ exhibits universality in the $n \to \infty$ limit, approaching different universal scaling forms in different regions of the complex $z$-plane. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT). At finite $z$, we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, the same as the average bulk resolvent for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. When $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application we give a new numerical method, the spectral bootstrap, for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof is complex analytic in nature, involving a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. This proof technique assumes some regularity conditions on the spectral function, and we comment on their possible connections to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We are led via steepest-descent to a related Coulomb gas ensemble, and we discuss how a recent conjecture -- the 'Operator Growth Hypothesis' -- is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. We then explain the implications of this criticality for the computational resources required to estimate transport coefficients.

Title: Predicting sampling advantage of stochastic Ising Machines for Quantum Simulations
Authors: Rutger J.L.F. Berns, Davi R. Rodrigues, Giovanni Finocchio, Johan H. Mentink
Abstract: Stochastic Ising machines, sIMs, are highly promising accelerators for optimization and sampling of computational problems that can be formulated as an Ising model. Here we investigate the computational advantage of sIM for simulations of quantum magnets with neural-network quantum states (NQS), in which the quantum many-body wave function is mapped onto an Ising model. We study the sampling performance of sIM for NQS by comparing sampling on a software-emulated sIM with standard Metropolis-Hastings sampling for NQS. We quantify the sampling efficiency by the number of steps required to reach iso-accurate stochastic estimation of the variational energy and show that this is entirely determined by the autocorrelation time of the sampling. This enables predications of sampling advantage without direct deployment on hardware. For the quantum Heisenberg models studied and experimental results on the runtime of sIMs, we project a possible speed-up of 100 to 10000, suggesting great opportunities for studying complex quantum systems at larger scales.

Title: Amending CALPHAD databases using a neural network for predicting mixing enthalpy of liquids
Authors: Clement Vincelya, Amin Sakic, Vedant Dave, Erwin Povoden-Karadeniz, Elmar Rueckert, Ronald Schnitzer, David Holec
Abstract: In order to establish the thermodynamic stability of a system, knowledge of its Gibbs free energy is essential. Most often, the Gibbs free energy is predicted within the CALPHAD framework using models employing thermodynamic properties, such as the mixing enthalpy, heat capacity, and activity coefficients. Here, we present a deep-learning approach capable of predicting the mixing enthalpy of liquid phases of binary systems that were not present in the training dataset. Therefore, our model allows for a system-informed enhancement of the thermodynamic description to unknown binary systems based on information present in the available thermodynamic assessment. Thereby, significant experimental efforts in assessing new systems can be spared. We use an open database for steels containing 91 binary systems to generate our initial training (and validation) and amend it with several direct experimental reports. The model is thoroughly tested using different strategies, including a test of its predictive capabilities. The model shows excellent predictive capabilities outside of the training dataset as soon as some data containing species of the predicted system is included in the training dataset. The estimated uncertainty of the model is below 1 kJ/mol for the predicted mixing enthalpy. Subsequently, we used our model to predict the enthalpy of mixing of all binary systems not present in the original database and extracted the Redlich-Kister parameters, which can be readily reintegrated into the thermodynamic database file.

Title: Tailoring hBN's Phonon Polaritons with the Plasmonic Phase-Change Material In3SbTe2
Authors: Lina Jäckering, Aaron Moos, Lukas Conrads, Yiheng Li, Alexander Rothstein, Dominique Malik, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Matthias Wuttig, Christoph Stampfer, Thomas Taubner
Abstract: Polaritons in van-der-Waals materials (vdWM) promise high confinement and multiple tailoring options by optical structures, e.g., resonators, launching structures and lenses. These optical structures are conventionally fabricated using cumbersome multi-process lithography techniques. In contrast, phase-change materials (PCMs) offer fast and reconfigurable programming of optical structures. PCMs can reversibly be switched between two stable phases with distinct permittivities by local heating, e.g., by optical laser pulses. While the well-known dielectric PCM GeSbTe-alloys feature only a permittivity change, the PCM In3SbTe2 can be switched between a dielectric and metallic phase. This makes In3SbTe2 promising for programming metallic launching structures. Here, we demonstrate direct optical programming and thereby rapid prototyping of optical launching structures in In3SbTe2 to tailor and confine polaritons in vdWM. We combine the vdWM hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with In3SbTe2 and optically program circular resonators for hBN's phonon polaritons through hBN into In3SbTe2. We investigate the polariton resonators with near-field optical microscopy. Demonstrating the reconfigurability, we decrease the resonator diameter to increase the polariton confinement. Finally, we fabricate focusing structures for hBN's phonon polaritons whose focal point is changed in a second post-processing step. We promote In3SbTe2 as a versatile platform for rapid prototyping of polariton optics in vdWM.

Title: PT-symmetry breaking phase transitions in an LMG dimer
Authors: Simon Kothe, Peter Kirton
Abstract: The open Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model provides a prototype of a dissipative phase transition which can be analyzed using mean-field theory. By combining the physics of this model with those of a quantum analogue of a parity-time reversal symmetry breaking transition we analyze the steady states phase diagram of a pair of coupled LMG models. The interplay of these two distinct physical effects leads to a complex phase diagram with multiple different types of steady state. We show that the effects predicted from mean-field theory survive in the full quantum model.

Title: Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional
Authors: Sanjeev Raja, Martin Šípka, Michael Psenka, Tobias Kreiman, Michal Pavelka, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan
Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.

Title: Automating Nanoindentation: Optimizing Workflows for Precision and Accuracy
Authors: Vivek Chawla, Dayakar Penumadu, Sergei Kalinin
Abstract: Nanoindentation is vital for probing mechanical properties, yet traditional grid-based workflows are inefficient for targeting specific microstructural features. We present an automated nanoindentation framework that integrates machine learning, real-time alignment, and adaptive indentation strategies. The system operates in three modes: standard automation, feature-based indentation via image-to-coordinate mapping, and large-scale indentation with full x, y, and z axis alignment. A key challenge (precise sample positioning across imaging and indentation stages) was met by correcting initial travel-distance errors (2.5-6 micrometres) through pixel-to-micron calibration, reducing alignment errors to the submicron level. Benchmark tests demonstrate phase-specific and orientation-guided indentation enabled by self-organising maps and macro imaging. The framework markedly improves precision, minimises user intervention, and enables efficient, targeted characterisation of complex materials. By providing a direct interface between nanoindentation instruments and Python-based automation frameworks, it can be adopted on most existing platforms. This work lays the foundation for next-generation autonomous mechanical testing tailored to microstructurally complex materials.

Title: Topological defect formation in a phase transition with tunable order
Authors: Fumika Suzuki, Wojciech H. Zurek
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the non-equilibrium dynamics and topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.

Title: Biorealistic Response in Optoelectrically-Driven Flexible Halide-Perovskite Single-Crystal Memristors

Abstract: The transition to smart wearable and flexible optoelectronic devices communicating with each other and performing neuromorphic computing at the edge is a big goal in next-generation optoelectronics. These devices should perform their regular tasks supported by energy-efficient in-memory calculations. Here, we study the response of the CsPbBr$_3$ halide-perovskite single crystal fabricated on the flexible polymer substrate and integrated with the single-walled carbon nanotube thin film electrodes in a lateral geometry. We show both photodetection functions combined with the synaptic functionality in our device under the application of hybrid optoelectrical stimuli. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our device exhibits frequency-dependent bidirectional modification of synaptic weight with a sliding threshold similar to biologically plausible Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro learning. The demonstrated optoelectronic synaptic behavior in halide-perovskite single-crystals opens the opportunity for the development of hybrid organic-inorganic artificial visual systems.

Title: Magnetoelectric effect in superconductors with d-wave magnetization
Authors: Alexander A. Zyuzin
Abstract: We report on a study of the interplay between the supercurrent and spin-polarization in a two-dimensional superconducting system in the presence of a d-wave symmetric antiferromagnetic exchange interaction (altermagnetism). It is demonstrated that the supercurrent exhibits a transverse contribution in the presence of both constant and momentum-dependent exchange interactions. We also discuss the analog of the Edelstein effect for such magnetic material, showing that the induced spin polarization is quadratic in the supercurrent and d-wave symmetric.

Title: Disorder Enhanced Thermalization in Interacting Many-Particle System
Authors: Chakradhar Rangi, Herbert F Fotso, Hanna Terletska, Juana Moreno, Ka-Ming Tam
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory to incorporate the effects of static random disorder in the dynamics of a many-particle system by integrating out different disorder configurations resulting in an effective time-dependent density-density interaction. We use this method to study the non-equilibrium transient dynamics of a system described by the Fermi Anderson-Hubbard model following an interaction and disorder quench. The method recovers the solution of the disorder-free case for which the system exhibits qualitatively distinct dynamical behaviors in the weak-coupling (prethermalization) and strong-coupling regimes (collapse-and-revival oscillations). However, we find that weak random disorder promotes thermalization. In the weak coupling regime, the jump in the quasiparticle weight in the prethermal regime is suppressed by random disorder while in the strong-coupling regime, random disorder reduces the amplitude of the quasiparticle weight oscillations. These results highlight the importance of disorder in the dynamics of realistic many-particle systems.

Title: How to accurately measure the mobility and viscosity of two-dimensional carriers?
Authors: M.V.Cheremisin, M.A. Zudov
Abstract: Two different methods of \emph{metrological} accuracy are proposed to determine the mobility and viscosity of ultra clean two-dimensional electron liquids. The experimental data analysis is based on the Gurzhi hydrodynamic model under no-slip boundary conditions without preliminary assumptions about carrier scattering times. The applicability of no-slip boundary conditions has been proven. A Hall bar with several conducting channels of different widths in a zero magnetic field and a sample with a single channel in a perpendicular field are considered. In both cases, it was possible to accurately isolate the ohmic part of the total measured resistance and, then find the exact mobility and viscosity of the charge liquid. The extracted e-e scattering time is extremely close to that obtained by other experimental group for transport measurements of superballistic point contact. At low temperatures the e-e scattering time demonstrates a stronger dependence compare to $1/T^{2}$ behavior predicted by Fermi liquid theory. We propose both methods as powerful tools for viscometry and finding the mobility of two-dimensional systems.

Title: Spin dynamics in itinerant antiferromagnet SrCr$_2$As$_2$
Authors: Zhenhua Ning, Pinaki Das, Y. Lee, N. S. Sangeetha, Douglas L. Abernathy, D. C. Johnston, R. J. McQueeney, D. Vaknin, Liqin Ke
Abstract: SrCr$_2$As$_2$ is an itinerant antiferromagnet in the same structural family as the SrFe$_2$As$_2$ high-temperature superconductors. We report our calculations of exchange-coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ for SrCr$_2$As$_2$ using a static linear-response method based on first-principles electronic-structure calculations. We find that the dominant nearest-neighbor exchange coupling $J_{\rm{1}} > 0$ is antiferromagnetic whereas the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_{\rm{2}} < 0$ is ferromagnetic with $J_{\rm{2}}$/$J_{\rm{1}}$~=~$-0.68$, reinforcing the checkerboard in-plane magnetic structure. Thus, unlike other transition-metal arsenides based on Mn, Fe, or Co, we find no competing magnetic interactions in SrCr$_2$As$_2$, which aligns with experimental findings. Moreover, the orbital resolution of exchange interactions shows that $J_1$ and $J_2$ are dominated by direct exchange mediated by the Cr $d$ orbitals. To validate the calculations we conduct inelastic neutron-scattering measurements on powder samples that show steeply dispersive magnetic excitations arising from the magnetic $\Gamma$ points and persisting up to energies of at least 175 meV. The spin-wave spectra are then modeled using the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with the theoretically-calculated exchange couplings. The calculated neutron-scattering spectra are in good agreement with the experimental data.

Title: Vortices in the Many-Body Excited States of Interacting Bosons in Two Dimension
Authors: Mateusz Ślusarczyk, Krzysztof Pawłowski
Abstract: Quantum vortices play an important role in the physics of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems, though they usually are understood in the single-particle framework like the mean-field approach. Inspired by the study on the relations between solitons and yrast states, we investigate here the emergence of vortices from the eigenstates of a N -body Hamiltonian of interacting particles trapped in a disk. We analyse states that appear by consecutively measuring the positions of particles. These states have densities, phases, and energies closely resembling mean-field vortices. We discuss similarities, but also point out purely many-body features, such as vortex smearing due to the quantum fluctuation of their center. The ab initio analysis of the many-body system, and mean-field approaches are supported by the analysis within the Bogoliubov approach.

Title: Skyrmion crystal phase on a magnetic domain wall in chiral magnets
Authors: Yuki Amari, Muneto Nitta
Abstract: We study a magnetic domain wall in the ferromagnetic phase in chiral magnets in two dimensions with an in-plane easy-axis anisotropy and an out-of-plane Zeeman magnetic field, and find a chiral soliton lattice (spiral) phase beside a ferromagnetic phase inside the domain line, where the former represents a domain-wall skyrmion crystal from the bulk point of view. We first determine the phase diagram on the domain wall by numerically constructing domain-wall solutions. We then analytically reproduce the phase diagram in a domain-wall theory (a chiral double sine-Gordon model) that we construct within the moduli approximation by treating the Zeeman magnetic field perturbatively. While we find good agreements between the phase diagrams of the numerical and effective theory methods, the numerical solution exhibits a decomposition of the topological charge into a bimeron which cannot be captured by the effective theory.

Title: Full distribution and large deviations of local observables in an exactly solvable current carrying steady state of a strongly driven XXZ chain
Authors: Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith
Abstract: Current carrying steady states of interacting spin chains exhibit rich structures generated through an interplay of constraints from the Hamiltonian dynamics and those induced by the current. The \textit{XXZ} spin chain when coupled to maximally polarizing Lindblad terms (with opposite signs on either end) admits an exact solution for the steady state in a matrix product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations and distributions of local spin observables in the nonequilibrium steady state. We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy per site and scaled cumulant generating functions (SCGF) for distributions of local observables in the \textit{XX} limit (Ising anisotropy $\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS solution in the $\Delta>0$ regime, to calculate numerically exact entropy, correlations, as well as full distributions of spin observables in large systems. In systems where $\Delta$ is a cosine of rational multiple of $\pi$, we can numerically exactly estimate the large system limit of the SCGF and the large deviation/rate functions of local-$z$ magnetization. For these, we show that the deviations of the SCGF, calculated in finite systems, from the asymptotic large system size limit decay exponentially with system size; however, the decay rate is a discontinuous function of $\Delta$. The $x$ magnetization density shows a double peak structure at $\Delta\lesssim 1$, suggesting short-range ferromagnetic ordering in the $x$ direction similar to what was reported for the ground state of the XXZ chain.

Title: Universality of Dynamic and Thermodynamic Behavior of Polymers near their Glass Transition
Authors: Valeriy V. Ginzburg, Oleg V. Gendelman, Riccardo Casalini, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: Describing the dynamics and thermodynamics of amorphous materials near the glass transition is a major challenge in soft-matter physics and polymer engineering. Here, we show that the dependence of the dielectric alpha-relaxation time on temperature can be captured by a universal equation with only two independent parameters, Tg and fragility, m. This is similar in spirit to the ideas of van Krevelen and Bicerano, and can be related to the Boyer-Spencer and Simha-Boyer rules for the volumetric thermal expansion via a modified free-volume approach such as Sanchez-Lacombe "Two-state, two-(time)scale" (SL-TS2) theory. The model is compared to experimental data for nine amorphous polymers with varying values of Tg and m, and a good qualitative and quantitative agreement is found. We also derive the relationship between the experimental and computational (high-cooling-rate) Tg, and compare our model prediction for the Tg-shift between the two with the simulation results of Afzal et al., finding a good qualitative and semi-quantitative agreement. The results could serve as a guidance for future simulation studies.

Title: Formulation of entropy through work by Carnot machine and direct derivation of law of entropy non-decrease from Kelvin-Planck principle
Authors: Yuki Izumida
Abstract: We derive the law of entropy non-decrease directly from the Kelvin-Planck principle for simple and compound systems without using the Clausius inequality. A key of the derivation is a formulation of entropy in terms of work by a Carnot machine operating between a system and a single heat reservoir at fixed temperature, which is equivalent to Clausius entropy based on heat and Gyftopoulos-Beretta entropy based on work. We also show that we can characterize entropy as the thermodynamic cost to create a system's state from a reference state.

Title: Emergent inductors in non-helical magnets
Authors: Takahiro Anan, Takahiro Morimoto
Abstract: The emergent inductor, which is a concept of inductor employing quantum mechanics on helical magnets, has been studied actively from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Interestingly, finite inductance has been observed not only in spiral magnetic phases but also across various other magnetic phases although the underlying mechanism behind emergent inductance in non-helical magnets remains unresolved. In this study, we broaden the concept of emergent inductance to encompass non-helical magnets and establish a comprehensive formalism of the emergent inductance generated by magnetization dynamics. Using a diagrammatic approach, we derive the linear response of current density mediated by magnetization dynamics and formulate impedance and inductance for general magnetic materials. We reveal that the emergent inductance is composed of two distinct components, each contributing positively or negatively. Notably, the positive inductance arises from Ohmic dissipation including the effect of the emergent electric field (Berry phase in real space) while the negative inductance arises from the polarization of itinerant electrons (Berry curvature in $k$-$t$ space). We also apply the present method to quasi 1D models and show the numerical results of the inductance, the spin dynamics, the impedance, and the Q-value.

Title: Supercurrent flow in inhomogeneous superconductors
Authors: Mikhail A. Skvortsov, Oleg B. Zuev, Dina I. Fazlizhanova
Abstract: We study how the supercurrent flow pattern is altered by inhomogeneities in superconducting films. Working in the vicinity of the critical temperature and assuming a model of short-range disorder in the quadratic term of the Ginzburg-Landau functional, we develop a perturbation theory in the inhomogeneity strength. Absorbing the ultraviolet divergences into the renormalization of the critical temperature, we arrive at a well-defined theory governed by large-scale physics. In the presence of inhomogeneities, the correlation functions of the order parameter and supercurrent exhibit a long-range power-law behavior, which can be attributed to the mixing of the amplitude and phase modes. The fluctuation magnitude grows with increasing the average current, and the system becomes strongly inhomogeneous near the critical current. An inhomogeneous superflow will generate a random magnetic field, whose magnitude in thin NbN films can be comparable to Earth's magnetic field. We discuss the feasibility of detecting it using the SQUID-on-tip technique.

Title: Intertwined order of generalized global symmetries
Authors: Benjamin Moy, Eduardo Fradkin
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of generalized global symmetries in 2+1 dimensions in a lattice model that couples a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model to a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory via a topological interaction. This coupling binds the charges of one symmetry to the disorder operators of the other, and when these composite objects condense, they give rise to emergent generalized symmetries with mixed 't Hooft anomalies. These anomalies result in phases with ordinary symmetry breaking, topological order, and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, where the different types of order are not independent but intimately related. We further explore the gapped boundary states of these exotic phases and develop theories for phase transitions between them. Additionally, we extend this lattice model to incorporate a non-invertible global symmetry, which can be spontaneously broken, leading to domain walls with non-trivial fusion rules.

Title: Real-space chirality from crystalline topological defects in the Kitaev spin liquid
Authors: Fay Borhani, Arnab Seth, Itamar Kimchi
Abstract: We show that certain crystalline topological defects in the gapless Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid model generate a chirality and Majorana fermion orbital magnetization that depends in a universal manner on their emergent flux. Focusing on 5-7 dislocations as building blocks, consisting of pentagon and heptagon disclinations, we identify the Kitaev bond label configurations that preserve solvability. By computing two formulations of local markers $M(r)$ we find that the 5 and 7 lattice defects generate a real-space contribution to Chern number and an associated Majorana fermion orbital magnetization proportional to $M(r)$. The sign of the $M(r)$ contribution from each 5/7 defect, i.e. its $q_M=\pm 1$ chirality, is determined by the defect Frank angle sign $F$ and emergent gauge field flux $W = \pm i$ through the expression $q_M = - i F W$. Remarkably, though lattice curvature and torsion can interplay with the surrounding gapless background to modify the profile of $M(r)$, its sign $q_M$ is determined locally, implying that crystalline defects in the Kitaev spin liquid can generate a robust and observable chirality.

Title: Adaptation of Wallace's Approach to the Specific Heat of Elemental Solids with Significant Intrinsic Anharmonicity, Particularly the Light Actinide Metals
Authors: Christopher A. Mizzi, W. Adam Phelan, Matthew S. Cook, Greta L. Chappell, Paul H. Tobash, David C. Arellano, Derek V. Prada, Boris Maiorov, Neil Harrison
Abstract: The quasiharmonic approximation is the most common method for modeling the specific heat of solids; however, it fails to capture the effects of intrinsic anharmonicity. In this study, we introduce the "elastic softening approximation," an alternative approach to modeling intrinsic anharmonic effects on thermodynamic quantities, which is grounded in Wallace's thermodynamic framework that tracks entropy changes resulting from the continuous change (e.g., softening) of phonons as a function of temperature. A key finding of our study is a direct correlation between Poisson's ratio and the differential rate of phonon softening at finite frequencies, compared to lower frequencies relevant to elastic moduli measurements. We observe that elemental solids such as $\alpha$-Be, diamond, Al, Cu, In, W, Au, and Pb, which span a wide range of Poisson's ratios and exhibit varying degrees of intrinsic anharmonicity, consistently follow this trend. When applied to $\alpha$-U, $\alpha$-Pu, and $\delta$-Pu, our method reveals unusually large anharmonic phonon contributions at elevated temperatures across all three light actinide metals. These findings are attributed to the unique combination of enhanced covalency and softer elastic moduli inherent in the actinides, potentially influenced by their 5f-electron bonding.

Title: Topological junction states in graphene nanoribbons: A route to topological chemistry
Authors: Hazem Abdelsalam, Domenico Corona, Renebeth B. Payod, Mahmoud A. S. Sakr, Omar H. Abd-Elkader, Qinfang Zhang, Vasil A. Saroka
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use the localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.

Title: Double perovskite Ba2NaOsO6: Magnetic structure, Kramers doublet and x-ray magnetic dichroic signals
Authors: S W Lovesey
Abstract: Of all the oxides of osmium, Ba2NaOsO6 is the only one with a substantial ferromagnetic moment. A fresh theoretical study of bulk magnetic properties of the double perovskite is accomplished with an appropriate space group, and an atomic model of a Kramers doublet formed by the single osmium d-electron. It possesses symmetry demanded by the Wyckoff position assigned to Os in a canted ferromagnet. Whereupon, magnetic moments in the paramagnetic and magnetically ordered states of Ba2NaOsO6 are unified. Analytic x-ray magnetic dichroic signals (XMCD) at osmium L2 and L3 absorption edges are presented, and shown to agree with hitherto unexplained recent measurements.

Title: A Thermodynamic Theory of Proximity Ferroelectricity
Authors: Eugene A. Eliseev, Anna N. Morozovska, Jon-Paul Maria, Long-Qing Chen, Venkatraman Gopalan
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where the multilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression" where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of dielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozen ferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.

Title: Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires
Authors: Magali Korolev, Karyn Le Hur
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids. This is equivalent to add charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. This reveals from an equilibrium approach the entangled nature of the two counter-propagating fractional charges associated to the same electron in the system. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach also clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ring geometry at zero temperature from a space-time correspondence in 1D. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group. Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, also we show how bipartite fluctuations can detect the presence of a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.

Title: Mixing and Ergodicity in Systems with Long-Range Interactions
Authors: Tarcísio Nunes Teles, Renato Pakter, Yan Levin
Abstract: We present a theory of collisionless relaxation in systems with long-range interactions. Contrary to Lynden-Bell's theory of violent relaxation, which assumes global ergodicity and mixing, we show that quasi-stationary states (qSS) observed in these systems exhibit broken global ergodicity. We propose that relaxation towards equilibrium occurs through a process of local mixing, where particles spread over energy shells defined by the manifold to which their trajectories are confined. To demonstrate our theory, we study the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model, a paradigmatic system with long-range interactions. Our theory accurately predicts the particle distribution functions in qSS observed in molecular dynamics simulations without any adjustable parameters. Additionally, it precisely forecasts the phase transitions observed in the HMF model.

Title: Numerical insights on the volume phase transition of thermoresponsive hollow microgels
Authors: Leah Rank, Emanuela Zaccarelli
Abstract: Hollow microgels, consisting of a pNIPAM polymer network with a central cavity, have significant potential due to their tunable softness and encapsulation capabilities. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we thoroughly characterise the swelling behaviour of neutral hollow microgels across the Volume Phase Transition (VPT) upon varying crosslinker concentration, shell thickness, and size. In particular, we examine in detail the onset of cavity filling and its relation to the VPT, detecting the presence of a discontinuity in the radius of gyration of the microgels, if an appropriate balance between shell stiffness and thermoresposiveness is reached. The discontinuity is, however, absent in the behaviour of the hydrodynamic radius, in agreement with experimental observations. We then test our numerical model by direct comparison of form factors with available measurements in the literature and also establish a minimal-size, stable hollow microgel for future computationally feasible bulk investigations. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental swelling properties of hollow microgels that can be useful to control the opening and closing of the cavity for application purposes.

Title: Quantifying the creation of negatively charged boron vacancies in He-ion irradiated hexagonal boron nitride

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts luminescent defects possessing spin qualities compatible with quantum sensing protocols at room temperature. Vacancies, in particular, are readily obtained via exposure to high-energy ion beams. While the defect creation mechanism via such irradiation is well understood, the occurrence rate of optically active negatively charged vacancies ($V_B^-$) is an open question. In this work, we exploit focused helium ions to systematically generate optically active vacancy defects in hBN flakes at varying density. By comparing the density-dependent spin splitting measured by magnetic resonance to calculations based on a microscopic charge model, in which we introduce a correction term due to a constant background charge, we are able to quantify the number of $V_B^-$ defects generated by the ion irradiation. We find a lower bound for the fraction (0.2%) of all vacancies in the optically active, negatively charged state. Our results provide a protocol for measuring the generation efficiency of $V_B^-$, which is necessary for understanding and optimizing luminescent centers in hBN.

Title: Effect of 2$^\text{nd}$ harmonic current--phase relation on a behavior of a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier
Authors: Claudio Guarcello, Carlo Barone, Giovanni Carapella, Giovanni Filatrella, Andrea Giachero, Sergio Pagano
Abstract: We numerically investigate the behavior of a Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier assuming a current-phase relation with a second--harmonic contribution. We find that varying the weight of harmonic terms in the Josephson current affects the gain profile. The analysis of gain characteristics, phase-space portraits, Poincaré sections, and Fourier spectra demonstrates that the nonsinusoidal contribution influences the operating mode and stability of the device. In particular, we identify the optimal weighting of harmonic contributions that maximizes amplification, achieving gains up to $\sim 13\;\text{dB}$ in a device without dispersion engineering.

Title: Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect
Authors: Kamran Behnia
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors induced by magnetic field. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experiments find that the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature at which the longitudinal thermal conductivity peaks. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions (which do not produce entropy) dominate Umklapp and boundary scattering events (which do). In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a geometric [Berry] phase. Its origin is the difference in the spatial distributions of the positive charge of the nuclei and the negative charge of the electron cloud. The magnetic flux is negligible for the point-like nuclei, but not for the electron cloud. Therefore, the molecular wave-function becomes a complex number in the presence of the magnetic field. In a crystal, this implies a complex amplitude for transverse acoustic phonons, modifying three-phonon interference patterns, and twisting the quasi-momentum of the outgoing phonon. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest displacement amplitude, $u_m$, of transverse acoustic phonons at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.

Title: Reversible magneto ionics in crystallized W Co20Fe60B20 MgO HfO2 ultra-thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
Authors: Song Chen, Elmer Monteblanco, Benjamin Borie, Shimpei Ono, Dafine Ravelosona
Abstract: We have investigated electric field (E-field) induced modulation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in both amorphous and crystalline W/CoFeB/MgO/HfO2 ultra-thin films. We find that in the amorphous state, the E-field effect is volatile and reversible, which is consistent with the conventional electrostatic effect through charge accumulation and depletion. In the crystallized system annealed at 370°C, we find that two effects are at play, a non-volatile and reversible voltage-induced effect on PMA and an electrostatic response. We discuss these results in terms of higher oxygen mobility at the crystallized CoFeB-MgO interface, which induces a non-volatile magnetoionic response. Modulating PMA in crystallized CoFeB-MgO materials through ionic migration opens the path to integrating magneto-ionics in full magnetic tunnel junctions.

Title: In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions
Authors: Junyi Yang, Changjiang Liu, Xianjing Zhou, Hanyu Hou, Kaijun Yin, Jianguo Wen, John Pearson, Alexey Suslov, Dafei Jin, Jidong S. Jiang, Ulrich Welp, Jian-Min Zuo, Michael R. Norman, Anand Bhattacharya
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.

Title: Incommensurate and commensurate antiferromagnetic orders in the kagome compound UV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$

Abstract: We report on the synthesis of single crystals of a new kagome compound, UV$_6$Sn$_6$, and present the results of magnetization, electrical resistivity, heat capacity, X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments to characterize the structure and magnetic properties. UV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystallizes in a large supercell of the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$ parent structure with an hexagonal symmetry in which some of the U atoms are shifted by $c/2$ in an ordered fashion. Below $T_{N1}\approx29$\,K, an incommensurate magnetic structure with a temperature-dependent wavevector $(0,0,k_z)$ is observed. Below $T_{N2}=23.5$\,K, the wavevector locks in to $(0,0,0.5)$ forming an antiferromagnetic ground state. The U moments align along the $c$ axis retaining a large magnetic anisotropy. These findings highlight the role of the $5f$ orbitals from uranium in this structural family in driving both magnetic ordering and structural modulation and distinguish UV$_6$Sn$_6$ from its lanthanide-based analogs.

Title: Critical Probability Distributions of the order parameter at two loops II: $O(n)$ universality class
Authors: Sankarshan Sahu
Abstract: We show how to compute the probability distributions of the order parameter of the $O(n)$ model at two-loop order of perturbation theory generalizing the methods developed for computing the same in case of the Ising model \cite{Sahu:2025bkp}. We show that even for the $O(n)$ model, there exists not one but a family of these probability distribution functions indexed by $\zeta$ which is the ratio of system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$. We also compare these PDFs to the Monte-Carlo simulations and the existing FRG results \cite{Rancon:2025bjf} for the $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models.

Title: Design of altermagnetic models from spin clusters
Authors: Xingchuan Zhu, Xingmin Huo, Shiping Feng, Song-Bo Zhang, Shengyuan A. Yang, Huaiming Guo
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new class of collinear compensated magnetic phase, has garnered tremendous interest because of its rich physics and promising applications. Physical models and verified material candidates for altermagnetism remain limited. Here, we propose a general scheme to construct altermagnetic models, which explicitly exhibits the blend of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations in real space via the design of spin clusters, echoing the observation that properties of altermagnets resemble a mixture of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We show that in some of our models, the desired altermagnetic order can be spontaneously realized by electron-electron interaction in a broad range of the phase diagram. This development facilitates the study of fascinating physics of altermagnetism and sheds light on the discovery of new altermagnetic materials.

Title: Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy
Authors: Tongyang Guan, Jiahao Liu, Wentao Qin, Yongwei Cui, Shunjia Wang, Yizheng Wu, Zhensheng Tao
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.

Title: Fluctuated lattice-driven charge density wave far above the condensation temperature in kagome superconductor KV$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Haoran Liu, Shaofeng Duan, Xiangqi Liu, Zhihua Liu, Shichong Wang, Lingxiao Gu, Jiongyu Huang, Wenxuan Yang, Jianzhe Liu, Dong Qian, Yanfeng Guo, Wentao Zhang
Abstract: The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, F$_c$, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of T$_c$ = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at F$_c$ were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at T$_c$. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near T$_c$, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.

Title: Probing Hilbert Space Fragmentation with Strongly Interacting Rydberg Atoms
Authors: Fan Yang, Hadi Yarloo, Hua-Chen Zhang, Klaus Mølmer, Anne E. B. Nielsen
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation provides a mechanism to break ergodicity in closed many-body systems. Here, we propose a feasible scheme to explore this exotic paradigm on a Rydberg quantum simulator. We show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space. The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art Rydberg array setups.

Title: Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography
Authors: Yoshiki Fukusumi
Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The recent topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).

Title: Entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains
Authors: Masahiro Hoshino, Masaki Oshikawa, Yuto Ashida
Abstract: The transfer of quantum information between many-qubit states is a subject of fundamental importance in quantum science and technology. We consider entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains, where the entanglement between the two chains is induced solely by the Bell-state measurements. We employ a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) approach and describe the measurements as conformal boundary conditions in the replicated field theory. We show that the swapped entanglement exhibits a logarithmic scaling, whose coefficient takes a universal value determined by the scaling dimension of the boundary condition changing operator. We apply our framework to the critical spin-1/2 XXZ chain and determine the universal coefficient by the boundary CFT analysis. We also numerically verify these results by the tensor-network calculations. Possible experimental relevance to Rydberg atom arrays is briefly discussed.

Title: Multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger Entanglement in Monitored Random Clifford Circuits
Authors: Guanglei Xu, Yu-Xiang Zhang
Abstract: We investigate $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ($\text{GHZ}_n$) entanglement in monitored random Clifford circuits and uncover a series of novel phase transitions and dynamical features. Random Clifford circuits are well-known for a measurement-induced transition between phases of volume-law and area-law (bipartite) entanglement. We numerically find that the volume-law phase is characterized by, approximately, a constant amount of $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement, despite the variations of system size and the rate of measurement. The area-law phase does not harbor such tripartite entanglement. A measurement-induced phase transition is also seen from $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement. Moreover, the amount of $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement generally does not change with the partitioning of the system, but abruptly drops to zero when a subsystem has more than half of the qubits, giving rise to a partitioning-induced phase transition. Dynamically, $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement does not grow gradually, as is typical for bipartite entanglement, but instead emerges suddenly through dynamical phase transitions (DPTs). Furthermore, in some situations we observe transient $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement that will suddenly disappear through another DPT. We also studied multipartite $\text{GHZ}_{n\geq 4}$ entanglement and find they emerge exclusively at the measurement-induced criticality, providing new insights into the long-range correlations of critical states.

Title: Locating Critical Points Using Ratios of Lee-Yang Zeros
Authors: Tatsuya Wada, Masakiyo Kitazawa, Kazuyuki Kanaya
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.

Title: The Geometry of Fixed-Magnetization Spin Systems at Low Temperature
Authors: Jacob Calvert, Shunhao Oh, Dana Randall
Abstract: Spin systems are fundamental models of statistical physics that provide insight into collective behavior across scientific domains. Their interest to computer science stems in part from the deep connection between the phase transitions they exhibit and the computational complexity of sampling from the probability distributions they describe. Our focus is on the geometry of spin configurations, motivated by applications to programmable matter and computational biology. Rigorous results in this vein are scarce because the natural setting of these applications is the low-temperature, fixed-magnetization regime. Recent progress in this regime is largely limited to spin systems under which magnetization concentrates, which enables the analysis to be reduced to that of the simpler, variable-magnetization case. More complicated models, like those that arise in applications, do not share this property. We study the geometry of spin configurations on the triangular lattice under the Generalized Potts Model (GPM), which generalizes many fundamental models of statistical physics, including the Ising, Potts, clock, and Blume--Capel models. Moreover, it specializes to models used to program active matter to solve tasks like compression and separation, and it is closely related to the Cellular Potts Model, widely used in computational models of biological processes. Our main result shows that, under the fixed-magnetization GPM at low temperature, spins of different types are typically partitioned into regions of mostly one type, separated by boundaries that have nearly minimal perimeter. The proof uses techniques from Pirogov--Sinai theory to extend a classic Peierls argument for the fixed-magnetization Ising model, and introduces a new approach for comparing the partition functions of fixed- and variable-magnetization models.

Title: Integrative Learning of Quantum Dot Intensity Fluctuations under Excitation via Tailored Dynamic Mixture Modeling
Authors: Xin Yang, Hawi Nyiera, Yonglei Sun, Jing Zhao, Kun Chen
Abstract: Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have attracted significant attention for their unique fluorescence properties. Under continuous excitation, QDs emit photons with intricate intensity fluctuation: the intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different QDs even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. Conventional normality-based single-dot analysis fall short of addressing these complexities. In collaboration with chemists, we develop an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series from multiple QDs. Motivated by the unique data structure and the hypothesized behaviors of the QDs, our approach leverages the celebrated hidden Markov model as its structural backbone to characterize individual dot intensity fluctuations, while assuming that, in each state the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, the state/emission distributions are shared across the QDs, and the state transition dynamics can vary among a few QD clusters. This framework allows for a precise, collective characterization of intensity fluctuation patterns and have the potential to transform current practice in chemistry. Applying our method to experimental data from 128 QDs, we reveal three shared intensity states and capture several distinct intensity transition patterns, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in providing deeper insights into QD behaviors and their design and application potential.

Title: Tensor Cross Interpolation of Purities in Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Dmytro Kolisnyk, Raimel A. Medina, Romain Vasseur, Maksym Serbyn
Abstract: A defining feature of quantum many-body systems is the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space with the number of degrees of freedom. This exponential complexity naïvely renders a complete state characterization, for instance via the complete set of bipartite Renyi entropies for all disjoint regions, a challenging task. Recently, a compact way of storing subregions' purities by encoding them as amplitudes of a fictitious quantum wave function, known as entanglement feature, was proposed. Notably, the entanglement feature can be a simple object even for highly entangled quantum states. However the complexity and practical usage of the entanglement feature for general quantum states has not been explored. In this work, we demonstrate that the entanglement feature can be efficiently learned using only a polynomial amount of samples in the number of degrees of freedom through the so-called tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm, assuming it is expressible as a finite bond dimension MPS. We benchmark this learning process on Haar and random MPS states, confirming analytic expectations. Applying the TCI algorithm to quantum eigenstates of various one dimensional quantum systems, we identify cases where eigenstates have entanglement feature learnable with TCI. We conclude with possible applications of the learned entanglement feature, such as quantifying the distance between different entanglement patterns and finding the optimal one-dimensional ordering of physical indices in a given state, highlighting the potential utility of the proposed purity interpolation method.

Title: Quantum error correction via multi-particle discrete-time quantum walk
Authors: Ryo Asaka, Ryusei Minamikawa
Abstract: We propose a scheme of quantum error correction that employs a multi-particle quantum walk defined on nested squares, each hosting a single particle. In this model, each particle moves within its own distinct square through iterations of three discrete-time steps. First, a particle updates its two-level internal coin state. Next, it either moves to an adjacent vertex or stays put, depending on the outcome. Finally, it interacts with another particle if these particles arrive at the nearest-neighbor vertices of the two adjacent squares, acquiring a phase factor of $-1$. Because a single particle represents a three-qubit state through its position and coin state, Shor's nine-qubit code is implemented using only three particles, with two additional particles for syndrome measurement. Furthermore, by exploiting gauge symmetry, our scheme achieves redundant encoding, error correction, and arbitrary operations on the encoded information using only nearest-neighbor interactions.

Title: Liouvillean Spectral Transition in Noisy Quantum Many-Body Scars
Authors: Jin-Lou Ma, Zexian Guo, Yu Gao, Zlatko Papić, Lei Ying
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.

Title: Average Spread Complexity and the Higher-Order Level Spacing
Authors: Amin Faraji Astaneh, Niloofar Vardian
Abstract: We investigate the spread complexity of a generic two-level subsystem of a larger system to analyze the influence of energy level statistics, comparing chaotic and integrable systems. Initially focusing on the nearest-neighbor level spacing, we observe the characteristic slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure. Further investigation reveals that certain matrix models exhibit additional iterative peaks, motivating us to generalize the known spacing distributions to higher-order level spacings. While this structure persists in chaotic systems, we find that integrable systems can also display similar features, highlighting limitations in using complexity as a universal diagnostic of quantum chaos.
