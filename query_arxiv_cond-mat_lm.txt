Title: A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime
Authors: Muqing Xu, Lev Haldar Kendrick, Anant Kale, Youqi Gang, Chunhan Feng, Shiwei Zhang, Aaron W. Young, Martin Lebrat, Markus Greiner
Abstract: Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics and the study of strongly-correlated quantum materials. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems beyond the reach of current numerical techniques. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically and so explored using the quantum simulator itself. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling no unbiased numerical simulation is available. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to significantly below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.

Title: Disordered Weyl semimetal as an array of coupled Hubbard chains
Authors: Jinmin Yi, A.A. Burkov
Abstract: We demonstrate that a disordered magnetic Weyl semimetal may be mapped onto a two-dimensional array of coupled replicated Hubbard chains, where the Hubbard $U$ is directly related to the variance of the disorder potential. This is a three-dimensional generalization of a similar mapping of the two-dimensional quantum Hall plateau transition to a one-dimensional Hubbard chain. We demonstrate that this mapping leads to the conclusion that the Weyl semimetal becomes a diffusive metal with a nonzero density of states at arbitrarily weak disorder, in agreement with recent work. We also discuss the absence of localization in strongly disordered Weyl semimetals from the viewpoint of this mapping.

Title: Theory of ab initio downfolding with arbitrary range electron-phonon coupling
Authors: Norm M. Tubman, Christopher J. N. Coveney, Chih-En Hsu, Andres Montoya-Castillo, Marina R. Filip, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Zhenglu Li, Vojtech Vlcek, Antonios M. Alvertis
Abstract: Ab initio downfolding describes the electronic structure of materials within a low-energy subspace, often around the Fermi level. Typically starting from mean-field calculations, this framework allows for the calculation of one- and two-electron interactions, and the parametrization of a many-body Hamiltonian representing the active space of interest. The subsequent solution of such Hamiltonians can provide insights into the physics of strongly-correlated materials. While phonons can substantially screen electron-electron interactions, electron-phonon coupling has been commonly ignored within ab initio downfolding, and when considered this is done only for short-range interactions. Here we propose a theory of ab initio downfolding that accounts for all mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling on equal footing, regardless of the range of the interactions. Our practical computational implementation is readily compatible with current downfolding approaches. We apply our approach to polar materials MgO and GeTe, and we reveal the importance of both short-range and long-range electron-phonon coupling in determining the magnitude of electron-electron interactions. Our results show that in the static limit, phonons reduce the on-site repulsion between electrons by 40% for MgO, and by 79% for GeTe. Our framework also predicts that overall attractive nearest-neighbor interactions arise between electrons in GeTe, consistent with superconductivity in this material.

Title: Semi-group influence matrices for non-equilibrium quantum impurity models
Authors: Michael Sonner, Valentin Link, Dmitry A. Abanin
Abstract: We introduce a framework for describing the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity models out of equilibrium which is based on the influence matrix approach. By replacing the dynamical map of a large fermionic quantum environment with an effective semi-group influence matrix (SGIM) which acts on a reduced auxiliary space, we overcome the limitations of previous proposals, achieving high accuracy at long evolution times. This SGIM corresponds to a uniform matrix-product state representation of the influence matrix and can be obtained by an efficient algorithm presented in this paper. We benchmark this approach by computing the spectral function of the single impurity Anderson model with high resolution. Further, the spectrum of the effective dynamical map allows us to obtain relaxation rates of the impurity towards equilibrium following a quantum quench. Finally, for a quantum impurity model with on-site two-fermion loss, we compute the spectral function and confirm the emergence of Kondo physics at large loss rates.

Title: Single electron interference and capacitive edge mode coupling generates $\Phi_0/2$ flux periodicity in Fabry-Perot interferometers in the integer quantum Hall regime
Authors: Shuang Liang, James Nakamura, Geoffrey C. Gardner, Michael J. Manfra
Abstract: Electronic Fabry-Perot interferometers operated in the quantum Hall regime facilitate study of coherent charge transport and interactions between localized charges and propagating edge modes. Experimental observations of flux periodicity $\phi_{0}/2$, where $\phi_0=h/e$ is the magnetic flux quantum, for interference of the outermost edge mode in the integer quantum Hall regime have been attributed to an exotic electron pairing mechanism. We present measurements of an AlGaAs/GaAs Fabry-Perot interferometer operated in the integer quantum Hall regime for filling factors $1\leq \nu \leq 3$ that has been designed to simultaneously express measurable bulk-edge and edge-edge couplings. At integer fillings $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$, we observe interference with flux periodicity $\phi_{0}/2$ for the outermost edge mode. However, our analysis indicates that the periodicity $\phi_0/2$ is not driven by electron pairing, but rather is the result of capacitive coupling between multiple isolated edge modes and the outer edge. In our experiment, the interfering unit of charge for the outermost edge mode at $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$ was determined to be $e^*=1$, where the effective charge $e^*$ is normalized to the charge of a single electron. Our measurements demonstrate that the magnitude of the interfering charge can be determined in operando in a Fabry-Perot interferometer.

Title: Spin dynamics in the Dirac $U(1)$ spin liquid YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$
Authors: Hank C. H. Wu, Francis L. Pratt, Benjamin M. Huddart, Dipranjan Chatterjee, Paul A. Goddard, John Singleton, D. Prabhakaran, Stephen J. Blundell
Abstract: YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ is a promising candidate for realizing a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state, particularly owing to its lack of significant site disorder. Pulsed-field magnetometry at 0.5 K shows magnetization saturating near 15 T, with a corrected saturation moment of 2.1(1) $\mu_\mathrm{B}$ after subtracting the van Vleck contribution. Our zero-field $\mu$SR measurements down to milliKelvin temperatures provide evidence for a dynamic ground state and the absence of magnetic order. To probe fluctuations in the local magnetic field at the muon site, we performed longitudinal field $\mu$SR experiments. These results provide evidence for spin dynamics with a field dependence that is consistent with a U1A01 Dirac QSL as a plausible description of the ground state.

Title: Electrically induced negative differential resistance states mediated by oxygen octahedra coupling in manganites for neuronaldynamics
Authors: Azminul Jaman, Lorenzo Fratino, Majid Ahmadi, Rodolfo Rocco, Bart J. Kooi, Marcelo Rozenberg, Tamalika Banerjee
Abstract: The precipitous rise of consumer network applications reiterates the urgency to redefine computing hardware with low power footprint. Neuromorphic computing utilizing correlated oxides offers an energy-efficient solution. By designing anisotropic functional properties in LSMO on a twinned LAO substrate and driving it out of thermodynamic equilibrium, we demonstrate two distinct negative differential resistance states in such volatile memristors. These were harnessed to exhibit oscillatory dynamics in LSMO at different frequencies and an artificial neuron with leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics. A material based modelling incorporating bond angle distortions in neighboring perovskites and capturing the inhomogeneity of domain distribution and propagation explains both the NDR regimes. Our findings establish LSMO as an important material for neuromorphic computing hardware.

Title: The electrostatic charge on a falling water drop
Authors: Schuyler Arn, Pablo Illing, Joshua Mendez Harper, Justin C. Burton
Abstract: Fluid triboelectrification, also known as flow electrification, remains an under-explored yet ubiquitous phenomenon with potential applications in various fields, from material science to planetary evolution. Building upon previous efforts to position water within the triboelectric series, we investigate the charge on individual, millimetric water drops falling through air. Our experiments measured the charge and mass of each drop using a Faraday cup mounted on a mass balance, and connected to an electrometer. For pure water in a glass syringe with a grounded metal tip, we find the charge per drop ($\Delta q/\Delta m$) was approximately -5 pC/g to -1 pC/g. This was independent of the release height of the drop, tip diameter and length, tip cleaning preparation, and whether the experiment was shielded with a Faraday cage. Biasing the tip to different voltages allowed for linear control of the drop charge, and the results were consistent with known electrochemical effects, namely the Volta potential expected between most metals and bulk water ($\approx$ -0.5 V). Introducing insulating plastic materials into the experiment (from the syringe body or tip) imparted large amounts of charge on the drops with apparent stochastic charge evolution. Together these results show that the flow electrification of water is more complex than previously reported, and is driven by various, material-dependent electrostatic processes.

Title: Spin-reorientation driven topological Hall effect in Fe4GeTe2
Authors: Alapan Bera, Soumik Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: Iron-based van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets with relatively high ordering temperatures are a current research focus due to their significance in fundamental physics and potential applications in spintronics. Competing magnetic interactions and anisotropies can give rise to nontrivial spin textures in these materials, resulting in novel topological features. Fe4GeTe2 (F4GT) is a nearly room-temperature vdW ferromagnet, well known for hosting a spin-reorientation transition (SRT) arising from the interplay of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and shape anisotropy. In this work, we investigate the angle-dependent magneto-transport properties of F4GT single crystals. We report a large topological Hall effect (THE) in a multi-layer F4GT originating from the SRT-driven non-coplanar spin textures. The THE appears at the in-plane orientation of the external magnetic field and persists over a wide range of temperatures around SRT. Additionally, we find a thickness-sensitive THE signal for the c axis orientation of the magnetic field at a low-temperature regime which is associated with a reentrant Lifshitz transition.

Title: Waveguide Excitation and Spin Pumping of Chirally Coupled Quantum Dots
Authors: Savvas Germanis, Xuchao Chen, René Dost, Dominic J. Hallett, Edmund Clarke, Pallavi K. Patil, Maurice S. Skolnick, Luke R. Wilson, Hamidreza Siampour, A. Mark Fox
Abstract: We report on an integrated semiconductor chip where a single quantum dot (QD) is excited in-plane via a photonic-crystal waveguide through its nearest p-shell optical transition. The chirality of the waveguide mode is exploited to achieve both directional absorption and directional emission, resulting in a substantial enhancement in directional contrast, as measured for the Zeeman components of the waveguide-coupled QD. This remote excitation scheme enables high directionality (greater than or equal to 0.95) across approximately 56% of the waveguide area, with significant overlap with the Purcell-enhanced region, where the electric field intensity profile is near its peak. In contrast, local excitation methods using an out-of-plane excitation beam focused directly over the area of the QD achieve only approximately 25% overlap. This enhancement increases the likelihood of locating Purcell-enhanced QDs in regions that support high directionality, enabling the experimental demonstration of a six-fold enhancement in the decay rate of a QD with greater than 90% directionality. The remote p-shell excitation protocol establishes a new benchmark for waveguide quantum optics in terms of the combination of Purcell enhancement and high directionality, thereby paving the way for on-chip excitation of spin-based solid-state quantum technologies in regimes of high beta-factor.

Title: Proposal for Spin-Superfluid Quantum Interference Device
Authors: Yanyan Zhu, Eric Kleinherbers, Leonid Levitov, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak
Abstract: In easy-plane magnets, the spin-superfluid phase was predicted to facilitate coherent spin transport. So far, experimental evidence remains elusive. In this letter, we propose an indirect way to sense this effect via the spin-superfluid quantum interference device (spin SQUID) -- inspired by its superconducting counterpart (rf SQUID). The spin SQUID is constructed as a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) magnetic ring with a single Josephson weak link, functioning as an isolated device with a microwave response. The spin current is controlled by an in-plane electric field through Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This interaction can be interpreted as a gauge field that couples to the spin supercurrent through the Aharonov-Casher effect. By investigating the static and dynamic properties of the device, we show that the spin current and the harmonic frequencies of the spin superfluid are periodic with respect to the accumulated Aharonov-Casher phase and are, therefore, sensitive to the radial electric flux through the ring in units of the electric flux quantum, suggesting a potential electric-field sensing functionality. For readout, we propose to apply spectroscopic analysis to detect the frequency of the harmonic modes.

Title: Stress Accommodation in Nanoscale Dolan Bridges Designed for Superconducting Qubits
Authors: Sueli Skinner-Ramos, Matthew L. Freeman, Douglas Pete, Rupert M. Lewis, Matthew Eichenfield, C. Thomas Harris
Abstract: Josephson junctions are the principal circuit element in numerous superconducting quantum information devices and can be readily integrated into large-scale electronics. However, device integration at the wafer scale necessarily depends on having a reliable, high-fidelity, and high-yield fabrication method for creating Josephson junctions. When creating Al/AlOx based superconducting qubits, the standard Josephson junction fabrication method relies on a sub-micron suspended resist bridge, known as a Dolan bridge, which tends to be particularly fragile and can often times fracture during the resist development process, ultimately resulting in device failure. In this work, we demonstrate a unique Josephson junction lithography mask design that incorporates stress-relief channels. Our simulation results show that the addition of stress-relief channels reduces the lateral stress in the Dolan bridge by more than 70% for all the bridge geometries investigated. In practice, our novel mask design significantly increased the survivability of the bridge during device processing, resulting in 100% yield for over 100 Josephson junctions fabricated.

Title: A combined statistical mechanical and ab initio approach to understanding H2O/CO2 co-adsorption in mmen-Mg2(dobpdc)
Authors: Jonathan R. Owens, Bojun Feng, Jie Liu, David Moore
Abstract: We study the effects of H2O on CO2 adsorption in an amine-appended variant of the metal-organic framework Mg2(dobpdc), which is known to exhibit chaining behavior that presents in a step-shaped adsorption isotherm. We first show how the presence of different levels of local H2O affects this chaining behavior and the energetics of CO2 adsorption, based on a series of ab initio calculations, giving insight into the atomic-scale environment. In particular, we predict a novel adsorbed configuration, in which H2O and CO2 intertwine to make a braided chain down the MOF pore. We then show how an existing lattice model can be adapted to incorporate the effect of water, and predict the CO2 isotherms for the various water levels, observing a sharp shift the uptake at low partial pressures. In addition to the physical further work on this and related materials.

Title: Aspects of the normal state resistivity of cuprate superconductors Bi2201 and Tl2201
Authors: Samantha Shears, Michael Arciniaga, B Sriram Shastry
Abstract: Planar normal state resistivity data from two families of hole doped single layer cuprate superconductors $Bi2201$ (Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$) and $Tl2201$ (Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$) are calculated using the extremely correlated Fermi liquid theory (ECFL). This theory was recently employed for understanding the three families of single layer cuprate superconductors LSCO, BSLCO and NCCO. Adding these two systems accounts for essentially all single layer compounds where data is available for a range of densities and temperatures. The added case of $Bi2201$ is of particular interest since it was the original system where the almost linear in temperature resistivity was reported in 1990, and has been followed up by a systematic doping analysis only recently in 2022. The $Tl2201$ system has two distinct set of band parameters that fit the same Fermi surface, providing new challenges and insights into the ECFL theory.

Title: Magnetism from multiparticle ring exchange in moir\'e Wigner crystals
Authors: Ilya Esterlis, Alex Levchenko
Abstract: We investigate the multiparticle ring exchange couplings of the two-dimensional triangular Wigner crystal in external commensurate triangular and honeycomb potentials, using a semiclassical approach valid in the regime where Coulomb interactions dominate over electronic kinetic energy. In this limit, increasing the strength of the potential drives a transition from a ferromagnet to a $120^\circ$ Néel antiferromagnet for both external potential types. In the triangular case, we find that the transition occurs already for a weak potential, whereas in the honeycomb case, it occurs when the potential is nearly two orders of magnitude larger. Our results are relevant to the magnetism of generalized Wigner crystal phases observed at certain rational fillings of the moiré superlattice in transition-metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers.

Title: First-principle study of surface structure estimation in $L1_0$-FePd(001)/graphene heterojunction
Authors: Ryusuke Endo, Naohiro Matsumoto, Samuel Vergara, Masaki Kobayashi, Hikari Shinya, Hiroshi Naganuma, Tomoya Ono, Mitsuharu Uemoto
Abstract: In this study, we present a theoretical and computational investigation of the atomic-scale structure of the heterointerface formed between the (001) surface of $L1_0$-ordered iron palladium (FePd) alloy and graphene (Gr), namely, $L1_0$-FePd(001)/Gr. Using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the topmost surface layer consisting of Pd (Pd-terminated surface) becomes more energetically stable than Fe, and Pd-terminated surfaces are not conducive to Gr adsorption. On the other hand, under oxygen atmosphere conditions, our calculation suggests the presence of Fe-terminated surfaces with Gr-covered structures reproducing recent experimental observations; besides, the presence of Fe-O bonds by the surface oxidization is also consistent with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These findings are crucial for understanding the fabrication processes of interfaces in Fe-based $L1_0$ alloy materials.

Title: Efficient calculation of phonon dynamics through a low-rank solution of the Boltzmann equation
Authors: Nikhil Malviya, Navaneetha K. Ravichandran
Abstract: Exotic nondiffusive heat transfer regimes such as the second sound, where heat propagates as a damped wave at speeds comparable to those of mechanical disturbances, often occur at cryogenic temperatures (T) and nanosecond timescales in semiconductors. First-principles prediction of such rapid, low-T phonon dynamics requires finely-resolved temporal tracking of large, dense, and coupled linear phonon dynamical systems arising from the governing linearized Peierls-Boltzmann equation (LPBE). Here, we uncover a rigorous low-rank representation of these linear dynamical systems, derived from the spectral properties of the phonon collision matrix, that accelerates the first-principles prediction of phonon dynamics by a factor of over a million without compromising on the computational accuracy. By employing this low-rank representation of the LPBE, we predict strong amplification of the wave-like second sound regime upon isotopic enrichment in diamond - a finding that would have otherwise been computationally intractable using the conventional brute-force approaches. Our framework enables a rapid and accurate discovery of the conditions under which wave-like heat flow can be realized in common semiconductors.

Title: Momentum distribution of He-3 in one dimension
Authors: Massimo Boninsegni
Abstract: The one-particle density matrix of a one-dimensional system of fermions featuring a hard-core repulsive interaction at short distances can be computed (numerically) exactly by means of the continuous-space Worm Algorithm, without any sign instability. We present here results for this quantity, and the related momentum distribution, for a He-3 fluid. It is shown that effects of quantum statistics are observable in both the fully polarized and in the unpolarized system, with only a relatively small suppression in the latter case.

Title: A Simple and General Equation for Matrix Product Unitary Generation
Authors: Sujeet K. Shukla
Abstract: Matrix Product Unitaries (MPUs) have emerged as essential tools for representing locality-preserving 1D unitary operators, with direct applications to quantum cellular automata and quantum phases of matter. A key challenge in the study of MPUs is determining when a given local tensor generates an MPU, a task previously addressed through fixed-point conditions and canonical forms, which can be cumbersome to evaluate for an arbitrary tensor. In this work, we establish a simple and efficient necessary and sufficient condition for a tensor $M$ to generate an MPU of size $N$, given by $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_M^N) = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_T^N) = 1$, where $\mathbb{E}_M$ and $\mathbb{E}_T$ are the transfer matrices of $M$ and $T = MM^\dagger$. This condition provides a unified framework for characterizing all uniform MPUs and significantly simplifies their evaluation. Furthermore, we show that locality preservation naturally arises when the MPU is generated for all system sizes. Our results offer new insights into the structure of MPUs, highlighting connections between unitary evolution, transfer matrices, and locality-preserving behavior, with potential extensions to higher-dimensions.

Title: First-principles study of dielectric properties of ferroelectric perovskite oxides with on-site and inter-site Hubbard interactions
Authors: Min Chul Choi, Wooil Yang, Young-Woo Son, Se Young Park
Abstract: We study the atomic and electronic structures of ferroelectric perovskite oxides, BaTiO$_3$, LiNbO$_3$, and PbTiO$_3$ using ab initio extended Hubbard functionals in which the on-site and inter-site Hubbard interactions are determined self-consistently, adapted from the pseudohybrid density functional proposed by Agapito-Curtarolo-Buongiorno Nardelli. Band structures, ferroelectric distortions, polarization, Born effective charges, and switching barriers are calculated with extended Hubbard functionals, that are compared with those using local density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and Hybrid (HSE06) functionals. The properties of all three compounds calculated by extended Hubbard functionals are in good agreement with experimental data. We find a substantial increase in band gaps due to the inter-site Coulomb interactions, which show better agreement with $GW$ results compared to those from LDA and GGA functionals. The crucial role of the inter-site Coulomb interactions in restoring the suppressed polar instability, which is computed when only the on-site Hubbard interactions are considered, is also highlighted. Overall, we find that the properties calculated using our extended Hubbard functionals exhibit trends similar to those obtained with the HSE06 functional, while reducing computational costs by over an order of magnitude. Thus, we propose that the current method is well-suited for high-throughput calculations for perovskite oxides, offering significantly improved accuracy in computing band gap and other related physical properties such as the shift current photovoltaic effect and band alignments in ferroelectric heterostructures.

Title: Cu Intercalation-stabilized 1T'-MoS2 with Electrical Insulating Behavior
Authors: Huiyu Nong, Junyang Tan, Yujie Sun, Rongjie Zhang, Yue Gu, Qiang Wei, Jingwei Wang, Yunhao Zhang, Qinke Wu, Xiaolong Zou, Bilu Liu
Abstract: The intercalated two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have attracted much attention for their designable structure and novel properties. Among this family, host materials with low symmetry such as 1T' phase TMDCs are particularly interesting because of their potentials in inducing unconventional phenomena. However, such systems typically have low quality and poor stability, hindering further study in the structure-property relationship and applications. In this work, we intercalated Cu into 1T' MoS2 with high crystallinity and high thermal stability up to ~300 oC. We identified the distribution and arrangement of Cu intercalators for the first time, and the results show that Cu occupy partial of the tetrahedral interstices aligned with Mo sites. The obtained Cu-1T' MoS2 exhibits an insulating hopping transport behavior with a large temperature coefficient of resistance reaching -4 ~ -2 % K-1. This work broadens the artificial intercalated structure library and promotes structure design and property modulation of layered materials.

Title: Exact solution of the three-state generalized double-chain Potts model
Authors: Pavel Khrapov, Grigory Skvortsov
Abstract: An exact analytical solution of generalized three-state double-chain Potts model with multi-spin interactions which are invariant under cyclic shift of all spin values is obtained. The partition function in a finite cyclically closed strip of length L, as well as the free energy, internal energy, entropy and heat capacity in thermodynamic limit are calculated using transfer-matrix method. Partial magnetization and susceptibility are suggested as the generalization of usual physical characteristics of a system. Proposed model can be interpreted as a generalized version of standard Potts model (which has Hamiltonian expressed through Kronecker symbols) and clock model (with Hamiltonian expressed through cosines). Considering a particular example of the model with plenty of forces, model's ground states are found, figures of its thermodynamic characteristics and discussed their behaviour at low temperature are shown.

Title: Orbital torques and orbital pumping in two-dimensional rare-earth dichalcogenides
Authors: Mahmoud Zeer, Dongwook Go, Mathias Kläui, Wulf Wulfhekel, Stefan Blügel, Yuriy Mokrousov
Abstract: The design of spin-orbit torque properties in two-dimensional (2D) materials presents one of the challenges of modern spintronics. In this context, 2D layers involving rare-earth ions $-$ which give rise to robust magnetism, exhibit pronounced orbital polarization of the states, and carry strong spin-orbit interaction $-$ hold particular promise. Here, we investigate ferromagnetic Janus H-phase monolayers of 4$f$-Eu rare-earth dichalcogenides EuSP, EuSSe, and EuSCl using first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that all compounds exhibit significant spin-orbit torques which originate predominantly in the colossal current-induced orbital response on the Eu $f$-electrons. Moreover, we demonstrate that the corresponding orbital torques can be used to drive strong in-plane currents of orbital angular momentum with non-trivial direction of orbital polarization. Our findings promote $f$-orbital-based 2D materials as a promising platform for in-plane orbital pumping and spin-orbit torque applications, and motivate further research on educated design of orbital properties for orbitronics with 2D materials.

Title: A spatially varying differential equation for multi-patch pandemic propagation
Authors: Abhimanyu Ghosh
Abstract: We develop an extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovery (SIR) model to account for spatial variations in population as well as infection and recovery parameters. The equations are derived by taking the continuum limit of discrete interacting patches, and results in a diffusion equation with some nonlinear terms. The resulting population dynamics can be reinterpreted as a nonlinear heat flow equation where the temperature vector captures both infected and recovered populations across multiple patches.

Title: Revealing Spin and Spatial Symmetry Decoupling: New Insights into Magnetic Systems with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction
Authors: Yuxuan Mu, Di Wang, Xiangang Wan
Abstract: It is widely accepted that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) generally locks spin and spatial degrees of freedom, as a result, the spin, despite being an axial vector, is fixed and cannot rotate independently, and the magnetic system should be described by magnetic space groups (MSGs). While as a new type of group, spin space groups (SSGs) have been introduced to approximately describe the symmetry of magnetic systems with negligible SOC, and received significant attention recently. In this work, we prove that in two cases of coplanar spin configurations, there are spin-only operations that strictly hold even with considerable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and the symmetry of their spin models could be described by the spin-coplanar SSG. In addition, we also find that for spin-collinear cases, regardless the strength of DMI, the magnon systems within the framework of linear spin wave theory (LSWT) also preserve the decoupled spin and spatial rotations, but the symmetry does not belong to the conventional definitions of collinear spin groups. Finally, we discuss the potential realization of these novel symmetries for magnetic candidate materials in rod, layer, and three-dimensional (3D) space groups. Our work extends the applicability of SSGs to magnetic materials with heavy elements, and provides new avenues for exploring novel physical phenomena in magnon topology and transport.

Title: Synthesis and Characterization of Two-dimensional Cs2AgInCl6 Nanoplates as Building Blocks for Functional Surfaces
Authors: Sasha Khalfin, Noam Veber, Saar Shaek, Betty Shamaev, Shai Levy, Shaked Dror, Yaron Kauffmann, Maria Koifman Khristosov, Yehonadav Bekenstein
Abstract: Breaking crystal symmetry is essential for engineering emissive double perovskite metal halides. The goal is to overcome their inherently indirect and disallowed optical transitions. Here we introduce a synthesis for silver - Cs2AgInCl6 two-dimensional hybrid nanoplate products that break the symmetry in two ways, their shape and their heterointerfaces. A comparative study between Cs2AgInCl6 nanocubes and nanoplates is presented to emphasize the difference in optical properties. A modified colloidal synthesis for Cs2AgInCl6 yields high-quality nanoplates with small lateral dimensions very different from the symmetric cubes. Each nanoplate is decorated with metallic silver nanoparticles, with diameters on the scale of the thickness of the perovskite nanoplate, forming significant heterointerfaces that further break symmetry. The Cs2AgInCl6 two-dimensional nanoplates also demonstrate facile transformation into larger crystalline nanosheets once deposited on substrates. We thus highlight those nanoplates as potential building blocks for assemblies of functional surfaces.

Title: An Inorganic Liquid Crystalline Dispersion with 2D Ferroelectric Moieties
Authors: Ziyang Huang, Zehao Zhang, Rongjie Zhang, Baofu Ding, Liu Yang, Keyou Wu, Youan Xu, Gaokuo Zhong, Chuanlai Ren, Jiarong Liu, Yugan Hao, Menghao Wu, Teng Ma, Bilu Liu
Abstract: Electro-optical effect based liquid crystal devices have been extensively used in optical modulation techniques, in which the Kerr coefficient reflects the sensitivity of the liquid crystals and determines the strength of the device operational electric field. The Peterlin-Stuart theory and the O'Konski model jointly indicate that a giant Kerr coefficient could be obtained in a material with both a large geometrical anisotropy and an intrinsic polarization, but such a material is not yet reported. Here we reveal a ferroelectric effect in a monolayer two-dimensional mineral vermiculite. A large geometrical anisotropy factor and a large inherent electric dipole together raise the record value of Kerr coefficient by an order of magnitude, till $3.0\times 10^{-4}$ m V$^{-2}$. This finding enables an ultra-low operational electric field of $10^2$-$10^4$ V m$^{-1}$ and the fabrication of electro-optical devices with an inch-level electrode separation, which is not practical previously. Because of its high ultraviolet stability (decay <1% under ultraviolet exposure of 1000 hours), large-scale, and energy-efficiency, prototypical displayable billboards have been fabricated for outdoor interactive scenes. The work provides new insights for both liquid crystal optics and two-dimensional ferroelectrics.

Title: Quantitative relations between nearest-neighbor persistence and slow heterogeneous dynamics in supercooled liquids
Authors: Katrianna S. Sarkar, Kevin A. Interiano-Alberto, Jack F. Douglas, Robert S. Hoy
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations of a binary Lennard-Jones model of glass-forming liquids, we examine how the decay of the normalized neighbor-persistence function $C_{\rm B}(t)$, which decays from unity at short times to zero at long times as particles lose the neighbors that were present in their original first coordination shell, compares with those of other, more conventionally utilized relaxation metrics. In the strongly-non-Arrhenius temperature regime below the onset temperature $T_{\rm A}$, we find that $C_{\rm B}(t)$ can be described using the same stretched-exponential functional form that is often utilized to fit the self-intermediate scattering function $S(q, t)$ of glass-forming liquids in this regime. The ratio of the bond lifetime $\tau_{\rm bond}$ associated with the terminal decay of $C_{\rm B}(t)$ to the $\alpha$-relaxation time $\tau_\alpha$ varies appreciably and non-monotonically with $T$, peaking at $\tau_{\rm bond}/\tau_\alpha \simeq 45$ at $T \simeq T_{\rm x}$, where $T_{\rm x}$ is a crossover temperature separating the high- and low-temperature regimes of glass-formation. In contrast, $\tau_{\rm bond}$ remains on the order of the overlap time $\tau_{\rm ov}$ (the time interval over which a typical particle moves by half its diameter), and the peak time $\tau_\chi$ for the susceptibility $\chi_{\rm B}(t)$ associated with the spatial heterogeneity of $C_{\rm B}(t)$ remains on the order of $\tau_{\rm imm}$ (the characteristic lifetime of immobile-particle clusters), even as each of these quantities varies by roughly $5$ orders of magnitude over our studied range of $T$. Thus, we show that $C_{\rm B}(t)$ and $\chi_{\rm B}(t)$ provide semi-quantitative spatially-averaged measures of the slow heterogeneous dynamics associated with the persistence of immobile-particle clusters.

Title: Influence of transition mutations and disorder on charge localization and transfer along B-DNA sequences
Authors: Pavlos Banev, Anastasia Falliera, Constantinos Simserides
Abstract: We illuminate the influence of transition mutations and disorder on charge localization and transfer along B-DNA sequences. Homopolymers are the best for charge transfer (cf. Refs.~ \cite{LVBMS:2018, MLTS:2019}). Hence, we consider as flawless a homopolymer sequence and then disturb it, introducing transition mutations and disorder. We exclude the possibility of charge transfer via the backbone that will be addressed soon in another work. We employ the Tight Binding (TB) Wire model to study the influence of transition mutations and the TB Fishbone Wire model to evaluate the influence of disorder emanating either from the $\pi$ path or from the backbone. For the TB Wire parameters, we employ the parametrization created in Ref.~\cite{MLS:2023}, where another TB at atomic level was used, considering all valence orbitals of all atoms. We calculate the HOMO and LUMO regime eigenenergies and eigenvectors, the participation ratio (a measure of the localization of each eigenstate), the time-dependent probability to find the carrier at each site, the mean over time probability at each site, and the mean transfer rate from site to site. Transition mutations increase localization in terms of participation ratio and impede charge transfer in terms of mean probability and transfer rates, provided the TB parameters involving mutated sites are significantly modified relative to the original. Disorder leads to severe modifications of participation ratios, i.e., increase of localization. Relevant changes occur on eigenenergies, mean probabilities at each site, and transfer rates.

Title: Vacancy-assisted superfluid drag
Authors: Thomas G. Kiely, Chao Zhang, Erich J. Mueller
Abstract: We study superfluid drag in the two-component, two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with infinitely strong repulsive interactions. We demonstrate, with a combination of analytic and numeric techniques, that the motion of holes leads to strong dissipationless coupling between currents in the two components. We show that this behavior is attributable to polaronic correlations that emerge in the presence of spin currents, and which can be observed in experiments.

Title: Transition Metal-Vacancy Point Defects in Zinc Oxide as Deep-Level Spin Qubits
Authors: Shimin Zhang, Taejoon Park, Erik Perez, Kejun Li, Xingyi Wang, Yanyong Wang, Jorge D Vega Bazantes, Ruiqi Zhang, Jianwei Sun, Kai-Mei C. Fu, Hosung Seo, Yuan Ping
Abstract: Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a promising candidate for hosting point defects as spin qubits for quantum information applications, due to its wide band gap, low spin-orbit coupling, and dilute nuclear spin environment. Previously shallow impurities in ZnO were mostly proposed for spin qubit candidates, but deep-level spin defect studies in ZnO are rather sparse, which may be ideally decoupled from the host materials for stable operation. In this work, we theoretically search for deep-level point defects in ZnO with optimal physical properties suitable for optically-addressable spin qubits in the solid-state. Using first-principles calculations for the search, we have predicted the Mo vacancy defect in ZnO owning promising spin and optical properties, including spin-triplet ground state, optical transition in the visible to near-infrared range with high quantum yield, allowed intersystem crossings with a large optically-detected magnetic resonance contrast, and long spin $T_2$ and $T_2^*$. Notably, we found the Huang-Rhys factor of the defect to be around 5, which is much smaller than those at 10-30 of the most-known defects in ZnO. We also proposed a new protocol for initializing and reading spin qubits, which could be applied in other systems with forbidden longitudinal intersystem crossing. Finally, we compared the spin decoherence driven by the nuclear spin bath and by paramagnetic impurity baths. We found that the paramagnetic impurities are very effective in causing spin decoherence even with very low concentrations, implying that the spin decoherence in ZnO can be likely dominated by them even after isotopic purification.

Title: Anomalous nuclear spin coherence in superconducting Nb$_3$Sn
Authors: Gan Zhai, William P. Halperin, Arneil P. Reyes, Sam Posen, Chiara Tarantini, Manish Mandal, David C. Larbalestier
Abstract: We have investigated the normal and superconducting states of the technologically important compound Nb$_3$Sn using $^{93}$Nb nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation we find strong suppression of the zero-temperature superconducting order parameter by magnetic field. We have identified an anomalously large electron-nuclear exchange interaction from spin-spin relaxation measurements, an order of magnitude beyond that of the dipole-dipole interaction, and thereby sensitive to vortex dynamics and vortex pinning.

Title: Fractional vorticity, Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield systems and complex structures for the (generalized) spinor Gross-Pitaevskii equations
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora, Pablo Pais
Abstract: The (generalized) Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for a complex scalar field in two spatial dimensions is analyzed. It is shown that there is an infinite family of self-interaction potentials which admit Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bounds together with the corresponding first-order BPS systems. For each member of this family, the solutions of the first-order BPS systems are automatically solutions of the corresponding second-order generalized GPE. The simplest topologically non-trivial solutions of these first-order BPS systems describe configurations with quantized fractional vorticity. The corresponding fraction is related to the degree of non-linearity. The case in which the self-interaction potential is of order six (namely $|\Psi|^{6}$, which is a relevant theory both in relativistic quantum field theories in $(2+1)$ dimensions in connection with the quantum Hall effect as well as in the theory of the supersolids) is analyzed in detail. Such formalism can also be extended to the case of quantum mixtures with multi-component GPEs. The relationship between these techniques and supersymmetry will be discussed. In particular, despite several standard features, we will show that there are multi-component GPEs that are not supersymmetric (at least, not in the standard sense) and possess a BPS system of the above type.

Title: Structural Dynamics and Strong Correlations in Dynamical Quantum Optical Lattices
Authors: Adrían U. Ramírez-Barajas, Santiago F. Caballero-Benitez
Abstract: When placing an ultracold atomic gas inside a cavity, the light-matter coupling is enhanced and nonlinear atomic dynamics are generated, offering a promising platform for quantum simulation of models with short- and long-range interactions. Recently, superradiant self organized phases for ultracold atomic gases inside a cavity, pumped by a blue detuned optical lattice, have been observed. Here, we explore the formation of quantum many-body phases with strongly interacting bosonic atoms inside an optical cavity, subject to transverse blue detuned pumping. We analyze the interplay between superradiant self-organization with superfluid and Mott insulator phases, without the need of including higher lying bands, as the Wannier functions are dynamically linked to the cavity light via backaction. We observe different kinds of structural phase transitions driven by the light inside the cavity and the interplay with atomic collisions. We observe the mode softening at the critical points in the quantum phase transitions which can be measured in future experiments.

Title: Magneto-plasmonic pesponse of nickel nano-rings prepared by electroless method
Authors: Akram Poursharif, Peyman Sahebsara, Seyyed Mahmood Monirvaghefi, Seyedeh Mehri Hamidi Mahshid Kharaziha, Masih Bagheri
Abstract: Magneto-plasmonic nanostructures have emerged as promising candidates for advanced sensing applications. However, conventional fabrication methods, such as lithography and sputtering, often involve high costs and complex processes. This study introduces a novel approach for fabricating nickel nano-rings (200-600 nm in diameter) utilizing nanosphere lithography and selective electroless deposition on ITO substrates. The resulting nickel-silver-boron (Ni-Ag-B) nanoarrays exhibit uniform, durable coatings with robust covalent bonds, providing a simpler, more cost-effective alternative to traditional methods. The unique ring-shaped geometry of the nano-rings enhances plasmonic effects by concentrating the electromagnetic field, thus outperforming other nanostructures. Unlike thin films, these nano-rings demonstrate surface plasmon resonance (SPR) within the 470-614 nm range when illuminated at a 45$^°$ incident angle. Moreover, ellipsometry parameter calculations and Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) measurements revealed narrow Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) peaks at 512 nm and 560 nm, indicating superior sensitivity for detection compared to conventional SPR and ellipsometry-SPR techniques. Finite element simulations using COMSOL provided valuable insight into the influence of magnetic fields on the electromagnetic response of the nano-rings, confirming their potential for optical communication and highly sensitive sensing technologies. This study addresses limitations in existing magneto-plasmonic systems, offering a scalable and innovative solution for the development of next-generation sensing applications.

Fiete, Joseph G. Checkelsky, Joseph Orenstein, Nuh Gedik
Abstract: Due to the lack of a net magnetic moment, antiferromagnets possess a unique robustness to external magnetic fields and are thus predicted to play an important role in future magnetic technologies. However, this robustness also makes them quite difficult to control, and the development of novel methods to manipulate these systems with external stimuli is a fundamental goal of antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we report evidence for a metastable reorientation of the order parameter in an antiferromagnetic semiconductor triggered by an ultrafast quench of the equilibrium order via photoexcitation above the band gap. The metastable state forms less than 10 ps after the excitation pulse, and persists for longer than 150 ps before decaying to the ground state via thermal fluctuations. Importantly, this transition cannot be induced thermodynamically, and requires the system to be driven out of equilibrium. Broadly speaking, this phenomenology is ultimately the result of large magnetoelastic coupling in combination with a relatively low symmetry of the magnetic ground state. Since neither of these properties are particularly uncommon in magnetic materials, the observations presented here imply a generic path toward novel device technology enabled by ultrafast dynamics in antiferromagnets.

Title: Hardening of Ni-O bond-stretching phonons in LaNiO$_2$
Authors: Yilin Wang
Abstract: We demonstrate that dynamical electron correlation and fluctuating local magnetic moments are crucial for the phonon spectra of the infinite-layer nickelate superconductor, LaNiO$_2$, using DFT plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. We find significant hardening of optical Ni-O bond-stretching phonons when going from non-magnetic to paramagnetic state, and increasing Coulomb interaction will make them even harder. The electron correlation is found to be sensitive to the Ni-O bond-stretching distortions, indicating strong interplay between electron correlation and lattice. We find that the strong local electron correlation will not favor charge orders that couple to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons, in support of the recent experiment that a $3a_0$ charge order is absent in the infinite-layer nickelates. Our results emphasize that the effects of local magnetic fluctuations should be fully taken into account when describing the lattice dynamics of the infinite-layer nickelates without long-range magnetic orders, and also provide evidence to ascribe the kink observed in the recent angle-resolved photoemission experiment to possible strong electron coupling to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons.

Title: Role of Dirac cones in the anisotropic properties associated with the spin-density wave state of iron pnictides
Authors: Garima Goyal, Dheeraj Kumar Singh
Abstract: The origin of unusual anisotropic electronic properties in the spin-density wave state of iron pnictides has conventionally been attributed to the breaking of four-fold rotational symmetry associated with the collinear magnetic order. By using a minimal two-orbital model, we show that a significant portion of the contribution to the anisotropy may come from the Dirac cones, which are not far away from the Fermi level. We demonstrate this phenomenon by examining optical conductivity and quasiparticle interference in the Dirac-semimetallic state with spin-density wave order, and the latter can be obtained by choosing appropriate interaction parameters and orbital splitting between the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals. We further extend this study to investigate the low-energy spin-wave excitations in the Dirac-semimetallic state with spin-density wave order.

Title: Orbital correlations in bilayer nickelates: roles of doping and interlayer coupling
Authors: Garima Goyal, Aastha Jain, Dheeraj Kumar Singh
Abstract: We study the nature of orbital correlations present in the bilayer nickelate within a minimal two-orbital tight binding model to gain insights into their possible role in stabilizing the less-known weakly-insulating state. The latter has been observed experimentally at ambient pressure. In order to achieve this objective, we examine the static orbital susceptibilities within the random-phase approximation. Our study highlights the sensitivity of orbital correlations to various factors including the interlayer coupling, carrier concentration, band-structure details such as the orbital contents, the number of bands contributing at the Fermi level etc. We relate this sensitiveness to the modification of the Fermi surfaces as well as their orbital contents dependent on aforementioned factors.

Title: Coulomb correlated multi-particle polarons
Authors: Petr Klenovsky
Abstract: The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.

Title: Deep Neural Network for Phonon-Assisted Optical Spectra in Semiconductors
Authors: Qiangqiang Gu, Shishir Kumar Pandey
Abstract: Phonon-assisted optical absorption in semiconductors is crucial for understanding and optimizing optoelectronic devices, yet its accurate simulation remains a significant challenge in computational materials science. We present an efficient approach that combines deep learning tight-binding (TB) and potential models to efficiently calculate the phonon-assisted optical absorption in semiconductors with $ab$ $initio$ accuracy. Our strategy enables efficient sampling of atomic configurations through molecular dynamics and rapid computation of electronic structure and optical properties from the TB models. We demonstrate its efficacy by calculating the temperature-dependent optical absorption spectra and band gap renormalization of Si and GaAs due to electron-phonon coupling over a temperature range of 100-400 K. Our results show excellent agreement with experimental data, capturing both indirect and direct absorption processes, including subtle features like the Urbach tail. This approach offers a powerful tool for studying complex materials with high accuracy and efficiency, paving the way for high-throughput screening of optoelectronic materials.

Title: Effect of 2$^\text{nd}$ harmonic current--phase relation on a behavior of a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier
Authors: Claudio Guarcello, Carlo Barone, Giovanni Carapella, Giovanni Filatrella, Andrea Giachero, Sergio Pagano
Abstract: We numerically investigate the behavior of a Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier assuming a current-phase relation with a second--harmonic contribution. We find that varying the weight of harmonic terms in the Josephson current affects the gain profile. The analysis of gain characteristics, phase-space portraits, Poincaré sections, and Fourier spectra demonstrates that the nonsinusoidal contribution influences the operating mode and stability of the device. In particular, we identify the optimal weighting of harmonic contributions that maximizes amplification, achieving gains up to $\sim 13\;\text{dB}$ in a device without dispersion engineering.

Title: Anomalous Hall effect in highly c-plane oriented Mn$_{3}$Ge/Si(100) thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition
Authors: Indraneel Sinha, Purba Dutta, Nazma Firdosh, Shreyashi Sinha, Nirmal Ganguli, Sujit Manna
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Mn$_{3}$Ge with a non-collinear Kagome structures present exciting prospects for exploring Berry curvature driven anomalous Hall effects (AHE). Despite substantial progress in bulk systems, the synthesis of crystalline thin films directly on silicon with a hexagonal phase presents a particular challenge unless a buffer layer is employed. In this study, we report the synthesis of single phase c-plane oriented hexagonal Mn$_{3}$Ge(0001) films on Si(100) using pulsed laser deposition. Under suitable growth conditions, we obtain layer-by-layer films with atomically flat surfaces and interfaces. High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy study reveals the detail surface atomic structures, where the surface Mn atoms spontaneously arrange into a Kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy (dI/dV) measurement on the atomically resolved Kagome surface show a minima in local density of states near the Fermi level, likely originated from the Weyl crossings near K points. Despite the nearly vanishing magnetization, magnetotransport measurements in 30 nm $Mn_{3}$Ge(0001) films show anomalous Hall resistivity up to 0.41 ($\mu\Omega\cdot\text{cm}$) at 2 K. Our \textit{ab initio} calculations shed further light on the existence of topological features and the band structures in Mn$_{3+x}$Ge$_{1-x}$ with increasing Mn concentration $x$. The anomalous Hall response at room temperature in crystalline Mn$_{3}$Ge films on Si(100) offer promising potential for the development of antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Magnetic-Field Dependence of Paramagnetic Properties Investigated by 63/65Cu-NMR on the Yb Zigzag-Chain Semiconductor YbCuS2
Authors: Fumiya Hori, Shunsaku Kitagawa, Kenji Ishida, Yudai Ohmagari, Takahiro Onimaru
Abstract: To investigate the paramagnetic properties of YbCuS2 under magnetic fields, we have performed the 63/65Cu-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The NMR spectra can be reproduced by the simulations of the three-dimensional powder pattern and the additional two-dimensional powder pattern, indicating the partial sample orientation due to the anisotropy of the magnetic properties. These simulations suggest that the ac plane is the easy plane in YbCuS2. The Knight shift K is proportional to the bulk magnetic susceptibility and field-independent. The broad maximum of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 at Tmax ~ 50 K (50 K anomaly) observed at zero magnetic field is quickly suppressed by the magnetic fields. This indicates that the 50 K anomaly is field-dependent. Furthermore, an anomalous enhancement of 1/T1 at low temperatures was observed above 3 T. This field seemingly corresponds to the magnetic field at which a field-induced phase transition occurs below the antiferromagnetic transition temperature TN ~ 1 K. The changes in 1/T1 observed in the paramagnetic state suggest the presence of the complex quantum phenomena under magnetic fields in YbCuS2.

Title: Doped resonating valence bond states: How robust are the spin ice phases in 3D Rydberg arrays
Authors: Jingya Wang, Changle Liu, Yan-Cheng Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Rydberg blockade effect provides a convenient platform for simulating locally constrained many-body systems, such as quantum dimer models and quantum loop models, especially their novel phases like topological orders and gapless quantum spin ice (QSI) phases. To discuss the possible phase diagram containing different QSIs in 3D Rydberg arrays, here, we have constructed an extended Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonian with equal-weight-superposition ground state in different fillings at the RK point. Therefore, both the perfect QSIs with fixed local dimer filling and their monomer-doped states can be simulated directly by Monte Carlo sampling. Using single mode approximation, the excitations of dimers and monomers have also been explored in different fillings. We find that, in the thermodynamical limit, even doping a small amount of monomers can disrupt the topological structure and lead to the existence of off-diagonal long-range order. However, in a finite size (as in cold-atom experiment), the property of QSI will be kept in a certain region like a crossover after doping. The phase diagram containing different QSIs and off-diagonal order phases is proposed.

Title: Nonclassical dynamics of N\'eel vector and magnetization accompanied by THz and high-harmonic radiation from ultrafast-light-driven NiO antiferromagnet insulator
Authors: Federico Garcia-gaitan, Adrian E Feiguin, Branislav K Nikolic
Abstract: Ultrafast-light-driven strongly correlated antiferromagnetic insulators, such as prototypical NiO with large energy gap 4 eV, have recently attracted experimental attention using either above-gap [K. Gillmeister et al., Nat. Commun. 11, 4095 (2020)] or subgap [H. Qiu et al., Nat. Phys. 17, 388 (2021)] energy photons that are of fundamental interest in far-from-equilibrium quantum matter or spintronic applications, respectively. In the latter context, emission of THz radiation is also observed from NiO/Pt bilayers, where heavy metal (HM) Pt introduces strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, microscopic mechanisms of such emission remain obscure because spintronic THz emitters have been amply studied using FM/HM (FM-ferromagnetic metal of conventional type) bilayers, where ultrafast demagnetization takes place and is directly related to THz emission. Conversely, in NiO total magnetization is zero prior to the fs laser pulse (fsLP) application. Here we employ the two-orbital Hubbard-Hund-Heisenberg model and study, via numerically exact nonequilibrium quantum many-body methods, the dynamics of its Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization. Additionally, we compute electromagnetic radiation by both time-dependent magnetization and local charge currents arising in either plain NiO or NiO with proximity SOC introduced by HM layer. Our analysis reveals nonclassical dynamics of Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization, changing only in length while not rotating, where the former is substantially reduced only in the case above-gap fsLP. In the plain NiO case, THz radiation of interest to applications is insignificant, but adding SOC enhances both current and magnetic dipole contributions to it. Above THz range, we find integer high-harmonic generation, as well as unusual noninteger harmonics for above-gap fsLP pump.

Title: Interplay of correlations and Majorana mode from local solution perspective
Authors: Jan Barański, Magdalena Barańska, Tomasz Zienkiewicz, Tadeusz Domański
Abstract: We study the quasiparticle spectrum of a hybrid system, comprising a correlated (Anderson-type) quantum dot coupled to a topological superconducting nanowire hosting the Majorana boundarymodes. From the exact solution of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian, we uncover a subtle interplay between Coulomb repulsion and the Majorana mode. Our analytical expressions show that the spectral weight of the leaking Majorana mode is sensitive to both the quantum dot energy level and the repulsive potential. We compare our results with estimations by L.S. Ricco et al. Phys. Rev. B 99, 155159 (2019) obtained for the same hybrid structure using the Hubbard-type decoupling scheme, and analytically quantify the spectral weight of the zero-energy (topological) mode coexisting with the finite-energy (trivial) states of the quantum dot. We also show that empirical verification of these spectral weights could be feasible through spin-polarized Andreev spectroscopy.

Title: Influence of pressure on properties of multi-gap type-I superconductor BeAu
Authors: Rustem Khasanov, Riccardo Vocaturo, Oleg Janson, Andreas Koitzsch, Ritu Gupta, Debarchan Das, Nicola P.M. Casati, Maia G. Vergniory, Jeroen van den Brink, Eteri Svanidze
Abstract: We report on studies of the superconducting and normal state properties of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor BeAu under hydrostatic pressure conditions. The room-temperature equation of state (EOS) reveals the values of the bulk modulus ($B_0$) and its first derivative ($B^\prime_0$) at ambient pressure to be $B_0 \simeq 132$~GPa and $B^\prime_0 \simeq 30$, respectively. Up to the highest pressures studied ($p \simeq 2.2$~GPa), BeAu remains a multi-gap type-I superconductor. The analysis of $B_{\rm c}(T, p)$ data within the self-consistent two-gap approach suggests the presence of two superconducting energy gaps, with the gap-to-$T_{\rm c}$ ratios $\Delta_1/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} \sim 2.3$ and $\Delta_2/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} \sim 1.1$ for the larger and smaller gaps, respectively [$\Delta = \Delta(0)$ is the zero-temperature value of the gap and $k_{\rm B}$ is the Boltzmann constant]. With increasing pressure, $\Delta_1/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$ increases while $\Delta_2/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$ decreases, suggesting that pressure enhances (weakens) the coupling strength between the superconducting carriers within the bands where the larger (smaller) superconducting energy gap has opened. The superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$, \textcolor{black}{the zero-temperature values of the superconducting gaps $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$} and the zero-temperature value of the thermodynamic critical field $B_{\rm c}(0)$ decrease with increasing pressure, with the rates of ${\rm d}T_{\rm c}/{\rm d}p \simeq -0.195$~K/GPa, \textcolor{black}{${\rm d}\Delta_1/{\rm d}p \simeq -0.034$~meV/GPa, ${\rm d}\Delta_2/{\rm d}p \simeq -0.029$~meV/GPa,} and ${\rm d}B_{\rm c}(0)/{\rm d}p = -2.65(1)$~mT/GPa, respectively. The measured $B_{\rm c}(0)$ values plotted as a function of $T_{\rm c}$ follow an empirical scaling relation established for conventional type-I superconductors.

Title: Tuning the surface energy of fluorinated diamond-like carbon coatings via plasma immersion ion implantation plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition with 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane
Authors: Yuhan Tong, Maryam Zahedian, Aiping Zeng, Ricardo Vidrio, Mike Efremov, Shenwei Yin, Hongyan Mei, Patrick Heaney, Jennifer T. Choy
Abstract: We demonstrate an environmentally friendly and scalable method to create fluorine-doped diamond-like carbon (F-DLC) coatings using plasma immersion ion implantation plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PIII-PECVD) with 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. F-DLC films tend to have low wettability and good mechanical flexibility, which make them suitable for applications in biomedical devices and antibiofouling surfaces. We report on the effects of fluorine incorporation on the surface chemistry, surface energy, and morphology of these coatings, showing that our method is effective in increasing the fluorine content in the F-DLC up to 40%. We show that the addition of fluorine leads to a decrease in surface energy, which is consistent with a reduction in surface wettability.

Title: A Microcanonical Inflection Point Analysis via Parametric Curves and its Relation to the Zeros of the Partition Function
Authors: Julio Cesar Siqueira Rocha, Rodrigo Alves Dias, Bismarck Vaz da Costa
Abstract: In statistical physics, phase transitions are arguably among the most extensively studied phenomena. In the computational approach to this field, the development of algorithms capable of estimating entropy across the entire energy spectrum in a single execution has highlighted the efficacy of microcanonical inflection point analysis, while Fisher zeros technique has re-emerged as a powerful methodology for investigating these phenomena. This paper presents an alternative protocol for analyzing phase transitions based on parametric microcanonical curves. We also provide a clear demonstration of the relation of the linear pattern of the Fisher's zeros on the complex inverse temperature map (a circle in the complex $x=e^{-\beta \varepsilon}$ map) with the order of the transition, showing that the specific heat is inversely related to the distance between the zeros. We study various model systems, including the Lennard-Jones cluster, the Ising, the XY, and the Zeeman models, illustrating the characterization of first-order, second-order, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions, respectively. By examining the behavior of thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and its derivatives in the microcanonical ensemble, we identify key features - such as loops and discontinuities in parametric curves - which signal phase transitions' presence and nature. We are confident that this approach can facilitate the classification of phase transitions across various physical systems.

Title: Superlubric Motion of Wave-like Domain Walls in Sliding Ferroelectrics
Authors: Changming Ke, Fucai Liu, Shi Liu
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectrics constructed from stacked nonpolar monolayers enable out-of-plane polarization in two dimensions with exceptional properties, including ultrafast switching speeds and fatigue-free behavior. However, the widely accepted switching mechanism, which posits synchronized long-distance in-plane translation of entire atomic layers driven by an out-of-plane electric field, has shown inconsistencies with experimental observations. We demonstrate that this spinodal decomposition-like homogeneous switching process violates Neumann's principle and is unlikely to occur due to symmetry constraint. Instead, symmetry-breaking domain walls (DWs) and the tensorial nature of Born effective charges are critical for polarization reversal, underscoring the quantum nature of sliding ferroelectrics. Using the Bernal-stacked $h$-BN bilayer as a model system, we discover that the coherent propagation of wide, wave-like domain walls is the key mechanism for ferroelectric switching. This mechanism fundamentally differs from the layer-by-layer switching associated with narrow domain walls, which has been established for over sixty years in perovskite ferroelectrics. Moreover, these wave-like DWs exhibit superlubric dynamics, achieving ultrahigh velocities of approximately 4000 m/s at room temperature and displaying an anomalous cooling-promoted switching speed. The unexpected emergence of DW superlubricity in sliding ferroelectrics presents new avenues for enhancing key performance metrics and offers exciting opportunities for applications in cryogenic environments.

Title: Impact of Fixing Spins in a Quantum Annealer with Energy Rescaling
Authors: Tomohiro Hattori, Hirotaka Irie, Tadashi Kadowaki, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.

Title: Superconductivity of the hybrid Ruddlesden-Popper La5Ni3O11 single crystals under high pressure

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 under high pressure indicates that the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates Rn+1NinO3n+1 (R = rare earth) is a new material family for high-temperature superconductivity. Exploring the superconductivity of other RP or hybrid RP phase nickelates under high pressure has become an urgent and interesting issue. Here, we report a novel hybrid RP nickelate superconductor of La5Ni3O11. The hybrid RP nickelate La5Ni3O11 is formed by alternative stacking of La3Ni2O7 with n=2 and La2NiO4 with n=1 along the c axis. The transport and magnetic torque measurements indicate a density-wave transition at approximately 170 K near ambient pressure, which is highly similar to both La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10. With increasing pressure, high-pressure transport measurements reveal that the density-wave transition temperature (TDW) continuously increases to approximately 210 K with increasing pressure up to 12 GPa before the appearance of pressure-induced superconductivity, and the density-wave transition abruptly fades out in a first-order manner at approximately 12 GPa. The optimal superconductivity with Tconset = 64 K and Tczero = 54 K is achieved at approximately 21 GPa. On the other hand, high-pressure X-ray diffraction experiments reveal a structural phase transition from an orthorhombic structure to a tetragonal structure at approximately 4.5 GPa. In contrast to La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10, the pressure-induced structural transition has no significant effect on either the density-wave transition or the superconductivity, suggesting a minor role of lattice degree of freedom in La5Ni3O11. The present discovery extends the superconducting member in the RP nickelate family and sheds new light on the superconducting mechanism.

Title: Enhancement of Electric Drive in Silicon Quantum Dots with Electric Quadrupole Spin Resonance

Abstract: Quantum computation with electron spin qubits requires coherent and efficient manipulation of these spins, typically accomplished through the application of alternating magnetic or electric fields for electron spin resonance (ESR). In particular, electrical driving allows us to apply localized fields on the electrons, which benefits scale-up architectures. However, we have found that Electric Dipole Spin Resonance (EDSR) is insufficient for modeling the Rabi behavior in recent experimental studies. Therefore, we propose that the electron spin is being driven by a new method of electric spin qubit control which generalizes the spin dynamics by taking into account a quadrupolar contribution of the quantum dot: electric quadrupole spin resonance (EQSR). In this work, we explore the electric quadrupole driving of a quantum dot in silicon, specifically examining the cases of 5 and 13 electron occupancies.

Title: Electrically induced bulk and edge excitations in the fractional quantum Hall regime
Authors: Quentin France, Yunhyeon Jeong, Akinori Kamiyama, Takaaki Mano, Ken-ichi Sasaki, Masahiro Hotta, Go Yusa
Abstract: We apply a voltage pulse to electrically excite the incompressible region of a two-dimensional electron liquid in the $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall state and investigate the collective excitations in both the edge and bulk via photoluminescence spectral energy shifts. Introducing an offset in the voltage pulse significantly enhances the excitation signal. Real-space and time-resolved measurements reveal the dynamics of the bulk excitations, with an estimated group velocity of approximately $3 \times 10^4$ m/s. These bulk excitations align well with the magneto-plasmon model. Our results highlight the topological link between edge and bulk states, providing a novel approach to exploring solid-state analogs of quantum gravity.

Title: Surface tension of Bose-Einstein condensate at finite temperature
Authors: Nguyen Van Thu
Abstract: We examine the influence of nonzero temperature on a bounded surface of a dilute Bose gas confined by a hard wall, utilizing the Gross-Pitaevskii theory and the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation to describe surface excitations. The theoretical calculations are compared with experimental data for liquid helium II, demonstrating excellent agreement. An empirical relation is found for the temperature-dependence of the surface tension. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the contribution of surface excitations remains below 0.7\% in the most of recent experiments on Bose-Einstein condensate.

Title: University of percolation at dynamic pseudocritical point
Authors: Qiyuan Shi, Shuo Wei, Youjin Deng, Ming Li
Abstract: Universality, encompassing critical exponents, scaling functions, and dimensionless quantities, is fundamental to phase transition theory. In finite systems, universal behaviors are also expected to emerge at the pseudocritical point. Focusing on two-dimensional percolation, we show that the size distribution of the largest cluster asymptotically approaches to a Gumbel form in the subcritical phase, a Gaussian form in the supercritical phase, and transitions within the critical finite-size scaling window. Numerical results indicate that, at consistently defined pseudocritical points, this distribution exhibits a universal form across various lattices and percolation models (bond or site), within error bars, yet differs from the distribution at the critical point. The critical polynomial, universally zero for two-dimensional percolation at the critical point, becomes nonzero at pseudocritical points. Nevertheless, numerical evidence suggests that the critical polynomial, along with other dimensionless quantities such as wrapping probabilities and Binder cumulants, assumes fixed values at the pseudocritical point that are independent of the percolation type (bond or site) but vary with lattice structures. These findings imply that while strict universality breaks down at the pseudocritical point, certain extreme-value statistics and dimensionless quantities exhibit quasi-universality, revealing a subtle connection between scaling behaviors at critical and pseudocritical points.

Title: Binary Bosonic Mixtures with Pair Hopping in Synthetic Dimension: Phase Transitions and Demixing Effects
Authors: Chenrong Liu, Zhi Lin
Abstract: We employ the cluster Gutzwiller mean-field method to investigate the ground-state phase diagrams and demixing effects in binary boson mixtures with pair hopping in synthetic dimensions. Our study reveals two novel interspecies paired superfluid phases: the paired super-counter-fluid (PSCF) phase, featuring pairs of two particles of one species and two holes of the other, and the SCF* phase, which combines PSCF and super-counter-fluid (SCF) orders. These phases provide new insights into XY ferromagnet states from a pseudo-spin perspective, with SCF* and PSCF states corresponding to different XY ferromagnet phases depending on particle filling. We also identify a quantum quadruple critical point in the interexchange asymmetric case. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mixed-demixed critical point is phase-dependent due to pairing hopping, differing from normal two-component bosonic systems. Experimental schemes to observe these novel phases are proposed.

Title: Exact height distribution in one-dimensional Edwards-Wilkinson interface with diffusing diffusivity
Authors: David S. Dean, Satya N. Majumdar, Sanjib Sabhapandit
Abstract: We study the height distribution of a one-dimensional Edwards-Wilkinson interface in the presence of a stochastic diffusivity $D(t)=B^2(t)$, where $B(t)$ represents a one-dimensional Brownian motion at time $t$. The height distribution at a fixed point is space is computed analytically. The typical height $h(x,t)$ at a given point in space is found to scale as $t^{3/4}$ and the distribution $G(H)$ of the scaled height $H=h/t^{3/4}$ is symmetric but with a nontrivial shape: while it approaches a nonzero constant quadratically as $H\to 0$, it has a non-Gaussian tail that decays exponentially for large $H$. We show that this exponential tail is rather robust and holds for a whole family of linear interface models parametrized by a dynamical exponent $z>1$, with $z=2$ corresponding to the Edwards-Wilkinson model.

Title: Designing Bimetallic Nanoparticle Catalysts via Tailored Surface Segregation
Authors: Yaxin Tang, Mingao Hou, Qian He, Guangfu Luo
Abstract: Bimetallic nanoparticles serve as a vital class of catalysts with tunable properties suitable for diverse catalytic reactions, yet a comprehensive understanding of their structural evolution under operational conditions as well as their optimal design principles remains elusive. In this study, we unveil a prevalent surface segregation phenomenon in approximately 100 platinum-group-element-based bimetallic nanoparticles through molecular dynamics simulations and derive a thermodynamic descriptor to predict this behavior. Building on the generality and predictability of surface segregation, we propose leveraging this phenomenon to intentionally enrich the nanoparticle surface with noble-metal atoms, thereby significantly reducing their usage while maintaining high catalytic activity and stability. To validate this strategy, we investigate dozens of platinum-based bimetallic nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation catalysis using first-principles calculations. Through a systematic examination of the catalytic sites on nanoparticle surfaces, we eventually identify several candidates featuring with stable Pt-enriched surface and superior catalytic activity, confirming the feasibility of this approach.

Title: Renormalization-group approach to the Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity: Amplification of the pairing gap from $\ell^4$ to $\ell$
Authors: Yuki Fujimoto
Abstract: We revisit the renormalization group (RG) analysis of the Kohn-Luttinger (KL) mechanism for superconductivity. The KL mechanism leads to superconductivity in a system with a repulsive bare interaction. The key ingredient is the screening effect that renders the induced interaction attractive in channels with nonzero angular momentum $\ell \neq 0$, thereby triggering the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) instability. According to the original argument, the resulting gap is exponentially small, with its exponent scaling as $-\ell^4$. However, the KL mechanism was originally formulated within perturbation theory, where the series is known to converge poorly in certain cases -- most notably, for the p-wave paring gap induced by a repulsive s-wave contact interaction. This poor convergence may be attributed to a divergent integrand in a specific class of diagrams containing both the BCS logarithm and the Kohn anomaly, suggesting that one must resum the Kohn anomaly contributions separately from the BCS logarithm. In this work, we incorporate the Kohn anomaly contribution into the beta function of the RG equation governing the BCS instability near the Fermi surface. Our solution shows that the KL gap exponent is then proportional to $-\ell$, indicating a significant enhancement of the KL mechanism beyond the previously known result. To illustrate this, we study the spin-triplet p-wave pairing gap arising from a repulsive s-wave contact interaction and compare our RG-based results with those obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in perturbation theory.

Title: Temperature dependence of nonlinear elastic moduli of polystyrene
Authors: Andrey V. Belashov, Anna A. Zhikhoreva, Yaroslav M. Beltukov, Irina V. Semenova
Abstract: Nonlinear elastic properties of polymers and polymeric composites are essential for accurate prediction of their response to dynamic loads, which is crucial in a wide range of applications. These properties can be affected by strain rate, temperature, and pressure. The temperature susceptibility of nonlinear elastic moduli of polymers remains poorly understood. We have recently observed a significant frequency dependence of the nonlinear elastic (Murnaghan) moduli of polystyrene. In this paper we expand this analysis by the temperature dependence. The measurement methodology was based on the acousto-elastic effect, and involved analysis of the dependencies of velocities of longitudinal and shear single-frequency ultrasonic waves in the sample on the applied static pressure. Measurements were performed at different temperatures in the range of 25-65 °C and at different frequencies in the range of 0.75-3 MHz. The temperature susceptibility of the nonlinear moduli $l$ and $m$ was found to be two orders of magnitude larger than that of linear moduli $\lambda$ and $\mu$. At the same time, the observed variations of $n$ modulus with temperature were low and within the measurement tolerance. The observed tendencies can be explained by different influence of pressure on relaxation processes in the material at different temperatures.

Title: Phase dependence of the Thermal Memory Effect in Polycrystalline Ribbon and Bulk Ni55Fe19Ga26 Heusler Alloys
Authors: A. Vidal-Crespo, A.F. Manchón-Gordón, J.M. Martín-Olalla, F.J. Romero, J.J. Ipus, M.C. Gallardo, J.S. Blázquez, C.F. Conde
Abstract: The thermal memory effect, TME, has been studied in Ni55Fe19Ga26 shape memory alloys, fabricated as ribbons via melt-spinning and as pellets via arc-melting, to evaluate its dependence on the martensitic structure and the macrostructure of the samples. When the reverse martensitic transformation is interrupted, a kinetic delay in the subsequent complete transformation is only evident in the ribbon samples, where the 14M modulated structure is the dominant phase. In contrast, degradation of the modulated structure or the presence of the gamma-phase significantly reduces the observed TME. In such cases, the magnitude of the TME approaches the detection limits of commercial calorimeters, and only high-resolution calorimeter at very low heating rate (40 mK h-1) can show the effect. Following the kinetic arrest and subsequent cooling, the reverse martensitic transformation was completed at several heating rates to confirm the athermal nature of the phenomenon.

Title: Spontaneous emergence of run-and-tumble-like dynamics in coupled self-propelled robots: experiment and theory
Authors: Somnath Paramanick, Umashankar Pardhi, Harsh Soni, Nitin Kumar
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the motility behaviour of microorganisms, we introduce a highly tunable, robotic system self-actuating into the run-and-tumble (RT)-like motion. It comprises two disk-shaped, centimeter-scale programmable robots individually programmed to perform overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion and connected by a rigid rod. The rod is attached to pivot points located on off-centered, mirror-symmetric points on each robot, allowing for its free rotation at both ends. We show that the collective dynamics of this system execute RT-like motion with characteristic sharp tumble events and exponentially distributed run times, similar to those observed in microorganisms. We further quantify emerging dynamics in terms of tumbling frequency and tune it over a wide range of experimental parameters. We also develop a theoretical model that reproduces our experimental results and elucidates the underlying physical mechanisms governing the rich phase behavior of RT motion. Together, these results highlight the importance of our robotic platform in offering valuable insights into the mechanism of motility characteristics in microorganisms.

Title: Polarizing altermagnets by ultrafast asymmetric spin dynamics
Authors: Zhaobo Zhou, Sangeeta Sharma, John Kay Dewhurst, Junjie He
Abstract: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This polarization arises from the momentum-dependent spin splitting, which is unique to altermagnets, and which induces a momentum-dependent optical intersite spin transfer effect. Furthermore, the ferrimagnetic polarization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. The excitation along the spin-polarized planes breaks the symmetry of the momentum-space magnetization distribution, leading to inequivalent spin-resolved charge transfer between sublattices across both momentum and real space. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferri-magnetic state.

Title: Generalized Lanczos method for systematic optimization of neural-network quantum states
Authors: Jia-Qi Wang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the reinforcement learning part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through reinforcement learning, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.

Title: High-Performance Nonvolatile Spin FETs from 2D Metallic Ferromagnetic and Ferroelectric Multiferroic Heterostructure
Authors: B. Liu, X. Zhang, W. Hou, H. Feng, Zhengei Dai, Zhi-Xin Guo
Abstract: All-electric-controlled nonvolatile spin field-effect transistors (SFETs) based on two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures hold great promise for advanced spintronics applications. However, their performance is hindered by the limited availability of 2D magnetic materials that can switch effectively between metallic and semiconducting states with sizable bandgaps controlled by ferroelectric polarization. Most studies have focused on materials that are naturally semiconducting, achieving a metallic state by modifying the ferroelectric polarization. In this work, we introduce an innovative approach that uses interface effects to convert inherently metallic 2D magnetic materials into half-metals and induce half-semiconducting behavior through changes in ferroelectric polarization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the CrPS3/Sc2CO2 heterostructure demonstrate that the ferroelectric polarization of Sc2CO2 monolayers can adjust the electronic structure of CrPS3, enabling a switch from half-metallic to half-semiconducting states. Building on these insights, we designed a nonvolatile SFET and analyzed its transport properties using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method combined with DFT. Our results show that reversing the ferroelectric polarization achieves an on/off current ratio exceeding 5000000%, and the heterostructure generates nearly 100% spin-polarized current with a current density of up to 6500 {\mu}A/{\mu}m at bias voltage below 0.2 V. These findings highlight a promising pathway for developing high-performance SFETs that surpass existing 2D heterojunction materials.

Title: Interfacial chemistry meets magnetism: comparison of $Co/Fe_3O_4$ and $Co/{\alpha}-Fe_2O_3$ epitaxial heterostructures
Authors: Ewa Madej, Natalia Kwiatek-Maroszek, Kinga Freindl, Józef Korecki, Ewa Młyńczak, Dorota Wilgocka-Ślęzak, Marcin Zając, Jan Zawała, Nika Spiridis
Abstract: The magnetic and chemical structure of metal/oxide interfaces were studied in cobalt/magnetite, $Fe_3O_4$, and cobalt/hematite, ${\alpha}-Fe_2O_3$, epitaxial heterostructures using the comprehensive selection of microscopic and spectroscopic methods. It was observed that the cobalt nanostructures and ultrathin films were oxidized at both interfaces, with a thicker cobalt oxide layer in the system with hematite. The formation of cobalt oxides was accompanied by the interfacial reduction of iron that modified magnetic properties of the iron oxides layers. In particular, uncompensated magnetic moments appear in antiferromagnetic hematite, and the orbital magnetic moment of Co grown on magnetite is significantly enhanced for thicknesses below 1 nm. Synchrotron magnetic microscopy showed a direct correlation in the domain structures of the cobalt/iron oxides: ferromagnetic coupling between cobalt and magnetite and between cobalt and the magnetically modified layer of hematite.

Title: Universal fluctuations of localized two interacting particles in one dimension
Authors: Sen Mu, Gabriel Lemarié, Jiangbin Gong
Abstract: We investigate the universal fluctuations of localized wavefunction in the Fock space of two interacting particles in one-dimensional disordered systems, focusing on the interplay between random potentials and random long-range interactions. By mapping the system onto a directed polymer problem, we show that random potentials alone produce correlated energies for the sites in the Fock space, giving rise to the fluctuation growth exponent 1/2. Introducing random long-range interactions alters these correlations and drives the system's fluctuations into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in (1+1)D with the exponent 1/3. To validate the universality of the observed fluctuation scaling, we study a complex directed polymer model with competing point and columnar disorder. Our results confirm that columnar disorder corresponds to on-site energies in the Fock space from the random potentials, while point disorder models the effects of random long-range interactions between the two particles. These findings provide new insights into the Fock-space perspective for examining disordered quantum many-body systems, and emphasize the critical role of disorder structure in determining the universality class of fluctuations in localized quantum systems.

Title: How to stay on the physical branch in self-consistent many-electron approaches
Authors: Herbert Eßl, Matthias Reitner, Evgeny Kozik, Alessandro Toschi
Abstract: We derive the mathematical condition under which the physical solution of the many-electron problem, obtained by self-consistent approaches, becomes unstable upon increasing interaction strength. The validity of our criterion is explicitly verified by performing self-consistent calculations of basic interacting models. In this context, we eventually unveiled the precise connection linking the misleading convergence of self-consistent schemes to the multivaluedness of the Luttinger-Ward functional as well as to the divergences of the irreducible vertex function. Our analysis also explains how a misleading convergence of self-consistent approximations can occur even in parameter regions without vertex divergences. Even more importantly, it allows us to define a general procedure for stabilizing the physical solution, when it is unstable in conventional self-consistent schemes.

Title: Accelerated recrystallization of nanocrystalline films as a manifestation of the inner size effect of the diffusion coefficient
Authors: S. Petrushenko, S. Dukarov, M. Fijalkowski, V. Sukhov
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the recrystallization of 100 nm thick polycrystalline films of copper and silver. It is found that in copper films deposited by the thermal evaporation method onto a substrate at room temperature, a bimodal crystallite size distribution with maxima at 15 and 35 nm is observed. The bimodal distribution in copper films is preserved during annealing, which leads to a shift of both peaks of the crystallite size distribution histograms to the larger sizes region. In contrast to Cu, micron-sized crystallites are present even in as-deposited Ag films besides the nanosized fraction. These grains are formed due to the phenomenon of self-annealing and weakly evolve during heating owing to grain growth stagnation. The nanosized fraction in as-deposited Ag films is represented by crystallites with the most probable size of 25 nm, which increases to 50 nm as a result of short-term annealing at the temperature of 250°C. The grain-boundary diffusion coefficient was determined, which is more than 10-18 m2/s for both films of metals. The obtained value indicates a multiple intensification of self-diffusion processes in films, the thickness of which allows us to refer them to macroscopic sample

Title: Extended string-net models with all anyons at finite temperature
Authors: André O. Soares, Anna Ritz-Zwilling, Jean-Noël Fuchs
Abstract: String-net models describe a vast family of topological orders in two spatial dimensions, but fail to produce all the expected anyonic excitations. Following arXiv:1502.03433, we consider an extended string-net model by attaching one tail to each plaquette of the lattice, allowing all anyons to emerge as elementary plaquette excitations for arbitrary input categories. The corresponding tube algebra is the mathematical tool needed to construct the anyons from the input category and to obtain their internal multiplicities. We use them to compute the energy level degeneracies and the partition function. In the thermodynamic limit, the latter is dominated by the trivial (vacuum) anyon, so that the topological order is destroyed at any non-zero temperature. In a finite-size system, order survives up to a finite temperature, similarly to the one-dimensional classical Ising model. We confirm this by computing thermal averages of topological projectors, Wegner-Wilson loops and the topological mutual information. The results are also generalized to models with multiple tails per plaquette.

Title: Quantum Geometric Origin of Strain-Induced Ferroelectric Phase Transitions
Authors: Jiaming Hu, Ziye Zhu, Yubo Yuan, Wenbin Li, Hua Wang, Kai Chang
Abstract: Strain-regulated ferroelectric (FE) materials have long attracted significant attention due to their diverse applications. While soft-phonon theory and the (pseudo) Jahn-Teller effect have achieved considerable success in providing phenomenological descriptions and general understanding, the detailed connection between these perspectives and their microscopic dependence on strain regulation remains unclear. Here, under the framework of density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), we demonstrate that the Berry curvature of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) plays a pivotal role in the interatomic force matrix (IFM). A subsequent model analysis shows that external strain can reverse the polarity of the EPC Berry curvature in (quasi)-degenerate electronic subsystems through band inversion, thereby directly leading to phonon softening. The general theory is then applied to the BiOCl monolayer as a benchmark, which offers an accurate description of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This mechanism is further observed across a broad range of materials through ab initio calculations, providing an insightful perspective on EPC quantum geometry in lattice dynamics and FE phase transitions.

Title: Axionic Acoustic Phonons
Authors: Joan Bernabeu, Alberto Cortijo
Abstract: The sound propagation properties resulting from a dynamical axion insulator generated from a Weyl semimetal are explored. Due to the axial electron-phonon coupling, the speed of sound in the material and its attenuation is seen to be modified. At the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) level, it is seen that the axion obstructs a stronger modification of the speed of sound for longitudinal waves propagating parallel to the Axionic Charge Density Wave (ACDW) wavevector but not for transverse waves. On the other hand, the attenuation is modified by effects beyond the RPA, but the axionic contribution is negligible. These effects can be probed in sound propagation experiments without invoking the axial anomaly, which would require an additional electric field. We also discuss the importance of axial electron-phonon interactions with respect to the more conventional vector interactions in these systems.

Title: Dependence of the energy and orbital structure of local states in CuO monolayer on Coulomb parameters
Authors: I. A. Makarov (1), M. M. Korshunov (1), S. G. Ovchinnikov (1) ((1) Kirensky Institute of Physics, Federal Research Center KSC SB RAS, Russia, Krasnoyarsk)
Abstract: The dependence of the energies and orbital structure of local states in the CuO monolayer on intra- and interatomic Coulomb interactions on copper and oxygen orbitals is studied. The electronic system is described within the eight-band p-d model in the hole representation with the on-site energies and hopping integrals obtained using density functional theory. CuO cluster multiparticle eigenstates are calculated using exact diagonalization. The difference between the energy dependencies on the Coulomb parameters for the states with the predominant probability density on the d-orbital and the states in which hole occupies p-orbitals leads to crossover of d- and p-states. The ground single-hole and two-hole states which determine the electronic structure of the low-energy excitations have the character of d- or p-orbitals in the different regions of the Coulomb parameters space. The gap between the energies of the dispersionless quasiparticles forming the top of the valence band and conductivity band also have different values in these two regions. The magnitude of this gap and the orbital character of the local multiparticle states change sharply even with an insignificant change in the Coulomb interactions within the boundary region of parameters between the regions in which the local states are formed by the d- or p-orbitals.

Title: Fracture in concrete: X-ray tomography with in-situ testing, digital volume correlation and phase-field modeling
Authors: Akanksha Mishra, Pietro Carrara, Michele Griffa, Laura De Lorenzis
Abstract: We test and simulate the mesoscopic cracking behavior of specimens made of a standard concrete mixture. To this end, we combine stable wedge-splitting fracture experiments performed during X-ray tomography, their analysis with digital volume correlation providing the full three-dimensional displacement field, and phase-field cohesive fracture modeling. In our computations, we apply the measured boundary conditions and model the actual heterogeneous material structure at the mesoscopic scale. Within the phase-field model, we explicitly distinguish among (thus individually represent) the mesostructural features of distinct material phases with size above a threshold of 1 mm, while we homogenize pores and finer aggregates below this threshold within the cementitious mortar matrix, with material parameters characterized accordingly. We compare experimental and numerical results in terms of both local and global quantities.

Title: Damage of bilayer structure in La3Ni2O7-d induced by high pO2 annealing
Authors: Yulin Zhang, Cuiying Pei, Ning Guo, Longlong Fan, Mingxin Zhang, Lingzhen Wang, Gongting Zhang, Feiyu Li, Yunong Wang, Chao Ma, Wenyong Cheng, Shanpeng Wang, Qiang Zheng, Yanpeng Qi, Junjie Zhang
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity with onset temperature of ~80 K in pressurized bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper La3Ni2O7-d has attracted much attention. Despite intense research, determination of the exact oxygen content and understanding of the relationship between superconductivity and oxygen content remain a big challenge. Here, we report a systematical study on the structure and physical properties of La3Ni2O7-d polycrystalline powders which were prepared using sol-gel method at ambient pressure and then annealed under various oxygen pressure. We found that high pO2 annealing with slow cooling results in a new phase, which can be modeled using the hybrid single-layer-trilayer La3Ni2O7 or the tetragonal bilayer La3Ni2O7. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements revealed significant single layers and trilayers after high oxygen pressure annealing, evidencing damage of the bilayer structure. The superconducting transition under high pressure became weak for high pO2 annealed samples, which is consistent with the damage of the bilayer structure. Our results reveal that the bilayer structure is fragile and post-annealing under near atmosphere pressure of oxygen is suitable to maintain bilayer structure and increase oxygen content at the same time.

Title: Emergence of single-particle mobility edge (SPME) in a ladder network under a modified Aubrey-Andre-Harper (AAH) kind distortion
Authors: Arpita Goswami
Abstract: This research examines the localization and delocalization phenomena in a two-strand ladder network incorporating a generalized Aubrey-Andre-Harper (AAH) model in different parametric regions. In our model, we have introduced a distortion that is neither periodic (Bloch-type) nor random (Anderson-type) but instead has a slowly varying pseudorandom pattern described by {\Gamma}n = {\lambda}cos(2{\pi}Qn^{\nu}), where 0 < {\nu} < 1. We have demonstrated that in the generalized ladder network in the 0 < {\nu} < 1 limit, it is not possible to see a pure metal-insulator transition due to the presence of a single particle mobility edge (SPME) state. We have shown that at {\nu} = 0.908 (and in its immediate neighborhood), the energy states maintain delocalization up to a considerable distortion strength and that a pure metal-to-insulator transition occurs at {\nu} = 1 as {\lambda} increases. We have also demonstrated the phase diagram for the ladder network in the parametric region {\nu}-{\lambda}. We extensively studied wave packet dynamics by examining different quantities to establish the claim satisfactorily. We also have studied the multifractality of the quantum network. These findings suggest that this ladder network could serve as a valuable platform for investigating the interplay between localized and extended states.

Title: (Anti-)Altermagnetism from Orbital Ordering in the Ruddlesden-Popper Chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$
Authors: Quintin N. Meier, Alberto Carta, Claude Ederer, Andrés Cano
Abstract: Altermagnets form a subclass of collinear antiferromagnets with spin-split electronic states. Here, we introduce the Ruddlesden-Popper chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ (including the perovskite SrCrO$_3$) as candidates for antiferromagnetic materials in which altermagnetism emerges from spontaneous orbital ordering, rather than crystal symmetry. Using first-principles calculations, we identify a layer-dependent spin splitting of the electronic states, driven by the interplay between spin and orbital order. We show that if the spin and orbital orders align in adjacent layers, the system exhibits a net spin splitting, and thus altermagnetism. In contrast, if either the spin or the orbital order is reversed in adjacent layers, we observe an anti-altermagnetic state where layerwise compensation leads to net zero spin splitting. We find that for odd $n$, altermagnetic and anti-altermagnetic phases can coexist, whereas for even $n$ and in the perovskite limit, the system remains strictly anti-altermagnetic. In both cases, increasing $n$ favors metallicity. Finally, we indicate that in odd $n$ compounds, epitaxial strain can promote the altermagnetic phase.

Title: Origin of phonon decoherence
Authors: Yiming Pan, Christoph Emeis, Stephan Jauernik, Michael Bauer, Fabio Caruso
Abstract: Phonon decoherence determines the characteristic timescales over which coherent lattice vibrations decay, making it a crucial process for understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of crystal lattices after excitation by a pump pulse. Here, we report a theoretical and computational investigation of the origin of phonon decoherence within a first-principles many-body framework. We derive quantum kinetic equations for the dynamics of coherent phonons by explicitly accounting for dissipation processes induced by electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions. The decoherence rate and frequency renormalization are formulated in terms of the non-equilibrium phonon self energy, providing a framework amenable for ab initio calculations. To validate this approach, we conduct a first-principles study of phonon decoherence for the elemental semimetals antimony and bismuth. The robust agreement with available temperature- and fluence-dependent experimental data confirms the accuracy of our theoretical and computational framework. More generally, our findings reveal that either electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling can prevail in determining the decoherence time, depending on the temperature and driving conditions. Overall, this work fills a critical gap in the theoretical understanding of phonon decoherence, providing a predictive framework for determining the timescales of light-induced structural dynamics in driven solids.

Title: Multiphysics simulations of microstructure influence on hysteresis and eddy current losses of electrical steel
Authors: Patrick Kühn, Yangyiwei Yang, Guanyu Chen, Shanelle N. Foster, Herbert Egger, Bai-Xiang Xu
Abstract: Improving efficiency of electrical machines requires fundamental knowledge on the mechanisms behind magnetic and eddy current losses of the magnetic core materials, with Fe-Si alloy as a prototype. These losses are intrinsically influenced by the microstructure of the materials. This necessitates physics-based, microstructure-informed multiscale simulations. In the present paper, we utilised micromagnetic simulations and computational homogenization methods to calculate the effective hysteresis and effective conductivities of Fe-Si electrical steels. To demonstrate the methodology, binder-jet printed electrical steel material samples with different microstructure were investigated. The microstructure samples were digitized based on both the descriptor-based synthetic reconstruction and SEM-image-based digitization. More samples were generated with varying microstructure features such as grain size and grain boundary phases. The micromagnetic simulations were then performed to investigate the magnetic hysteresis and hysteresis loss. The eddy current loss was also evaluated by using the effective conductivity through computational homogenization. By performing parameter research on a series of synthetic microstructures, effects of average grain size and grain boundary (GB) phase thickness on the hysteresis loss and eddy current loss were unveiled. An average grain size around 120 \si{\micro m} has the lowest hysteresis loss, although the eddy current loss increases with the grain size. Increasing GB-phase thickness helps reduce both losses. Results indicate the potential to decrease loss of magnetic core materials by microstructure optimization.

Title: Searching for fixed points of dynamical systems by the Explorative Relaxation Reditribution Method
Authors: Eliodoro Chiavazzo
Abstract: Being able to effectively locate saddle (and other fixed) points in dynamical systems holds tremendous implications in a number of applications in engineering and science, among which the study of rare events in molecular simulations stands as one of the most prominent field of interest. Although there is a vast literature on methods aiming at addressing this challenge, open issues still remain in several aspects such as computational efficiency and easy implementation. In this work, we suggest that the Relaxation Redistribution Method (RRM) - formerly introduced to solve the invariance equation in the context of stiff dynamical systems ruling detailed chemical kinetics - can be reformulated to locate saddle and other fixed points even for stochastic simulators driven by effective energy gradients. This new formulation of the RRM is referred to as the Explorative Relaxation Redistribution Method (ERRM). Benchmarks based on the popular Mueller-Brown and other potentials are used to test the ERRM.

Title: Grain Boundary Segregation and Embrittlement of Aluminum Binary Alloys from First Principles
Authors: Nutth Tuchinda, Gregory B. Olson, Christopher A. Schuh
Abstract: Grain boundary segregation controls properties of polycrystalline materials such as their susceptibility to intergranular cracking. It is of interest to engineer alloy chemistry to enhance grain boundary cohesion to prevent intergranular failure. While there is collectively a large first-principles dataset for grain boundary embrittlement in multiple Al-based binary alloys, the methodologies used for the first principles calculations, as well as the analyzed fracture paths, are variable amongst studies. Here, we reevaluate and compute grain boundary segregation and embrittlement from all-electron first-principles for the {\Sigma}5[001](210) Al grain boundary. We explicitly evaluate multiple fracture paths, and provide a study case of the chemical trends of the preferred fracture paths across 69 binary Al alloys. The results suggest that neglecting certain low energy fracture paths can lead to errors of estimating embrittlement potency up to the order of 1 eV per solute atom, especially for multiple d-block transition metal solutes that are of engineering interest. The database calculated here also permits a comprehensive comparison between all-electron and pseudopotential methodologies. The effects of Hubbard U density functional theory on grain boundary segregation and embrittlement in Al(Sc) are found not to be significant in terms of the relative energetic calculations of grain boundaries and free surfaces (differences are of order 0.1 eV or less).

Abstract: We report the magnetic, magnetodielectric, and electric polarization properties of single crystals of the Co-based Kitaev Spin Liquid (KSL) candidate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ (NCTO). The sample shows magnetic transitions at 26 K, 16 K, and 5 K, consistent with the literature. The magnetic measurements along and perpendicular to the Co-honeycomb planes show a strong anisotropy in susceptibility and in Curie-Weiss (C-W) temperatures. The experimental anisotropic C-W temperatures of NCTO qualitatively match with the theoretical C-W temperatures, calculated using the HKTF model [C. Kim \textit{et al.}, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter \textbf{34}, 045802 (2021)]. We find from our temperature- and field-dependent dielectric and pyroelectric ($I_p$) current studies ($H\parallel ab$ and $E\perp ab$) that our single crystal NCTO samples do not have a finite electric polarization below 100 K. These $I_p$ studies confirm the absence of a magnetoelectric coupling and electric polarization properties in the title compound and suggest that the zig-zag AFM structure is more favorable than the triple-$Q$ structure with AFM Kitaev interactions.

Title: State transitions and hysteresis in a transverse magnetic island chain
Authors: G. M. Wysin
Abstract: A chain of dipole-coupled elongated magnetic islands whose long axes are oriented perpendicular to the chain is studied for its magnetization properties. With a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the chain, the competition between dipolar energy, shape anisotropy, and field energy leads to three types of uniform states with distinct magnetizations: (1) oblique to the chain, (2) perpendicular to the chain, and (3) zero due to having alternating dipoles. The response of these states to a slowly varying field is analyzed, focusing on their stability limits and related oscillation modes, and the dependencies on the dipolar and anisotropy constants. Based on identifiable transitions among the three states and their instability points, the theoretically predicted zero-temperature magnetization curves show significant dependence on the anisotropy. The model suggests a path for designing advanced materials with desired magnetic properties. Different geometries and magnetic media for the islands are considered.

Title: Graphene intercalation of the large gap quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene
Authors: Lukas Gehrig, Cedric Schmitt, Jonas Erhardt, Bing Liu, Tim Wagner, Martin Kamp, Simon Moser, Ralph Claessen
Abstract: The quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene, a two-third monolayer of bismuth on SiC(0001), is distinguished by helical metallic edge states that are protected by a groundbreaking 800 meV topological gap, making it ideal for room temperature applications. This massive gap inversion arises from a unique synergy between flat honeycomb structure, strong spin orbit coupling, and an orbital filtering effect that is mediated by the substrate. However, the rapid oxidation of bismuthene in air has severely hindered the development of applications, so far confining experiments to ultra-high vacuum conditions. Here, we successfully overcome this barrier, intercalating bismuthene between SiC and a protective sheet of graphene. As we demonstrate through scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, graphene intercalation preserves the structural and topological integrity of bismuthene, while effectively shielding it from oxidation in air. We identify hydrogen as the critical component that was missing in previous bismuth intercalation attempts. Our findings facilitate ex-situ experiments and pave the way for the development of bismuthene based devices, signaling a significant step forward in the development of next-generation technologies.

Title: Nonaffine motion in flowing highly polydisperse granular media
Authors: Pablo Eduardo Illing, Eric R. Weeks
Abstract: We study the particle-scale motion of highly polydisperse hard disks flowing in a two-dimensional bent channel. We use various size distributions of particles, in which the largest particles are up to five times larger than the smallest. The disks are pushed through an L-shaped channel to drive the particle rearrangements. Although the mean flow is essentially independent of the polydispersity, the motion of individual particles becomes more nonaffine on average for higher polydispersity samples. We characterize the nonaffine motion, finding a qualitative difference in the behavior of small and larger particles: the smaller disks have more nonaffine motion, induced by the larger particles.

Title: Structural and Electronic Evolution of Bilayer Nickelates Under Biaxial Strain
Authors: H C Regan B. Bhatta, Xiaoliang Zhang, Yong Zhong, Chunjing Jia
Abstract: The discovery of high-Tc superconductivity around 80K in bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has expanded the family of high-Tc superconductors above the nitrogen boiling temperature. Recent studies have further shown that ambient pressure superconductivity with a Tc exceeding 40K can be achieved in compressively strained La3Ni2O7 thin films, offering a tunable platform for investigating the pairing mechanism in high-Tc nickelates. A comprehensive understanding of the structural and electronic properties of bilayer nickelate under epitaxial strain is essential to advance this active field. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically explore the entire rare-earth (Re) series of bilayer nickelates Re3Ni2O7 in the realistic orthorhombic Amam phase under various compressive and tensile strain conditions. We highlight the materials properties change when strain is applied, and compare these results with those observed under high pressure. Our findings show that 2.5\% compressive strain increases the apical Ni-O-Ni bond angle toward 180 degree, and causes the Ni $d_{z^2}$ bands to move away from the Fermi level. The tight-binding parameters for the 2.5\% compressively strained La3Ni2O7 are quite similar to those of the unstrained material, except that the on-site energy difference between the Ni $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals increases by about 50 percent. Notably, the absence of the $d_{z^2}$ bands at the Fermi energy under compressive strain contrasts sharply with the electronic structure in the high-pressure {\it Fmmm} phase, suggesting that the presence of $d_{z^2}$ bands at the Fermi energy may not be a requisite for superconductivity.

Title: Spectra-orthogonal optical anisotropy in wafer-scale molecular crystal monolayers
Authors: Tomojit Chowdhury, Fauzia Mujid, Zehra Naqvi, Ariana Ray, Ce Liang, David A. Muller, Nathan P. Guisinger, Jiwoong Park
Abstract: Controlling the spectral and polarization responses of two-dimensional (2D) crystals is vital for developing ultra-thin platforms for compact optoelectronic devices. However, independently tuning optical anisotropy and spectral response remains challenging in conventional semiconductors due to the intertwined nature of their lattice and electronic structures. Here, we report spectra-orthogonal optical anisotropy, where polarization anisotropy is tuned independently of spectral response, in wafer-scale, one-atom-thick 2D molecular crystal (2DMC) monolayers synthesized on monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals. Utilizing the concomitant spectral consistency and structural tunability of perylene derivatives, we demonstrate tunable optical polarization anisotropy in 2DMCs with similar spectral profiles, as confirmed by room-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and cross-polarized reflectance microscopy. Additional angle-dependent analysis of the single- and polycrystalline molecular domains reveals an epitaxial relationship between the 2DMC and the TMD. Our results establish a scalable, molecule-based 2D crystalline platform for unique and tunable functionalities unattainable in covalent 2D solids.

Title: Minkowski tensors for voxelized data: robust, asymptotically unbiased estimators
Authors: Daniel Hug, Michael A. Klatt, Dominik Pabst
Abstract: Minkowski tensors, also known as tensor valuations, provide robust $n$-point information for a wide range of random spatial structures. Local estimators for voxelized data, however, are unavoidably biased even in the limit of infinitely high resolution. Here, we substantially improve a recently proposed, asymptotically unbiased algorithm to estimate Minkowski tensors for voxelized data. Our improved algorithm is more robust and efficient. Moreover we generalize the theoretical foundations for an asymptotically bias-free estimation of the interfacial tensors to the case of finite unions of compact sets with positive reach, which is relevant for many applications like rough surfaces or composite materials. As a realistic test case, we consider, among others, random (beta) polytopes. We first derive explicit expressions of the expected Minkowski tensors, which we then compare to our simulation results. We obtain precise estimates with relative errors of a few percent for practically relevant resolutions. Finally, we apply our methods to real data of metallic grains and nanorough surfaces, and we provide an open-source python package, which works in any dimension.

Title: Entropic costs of the quantum-to-classical transition in a microscopic clock

Abstract: We experimentally realize a quantum clock by using a charge sensor to count charges tunneling through a double quantum dot (DQD). Individual tunneling events are used as the clock's ticks. We quantify the clock's precision while measuring the power dissipated by the DQD and, separately, the charge sensor in both direct-current and radio-frequency readout modes. This allows us to probe the thermodynamic cost of creating ticks microscopically and recording them macroscopically, which we refer to as the quantum-to-classical transition. Our experiment is the first to explore the interplay between the entropy produced by a microscopic clockwork and its macroscopic measurement apparatus. We show that the latter contribution not only dwarfs the former but also unlocks greatly increased precision, because the measurement record can be exploited to optimally estimate time even when the DQD is at equilibrium. Our results suggest that the entropy produced by the amplification and measurement of a clock's ticks, which has often been ignored in the literature, is the most important and fundamental thermodynamic cost of timekeeping at the quantum scale.

Title: Optimizing lossy state preparation for quantum sensing using Hamiltonian engineering
Authors: Bharath Hebbe Madhusudhana
Abstract: One of the most prominent platforms for demonstrating quantum sensing below the standard quantum limit is the spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. While a quantum advantage using several tens of thousands of atoms has been demonstrated in this platform, it faces an important challenge: atom loss. Atom loss is a Markovian error process modelled by Lindblad jump operators, and a no-go theorem, which we also show here, stating that the loss of atoms in all spin components reduces the quantum advantage to a constant factor. Here, we show that this no-go theorem can be circumvented if we constrain atom losses to a single spin component. Moreover, we show that in this case, the maximum quantum Fisher information with $N$ atoms scales as $N^{3/2}$, establishing that a scalable quantum advantage can be achieved despite atom loss. Although Lindblad jump operators are generally non-Hermitian and non-invertible, we use their Moore-Penrose inverse to develop a framework for constructing several states with this scaling of Fisher information in the presence of losses. We use Hamiltonian engineering with realistic Hamiltonians to develop experimental protocols for preparing these states. Finally, we discuss possible experimental techniques to constrain the losses to a single spin mode.

Title: Radiation sputtering of hydrocarbon ices at Europa-relevant temperatures
Authors: Sankhabrata Chandra, Bryana L. Henderson, Murthy S. Gudipati
Abstract: This study shows that the sputtering of hydrocarbon water ice leads to the production of mostly CO2, CO, and fragmented hydrocarbons. The onset of sputtered hydrocarbons is immediate, and quickly reaches a steady state, whereas CO2 and CO are formed more gradually. It is found that higher temperatures cause more sputtering, and that there are some notable differences in the distribution of species that are sputtered at different temperatures, indicating local heterogeneity of sputtering yields depending on the surface temperature.

Title: Machine Learning Models for Reinforced Concrete Pipes Condition Prediction: The State-of-the-Art Using Artificial Neural Networks and Multiple Linear Regression in a Wisconsin Case Study
Authors: Mohsen Mohammadagha, Mohammad Najafi, Vinayak Kaushal, Ahmad Mahmoud Ahmad Jibreen
Abstract: The aging sewer infrastructure in the U.S., covering 2.1 million kilometers, encounters increasing structural issues, resulting in around 75,000 yearly sanitary sewer overflows that present serious economic, environmental, and public health hazards. Conventional inspection techniques and deterministic models do not account for the unpredictable nature of sewer decline, whereas probabilistic methods depend on extensive historical data, which is frequently lacking or incomplete. This research intends to enhance predictive accuracy for the condition of sewer pipelines through machine learning models artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multiple linear regression (MLR) by integrating factors such as pipe age, material, diameter, environmental influences, and PACP ratings. ANNs utilized ReLU activation functions and Adam optimization, whereas MLR applied regularization to address multicollinearity, with both models assessed through metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R2. The findings indicated that ANNs surpassed MLR, attaining an R2 of 0.9066 compared to MLRs 0.8474, successfully modeling nonlinear relationships while preserving generalization. MLR, on the other hand, offered enhanced interpretability by pinpointing significant predictors such as residual buildup. As a result, pipeline degradation is driven by pipe length, age, and pipe diameter as key predictors, while depth, soil type, and segment show minimal influence in this analysis. Future studies ought to prioritize hybrid models that merge the accuracy of ANNs with the interpretability of MLR, incorporating advanced methods such as SHAP analysis and transfer learning to improve scalability in managing infrastructure and promoting environmental sustainability.

Title: Influence of nanoparticulates and microgrooves on the secondary electron yield and electrical resistance of laser-treated copper surfaces
Authors: P. Krkotić, T. Madarász, C. Serafim, H. Neupert, A. T. Perez-Fontenla, M. Himmerlich, S. Calatroni
Abstract: Laser surface structuring has proven to be an effective technique for achieving a copper surface with secondary electron yield (SEY) values close to or below unity. However, the attributes that minimize SEY, such as moderately deep grooves and redeposited nanoparticles, may lead to undesirable consequences, including increased radio frequency surface resistance. This investigation systematically examined data about different cleaning procedures designed to eliminate redeposited adsorbed particulates. Various analysis techniques were used iteratively after each consecutive cleaning step, providing insights into the evolving surface characteristics. The collected experimental results identified distinct impacts of microgrooves, groove orientation, and associated particulates on secondary electron yield and surface resistance. Exposing the crests while retaining high particulate coverage in the grooves leads to reduced SEY values and surface resistance, suggesting that the tips of the grooves exert a more significant influence on surface current density than the groove depth. At the same time, nanoparticles in the grooves have a more significant impact on SEY values than the exposed tips at the surface.

Title: Resolving the Problem of Multiple Control Parameters in Optimized Borel-Type Summation
Authors: V.I. Yukalov, S. Gluzman
Abstract: One of the most often used methods of summing divergent series in physics is the Borel-type summation with control parameters improving convergence, which are defined by some optimization conditions. The well known annoying problem in this procedure is the occurrence of multiple solutions for control parameters. We suggest a method for resolving this problem, based on the minimization of cost functional. Control parameters can be introduced by employing the Borel-Leroy or Mittag-Leffler transforms. Also, two novel transformations are proposed using fractional integrals and fractional derivatives. New cost functionals are advanced, based on lasso and ridge selection criteria, and their performance is studied for a number of models. The developed method is shown to provide good accuracy for the calculated quantities.

These results constitute a first step toward implementing a nondestructive dielectric nanotomography technique based on EFM with applications in materials sciences and life sciences.

Title: Harnessing Discrete Differential Geometry: A Virtual Playground for the Bilayer Soft Robotics
Authors: Jiahao Li, Dezhong Tong, Zhuonan Hao, Yinbo Zhu, Hengan Wu, Mingchao Liu, Weicheng Huang
Abstract: Soft robots have garnered significant attention due to their promising applications across various domains. A hallmark of these systems is their bilayer structure, where strain mismatch caused by differential expansion between layers induces complex deformations. Despite progress in theoretical modeling and numerical simulation, accurately capturing their dynamic behavior, especially during environmental interactions, remains challenging. This study presents a novel simulation environment based on the Discrete Elastic Rod (DER) model to address the challenge. By leveraging discrete differential geometry (DDG), the DER approach offers superior convergence compared to conventional methods like Finite Element Method (FEM), particularly in handling contact interactions -- an essential aspect of soft robot dynamics in real-world scenarios. Our simulation framework incorporates key features of bilayer structures, including stretching, bending, twisting, and inter-layer coupling. This enables the exploration of a wide range of dynamic behaviors for bilayer soft robots, such as gripping, crawling, jumping, and swimming. The insights gained from this work provide a robust foundation for the design and control of advanced bilayer soft robotic systems.

Title: Ultrafast electrical control of dipolaritonic circuits with a few femto-joul per bit power consumption
Authors: Dror Liran, Ronen Rapaport, Kirk Baldwin, Loren Pfeiffer, Hui Deng
Abstract: The next generation of photonic circuits will require on-chip, ultrafast, compact, and energy-efficient components in a scalable platform to power technologies like quantum and neuromorphic computing. Here we present a significant advancement in ultrafast electrical control of highly nonlinear hybrid light-matter quasi-particles, called waveguide exciton-dipolaritons, with extremely low power consumption. Our device, that was shown to perform as an optical transistor with an optical switching power as low as $\sim$1 fJ/operation, achieves a GHz-rate electrical modulation with a record-low total energy consumption $\sim$3 fJ/bit and a compact active area of down to 25 $\mu$m$^2$. This work establishes waveguide-dipolariton platforms for scalable, electrically reconfigurable, ultra-low power photonic circuits for both classical and quantum computing and communication.

Title: Fundamental limits of learning in sequence multi-index models and deep attention networks: High-dimensional asymptotics and sharp thresholds
Authors: Emanuele Troiani, Hugo Cui, Yatin Dandi, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the learning of deep attention neural networks, defined as the composition of multiple self-attention layers, with tied and low-rank weights. We first establish a mapping of such models to sequence multi-index models, a generalization of the widely studied multi-index model to sequential covariates, for which we establish a number of general results. In the context of Bayesian-optimal learning, in the limit of large dimension $D$ and commensurably large number of samples $N$, we derive a sharp asymptotic characterization of the optimal performance as well as the performance of the best-known polynomial-time algorithm for this setting --namely approximate message-passing--, and characterize sharp thresholds on the minimal sample complexity required for better-than-random prediction performance. Our analysis uncovers, in particular, how the different layers are learned sequentially. Finally, we discuss how this sequential learning can also be observed in a realistic setup.

Title: Nodal lines in a honeycomb plasmonic crystal with synthetic spin
Authors: Sang Hyun Park, E.J. Mele, Tony Low
Abstract: We analyze a plasmonic model on a honeycomb lattice of metallic nanodisks that hosts nodal lines protected by local symmetries. Using both continuum and tight-binding models, we show that a combination of a synthetic time-reversal symmetry, inversion symmetry, and particle-hole symmetry enforce the existence of nodal lines enclosing the $\mathrm{K}$ and $\mathrm{K}'$ points. The nodal lines are not directly gapped even when these symmetries are weakly broken. The existence of the nodal lines is verified using full-wave electromagnetic simulations. We also show that the degeneracies at nodal lines can be relieved by introducing a Kekulé distortion that acts to mix the nodal lines near the $\mathrm{K},\mathrm{K}'$ points. Our findings open pathways for designing novel plasmonic and photonic devices without reliance on complex symmetry engineering, presenting a convenient platform for studying nodal structures in two-dimensional systems.

Title: Generating logical magic states with the aid of non-Abelian topological order
Authors: Sheng-Jie Huang, Yanzhu Chen
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing with the surface code, non-Clifford gates are crucial for universal computation. However, implementing these gates using methods like magic state distillation and code switching requires significant resources. In this work, we propose a new protocol that combines magic state preparation and code switching to realize logical non-Clifford operations with the potential for fault tolerance. Our approach begins with a special logical state in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ surface code. By applying a sequence of transformations, the system goes through different topological codes, including the non-Abelian $D_4$ quantum double model. This process ultimately produces a magic state in a condensed $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code, which enables the implementation of a logical $T$ gate in the standard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code. In our analysis, we employ a framework where the topological codes are represented by their topological orders and all the transformations are considered as topological manipulations such as gauging symmetries and condensing anyons. This perspective is particularly useful for understanding code switching between topological codes.

Title: Noise-resilient host for electron qubit operation up to 0.4 K
Authors: Xinhao Li, Christopher S. Wang, Brennan Dizdar, Yizhong Huang, Yutian Wen, Wei Guo, Xufeng Zhang, Xu Han, Xianjing Zhou, Dafei Jin
Abstract: Cryogenic solid neon has recently emerged as a pristine solid-state material platform for hosting single electron qubits. At temperatures of $\sim$10 mK, electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have shown exceptionally long coherence times and high single-qubit gate fidelities. Further expanding the capabilities of this platform to multiple qubits in a scalable fashion will require careful understanding and the corresponding optimization of the underlying noise environment. Here, we demonstrate the remarkable robustness enabled by the neon layer in eNe charge qubits against charge and thermal noise by operating them away from the charge-insensitive sweet-spot and at elevated temperatures. Without optimization, the measured charge (voltage) noise spectral density on neon is comparable to the best in conventional gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots. Up to 0.4 K, the qubit coherence time with dynamical decoupling can still reach the relaxation limit of $\sim$1 microsecond. These observations highlight the potential of solid neon to facilitate a quiet charge environment and eNe qubits' potential for higher-temperature operation in a scaled-up system.

Title: The number of immune defense and counter-defense systems sustained in the arms race between procaryotes and viruses
Authors: Yaroslav Ispolatov, Anna Lekontseva, Konstantin Severinov
Abstract: Prokaryotes have evolved various mechanisms to counter viruses, which in their turn developed numerous strategies to avoid defenses of the hosts. Dozens of such defense and counter-defense mechanisms have recently been discovered, yet the number of such systems held by a given virus or its host is limited. Here, we present numerical and theoretical arguments for the existence of the maximal number of ecologically and evolutionary sustainable defense and counter-defense systems maintained by both sides at any time of the never-ending evolutionary arms race. We find that the number of such systems is of the order of 10 for a broad range of assumptions about the costs and benefits of defense and counter-defense mechanisms and their specificity. This optimum in the number of defense and counter-defense systems appears as a result of a compromise between the metabolic and autoimmune costs of adding a new layer of defense and the benefits it conveys.

Title: Near-deterministic photon entanglement from a spin qudit in silicon using third quantisation
Authors: Gözde Üstün, Samuel Elman, Jarryd J. Pla, Andrew C. Doherty, Andrea Morello, Simon J. Devitt
Abstract: Unlike other quantum hardware, photonic quantum architectures can produce millions of qubits from a single device. However, controlling photonic qubits remains challenging, even at small scales, due to their weak interactions, making non-deterministic gates in linear optics unavoidable. Nevertheless, a single photon can readily spread over multiple modes and create entanglement within the multiple modes deterministically. Rudolph's concept of third quantization leverages this feature by evolving multiple single-photons into multiple modes, distributing them uniformly and randomly to different parties, and creating multipartite entanglement without interactions between photons or non-deterministic gates. This method requires only classical communication and deterministic entanglement within multi-mode single-photon states and enables universal quantum computing. The multipartite entanglement generated within the third quantization framework is nearly deterministic, where ``deterministic'' is achieved in the asymptotic limit of a large system size. In this work, we propose a near-term experiment using antimony donor in a silicon chip to realize third quantization. Utilizing the eight energy levels of antimony, one can generate two eight-mode single-photon states independently and distribute them to parties. This enables a random multipartite Bell-state experiment, achieving a Bell state with an upper-bound efficiency of 87.5% among 56 random pairs without non-deterministic entangling gates. This approach opens alternative pathways for silicon-based photonic quantum computing.

Abstract: Doping stoichiometric SiNx layers (x=[N]/[Si]=1.33) with Si atoms by ultra-low energy ion implantation (ULE-II) and annealing them at different temperatures can significantly impact the switching characteristics. Electrical characterization and dielectric breakdown measurements are used to identify the main switching properties and performance of the fabricated devices and the effect that the Si dopants and annealing temperature have. In addition, impedance spectroscopy measurements revealed the dielectric properties of the silicon nitride films, as well as the ac conductance, which is utilized to identify the conduction mechanisms.

Title: Origin of slow earthquake statistics in low-friction soft granular shear
Authors: Yuto Sasaki, Hiroaki Katsuragi
Abstract: Slow earthquakes differ from regular earthquakes in their slower moment release and limited size distribution. What mechanisms cause slow earthquakes that manifest these unique statistics? We experimentally demonstrate that their characteristics emerge from low-friction soft granular shear. Using a hydrogel particle layer floated on lubricating fluid, we conducted stick-slip experiments. The observed slip events follow the same laws of both moment release rate and size distribution as slow earthquakes, contrasting with frictional rigid granular shear. Slip size is determined by the competing effects of shear localization and pressure enhancement with decreasing porosity. These findings indicate that low friction and particle softness in sheared granular systems with monotonous structures cause slow earthquake statistics, which may monitor pore fluid dynamics and shear localization within hazardous fault zones.

Title: Developing universal logical state-purification strategy for quantum error correcting codes
Authors: Chandrima B. Pushpan, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Aditi Sen De, Amit Kumar Pal
Abstract: We develop a measurement-based protocol for simultaneously purifying arbitrary logical states in multiple quantum error correcting codes with unit fidelity and finite probability, starting from arbitrary thermal states of each code. The protocol entails a time evolution caused by an engineered Hamiltonian, which results in transitions between the logical and error subspaces of the quantum error correcting code mediated by the auxiliary qubit, followed by a projective measurement in an optimum basis on the auxiliary qubit and an appropriate post-selection of the measurement outcomes. We illustrate the results with the three-qubit repetition code and the logical qubit used in quantum state transfer protocol. We further demonstrate that when the measurement base is not optimal, it is possible to achieve both classical fidelity, and fidelity as high as $90\%$ through several iterations of the purifying procedure, thereby establishing its robustness against variations in the measurement basis. By repeating the purification rounds, we show that purifying the cardinal states of the logical Bloch sphere corresponding to logical qubits in quantum state transfer is feasible utilizing paradigmatic quantum spin models as the generator of the time evolution.

Title: Comparison of the clock, stochastic cutoff, and Tomita Monte Carlo methods in simulating the dipolar triangular lattice at criticality
Authors: S. Ismailzadeh, M. D. Niry
Abstract: Magnetic nanostructures find application in diverse technological domains and their behavior is significantly influenced by long-range dipolar interactions. However, simulating these systems using the traditional Metropolis Monte Carlo method poses high computational demand. Several methods, including the clock, stochastic cutoff, and Tomita approaches, can reduce the computational burden of simulating 2D systems with dipolar interactions. Although these three methods rely on distinct theoretical concepts, they all achieve complexity reduction by a common strategy. Instead of calculating the energy difference between a spin and all its neighbors, they evaluate the energy difference with only a limited number of randomly chosen neighbors. This is achieved through methods like the dynamic thinning and Fukui-Todo techniques. In this article, we compared the performance of the clock, SCO, Tomita, and Metropolis methods near the critical point of the dipolar triangular lattice to identify the most suitable algorithm for this type of simulation. Our findings show that while these methods are less suitable for simulating this system in their untuned implementation, incorporating the boxing nearby neighbors method and overrelaxation moves makes them significantly more efficient and better suited than the Metropolis method with overrelaxation.

Title: Non-Stabilizerness of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model
Authors: Surajit Bera, Marco Schirò
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results therefore suggest that non-stabilizerness allows to sharply detect many-body quantum chaos.

Title: Quantum work statistics across a critical point: full crossover from sudden quench to the adiabatic limit
Authors: Zhanyu Ma, Andrew K. Mitchell, Eran Sela
Abstract: When an external parameter drives a system across a quantum phase transition at a finite rate, work is performed on the system and entropy is dissipated, due to the creation of excitations via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Although both the adiabatic and sudden-quench limits have been studied in detail, the quantum work statistics along the crossover connecting these limits has largely been an open question. Here we obtain exact scaling functions for the work statistics along the full crossover from adiabatic to sudden-quench limits for critical quantum impurity problems, by combining linear response theory, conformal field theory, and the numerical renormalization group. These predictions can be tested in charge-multichannel Kondo quantum dot devices, where the dissipated work corresponds to the creation of nontrivial excitations such as Majorana fermions or Fibonacci anyons.

Title: Quasinormal modes of nonthermal fixed points
Authors: Matisse De Lescluze, Michal P. Heller
Abstract: Quasinormal modes play a prominent role in relaxation of diverse physical systems to equilibria, ranging from astrophysical black holes to tiny droplets of quark-gluon plasma at RHIC and LHC accelerators. We propose that a novel kind of quasinormal modes govern the direct approach to self-similar time evolution of nonthermal fixed points, whose relevance ranges from high energy physics to cold atom gases. We utilize black hole perturbation theory techniques to compute the spectrum of these far from equilibrium quasinormal modes for a kinetic theory with a Focker-Planck collision kernel in isotropic and homogeneous states. Our conclusion is that quasinormal modes of nonthermal fixed points give rise to a tower of progressively more decaying power-law contributions. A byproduct of our analysis is a precise determination and improved understanding of the distribution function characterizing nonthermal fixed points.

Title: Chiral Spin and Orbital Angular Momentum Textures in Mn Chains on W(110): Interplay of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Crystal Field Effects
Authors: M. M. Bezerra-Neto, Y. O. Kvashnin, A. Bergman, R. Cardias, R. B. Muniz, O. Eriksson, M. I. Katsnelson, A. B. Klautau
Abstract: Stabilization of unusual spin-orbit driven magnetic orderings are achieved for chains of Mn atoms deposited on a W(110) substrate. First-principles electronic structure calculations show that the ground state spin configuration is non-collinear, forming chiral spiral-like structures, driven by competing nearest and next-nearest neighbor interactions. The orbital magnetic moments are also found to exhibit non-collinear ordering that, interestingly, tend to align in-plane for some systems with an orientation distinctly differently from that of the spin moment. We analyse the mechanism behind such behaviour, and find that it is due to the competition between the spin-orbit interaction and crystal-field splitting. Model calculations based on this assumption reproduce the main findings observed in our first-principles calculations.

Title: Fidelity Strange Correlators for Average Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases
Authors: Jian-Hao Zhang, Yang Qi, Zhen Bi
Abstract: Topological phases in open quantum systems have become an exciting area of research, driven by the rising importance of noisy intermediate-scale quantum platforms. The concept of Average Symmetry-Protected Topological (ASPT) phases extends symmetry-protected topological phases to quantum systems affected by disorder or decoherence. To identify nontrivial ASPT states, we introduce a "fidelity strange correlator" (FSC), which operates directly on a single bulk density matrix without boundaries. For nontrivial ASPT phases in one and two dimensions, we show that the FSC reveals long-range or power-law behavior. In several two-dimensional examples, we establish a link between the FSC and certain non-local correlation functions in statistical loop models with quantum corrections, enabling us to derive exact scaling exponents for the FSC. In addition, we discuss methods to measure the FSC using classical shadow tomography. Our work lays the groundwork for identifying these intriguing topological phases of matter in open quantum systems, both numerically and experimentally.

Title: The influence of anisotropy on the manifestation of aging effects in the magnetoresistance of multilayer structures
Authors: Marina M. Boldyreva, Dmitry A. Druzev, Vadim O. Borzilov, Igor K. Saifutdinov, Natalia I. Piskunova, Marina V. Mamonova, Vladimir V. Prudnikov, Pavel V. Prudnikov
Abstract: Currently, aging effects occurring in multilayer systems attract much attention from researchers. In our research we looked at the behavior of multilayer systems that depend on anisotropy, magnetoresistance and this http URL these parameters are interrelated and have varying degrees of influence on the effects of aging. We researched our Co-layers magnetic system from high-temperature and low-temperature initial states, as well as not only in the critical temperature region, but in a wide low-temperature range. The study was carried out with different types of magnetic anisotropy, which made it possible to identify differences in the behavior of the system depending on the type of anisotropy. We found that in systems exhibiting a dimensional transition, aging effects manifest to gain and themselves in a wide low-temperature range, and not only in a narrow near-critical region, which ultimately leads us to a wide range of applications of these materials for practical applications.

Title: Zero-Threshold PT-Symmetric Polariton-Raman Laser
Authors: Avijit Dhara, Pritam Das, Devarshi Chakrabarty, Kritika Ghosh, Ayan Roy Chaudhuri, Sajal Dhara
Abstract: Anisotropy endows topological aspects in optical systems and furnishes a platform to explore non-Hermitian physics, which can be harnessed for the polarization-selective amplification of light. Here, we show a zero-threshold Raman laser can be achieved in an anisotropic optical microcavity via polarization-controlled optical pumping. A loss-gain mechanism between two polarized Stokes modes arises naturally via polarization-dependent stimulated scattering and anisotropic Raman gain of the active layered material inside the microcavity. A Parity-Time (PT) symmetric Hamiltonian has been proposed to explain the emergence of a single polarization mode, essential for achieving a zero-threshold lasing condition. Additionally, intensity correlation measurements of the Stokes modes validate the coherence properties of the emitted light. Our realization of the zero-threshold Raman laser in anisotropic microcavity can open up a new research direction exploring non-Hermitian and topological aspects of light in anisotropic two-dimensional materials.

Title: Supercurrent through a single transverse mode in nanowire Josephson junctions
Authors: B. Zhang, Z. Li, H. Wu, M. Pendharkar, C. Dempsey, J. S. Lee, S. D. Harrington, C. J. Palmstrom, S. M. Frolov
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials are fueling research in mesoscopic physics and quantum technology. Recently demonstrated smooth $\beta$-Sn superconductor shells, due to the increased induced gap, are expanding the available parameter space to new regimes. Fabricated on quasiballistic InSb nanowires, with careful control over the hybrid interface, Sn shells yield measurable switching currents even when nanowire resistance is of order 10kohm. In this regime Cooper pairs travel through a purely 1D quantum wire for at least part of their trajectory. Here, we focus on the evolution of proximity-induced supercurrent in magnetic field parallel to the nanowire. Long decay up to fields of 1T is observed. At the same time, the decay for higher occupied subbands is notably faster in some devices but not in others. We analyze this using a tight-binding numerical model that includes the Zeeman, orbital and spin-orbit effects. When the first subband is spin polarized, we observe a dramatic suppression of supercurrent, which is also confirmed by the model and suggests an absence of significant triplet supercurrent generation.

Title: Second law of thermodynamics: A case study searching for quantum non-thermodynamic phenomena
Authors: Yu Qiao
Abstract: Recent research on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics has led to an interesting discovery: With locally nonchaotic barriers, as Boltzmann's H-theorem is inapplicable, there exist nontrivial non-thermodynamic systems that can produce useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect, thereby breaking the boundaries of the second law of thermodynamics. The previous analyses used classical mechanical models. In the current investigation, the study is extended to quantum mechanics. First, we reiterate that the Fermi-Dirac distribution and the Bose-Einstein distribution are compatible with the generalized Maxwell's relations, which demonstrates the overall robustness of the framework of quantum statistical mechanics. Next, we analyze a set of simple-step scattering problems. When the system is in contact with a thermal reservoir, a bound state inherently follows the second law of thermodynamics, while a scattering state may not. The root cause is associated with the nonlocal nature of the wave function. It implies that the non-thermodynamic phenomena favor unquantized energy, exhibiting a tendency to occur in classical mechanical or "semiclassical" setups.

Title: Robustness of stress focusing in soft lattices under topology-switching deformation
Authors: Caleb Widstrand, Xiaoming Mao, Stefano Gonella
Abstract: Recent developments in topological mechanics have demonstrated the ability of Maxwell lattices to effectively focus stress along domain walls between differently polarized domains. The focusing ability can be exploited to protect the lattice bulk from accidental stress concentration -- and eventually onset and propagation of fracture -- at structural hot spots such as defects and cracks. A recent study has revisited the problem for structural lattices featuring non-ideal hinges, showing that the focusing remains robust, albeit diluted in strength. Realizing that the problem of domain wall localization has been traditionally framed in the context of linear elasticity, in this work we extend the study to the realm of soft structures undergoing nonlinear finite deformation. Through experiments performed on silicone hyperelastic prototypes, we assess and quantify the robustness of the phenomenon against the macroscopic shape changes induced by large deformation, with special attention to deformation levels that alter the topology of the bulk, lifting the topological protection. Furthermore, we identify a simple geometric indicator for this transition.

Title: Frozen Cheerios effect: Particle-particle interaction induced by an advancing solidification front
Authors: Jochem G. Meijer, Vincent Bertin, Detlef Lohse
Abstract: Particles at liquid interfaces have the tendency to cluster due to capillary forces competing with gravitational buoyancy (i.e., normal to the distorted free surface). This is known as the Cheerios effect. Here we experimentally and theoretically study the interaction between two submerged particles near an advancing water-ice interface during the freezing process. Particles that are thermally more conductive than water are observed to attract each other and form clusters once frozen. We call this feature the frozen Cheerios effect, where interactions are driven by alterations to the direction of the experienced repelling force (i.e., normal to the distorted isotherm). On the other hand, particles less conductive than water separate, highlighting the importance of thermal conduction during freezing. Based on existing models for single particle trapping in ice, we develop an understanding of multiple particle interaction. We find that the overall efficacy of the particle-particle interaction critically depends on the solidification front velocity. Our theory explains why the thermal conductivity mismatch between the particles and water dictates the attractive/repulsive nature of the particle-particle interaction.

Title: Emergent Topology in Many-Body Dissipative Quantum Matter
Authors: Antonio M. García-García, Lucas Sá, Jacobus J. M. Verbaarschot, Can Yin
Abstract: The identification, description, and classification of topological features is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of pseudo-Hermitian many-body quantum systems. For that purpose, we study two different systems, the dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain. For the two different many-body models, we find the same topological features for a wide range of parameters suggesting that they are universal. In the SYK model, we identify four universality classes, related to pseudo-Hermiticity, characterized by a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, we identify a topological index $\nu$ that only depends on symmetry. Another distinct consequence of the rectangularization is the observation, for any coupling to the bath, of purely real topological modes in the Liouvillian. The level statistics of these real modes agree with that of the corresponding random matrix ensemble and therefore can be employed to characterize the four topological symmetry classes. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.

Title: Tensor Network Finite-Size Scaling for Two-Dimensional 3-state Clock Model
Authors: Debasmita Maiti, Sing-Hong Chan, Pochung Chen
Abstract: We benchmark recently proposed tensor network based finite-size scaling analysis in Phys. Rev. B {\bf 107}, 205123 (2023) against two-dimensional classical 3-state clock model. Due to the higher complexity of the model, more complicated crossover behavior is observed. We advocate that the crossover behavior can be understood from the perspective of finite bond dimension inducing relevant perturbation. This leads to a general strategy to best estimate the critical properties for a given set of control parameters. For the critical temperature $T_c$, the relative error at the order of $10^{-7}$ can be reached with bond dimension $D=70$. On the other hand, with bond dimension $D=60$, the relative errors of the critical exponents $\nu, \beta, \alpha$ are at the order of $10^{-2}$. Increasing the bond dimension to $D=90$, these relative errors can be reduced at least to the order of $10^{-3}$. In all cases our results indicate that the errors can be systematically reduced by increasing the bond dimension and the stacking number.

Title: Two-dimensional topological paramagnets protected by $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry: Properties of the boundary Hamiltonian
Authors: Hrant Topchyan, Vasilii Iugov, Mkhitar Mirumyan, Tigran S. Hakobyan, Tigran A. Sedrakyan, Ara G. Sedrakyan
Abstract: We systematically study gapless edge modes corresponding to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of two-dimensional three-state Potts paramagnets on a triangular lattice. First, we derive microscopic lattice models for the gapless edge and, using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach, investigate the finite-size scaling of the low-lying excitation spectrum and the entanglement entropy. Based on the obtained results, we identify the universality class of the critical edge, namely the corresponding conformal field theory and the central charge. Finally, we discuss the inherent symmetries of the edge models and the emergent winding number symmetry. As a result, one-dimensional chains with this symmetry form a model that supports gapless excitations due to its tricritical symmetry. Numerically, we show that low-energy states in the continuous limit of the edge model can be described by conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1$, given by the coset $SU_k(3)/SU_k(2)$ CFT at level k=1.

Title: Anisotropic skyrmion and multi-$q$ spin dynamics in centrosymmetric Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$

Abstract: Skyrmions are particle-like vortices of magnetization with non-trivial topology, which are usually stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) in noncentrosymmetric bulk materials. Exceptions are centrosymmetric Gd- and Eu-based skyrmion-lattice (SkL) hosts with zero DMI, where both the SkL stabilization mechanisms and magnetic ground states remain controversial. We address these here by investigating both the static and dynamical spin properties of the centrosymmetric SkL host Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ using muon spectroscopy ($\mu$SR). We find that spin fluctuations in the non-coplanar SkL phase are highly anisotropic, implying that spin anisotropy plays a prominent role in stabilizing this phase. We also observe strongly-anisotropic spin dynamics in the ground-state (IC-1) incommensurate magnetic phase of the material, indicating that it hosts a meron-like multi-$q$ structure. In contrast, the higher-field, coplanar IC-2 phase is found to be single-$q$ with nearly-isotropic spin dynamics.

Title: Monte Carlo, blocking, and inference: How to measure the renormalization group flow
Authors: Luca Di Carlo
Abstract: Renormalization group theory is a powerful and intriguing technique with a wide range of applications. One of the main successes of renormalization group theory is the description of continuous phase transitions and the development of scaling theory. Most courses on phase transitions focus on scaling and critical exponents, while less attention is paid to universality, renormalization group flow, and the existence of a unique fixed point, which are the ultimate reasons why scaling theory is so effective in describing continuous phase transitions. We use a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and real space renormalization group theory to determine the renormalization group flow and to show the existence of a universal fixed point in the context of the ferromagnetic Ising model.

Title: Self-consistent study of topological superconductivity in two-dimensional quasicrystals
Authors: Masahiro Hori, Takanori Sugimoto, Takami Tohyama, K. Tanaka
Abstract: We study two-dimensional $s$-wave topological superconductivity with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field in Penrose and Ammann-Beenker quasicrystals. By solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations self-consistently for not only the superconducting order parameter, but also the spin-dependent Hartree potential, we show the stable occurrence of topological superconductivity with broken time-reversal symmetry in both Penrose and Ammann-Beenker quasicrystals. The topological nature of the quasicrystalline system is signified by the Bott index $B$. Topological phase transitions are found to occur, where $B$ changes between 0 and $\pm 1$, as the chemical potential or Zeeman field is varied. In terms of self-consistent solutions, we demonstrate the existence of a Majorana zero mode per edge or vortex when $B=\pm 1$, consistently with the bulk-edge/defect correspondence for periodic systems.

Abstract: This study focuses on amorphous boron nitride ($\rm \alpha$-BN) as a novel diffusion barrier for advanced semiconductor technology, particularly addressing the critical challenge of copper diffusion in back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnects. Owing to its ultralow dielectric constant and robust barrier properties, $\rm \alpha$-BN is examined as an alternative to conventional low-k dielectrics. The investigation primarily employs theoretical modelling, using a Gaussian Approximation Potential, to simulate and understand the atomic-level interactions. This machine learning-based approach allows the performance of realistic simulations of amorphous structure of $\rm \alpha$-BN, enabling the exploration of the impact of different film morphologies on barrier efficacy. Furthermore, we studied the electronic and optical properties of the films using a simple Tight-Binding model. In addition to the theoretical studies, we performed diffusion studies of copper through PECVD $\rm \alpha$-BN on Si. The results from both the theoretical and experimental investigations highlight the potential of $\rm \alpha$-BN as a highly effective diffusion barrier, suitable for integration in nanoelectronics. This research shows that $\rm \alpha$-BN is a promising candidate for BEOL interconnects but also demonstrates the synergy of advanced computational models and experimental methods in material innovation for semiconductor applications.

Title: Condensation Completion and Defects in 2+1D Topological Orders
Authors: Gen Yue, Longye Wang, Tian Lan
Abstract: We review the condensation completion of a modular tensor category, which yields a fusion 2-category of codimension-1 and higher defects in a $2+1$D topological order. We apply the condensation completion to $2+1$D topological order with $\mathbb Z_2\times \mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_4$ fusion rules. In these cases, we explicitly enumerate the $1$d and $0$d defects present in these topological orders, along with their fusion rules. We also talk about other applications of condensation completion: alternative interpretations of condensation completion of a braided fusion category; condensation completion of the category of symmetry charges and its correspondence to gapped phases with symmetry; for a topological order $\mathcal{C}$, one can also find all gapped boundaries of the stacking of $\mathcal{C}$ with its time-reversal conjugate through computing the condensation completion of $\mathcal{C}$.

Title: Simulating chiral spin liquids with fermionic Projected Entangled Paired States
Authors: Sasank Budaraju, Didier Poilblanc, Sen Niu
Abstract: Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) based on spin-1/2 fermionic Projected Entangled Pair States (fPEPS) are considered on the square lattice. First, fPEPS approximants of Gutzwiller-projected Chern insulators (GPCI) are investigated by Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) techniques on finite size tori. We show that such fPEPS of finite bond dimension can correctly capture the topological properties of the chiral spin liquid, as the exact GPCI, with the correct topological ground state degeneracy on the torus. Further, more general fPEPS are considered and optimized (on the infinite plane) to describe the CSL phase of a chiral frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The chiral modes are computed on the edge of a semi-infinite cylinder (of finite circumference) and shown to follow the predictions from Conformal Field Theory. In contrast to their bosonic analogs the (optimized) fPEPS do not suffer from the replication of the chiral edge mode in the odd topological sector.

Title: Theoretical lower limit of coercive field in ferroelectric hafnia
Authors: Jiyuan Yang, Jing Wu, Jingxuan Li, Chao Zhou, Yang Sun, Zuhuang Chen, Shi Liu
Abstract: The high coercive field ($E_c$) of hafnia-based ferroelectrics presents a major obstacle to their applications. The ferroelectric switching mechanisms in hafnia that dictate $E_c$, especially those related to domain nucleation in the Nucleation-Limited-Switching (NLS) model and domain wall motion in the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibas (KAI) model, have remained elusive. We develop a deep-learning-assisted multiscale approach, incorporating atomistic insights into the critical nucleus, to predict both NLS- and KAI-type coercive fields. The theoretical NLS-type $E_c$ values agree with previous experimental results as well as our own measurements and also exhibit the correct thickness scaling for films between 3 and 20 nm. Combined theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that the giant $E_c$ in hafnia-based ferroelectrics arises from the ultra-thin geometry, which confines switching to the NLS mechanism. We predict that the theoretical lower limit for KAI-type $E_c$ is 0.1 MV/cm arsing from mobile domain walls. The activation of KAI-type switching to achieve lower $E_c$ is supported by our experimental demonstration of a low coercive field of 1 MV/cm in a 60 nm ferroelectric (HfO$_2$)$_n$/(ZrO$_2$)$_n$ ($n=3$ unit cells) superlattices. These findings establish a comprehensive framework for understanding ferroelectric switching in hafnia and highlight the potential of geometry and domain-wall engineering to achieve low-$E_c$ devices.

Title: Effective time-dependent temperature for fermionic master equations beyond the Markov and the secular approximations
Authors: Lukas Litzba, Eric Kleinherbers, Jürgen König, Ralf Schützhold, Nikodem Szpak
Abstract: We consider a fermionic quantum system exchanging particles with an environment at a fixed temperature and study its reduced evolution by means of a Redfield-I equation with time-dependent (non-Markovian) coefficients. We find that the description can be efficiently reduced to a standard-form Redfield-II equation, however, with a time-dependent effective bath temperature obeying a universal law. At early times, after the system and environment start in a product state, the effective temperature appears to be very high, yet eventually it settles down towards the true environment value. In this way, we obtain a time-local master equation, offering high accuracy at all times and preserving the crucial properties of the density matrix. It includes non-Markovian relaxation processes beyond the secular approximation and time-averaging methods and can be further applied to various types of Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equations. We derive the theory from first principles and discuss its application using a simple example of a single quantum dot.

Title: Identification of the superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ upon 100 GPa

Abstract: Identification of superconductivity in the Ruddlesden-Popper phases of nickelates under high pressure remains challenging. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the crystal structure, resistance, and Meissner effect in single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with hydrostatic pressures up to 104 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic to a tetragonal phase above 40 GPa. Zero resistance of the superconductivity was achieved with a maximum onset $T_c^{onset}$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa. Superconductivity is gradually suppressed until it disappears above 80 GPa, resulting in a right-triangle-like superconducting region. The direct-current magnetic susceptibility technique successfully detected the Meissner effect in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure; the maximum superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be 62.7% at 22.0 GPa. Thus, we demonstrate the bulk nature of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ single crystals under high pressure. The results reveal intimate connections among the superconductivity, oxygen content, and structure in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Flat-band ratio and quantum metric in the superconductivity of modified Lieb lattices
Authors: Reko P. S. Penttilä, Kukka-Emilia Huhtinen, Päivi Törmä
Abstract: Flat bands may offer a route to high critical temperatures of superconductivity. It has been predicted that the quantum geometry of the bands as well as the ratio of the number of flat bands to the number of orbitals determine flat band superconductivity. However, such results have assumed at least one of the following: an isolated flat band, zero temperature, mean-field theory, and/or uniform pairing. Here, we explore flat band superconductivity when these assumptions are relaxed. We consider an attractive Hubbard model for different extensions of the Lieb lattice. The superconducting order parameter, critical temperature, superfluid weight, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature are calculated within dynamical mean-field theory. We find that for isolated flat bands, the flat-band ratio and quantum geometry are in general good indicators of superconductivity even at finite temperatures. For non-isolated flat bands, a good guideline of the BKT temperature is provided by the zero-temperature superfluid weight and the flat-band ratio.

Title: Two-dimensional borophene: In-plane hyperbolic polaritons in the visible spectral range
Authors: Yaser Abdi, Masoud Taleb, Soheil Hajibaba, Mohsen Moayedi, Nahid Talebi
Abstract: Two-dimensional metals, such as graphene, have undergone extensive exploration, with graphene exhibiting a metallic response limited to the infrared spectral range. Overcoming the challenge of extending the electron mobility in two-dimensional metals to achieve plasmonic behaviors in the visible range necessitates innovative synthesis procedures. In this study, we showcase the successful realization of the phase of \c{hi}_3 borophene on diverse substrates using aluminum-based chemical vapor deposition. Leveraging first-principle density-functional theory alongside advanced deep-subwavelength cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, we reveal the extreme anisotropic response of this material in the visible range, transitioning from hyperbolic polaritonic to an elliptic wavefront. Our calculations substantiate the experimental findings, positioning borophene as an unprecedented candidate for the in-plane hyperbolic response in the visible range. These results open avenues for pioneering optoelectronic applications in the visible spectrum, particularly through the incorporation of borophene into hybrid metallic-semiconducting heterostructures.

Title: SU(N) magnetism with ultracold molecules
Authors: Bijit Mukherjee, Jeremy M. Hutson, Kaden R. A. Hazzard
Abstract: Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.

Abstract: In unconventional high-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors, the pair density wave state, an exotic superconducting order showing spatially periodic order parameter modulations with the period of several unit cells and translational symmetry breaking, has attracted broad attention. However, the superconducting pair density modulation within a single unit cell (PDM) has never been carefully investigated before. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we report the observation of PDM in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001). The superconductivity modulations are characterized by the superconducting gap size and the coherence peak sharpness. Further analysis shows that the local maxima and minima in the superconducting gap modulation are centered at the crystallographic locations of the chalcogen atoms, revealing the breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry of the chalcogen atoms in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films grown on SrTiO3(001). Our findings provide precise microscopic information on superconductivity within the lattice unit cell and may promote the understanding of unconventional high-Tc superconductivity.

Title: Tree networks of real-world data: analysis of efficiency and spatiotemporal scales
Authors: Davide Cipollini, Lambert Schomaker
Abstract: Hierarchical tree structures are common in many real-world systems, from tree roots and branches to neuronal dendrites and biologically inspired artificial neural networks, as well as in technological networks for organizing and searching complex datasets of high-dimensional patterns. Within the class of hierarchical self-organized systems, we investigate the interplay of structure and function, associated with the emergence of complex tree structures in disordered environments. Using an algorithm that creates and searches trees of real-world patterns, our work stands at the intersection of statistical physics, machine learning, and network theory. We resolve the network properties over multiple phase transitions and across a continuity of scales, using the von Neumann entropy, its generalized susceptibility, and the recent definition of thermodynamic-like quantities, such as work, heat, and efficiency. We show that scale-invariance, i.e. power-law Laplacian spectral density, is a key feature to construct trees capable of combining fast information flow and sufficiently rich internal representation of information, enabling the system to achieve its functional task efficiently. Moreover, the complexity of the environmental conditions the system has adapted to is encoded in the value of the exponent of the power-law spectral density, inherently related to the network spectral dimension, and directly influencing the traits of those functionally efficient networks. Thereby, we provide a novel metric to estimate the complexity of high-dimensional datasets.

Title: Josephson microwave photon detector operating at 0.7 K
Authors: Dmitry A. Ladeynov, Andrey L. Pankratov, Leonid S. Revin, Anna V. Gordeeva, Alexander V. Chiginev, Sergey A. Razov, Evgeny V. Ilichev
Abstract: We predict that the threshold detectors based on Al Josephson junctions, with critical currents below 100 nA, exhibiting a phase diffusion regime, can be exploited for the microwave photon detection both at 17 mK and 700 mK. We demonstrate a detection of two- and one-photon energies at 5 GHz with 90% and 15% efficiency and dark count time of about 0.1 s and 0.01 s, respectively. The observed weak temperature dependence of the detector's performance in the sub-kelvin range fully confirms its phase-diffusion mode of operation. On the other hand, these results show that inevitable thermal fluctuations are not the main source of the detector noise. Consequently, there is still a room to optimize the detector's performance. These results are important for axion search experiments in the range of 5-25 GHz (20-100 $\mu$eV).

Title: How Can We Engineer Electronic Transitions Through Twisting and Stacking in TMDC Bilayers and Heterostructures? A First-Principles Approach
Authors: Yu-Hsiu Lin, William P. Comaskey, Jose L. Mendoza-Cortes
Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit unique properties, expanding opportunities in material design. We investigate MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) in homo- and heterobilayers with different stacking and twist angles. Twisted bilayers introduce Moiré patterns, significantly altering electronic properties. Using first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) with range-separated hybrid functionals, we examine 30 MX$_2$ combinations, revealing how stacking and composition influence stability and band gap energy (E$_g$). Notably, the MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure with a 60\textdegree~shift maintains a direct band gap, highlighting its potential for applications. Homobilayers under low-strain conditions exhibit diverse stacking-dependent electronic behaviors, where MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$ transition between direct and indirect band gaps at specific twist angles. MoS$_2$ can even switch between semiconductor and metallic states. Critical twist angles (17.9\textdegree, 42.1\textdegree, 77.9\textdegree, and 102.1\textdegree) in twisted WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ bilayers yield symmetric Moiré patterns with tunable band gaps. Our findings emphasize that controlling heterostructures and twist angles is a powerful strategy for engineering electronic properties, offering a pathway for next-generation materials.

Title: Real-Time Detection and Control of Correlated Charge Tunneling in a Quantum Dot
Authors: Johannes C. Bayer, Fredrik Brange, Adrian Schmidt, Timo Wagner, Eddy P. Rugeramigabo, Christian Flindt, Rolf J. Haug
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the real-time detection and control of correlated charge tunneling in a dynamically driven quantum dot. Specifically, we measure the joint distribution of waiting times between tunneling charges and show that the waiting times for holes may be strongly correlated due to the periodic drive and the Coulomb interactions on the dot, although the electron waiting times are not. Our measurements are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model that allows us to develop a detailed understanding of the correlated tunneling events. We also demonstrate that the degree of correlations can be controlled by the drive. Our experiment paves the way for systematic real-time investigations of correlated electron transport in low-dimensional nanostructures.

Title: Emergence of Newtonian Deterministic Causality from Stochastic Motions in Continuous Space and Time
Authors: Bing Miao, Hong Qian, Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: Since Newton's time, deterministic causality has been considered a crucial prerequisite in any fundamental theory in physics. In contrast, the present work investigates stochastic dynamical models for motion in one spatial dimension, in which Newtonian mechanics becomes an emergent property: We present a coherent theory in which a Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE) emerges in a description of the evolution of entropy $-\phi(x,t)=\epsilon \log$(Probability) of a system under observation and in the limit of large information extent $\epsilon^{-1}$ in homogeneous space and time. The variable $\phi$ represents a non-random high-order statistical concept that is distinct from probability itself as $\epsilon=0$; the HJE embodies an emergent law of deterministic causality in continuous space and time with an Imaginary Scale symmetry $(t,x,\phi)\leftrightarrow (it,ix,-i\phi)$. $\phi(x,t)$ exhibits a nonlinear wave phenomenon with a mathematical singularity in finite time, overcoming which we introduce viscosity $\epsilon(\partial^2\phi/\partial x^2)$ and wave $i\epsilon(\partial^2 \phi/\partial x^2)$ perturbations, articulating dissipation and conservation, which break the Imaginary Scale symmetry: They lead to the Brownian motion and Schrödinger's equation of motion, respectively. Last but not least, Lagrange's action in classical mechanics acquires an entropic interpretation and Hamilton's principle is established.

Title: Unraveling-induced entanglement phase transition in diffusive trajectories of continuously monitored noninteracting fermionic systems
Authors: Moritz Eissler, Igor Lesanovsky, Federico Carollo
Abstract: The competition between unitary quantum dynamics and dissipative stochastic effects, as emerging from continuous-monitoring processes, can culminate in measurement-induced phase transitions. Here, a many-body system abruptly passes, when exceeding a critical measurement rate, from a highly entangled phase to a low-entanglement one. We consider a different perspective on entanglement phase transitions and explore whether these can emerge when the measurement process itself is modified, while keeping the measurement rate fixed. To illustrate this idea, we consider a noninteracting fermionic system and focus on diffusive detection processes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that, upon varying a suitable \textit{unraveling parameter} -- interpolating between measurements of different quadrature operators -- the system displays a transition from a phase with area-law entanglement to one where entanglement scales logarithmically with the system size. Our findings may be relevant for tailoring quantum correlations in noisy quantum devices and for conceiving optimal classical simulation strategies.

Title: Dissecting van der Waals interactions with Density Functional Theory -- Wannier-basis approach
Authors: Diem Thi-Xuan Dang, Dai-Nam Le, Lilia M. Woods
Abstract: A new scheme for the computation of dispersive interactions from first principles is presented. This cost-effective approach relies on a Wannier function representation compatible with density function theory descriptions. This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in benchmarked materials and layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.

Title: Bethe $M$-layer construction for the percolation problem
Authors: Maria Chiara Angelini, Saverio Palazzi, Tommaso Rizzo, Marco Tarzia
Abstract: The major difference between percolation and other phase transition models is the absence of an Hamiltonian and of a partition function. For this reason it is not straightforward to identify the corresponding field theory to be used as starting point of Renormalization Group computations. Indeed, it could be identified with the field theory of $n+1$ states Potts model in the limit of $n \to 0$ only by means of the mapping discovered by Kasteleyn and Fortuin for bond percolation. In this paper we show that it is possible to recover the epsilon expansion for critical exponents in finite dimension directly using the $M$-layer expansion, without the need to perform any analytical continuation. Moreover, we also show explicitly that the critical exponents for site and bond percolation are the same. This computation provides a reference for applications of the $M$-layer method to systems where the underlying field theory is unknown or disputed.

Title: Long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting
Authors: Robert Mattes, Igor Lesanovsky, Federico Carollo
Abstract: Enhanced experimental capabilities to control nonlocal and power-law decaying interactions are currently fuelling intense research in the domain of quantum many-body physics. Compared to their counterparts with short-ranged interactions, long-range interacting systems display novel physics, such as nonlinear light cones for the propagation of information or inequivalent thermodynamic ensembles. In this work, we consider generic long-range open quantum systems in arbitrary dimensions and focus on the so-called strong long-range regime. We prove that in the thermodynamic limit local properties, captured by reduced quantum states, are described by an emergent non-interacting theory. Here, the dynamics factorizes and the individual constituents of the system evolve independently such that no correlations are generated over time. In this sense, long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting. This has significant implications for their relaxation behavior, for instance in relation to the emergence of long-lived quasi-stationary states or to the absence of thermalization.

Title: Mixing by squirmers in stratified fluids
Authors: Vaseem A. Shaik, Gwynn J. Elfring
Abstract: We find the mixing induced by a small swimming organism in a density stratified fluid. We model the swimmer as a spherical squirmer and quantify mixing through a mixing efficiency that is the ratio of rate of change of potential energy of fluid to the total work done by the swimmer. Assessing mixing in the near field and far field of the swimmer separately, we find that the near-field mixing aligns with past work, but the overall mixing is much larger than that caused by a point-sized swimmer (like force-dipole), although still small in weak stratification. Equivalent results are also obtained for a homogeneous dilute suspension of non-interacting swimmers. Our study highlights the impact of swimmer size on mixing, revealing that small-sized swimmers cannot induce substantial mixing. However, we propose few (unexplored) pathways through which small swimmers could induce significant mixing, ultimately contributing towards oceanic mixing.

Title: Two-dimensional Brownian motion with dependent components: turning angle analysis
Authors: Michał Balcerek, Adrian Pacheco-Pozo, Agnieszka Wyłomanska, Krzysztof Burnecki, Diego Krapf
Abstract: Brownian motion in one or more dimensions is extensively used as a stochastic process to model natural and engineering signals, as well as financial data. Most works dealing with multidimensional Brownian motion consider the different dimensions as independent components. In this article, we investigate a model of correlated Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the individual components are not necessarily independent. We explore various statistical properties of the process under consideration, going beyond the conventional analysis of the second moment. Our particular focus lies on investigating the distribution of turning angles. This distribution reveals particularly interesting characteristics for processes with dependent components that are relevant to applications in diverse physical systems. Theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets: the financial data of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor's 500, and trajectories of polystyrene beads in water. Finally, we show that the model can be readily extended to trajectories with correlations that change over time.

Title: Information-entropy-driven generation of material-agnostic datasets for machine-learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Aparna P. A. Subramanyam, Danny Perez
Abstract: In contrast to their empirical counterparts, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIAPs) promise to deliver near-quantum accuracy over broad regions of configuration space. However, due to their generic functional forms and extreme flexibility, they can catastrophically fail to capture the properties of novel, out-of-sample configurations, making the quality of the training set a determining factor, especially when investigating materials under extreme conditions. We propose a novel automated dataset generation method based on the maximization of the information entropy of the feature distribution, aiming at an extremely broad coverage of the configuration space in a way that is agnostic to the properties of specific target materials. The ability of the dataset to capture unique material properties is demonstrated on a range of unary materials, including elements with the fcc (Al), bcc (W), hcp (Be, Re and Os), graphite (C), and trigonal (Sb, Te) ground states. MLIAPs trained to this dataset are shown to be accurate over a range of application-relevant metrics, as well as extremely robust over very broad swaths of configurations space, even without dataset fine-tuning or hyper-parameter optimization, making the approach extremely attractive to rapidly and autonomously develop general-purpose MLIAPs suitable for simulations in extreme conditions.

Title: Minimal work protocols for inertial particles in non-harmonic traps
Authors: Julia Sanders, Marco Baldovin, Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi
Abstract: Progress in miniaturized technology allows us to control physical systems at nanoscale with remarkable precision. Experimental advancements have sparked interest in control problems in stochastic thermodynamics, typically concerning a time-dependent potential applied to a nanoparticle to reach a target stationary state in a given time with minimal energy cost. We study this problem for a particle subject to thermal fluctuations in a regime that takes into account the effects of inertia, and, building on the results of a previous work, provide a numerical method to find optimal controls even for non-Gaussian initial and final conditions, corresponding to non-harmonic confinements. The control protocol and the time-dependent position distribution are qualitatively different from the corresponding overdamped limit: in particular, a symmetry of the boundary conditions, which is preserved in the absence of inertia, turns out to be broken in the underdamped regime. We also show that the momentum mean tends to a constant value along the trajectory, except close to the boundary, while the evolution of the position mean and of the second moments is highly non-trivial. Our results also support that the lower bound on the optimal entropy production computed from the overdamped case is tight in the adiabatic limit.

Title: Predicting quantum materials properties using novel faithful machine learning embeddings
Authors: Gavin Nop, Micah Mundy, Durga Paudyal, Jonathan Smith
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is accelerating the progress of materials prediction and classification, with particular success in CGNN designs. While classical ML methods remain accessible, advanced deep networks are still challenging to build and train. We introduce two new adaptations and refine two existing ML networks for generic crystalline quantum materials properties prediction and optimization. These new models achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting TQC classification and strong performance in predicting band gaps, magnetic classifications, formation energies, and symmetry group. All networks easily generalize to all quantum crystalline materials property predictions. To support this, full implementations and automated methods for data handling and materials predictions are provided, facilitating the use of deep ML methods in quantum materials science. Finally, dataset error rates are analyzed using an ensemble model to identify and highlight highly atypical materials for further investigations.

Title: Haldane model on the Sierpi\'nski gasket
Authors: Zebedeus Osseweijer, Lumen Eek, Anouar Moustaj, Mikael Fremling, Cristiane Morais Smith
Abstract: We investigate the topological phases of the Haldane model on the Sierpiński gasket. As a consequence of the fractal geometry, multiple fractal gaps arise. Additionally, a flat band appears, and due to a complex next-nearest neighbour hopping, this band splits and multiple topological flux-induced gaps emerge. Owing to the fractal nature of the model, conventional momentum-space topological invariants cannot be used. Therefore, we characterise the system's topology in terms of a real-space Chern number. In addition, we verify the robustness of the topological states to disorder. Finally, we present phase diagrams for both a fractal gap and a flux-induced gap. Previous work on a similar system claims that fractality "squeezes" the well-known Haldane phase diagram. However, this result arises because a doubled system was considered with two Sierpiński gaskets glued together. We consider only a single copy of the Sierpiński gasket, keeping global self-similarity. In contrast with these previous results, we find intricate and complex patterns in the phase diagram of this single fractal. Our work shows that the fractality of the model greatly influences the phase space of these structures, and can drive topological phases in the multitude of fractal and flux-induced gaps, providing a richer platform than a conventional integer dimensional geometry.

Title: Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits
Authors: Friedrich Hübner, Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli
Abstract: Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.

Title: Ternary superhydrides under pressure of Anderson's theorem: Near-record superconductivity in (La,Sc)H$_{12}$

Abstract: Lanthanum-hydrogen system and its derivatives remain among the most promising for achieving room-temperature superconductivity. In this study, we examined the formation of ternary lanthanum-scandium superhydrides at pressures up to 220 GPa. The primary product of the LaSc alloy's reaction with hydrogen is newly discovered cubic (La,Sc)H$_{12}$, demonstrating clear superconducting transition in all six channels of the van der Pauw scheme below 244-248 K. In this compound with an unusually large unit cell volume, virtually no magnetoresistance was observed in fields up to 68 Tesla. Synthesized samples of (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ demonstrate pronounced superconducting diode and SQUID-like effects at a record high temperature of 233 K. Furthermore, our analysis revealed the formation of lower hexagonal polyhydrides (La,Sc)H$_{6-7}$, which could potentially account for the anomaly in electrical resistance observed near 274 K. This anomaly between 265-290 K also appears in the radio-frequency transmission measurements and may be of a superconducting nature.

Title: Complexions at the Iron-Magnetite Interface
Authors: Xuyang Zhou, Baptiste Bienvenu, Yuxiang Wu, Alisson Kwiatkowski da Silva, Colin Ophus, Dierk Raabe
Abstract: Synthesizing distinct phases and controlling the crystalline defects in them are key concepts in materials and process design. These approaches are usually described by decoupled theories, with the former resting on equilibrium thermodynamics and the latter on nonequilibrium kinetics. By combining them into a holistic form of defect phase diagrams, we can apply phase equilibrium models to the thermodynamic evaluation of defects such as vacancies, dislocations, surfaces, grain boundaries, and phase boundaries, placing the understanding of material imperfections and their role on properties on solid thermodynamic and theoretical grounds. In this study, we characterize an interface-stabilized phase between Fe and Fe3O4 (magnetite) with differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). This method uniquely enables the simultaneous imaging of both heavy Fe atoms and light O atoms, providing precise mapping of the atomic structure and chemical composition at this heterogeneous metal-oxide interface. We identify a well-ordered two-layer interface-stabilized phase state (referred to as complexion) at the Fe[001]/Fe3O4[001] interface. Using density-functional theory (DFT), we not only explain the observed complexion but also map out various interface-stabilized phases as a function of the O chemical potential. We show that the formation of complexions influences the properties of the interface, increasing its adhesion by 20 % and changing the charge transfer between adjacent materials, also leveraging impact on the transport properties across such interfaces. Our findings highlight the potential of tunable phase states at defects as a new asset in advanced materials design, paving the way for knowledge-based and optimized corrosion protection, catalysis, magnetism, and redox-driven phase transitions.

Title: Impact of Spin-Orbit Coupling on Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Graphene
Authors: Jixiang Yang, Xiaoyan Shi, Shenyong Ye, Chiho Yoon, Zhengguang Lu, Vivek Kakani, Tonghang Han, Junseok Seo, Lihan Shi, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Fan Zhang, Long Ju
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has played an important role in many topological and correlated electron materials. In graphene-based systems, SOC induced by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) at proximity was shown to drive topological states and strengthen superconductivity. However, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a robust platform for electron correlation and topology, superconductivity and the role of SOC remain largely unexplored. Here we report transport measurements of TMD-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG). We observed a new hole-doped superconducting state SC4 with Tc = 230 mK. On the electron-doped side, we identified a new isospin-symmetry breaking three-quarter-metal (TQM) phase and observed the nearby weak superconducting state SC3 is significantly enhanced. Surprisingly, the original superconducting state SC1 in bare RTG is strongly suppressed in the presence of TMD - opposite to the effect of SOC on all other graphene superconductivities. Our observations form the basis of exploring superconductivity and non-Abelian quasiparticles in rhombohedral graphene devices.

Title: Semi-Deterministic and Stochastic Sampling of Feynman Diagrams with 1/N$_f$ Expansions
Authors: Boyuan Shi
Abstract: We introduce a family of (semi) bold-line series, assisted with $1/\text{N}_{f}$ expansions, with $\text{N}_{f}$ being the number of fermion flavours. If there is no additional $\mathrm{N}_{f}$ cut, the series reduces to the RPA series in the density-density channel, complementary to the particle-hole and particle-particle channels introduced in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{102}, 195122]. We performed extensive benchmarks for density, energy and pressure with $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{t}'$ $\mathrm{SU}(\mathrm{N}_{f})$ Hubbard model on square lattice and honeycomb lattices over a wide range of numerical methods. For benchmark purposes, we also implement bare-$\mathrm{U}$ symmetry-broken perturbation series for the 2D SU(2) Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. We find difficulties simulating grand potentials with different shift parameters even at high temperatures and weak interactions, while in general find encouraging results for density simulations. We believe the search for optimal shift parameters is feasible, while we leave this problem for future studies. Nevertheless, the $1/\mathrm{N}_{f}$ series could proves efficacious for grand potential computations where symmetry broken bare-U expansion grapples with considerable challenges.

Title: $Z_2$ flux binding to higher-spin impurities in the Kitaev spin liquid
Authors: Masahiro O. Takahashi, Wen-Han Kao, Satoshi Fujimoto, Natalia B. Perkins
Abstract: Stabilizing $Z_2$ fluxes in Kitaev spin liquids (KSLs) is crucial for both characterizing candidate materials and identifying Ising anyons. In this study, we investigate the effects of spin-$S$ magnetic impurities embedded in the spin-1/2 KSL. Utilizing exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods, we examine the impurity magnetization and ground-state flux sector with varying impurity coupling and spin size. Our findings reveal that impurity magnetization exhibits an integer/half-integer spin dependence, which aligns with analytical predictions, and a flux-sector transition from bound-flux to zero-flux occurs at low coupling strengths, independent of the impurity spin. Notably, for spin-3/2 impurities, we observe a reentrant bound-flux sector, which remains stable under magnetic fields. By considering fermionic representations of our spin Hamiltonian, we provide phenomenological explanations for the transitions. Our results suggest a novel way of binding a flux in KSLs, beyond the proposals of vacancies or Kondo impurities.

Title: Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems
Authors: Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky
Abstract: Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently large.

Title: Scalability of Graph Neural Network in Accurate Prediction of Frictional Contact Network in Suspensions
Authors: Armin Aminimajd, Joao Maia, Abhinendra Singh
Abstract: Dense suspensions often exhibit shear thickening, characterized by a dramatic increase in viscosity under large external forcing. This behavior has recently been linked to the formation of a system-spanning frictional contact network (FCN), which contributes to increased resistance during deformation. However, identifying these frictional contacts poses experimental challenges and is computationally expensive. This study introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to accurately predict FCNs in two dimensional simulations of dense shear thickening suspensions. The results demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the GNN model across various stress levels $(\sigma)$, packing fractions$(\phi)$, system sizes, particle size ratios$(\Delta)$, and amount of smaller particles. The model is further able to predict both the occurrence and structure of the FCN. The presented model is accurate and interpolates and extrapolates to conditions far from its control parameters. This machine learning approach provides an accurate, lower cost, and faster predictions of suspension properties compared to conventional methods, while it is trained using only small systems. Ultimately, the findings in this study pave the way for predicting frictional contact networks in real-life large-scale polydisperse suspensions, for which theoretical models are largely limited owing to computational challenges.

Title: Two-component droplet phases and their spectral stability in one dimension
Authors: Efstathios G. Charalampidis, Simeon I. Mistakidis
Abstract: We unravel the existence and stability properties of one-dimensional droplets arising in genuine two-component particle imbalanced bosonic mixtures under the influence of a weak harmonic confinement. A plethora of miscible droplet phases is found with the majority component atoms in the vicinity of the minority ones assembling in a droplet configuration while the remaining excess atoms being in the gas state. Our computations identify a transition from a bound to a trapped gas many-body state for increasing total atom number and fixed interactions, with the bound character being prolonged for stronger intercomponent attractions. Spectral stability of these two-component droplets is revealed by examining their underlying Bogoliubov-de-Gennes excitation spectrum. Furthermore, the collective dynamics associated with the fundamental dipole and breathing modes of the system is monitored by suddenly shifting the trap's center or quenching the trap's frequency, respectively. There, a back action of the significantly localized minority component is imprinted in the majority cloud. The present findings can be simulated in recent cold-atom experiments, thus setting the stage for probing the complex nonequilibrium dynamics of two-component droplets.

Title: Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length
Authors: Valla Fatemi, Pavel D. Kurilovich, Anton R. Akhmerov, Bernard van Heck
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.

Title: Dynamic Mean-Field Theory for Continuous Random Networks
Authors: W. A. Zúñiga-Galindo
Abstract: This article studies the dynamics of the mean-field approximation of continuous random networks. These networks are stochastic integrodifferential equations driven by Gaussian noise. The kernels in the integral operators are realizations of generalized Gaussian random variables. The equation controls the time evolution of a macroscopic state interpreted as neural activity, which depends on position and time. The position is an element of a measurable space. Such a network corresponds to a statistical field theory (STF) given by a momenta-generating functional. Discrete versions of the mentioned networks appeared in spin glasses and as models of artificial neural networks (NNs). Each of these discrete networks corresponds to a lattice SFT, where the action contains a finite number of neurons and two scalar fields for each neuron. In this article, we develop mathematically rigorous, continuous versions of the mean-field theory approximation and the double-copy system that allow us to derive a condition for the criticality of continuous stochastic networks via the largest Lyapunov exponent. We use two basic architectures; in the first one, the space of neurons is the real line, and then the neurons are organized in one layer; in the second one, the space of neurons is the p-adic line, and then the neurons are organized in an infinite, fractal, tree-like structure. We also studied a toy model of a continuous Gaussian network with a continuous phase transition. This behavior matches the critical brain hypothesis, which states that certain biological neuronal networks work near phase transitions.

Title: Spatial Form Factor for Point Patterns: Poisson Point Process, Coulomb Gas, and Vortex Statistics
Authors: Matteo Massaro, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: Point processes have broad applications in science and engineering. In physics, their use ranges from quantum chaos to statistical mechanics of many-particle systems. We introduce a spatial form factor (SFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the SFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the SFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The SFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the SFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The SFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process. As a physical application, we describe the spontaneous vortex formation during Bose-Einstein condensation in finite time recently studied in ultracold atom experiments and use the SFF to reveal the stochastic geometry of the resulting vortex patterns. In closing, we also introduce a generalization of the SFF applicable to arbitrary sets in a metric space.

Title: Gate-tunable nonlocal Josephson effect through magnetic van der Waals bilayers
Authors: G. A. Bobkov, D. S. Rabinovich, A. M. Bobkov, I. V. Bobkova
Abstract: It is well-known that the proximity effect at superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) interfaces produces damped oscillatory behavior of the Cooper pair wave function within the ferromagnetic regions, which is analogous to the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity. It is often called the mesoscopic FFLO state and gives rise to $0-\pi$-transitions in S/F/S Josephson junctions. This paper offers an analysis of the proximity effect at interfaces between superconductors and magnetic van der Waals (vdW) bilayers. The specific feature of the proximity effect in the vdW bilayer systems is the presence of non-local Cooper pairs. We predict that the mesoscopic FFLO state formed by such pairs is sensitive to the difference between on-site energies of the monolayers composing the bilayer and, thus, can be controlled by applying a gating potential to one of the monolayers. This opens the possibility of implementing gate-controlled $0-\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions through the magnetic vdW bilayer weak links.

Title: Majorana-metal transition in a disordered superconductor: percolation in a landscape of topological domain walls
Authors: V. A. Zakharov, I. C. Fulga, G. Lemut, J. Tworzydlo, C. W. J. Beenakker
Abstract: Most superconductors are thermal insulators. A disordered chiral $\textit{p}$-wave superconductor, however, can make a transition to a thermal metal phase. Because heat is then transported by Majorana fermions, this phase is referred to as a Majorana metal. Here we present numerical evidence that the mechanism for the phase transition with increasing electrostatic disorder is the percolation of boundaries separating domains of different Chern number. We construct the network of domain walls using the spectral localizer as a ``topological landscape function'', and obtain the thermal metal--insulator phase diagram from the percolation transition.

Title: Surface polarization strongly influences electrostatics in a nonlocal medium
Authors: Ali Behjatian, Ralf Blossey, Madhavi Krishnan
Abstract: Electrostatics in the solution phase is governed by free electrical charges such as ions, as well as by bound charges that arise when a polarizable medium responds to an applied field. In a local medium, described by a constant dielectric permittivity, the sign of the far-field electrostatic potential distribution around an object is governed by its electrical charge. We demonstrate significant departures from this expectation in a nonlocal medium characterized by a wave vector-dependent dielectric function. Here, surface polarization due to the solvent, or indeed non-solvent dipoles, may wield significant influence at large distances. The polarization correlation length may not only significantly augment the effective screening length, but we also show that the electrical contribution from polarization can compete with and even invert the sign of the electrical potential and the field arising from charge alone. These results hold ramifications for a range of apparently anomalous electrically governed observations such as underscreening, electrophoretic mobilities of charge-neutral objects, and long-ranged attraction between like-charged entities in water and other solvents.

Title: Novel Topology and Manipulation of Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Jared Erb, Nadav Shaibe, Robert Calvo, Daniel Lathrop, Thomas Antonsen, Tsampikos Kottos, Steven M. Anlage
Abstract: The control of wave scattering in complex non-Hermitian settings is an exciting subject -- often challenging the creativity of researchers and stimulating the imagination of the public. Successful outcomes include invisibility cloaks, wavefront shaping protocols, active metasurface development, and more. At their core, these achievements rely on our ability to engineer the resonant spectrum of the underlying physical structures which is conventionally accomplished by carefully imposing geometrical and/or dynamical symmetries. In contrast, by taking active control over the boundary conditions in complex scattering environments which lack artificially-imposed geometric symmetries, we demonstrate via microwave experiments the ability to manipulate the spectrum of the scattering operator. This active control empowers the creation, destruction and repositioning of exceptional point degeneracies (EPD's) in a two-dimensional (2D) parameter space. The presence of EPD's signifies a coalescence of the scattering eigenmodes, which dramatically affects transport. The scattering EPD's are partitioned in domains characterized by a binary charge, as well as an integer winding number, are topologically stable in the two-dimensional parameter space, and obey winding number-conservation laws upon interactions with each other, even in cases where Lorentz reciprocity is violated; in this case the topological domains are destroyed. Ramifications of this understanding is the proposition for a unique input-magnitude and phase-insensitive 50:50 in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) power splitter. Our study establishes an important step towards complete control of scattering processes in complex non-Hermitian settings.

Title: Universally optimizable strategy for magnetic gaps towards high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall states via magnetic-insulator/topological-insulator building-blocks
Authors: Zhe Li, Feng Xue, Xin-Yi Tang, Xiyu Hong, Yang Chen, Xiao Feng, Ke He
Abstract: Optimizing the magnetic Zeeman-splitting term, specifically the magnetic gap of the topological surface states (TSSs), is a crucial issue and central challenge in advancing higher-temperature quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In this work, we demonstrate a counterintuitive, nonmonotonic relationship between the magnetic gap and the hybridization strength in ferromagnetic-insulator (FMI)/topological-insulator (TI) sandwich structures. Concretely, insufficient hybridization strength fails to induce a substantial magnetic gap; while excessive hybridization incandesces the competition between kinetic and Coulomb exchange interactions, thereby reducing the gap. Strong hybridization strength also spatially delocalizes the TSSs, diminishing the effective orbital coupling between TSS-based p and magnetic d orbitals, which further weakens kinetic and Coulomb exchange interaction strength. Moreover, modifying the stacking order offers an experimentally viable approach to optimizing magnetic gaps, enabling the tunability of Chern numbers, chirality and maximizing global gaps. These findings unveil a universal guiding principle for optimizing magnetic gaps in FMI-TI proximity-based QAH systems, offering valuable insights for advancing experimental implementations in this field.

Title: Objective Moir\'e Pattern
Authors: Fan Feng
Abstract: Moiré patterns, typically formed by overlaying two layers of two-dimensional materials, exhibit an effective long-range periodicity that depends on the short-range periodicity of each layer and their spatial misalignment. Here, we study moiré patterns in objective structures with symmetries different from those in conventional patterns such as twisted bilayer graphene. Specifically, the mathematical descriptions for ring patterns, 2D Bravais lattice patterns, and helical patterns are derived analytically as representative examples of objective moiré patterns, using an augmented Fourier approach. Our findings reveal that the objective moiré patterns retain the symmetries of their original structures but with different parameters. In addition, we present a non-objective case, conformal moiré patterns, to demonstrate the versatility of this approach. We hope this geometric framework will provide insights for solving more complex moiré patterns and facilitate the application of moiré patterns in X-ray diffractions, wave manipulations, molecular dynamics, and other fields.

Title: Single-boson exchange formulation of the Schwinger-Dyson equation and its application to the functional renormalization group
Authors: Miriam Patricolo, Marcel Gievers, Kilian Fraboulet, Aiman Al-Eryani, Sarah Heinzelmann, Pietro M. Bonetti, Alessandro Toschi, Demetrio Vilardi, Sabine Andergassen
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced single-boson exchange formulation to the computation of the self-energy from the Schwinger--Dyson equation (SDE). In particular, we derive its expression both in diagrammatic and in physical channels. The simple form of the single-boson exchange SDE, involving only the bosonic propagator and the fermion-boson vertex, but not the rest function, allows for an efficient numerical implementation. We furthermore discuss its implications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form factors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum dependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different channel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization group, we find that the convergence in the number of form factors depends on the channel representation of the SDE. For the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling, the pseudogap opening driven by antiferromagnetic fluctuations is captured already by a single ($s$-wave) form factor in the magnetic channel representation, differently to the density and superconducting channels.

Title: Structure of Quantum Mean Force Gibbs States for Coupled Harmonic Systems
Authors: Joonhyun Yeo, Haena Shim
Abstract: An open quantum system interacting with a heat bath at given temperature is expected to reach the mean force Gibbs (MFG) state as a steady state. The MFG state is given by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom from the equilibrium Gibbs state of the total system plus bath. When the interaction between the system and the bath is not negligible, it is different from the usual system Gibbs state obtained from the system Hamiltonian only. Using the path integral method, we present the exact MFG state for a coupled system of quantum harmonic oscillators in contact with multiple thermal baths at the same temperature. We develop a nonperturbative method to calculate the covariances with respect to the MFG state. By comparing them with those obtained from the system Gibbs state, we find that the effect of coupling to the bath decays exponentially as a function of the distance from the system-bath boundary. This is similar to the skin effect found recently for a quantum spin chain interacting with an environment. Using the exact results, we also investigate the ultrastrong coupling limit where the coupling between the system and the bath gets arbitrarily large and make a connection with the recent result found for a general quantum system.

Title: Analytical modelling for the frequency behavior of two distinct modes in nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillator
Authors: H. Ghanatian, M. Rajabali, R. Khymyn, A. Kumar, V. H. González, H. Farkhani, J.Åkerman, F. Moradi
Abstract: Nano-constriction spin-Hall nano-oscillators (NC-SHNOs) have garnered considerable interest due to their potential use as efficient and adjustable nano-sized sources of microwave signals, with high-frequency tunability, adaptable design layout, and CMOS compatibility. In order to facilitate system- and circuit-level designs based on the NC-SHNOs, it is essential to have an analytical model capable of predicting the behavior of the NC-SHNO. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model to describe the frequency behavior of a single NC-SHNO in an in-plane magnetic field while considering the Oersted field. The model is divided into two regions based on the direct current value: the "linear-like" and "bullet" modes. Each region is characterized by distinct concepts and equations. The first region, the "linear-like mode," emerges from the nano-constriction edges and progresses toward the center of the active area of the NC-SHNO. In contrast, the second regime, the localized "bullet mode," exhibits negative nonlinearity, where increasing the current will lead to a decrease in frequency. The model's validity is confirmed through experimental data obtained from electrical RF measurements on a single 180nm wide NC-SHNO, and the model demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data.

Title: Giant Nonvolatile Multistate Resistance with Fully Magnetically Controlled in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions
Authors: Zhi Yan, Xujin Zhang, Jianhua Xiao, Cheng Fang, Xiaohong Xu
Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching in electrically controlled van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) causes atomic migration, compromising device stability and fatigue resistance. Here we propose a fully magnetically controlled vdW-MFTJ based on a \(\mathrm{CrBr_3/MnPSe_3/CrBr_3}\) vertical heterostructure, which achieves ferroelectric polarization reversal without relying on atomic migration driven by inversion symmetry breaking. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.

Title: Orientation-dependent transport in junctions formed by $d$-wave altermagnets and $d$-wave superconductors
Authors: Wenjun Zhao, Yuri Fukaya, Pablo Burset, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Bo Lu
Abstract: We investigate de Gennes-Saint-James states and Josephson effect in hybrid junctions based on $d$-wave altermagnet and $d$-wave superconductor. Even though these states are associated to long junctions, we find that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-altermagnet in a normal metal/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor junction forms de Gennes-Saint-James states in a short junction due to an enhanced mismatch between electron and hole wave vectors. As a result, the zero-bias conductance peak vanishes and pronounced resonance spikes emerge in the subgap conductance spectra. By contrast, the $d_{xy}$-altermagnet only features de Gennes-Saint-James states in the long junction. Moreover, the well-known features such as V-shape conductance for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairings and zero-biased conductance peak for $d_{xy}$ pairings are not affected by the strength of $d_{xy}$-altermagnetism in the short junction. We also study the Josephson current-phase relation $I(\varphi)$ of $d$-wave superconductor/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrids, where $\varphi$ is the macroscopic phase difference between two $d$-wave superconductors. In symmetric junctions, we obtain anomalous current phase relation such as a $0$-$\pi$ transition by changing either the orientation or the magnitude of the altermagnetic order parameter and dominant higher Josephson harmonics. Interestingly, we find the first-order Josephson coupling in an asymmetric $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-superconductor/altermagnet/$d_{xy}$-superconductor junction when the symmetry of altermagnetic order parameter is neither $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- nor $d_{xy}$-wave. We present the symmetry analysis and conclude that the anomalous orientation-dependent current-phase relations are ascribed to the peculiar feature of the altermagnetic spin-splitting field.

Title: Selective enhancement of Coulomb interactions in planar Weyl fermions
Authors: Vadym Apalkov, Wenchen Luo, Tapash Chakraborty
Abstract: We report on our study of the electron interaction effects in topological two-dimensional (2D) materials placed in a quantizing magnetic field. Taking our cue from a recent experimental report, we consider a particular case of bismuthene monolayer with a strong spin-orbit interaction which can be a Weyl semimetal when placed on a specially tuned substrate. Interestingly, we observe that in some Landau levels of this material, the interaction effects are strongly enhanced compared to those for a conventional 2D system. Such an enhancement of electron-electron interactions in these materials is largely due to an anisotropy present in the materials. Additionally, the interaction effects can be tuned by changing the coupling to the substrate and the strongest inter-electron interactions are observed when the system is a Weyl semimental. The observed enhancement of the interaction effects can therefore be an important signature of the 2D Weyl fermions.

Title: Quasi-aperiodic grain boundary phases of {\Sigma}5 tilt grain boundaries in refractory metals
Authors: Enze Chen, Timofey Frolov
Abstract: We report new quasi-aperiodic, ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma5$ tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma5$ tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon. Density functional theory calculations yield similar GB energies and structures for kite and split kite phases in all BCC metals studied. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.

Title: The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions
Authors: Subir Sachdev
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The field theory for FL*-FL quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder is mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations. The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.

Title: Effect of metal (Ti) interlayer on fracture toughness of TiN thin films
Authors: Nidhin George Mathews, Aloshious Lambai, Marcus Hans, Jochen M. Schneider, Gaurav Mohanty, Balila Nagamani Jaya
Abstract: Titanium nitride (TiN) is widely used as a protective coating due to its high hardness, but suffers from inherent brittleness and low fracture toughness, limiting its applicability. The layering of TiN films with metallic titanium (Ti) improves the overall fracture behaviour of the architecture by modifying the crack driving force due to elastic-plastic mismatch between the layers. Microcantilever fracture tests were carried out on bilayer (Ti-TiN, TiN-Ti) and trilayer (Ti-TiN-Ti) architectures to determine the fracture toughness and study the fundamental crack growth behaviour. The initiation fracture toughness in bilayer architecture with crack in Ti layer is almost 70% higher, when compared to crack in TiN layer. In Ti-TiN bilayer the crack propagated catastrophically post linear elastic deformation, whereas the crack was arrested at the TiN/Ti interface in both TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti architectures due to plastic energy dissipation in the Ti layer. Crack tip plasticity originated in the metallic Ti layer in TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti architectures increased the total fracture resistance by more than eight-fold compared to the Ti-TiN bilayer.

Title: A machine-learning study of phase transitions in Ising, Blume-Capel, and Ising-metamagnet models
Authors: Vasanth Kumar Babu, Rahul Pandit
Abstract: We combine machine-learning (ML) techniques with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and finite-size scaling (FSS) to study continuous and first-order phase transitions in Ising, Blume-Capel, and Ising-metamagnet spin models. We go beyond earlier studies that had concentrated on obtaining the correlation-length exponent $\nu$. In particular, we show (a) how to combine neural networks (NNs), trained with data from MC simulations of Ising-type spin models on finite lattices, with FSS to obtain both thermal magnetic exponents $y_t = 1/\nu$ and $y_h$, respectively, at both critical and tricritical points, (b) how to obtain the NN counterpart of two-scale-factor universality at an Ising-type critical point, and (c) FSS at a first-order transition. We also obtain the FSS forms for the output of our trained NNs as functions of both the temperature and the magnetic field.

Title: Nonlinear shallow-water waves with vertical odd viscosity
Authors: Alex Doak, Guido Baardink, Paul A Milewski, Anton Souslov
Abstract: The breaking of detailed balance in fluids through Coriolis forces or odd-viscous stresses has profound effects on the dynamics of surface waves. Here we explore both weakly and strongly non-linear waves in a three-dimensional fluid with vertical odd viscosity with and without the Coriolis effect. Our model describes the free surface of a shallow fluid composed of nearly vertical vortex filaments, which all stand perpendicular to the surface. We find that the odd viscosity in this configuration induces previously unexplored non-linear effects in shallow-water waves, arising from both stresses on the surface and stress gradients in the bulk. By assuming weak nonlinearity, we find reduced equations including Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Ostrovsky, and Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli (KP) equations with modified coefficients. At sufficiently large odd viscosity, the dispersion changes sign, allowing for compact two-dimensional solitary waves. We show that odd viscosity and surface tension have the same effect on the free surface, but distinct signatures in the fluid flow. Our results describe the collective dynamics of many-vortex systems, which can also occur in oceanic and atmospheric geophysics.

Title: Quantum complexity phase transitions in monitored random circuits
Authors: Ryotaro Suzuki, Jonas Haferkamp, Jens Eisert, Philippe Faist
Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.

Title: Automated Graph-Based Detection of Quantum Control Schemes: Application to Molecular Laser Cooling
Authors: Anna Dawid, Niccolò Bigagli, Daniel W. Savin, Sebastian Will
Abstract: One of the demanding frontiers in ultracold quantum science is identifying laser cooling schemes for complex atoms and molecules out of their vast spectra of internal states. Motivated by the prospect of expanding the set of available ultracold molecules for applications in fundamental physics, chemistry, astrochemistry, and quantum simulation, we propose and demonstrate an automated graph-based search approach for viable laser cooling schemes. The method is time efficient, reproduces the results of previous manual searches, and reveals a plethora of new potential laser cooling schemes. We discover laser cooling schemes for YO, C$_2$, OH$^+$, CN, and CO$_2$, including surprising schemes that start from highly excited states or do not rely on a strong main transition. A central insight of this work is that the reinterpretation of quantum states and transitions between them as a graph can dramatically enhance the ability to identify new quantum control schemes for complex quantum systems. As such, this approach will also apply to complex atoms and, in fact, any complex many-body quantum system with a discrete spectrum of internal states.

Title: Making Sense of Gravitational Thermodynamics
Authors: Lorenzo Lorenzetti
Abstract: The use of statistical methods to model gravitational systems is crucial to physics practice, but the extent to which thermodynamics and statistical mechanics genuinely apply to these systems is a contentious issue. This paper provides new conceptual foundations for gravitational thermodynamics by reconsidering the nature of key concepts like equilibrium and advancing a novel way of understanding thermodynamics. The challenges arise from the peculiar characteristics of the gravitational potential, leading to non-extensive energy and entropy, negative heat capacity, and a lack of standard equilibrium. Hence it has been claimed that only non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is warranted in this domain, whereas thermodynamics is inapplicable. We argue instead that equilibrium statistical mechanics applies to self-gravitating systems at the relevant scale, as they display equilibrium in the form of metastable quasi-equilibrium states. We then develop a minimal framework for thermodynamics that can be applied to these systems and beyond. Thermodynamics applies in the sense that we can devise macroscopic descriptions and explanations of the behaviour of these systems in terms of coarse-grained quantities like energy and temperature within equilibrium statistical mechanics.

Title: Conformal geometry from entanglement
Authors: Isaac H. Kim, Xiang Li, Ting-Chun Lin, John McGreevy, Bowen Shi
Abstract: In a physical system with conformal symmetry, observables depend on cross-ratios, measures of distance invariant under global conformal transformations (conformal geometry for short). We identify a quantum information-theoretic mechanism by which the conformal geometry emerges at the gapless edge of a 2+1D quantum many-body system with a bulk energy gap. We introduce a novel pair of information-theoretic quantities $(\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}, \eta)$ that can be defined locally on the edge from the wavefunction of the many-body system, without prior knowledge of any distance measure. We posit that, for a topological groundstate, the quantity $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is stationary under arbitrary variations of the quantum state, and study the logical consequences. We show that stationarity, modulo an entanglement-based assumption about the bulk, implies (i) $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is a non-negative constant that can be interpreted as the total central charge of the edge theory. (ii) $\eta$ is a cross-ratio, obeying the full set of mathematical consistency rules, which further indicates the existence of a distance measure of the edge with global conformal invariance. Thus, the conformal geometry emerges from a simple assumption on groundstate entanglement. We show that stationarity of $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is equivalent to a vector fixed-point equation involving $\eta$, making our assumption locally checkable. We also derive similar results for 1+1D systems under a suitable set of assumptions.

Title: Neural Quantum State Study of Fracton Models
Authors: Marc Machaczek, Lode Pollet, Ke Liu
Abstract: Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes -- the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code -- both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.

Title: Origin of yield stress and mechanical plasticity in model biological tissues
Authors: Anh Q. Nguyen, Junxiang Huang, Dapeng Bi
Abstract: During development and under normal physiological conditions, biological tissues are continuously subjected to substantial mechanical stresses. In response to large deformations cells in a tissue must undergo multicellular rearrangements in order to maintain integrity and robustness. However, how these events are connected in time and space remains unknown. Here, using computational and theoretical modeling, we studied the mechanical plasticity of epithelial monolayers under large deformations. Our results demonstrate that the jamming-unjamming (solid-fluid) transition in tissues can vary significantly depending on the degree of deformation, implying that tissues are highly unconventional materials. Using analytical modeling, we elucidate the origins of this behavior. We also demonstrate how a tissue accommodates large deformations through a collective series of rearrangements, which behave similarly to avalanches in non-living materials. We find that these tissue avalanches are governed by stress redistribution and the spatial distribution of vulnerable spots. Finally, we propose a simple and experimentally accessible framework to predict avalanches and infer tissue mechanical stress based on static images.

Title: Vacuum and Vortices in Inhomogeneous Abelian Higgs Model
Authors: Yoonbai Kim, SeungJun Jeon, O-Kab Kwon, Hanwool Song, Chanju Kim
Abstract: The inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model with a magnetic impurity in the BPS limit is studied for both relativistic and nonrelativistic regimes. Though the symmetry of spatial translation is broken by inhomogeneity, extension to an $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theory is admitted. The quartic scalar potential has minimum value depending on strength of the impurity but possesses broken phase at spatial asymptote. The vacuum configuration of broken phase can be neither a constant nor the minimum of the scalar potential, but is found as a nontrivial solution of the Bogomolny equations. While its energy density and magnetic field are given by the function of spatial coordinates, the energy and magnetic flux remain zero. The sign of the magnetic impurity term allows either a BPS sector or anti-BPS sector but not both. Thus the obtained solution is identified as the new inhomogeneous broken vacuum of minimum zero energy. In the presence of rotationally symmetric Gaussian type inhomogeneity, topological vortex solutions are also obtained and the effects of the impurity to the vortex are numerically analyzed.

Title: Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order
Authors: Carolyn Zhang, Yichen Xu, Jian-Hao Zhang, Cenke Xu, Zhen Bi, Zhu-Xi Luo
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a Rényi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, & Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite Rényi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.

Title: High-performance conditional-driving gate for Kerr parametric oscillator qubits
Authors: Hiroomi Chono, Hayato Goto
Abstract: Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), two-photon driven Kerr-nonlinear resonators, can stably hold coherent states with opposite-sign amplitudes and are promising devices for quantum computing. Recently, we have theoretically proposed a two-qubit gate $R_{zz}$ for highly detuned KPOs and called it a conditional-driving gate [Chono $\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. Res. $\textbf{4}$, 043054 (2022)]. In this study, analyzing its superconducting-circuit model and deriving a corresponding static model, we find that an AC-Zeeman shift due to the flux pulse for the gate operation largely affects the gate performance. This effect becomes a more aggravating factor with shorter gate times, leading to an increase in the error rate. We thus propose a method to cancel this undesirable effect. Furthermore, through the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity and the optimization of flux pulses, we numerically demonstrate a conditional-driving gate with average fidelity exceeding 99.9$\%$ twice faster than that without the proposed method.

Title: SU($N$) symmetry with ultracold alkali dimers: weak dependence of scattering properties on hyperfine state
Authors: Bijit Mukherjee, Jeremy M. Hutson
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of using ultracold alkali diatomic molecules to implement many-body quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry. Experimentally accessible molecules offer large $N$ for both bosonic and fermionic systems, with both attractive and repulsive interactions. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations on pairs of NaK, NaRb and NaCs molecules that are shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields. We develop new methods to handle the very large basis sets required to include nuclear spins. We show that all the molecules studied have the properties required for SU($N$) symmetry: the collisions are principally elastic, and the scattering lengths depend only weakly on the spin states of the molecules. The rates of spin-changing inelastic collisions are very low. We develop and test a semiclassical model of the spin dependence and find that it performs well.

Title: Quasi-electrostatic eigenmode analysis of anisotropic particles
Authors: Asaf Farhi, Haim Suchowski
Abstract: Anisotropic subwavelength particles combine the strong response and tunability of nanostructures with the exotic properties of anisotropic materials. Here we analytically derive the quasielectrostatic eigenmodes and eigenpermittivity relations of anistropic spheres and ellipsoids and present the results for spheres. We show that anisotropic particles exhibit novel radiation patterns and axial-eigenpermittivity sum rules, resulting in resonance splitting and eigenvalue degeneracy. Our results pave the way for a new generation of directional and multispectral detectors and biomarkers and apply to other fields of physics.

Title: On the numerical integration of the Fokker-Planck equation driven by a mechanical force and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula
Authors: Julia Sanders, Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi
Abstract: Optimal control theory aims to find an optimal protocol to steer a system between assigned boundary conditions while minimizing a given cost functional in finite time. Equations arising from these types of problems are often non-linear and difficult to solve numerically. In this note, we describe numerical methods of integration for two partial differential equations that commonly arise in optimal control theory: the Fokker-Planck equation driven by a mechanical potential for which we use Girsanov theorem; and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman, or dynamic programming, equation for which we find the gradient of its solution using the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula. The computation of the gradient is necessary to specify the optimal protocol. Finally, we give an example application of the numerical techniques to solving an optimal control problem without spacial discretization using machine learning.

Title: Quantum Friction near the Instability Threshold
Authors: Daigo Oue, Boris Shapiro, Mário G. Silveirinha
Abstract: In this work, we develop an analytical framework to understand quantum friction across distinct stability regimes, providing approximate expressions for frictional forces both in the deep stable regime and near the critical threshold of instability. Our primary finding is analytical proof that, near the instability threshold, the quantum friction force diverges logarithmically. This result, verified through numerical simulations, sheds light on the behavior of frictional instabilities as the system approaches criticality. Our findings offer new insights into the role of instabilities, critical divergence and temperature in frictional dynamics across quantum and classical regimes.

Title: Entanglement asymmetry in the Hayden-Preskill protocol
Authors: Hui-Huang Chen, Zi-Jun Tang
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the time evolution of entanglement asymmetry of the black hole radiation in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. We assume the black hole is initially in a mixed state since it is entangled with the early radiation. Alice throws a diary maximally entangled with a reference system into the black hole. After the black hole has absorbed the diary, Bob tries to recover the information that Alice thought should be destroyed by the black hole. In this protocol, we found that a $U(1)$ symmetry of the radiation emerges before a certain transition time (the time when the vanishing entanglement asymmetry begins to grow). This emergent symmetry is exact in the thermodynamic limit and can be characterized by the vanishing entanglement asymmetry of the radiation. The transition time depends on the initial entropy and the size of the diary. What's more, when the initial state of the black hole is maximally mixed, this emergent symmetry survives during the whole procedure of the black hole radiation. We successfully explained this novel phenomenon using the decoupling inequality.

Title: Statistics of invertible topological excitations: a framework using operators and many-body Hilbert spaces
Authors: Hanyu Xue
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics, based on string operators and many-body Hilbert space, to invertible topological excitations of any dimensions. This framework is only build on several fundamental facts in quantum mechanics, while providing a rigorous and systematic theory for statistics independent to topological order and field theory. Additionally, we propose several conjectures that may hold mathematical interest. We also present a computer program for computing statistics, which has yielded results consistent with traditional physical theories.

Title: Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics & Krylov Complexity
Authors: Hyun-Sik Jeong, Arnab Kundu, Juan F. Pedraza
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.

Title: The Effect of Optimal Self-Distillation in Noisy Gaussian Mixture Model
Authors: Kaito Takanami, Takashi Takahashi, Ayaka Sakata
Abstract: Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model refines itself from its own predictions, has garnered attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD in binary classification tasks with noisy labeled Gaussian mixture data, utilizing a replica theory. Our findings reveals that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate the efficacy of practical heuristics, such as early stopping for extracting meaningful signal and bias fixation for imbalanced data. These results provide both theoretical guarantees and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.

Title: Periodic Boundary Conditions for Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Jacob Higer, Yotam M. Y. Feldman, Barak Hirshberg
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.
