Title: Fracture Properties of Green Nano Fibrous Network with Random and Aligned Fibre Distribution: A Hierarchical Molecular Dynamics and Peridynamics Approach
Authors: Razie Izadi, Raj Das, Nicholas Fantuzzi, Patrizia Trovalusci
Abstract: Polylactic acid (PLA) nanofibrous networks have gained substantial interest across various engineering and scientific disciplines, such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, and filtration, due to their unique and multifunctional attributes, including biodegradability, tunable mechanical properties, and surface functionality. However, predicting their mechanical behaviour remains challenging due to their structural complexity, multiscale features, and variability in material properties. This study presents a hierarchical approach to investigate fracture phenomena in both aligned and randomly oriented nanofibrous networks by integrating atomistic modelling and nonlocal continuum mechanics, namely peridynamics. At the nanoscale, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are employed to apply tensile loads to freestanding pristine and silver-doped PLA nanofibres, where key mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and critical energy release rate are determined. A new method is introduced to transfer data from molecular dynamics to peridynamics by ensuring convergence of the tensile response of a single fiber in both frameworks. This nano-to-micro coupling technique is then used to examine the Young's modulus, fracture toughness in modes I and II, and crack propagation in PLA nanofibrous networks. The proposed framework can also incorporate the effects of surface coating and fiber arrangements on the measured properties. This research paves the way for the development of stronger and more durable eco-friendly nanofibrous networks with optimised performance.

Title: Inelastic Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: A generalized framework for automated discovery of interpretable inelastic material models
Authors: Chenyi Ji, Kian P. Abdolazizi, Hagen Holthusen, Christian J. Cyron, Kevin Linka
Abstract: A key problem of solid mechanics is the identification of the constitutive law of a material, that is, the relation between strain and stress. Machine learning has lead to considerable advances in this field lately. Here we introduce inelastic Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (iCKANs). This novel artificial neural network architecture can discover in an automated manner symbolic constitutive laws describing both the elastic and inelastic behavior of materials. That is, it can translate data from material testing into corresponding elastic and inelastic potential functions in closed mathematical form. We demonstrate the advantages of iCKANs using both synthetic data and experimental data of the viscoelastic polymer materials VHB 4910 and VHB 4905. The results demonstrate that iCKANs accurately capture complex viscoelastic behavior while preserving physical interpretability. It is a particular strength of iCKANs that they can process not only mechanical data but also arbitrary additional information available about a material (e.g., about temperature-dependent behavior). This makes iCKANs a powerful tool to discover in the future also how specific processing or service conditions affect the properties of materials.

Title: Families of localized modes of Bose-Einstein condensates enabled by incommensurate optical lattice and photon-atom interactions
Authors: Pedro S. Gil, Vladimir V. Konotop
Abstract: We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) loaded into a one-dimensional optical cavity under the combined action of an external potential and atom-cavity coupling with mutually incommensurate periods. Such configuration enables the localization of matter waves even in the absence of two-body interactions. We study families of localized modes within the mean-field approximation for red and blue detunings from atomic and cavity resonances in relatively shallow quasiperiodic lattices, beyond the validity of the tight-binding approximation. The parameter regimes supporting localization of atomic wave packets are identified. The system exhibits two types of bistability manifested as distinct photon numbers under otherwise identical conditions. One type arises from the coexistence of multiple families of localized modes, typical of conservative nonlinear systems, while the other stems from the multivalued dependence of the families on system parameters, characteristic of systems exhibiting hysteresis. BEC in a cavity may also display pseudodegeneracy, understood as the existence of two distinct atomic-density distributions corresponding to the same atomic and photon numbers (although different chemical potentials). The stability of the localized modes is analyzed. It is shown that, owing to the strong impact of long-range interactions on stability, a two-localized-mode configuration can operate as an XOR logic gate.

Title: Scaling invariance: a bridge between geometry, dynamics and criticality
Authors: Edson D. Leonel, Diego F. M. Oliveira
Abstract: Scale invariance is a central organizing principle in physics, underlying phenomena that range from critical behaviour in statistical mechanics to transport and chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems. Here we present a unified and physically motivated exploration of scaling concepts, emphasizing how invariance under rescaling transformations emerges across systems of increasing dynamical complexity. Rather than adopting a purely abstract approach, we combine simple geometrical constructions, analytical arguments, and prototypical dynamical models to build physical intuition. We begin with elementary, easily reproducible examples governed by a single control parameter, showing how power-law behaviour naturally arises when characteristic scales are absent. We then extend the discussion to nonlinear dynamical systems exhibiting local bifurcations, where two scaling variables control the relaxation toward stationary states. In this context, scaling invariance manifests through critical exponents, crossover phenomena, and critical slowing down, allowing systems of different dimensionality to be grouped into universality classes. Finally, we address continuous phase transitions in chaotic dynamical systems, including transitions from integrability to non-integrability and from bounded to unbounded diffusion. By drawing on concepts traditionally associated with statistical mechanics, such as order parameters, susceptibilities, symmetry breaking, elementary excitations, and topological defects, we show how these transitions can be interpreted within a coherent scaling framework. Taken together, the examples discussed here demonstrate that scaling invariance provides a unifying language for understanding structure, transport, and criticality in nonlinear systems, bridging deterministic dynamics and nonequilibrium statistical physics in a transparent and physically intuitive manner.

Title: Direct imaging of a topological nematic phase in a spin-compensated magnet
Authors: Weihang Lu, Camron Farhang, Yuchuan Yao, Pratap Pal, Hao Zhang, Shaofeng Han, Shi-Zeng Lin, Chang-Beom Eom, Jing Xia
Abstract: Density waves conventionally describe the periodic modulation of charge or spin, yet the spatial modulation of electronic topology has remained elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a Berry-curvature density wave in the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3NiN with compensated spins. Using high-precision Sagnac Kerr microscopy, we directly image micrometer-scale modulations of the Berry curvature. These topological ripples exhibit orientations unpinned to the crystal lattice, forming a nematic phase that spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry. We attribute this instability to field-induced spatial variations of the spin texture driven by competing magnetic interactions. This discovery unveils a new class of collective order in spin-compensated magnets arising from the geometric phase of the wavefunction itself and offering a tunable degree of freedom for topological spintronics based on antiferromagnets and altermagnets.

Title: Precise Determination of the Long-Time Asymptotics of the Diffusion Spreadability of Two-Phase Media
Authors: Shaobing Yuan, Salvatore Torquato
Abstract: The time-dependent diffusion spreadability $\mathcal{S}(t)$ is a powerful dynamical probe of the microstructure of two-phase heterogeneous media across length scales [Torquato, S., \emph{Phys. Rev. E.}, 104 054102 (2021)]. It has been shown that when the spectral density takes the power-law form $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(\mathbf{k})\sim |\mathbf{k}|^\alpha$ as the wavenumber $|\mathbf{k}|$ tends to zero, the normalized excess spreadability $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)$ [proportional to $\mathcal{S}(\infty)-\mathcal{S}(t)$] scales as $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)\sim t^{-\frac{d+\alpha}{2}}$ in the long-time limit $t\to\infty$, enabling one to determine the infinite-wavelength scaling exponent $\alpha$. An algorithm that allows one to reliably extract the exponent $\alpha$ from long-time spreadability data was previously devised [Wang, H., Torquato, S., \emph{Phys. Rev. Appl.}, 17 034022 (2022)]. In this paper, we further improve this procedure to obtain $\alpha$ even more accurately by incorporating higher-order correction terms to the long-time asymptotics and by utilizing analyticity properties of $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(k)$ at the origin. We illustrate our procedure by analyzing hyperuniform ($\alpha> 0$), typical nonhyperuniform ($\alpha=0$), and antihyperuniform ($-d < \alpha <0$) models of two-phase media. In addition, by combining the large-$t$ asymptotic expansion of $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)$ with the small-$t$ expansion, we have devised a two-point Padé approximant to approximate $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)$ for all $t$ with just a few parameters. Our findings facilitate the characterization of the microstructure of two-phase media across length scales as obtained from numerical spreadability data or experimental data obtained from NMR relaxation measurements. Our work can also be applied in the inverse design of two-phase microstructures with targeted spreadability behaviors.

Title: Leveraging mechanical resonances for the selection of promising materials in complex phase spaces
Authors: Christopher A. Mizzi, Osman El-Atwani, Tannor T.J. Munroe, Saryu Fensin, Boris Maiorov
Abstract: The "high-entropy" paradigm has been applied to a central challenge in materials science, the design of new functional materials with enhanced performance for targeted applications, with some notable successes over the last twenty years. However, the immensity of the high-entropy design space remains a major impediment to discovering optimal compositions with tailored microstructures. Suites of high-throughput computational tools have been developed to address this problem, but there is a compelling need to inform these models with fast, economical, non-destructive, and versatile experimental guidance. In this work, we demonstrate mechanical resonance measurements can address this need. Mechanical resonance measurements enable the rapid, non-destructive assessment of materials created by novel syntheses and/or processes and provide high-accuracy determinations of elastic constants to directly benchmark models. We exemplify these capabilities on W-Ta-Cr-V-Hf and Mo-Nb-Ti-V-Zr refractory high-entropy alloys and suggest methodologies for the wider adoption and application of mechanical resonance measurements.

Title: El Agente Sólido: A New Age(nt) for Solid State Simulations
Authors: Sai Govind Hari Kumar, Yunheng Zou, Andrew Wang, Jesús Valdés-Hernández, Tsz Wai Ko, Nathan Yue, Olivia Leng, Hanyong Xu, Chris Crebolder, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Varinia Bernales
Abstract: Quantum chemistry calculations are a key component of the materials discovery process. The results from first-principles explorations enable the prediction of material properties prior to experimental validation. Despite their impact, the practical use of first-principles methods remains limited by the expertise required to design, execute, and troubleshoot complex computational workflows. Even when workflows are successfully built, they are sometimes rigid and not adaptable to different use cases. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems offer a pathway to flexibly automate these processes and lower barriers to entry. Here, we introduce El Agente Sólido, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for automating solid-state quantum chemistry workflows using the open-source Quantum ESPRESSO simulation package. The framework translates high-level scientific objectives expressed in natural language into end-to-end computational pipelines that include structure generation, input file construction, workflow execution, and post-processing analysis. El Agente Sólido integrates density functional theory with phonon calculations and machine-learning interatomic potentials to enable efficient and physically consistent simulations. Extensive benchmarking and case studies demonstrate that El Agente Sólido reliably executes a wide range of solid-state calculations, highlighting its potential to improve reproducibility and accelerate computational materials discovery

Title: Ab initio Monte Carlo prediction of order-to-disorder transitions in multicomponent MXenes
Authors: Noah Oyeniran, Chongze Hu
Abstract: This letter predicts unprecedented order-to-disorder transition behaviors in multicomponent MXenes using an integrated and improved first-principles Monte Carlo (MC) framework. The improvements include (i) structural relaxation and (ii) selective atom swapping during MC iterations for more accurate and efficient predictions. Using (TiMo)-based double transition metal (DTM) carbide MXenes as a model system, ab initio MC simulations reveal that surface termination and coordination environments play critical roles in governing chemical ordering in MXenes. Specifically, the formation of out-of-plane MXene (o-MXenes) with Mo segregation to outermost metallic layers (M') is only driven by the oxygen (O) termination at prismatic sites. In contrast, O termination at octahedral sites and fluorine (F) termination at both prismatic and octahedral sites always promote the formation of o-MXenes with Ti-segregated to M' layers. Furthermore, changing the F/O ratio at prismatic termination sites or alternating the atomic coordination within the MXene lattices can induce an order-to-disorder transition in DTM MXenes.

Title: Microwave Imaging of Edge Conductivity in Graphene at Charge Neutrality and Quantum Hall States
Authors: Hongtao Yan, Chun-Chih Tseng, Anzhuoer Li, Manish Kumar, Kaile Wang, Shizai Chu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Allan H. MacDonald, Matthew Yankowitz, Keji Lai
Abstract: We report local conductivity imaging of edge states in monolayer graphene by millikelvin microwave impedance microscopy (MIM). At the charge-neutrality point, as the magnetic field increases, the local conductivity at the edge drops to zero more slowly than in the bulk. This behavior is consistent with the calculated spatial profile of the charge gap in the canted antiferromagnetic phase. For comparison, we also perform microwave imaging of integer quantum Hall states away from neutrality, which host dissipationless chiral edge channels. The evolution of the edge signal as a function of the bulk gap is fundamentally different between the Landau level filling factor $\nu = 0$ and $|\nu| \ge 1$ integer quantum Hall states, which can be qualitatively explained by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. Our results provide a comprehensive microscopic picture of the edge and bulk states as the Fermi level moves across the unique Landau-level spectrum of graphene.

Title: Observation of Room-temperature Charge Density Wave Correlations via Coherent Phonon Spectroscopy in Sn-doped Kagome Superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Qinwen Deng, Andrea Capa Salinas, Suchismita Sarker, Leon Balents, Stephen D. Wilson, Liang Wu
Abstract: In this work, we perform ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity measurements to track the evolution of charge density wave (CDW) correlations in Sn-doped Kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum, we evidence robust signatures of CDW correlations at temperature and doping ranges far beyond the phase boundary of long-range CDW order. Remarkably, we unveil short-range CDW correlations survive up to room temperature in $x = 0.32$ Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, supported by synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements. We point out the introduction of quenched disorder by Sn doping can pin the CDW and form static short-range CDW, which can explain the observed persistent CDW signatures. Our results thus corroborate the ubiquity and robustness of CDW correlations in Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and provide new insights on the role of disorders on the CDW correlations in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.

Title: Efficient photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products with Pt1-xPdxSn4 Dirac Nodal Arc Semimetal
Authors: Kangwang Wang, Jie Zhan, Jun Liu, Zaichen Xiang, Wanyi Zhang, Lingyong Zeng, Kai Yan, Yan Sun, Huixia Luo
Abstract: The photochemical CO2 reduction reaction represents a zero-carbon pathway for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals, yet its industrial implementation has been constrained by low selectivity and product diversity. Dirac nodal arc semimetals characterized by ultrahigh carrier mobility with over 25000 cm2 V-1 s-1 offer a promising platform to search for efficient catalysts for CO2 conversion. Herein, we demonstrate that strategic Pt incorporation into PdSn4 optimizes the electronic structure and carrier dynamics of this Dirac semimetal. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the resulting Pd-Sn-Pt local electronic structure redistributes charge density around Pd and Pt atoms, which facilitates C-C coupling via *OC-COH and *OC-CHOH intermediates and enhances carrier mobility by 40% versus the pristine PdSn4 single crystal. The optimized Pd0.4Pt0.6Sn4 single crystal achieves C2H4 with formation rate of 0.000328 mol g-1 h-1, product selectivity of 73.1% and electron-based selectivity of 89%. This work establishes electronic-structure-tunable Dirac semimetals as a new paradigm for multi-carbon photochemical CO2 reduction, providing a design strategy for next-generation photocatalysts.

Title: Optical and Hall conductivity of the two dimensional Hubbard model: effective theory description, sign-problem-free Monte Carlo simulation and applications to the cuprate superconductors
Authors: Xinyue Liu, Tao Li
Abstract: Exact formulas for the optical conductivity and the Hall conductivity of the two dimensional Hubbard model are derived in terms of an effective theory description of the local moment fluctuation in the system. In this framework, the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the electromagnetic response of such a strongly correlated electron system becomes sign-problem-free in many physically relevant cases. In particular, it is sign-problem-free when we assume the widely used Millis-Monien-Pines form for the phenomenological susceptibility in the effective action of the fluctuating local moment, even though these local moments are now subjected to Landau damping as a result of their coupling to the itinerant quasiparticle on the fermi surface. This is true more generally when a $\varphi^{4}$ term is included in the effective action and is thus not restricted to the Gaussian limit. Here we demonstrate the power of this framework by studying the effect of thermal fluctuation of the local moment on the optical conductivity $\sigma^{xx}(\omega)$ and the Hall conductivity $\sigma^{xy}(\omega)$ of the cuprate superconductors. Both $\sigma^{xx}(\omega)$ and $\sigma^{xy}(\omega)$ calculated are found to exhibit a two-component structure, with a Drude component at low energy and a mid-infrared component at higher energy. Depending on the relative importance of the hole pocket and the electron pocket on the reconstructed fermi surface and the coupling strength to the local moment, the Drude component in $\mathrm{Im}\sigma^{xy}(\omega)$ can be either positive or negative.(full-length abstract can be found in the main text.)

Title: Method for real-time monitoring of paramagnetic reactions using spin relaxometry with fluorescent nanodiamonds
Authors: Trent Ralph, Erin S. Grant, Lianne Lay, Sepehr Ahmadi, David A. Simpson
Abstract: Spin relaxometry using fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) has been applied successfully to sense numerous paramagnetic target molecules such as free radicals and metalloproteins. However, despite their high sensitivity, T1 spin relaxation measurements are often hampered by their slow acquisition speed. Here, we demonstrate a method that allows for real-time monitoring of paramagnetic chemical reactions. We demonstrate T1 spin relaxometry from thousands of FNDs using an optimised cuvette-based system integrating an avalanche photodiode operated in linear mode, and a fast, fieldprogrammable gate array (FPGA) for data collation. We demonstrate chemical monitoring of the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) ions in-solution with a 15 second integration using an optimised T1 sensing protocol. Our method achieves more than two orders of magnitude speed up with an order of magnitude reduction in cost when compared with traditional techniques. With further technical improvements, we believe this in-solution method could be extended to sense the sub-second chemical kinetics of paramagnetic molecules in solution.

Title: Irradiation-Driven Recrystallization in Fusion-Grade Tungsten: A Mesoscale, Microstructure-Aware Model
Authors: Jinxin Yu, Sicong He, Giacomo Po, Jason R. Trelewicz, Timothy J. Rupert, Jaime Marian
Abstract: Tungsten (W) is the leading candidate material for plasma-facing components in fusion reactors, yet its upper operational temperature is limited by premature grain growth and recrystallization processes. Irradiation adds further complications by generating defect clusters and transmutation products that alter both the driving forces and kinetics of grain boundary motion. In this work, we develop a physics-based, multiscale framework that couples crystal plasticity, stochastic cluster dynamics, and discrete grain boundary dynamics to model the co-evolution of plastic deformation, irradiation damage, and grain growth in fusion-grade tungsten polycrystals. The approach enables simulations on realistic microstructures with arbitrary grain size and misorientation distributions, without recourse to mean-field simplifications. The model captures (i) the spatial heterogeneity of dislocation density distribution during hot working; (ii) irradiation-induced defect accumulation under fusion conditions, and (iii) the buildup of chemical and elastic driving forces for grain boundary migration and microstructural evolution. Parametric studies demonstrate the dominant influence that temperature has on thermally activated grain-boundary mobility, a weaker dependence on prior strain, and a pronounced retardation of recrystallization by rhenium segregation arising from neutron transmutation. Under fusion energy irradiation conditions, our framework predicts a substantial reduction of the effective recrystallization temperature relative to unirradiated microstructures, while Re production restores and even elevates this limit. By providing quantitative projections of recrystallization kinetics and in-service recrystallization temperatures, this work establishes a predictive tool for assessing the lifetime and operational envelope of W-based plasma-facing materials under fusion conditions.

Title: Extended Mean-Field Theory for the 2D Hubbard Model in Degenerate Dilute Electron Gases: Fluctuations, Superconducting Dome, and Interaction Mechanisms in Strontium Titanate
Authors: Xing Yang, Xinyu Zhang, Xuchang Zhang
Abstract: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3, STO}$) dome-shaped superconducting transition temperature as a function of chemical potential, consistent with STO experiments, and shows that tunable s-wave and d-wave symmetries are modulated by doping. Superconducting fluctuations validate the mean-field approximation at low temperatures but destroy pairing at higher temperatures. The charge-density-wave order competes with superconductivity, enhances the effective electron mass inversely with the chemical potential, and increases with the interaction strength $U$ and the temperature $T$. SDW order is rare and fragile, while an additional magnetic term induces subtle band splitting. These findings suggest e-e contributions to STO's transport anomalies and provide criteria to distinguish e-e from e-ph origins, offering insights for engineering higher $T_c$ in dilute systems.

Title: Lattice and Orbital-Resolved Fermiology of Metallenes
Authors: Kameyab Raza Abidi, Mohammad Bagheri, Pekka Koskinen
Abstract: Atomically thin metallenes have emerged as a new member of the two-dimensional (2D) materials family. Recent experimental realization of metallenes in the Ångström limit has further intensified interest in this class of 2D materials. However, achieving sub-atomic insight into them demands the most detailed and systematic characterization of their electronic structure. Such understanding is essential for the rational design and exploitation of their properties in plasmonics, catalysis, and quantum optics. Existing electronic-structure studies are either scattered or focus on a few selected systems, and a comprehensive view of their band structures and Fermi surfaces remains missing. Here, we address this gap by studying 45 elemental metallenes in six monolayer lattices (honeycomb, square, hexagonal, and their buckled forms) using density-functional theory. We found that lattice type primarily fixes the shape and radial placement of the Fermi-lines, while out-of-plane buckling introduces controlled modifications: it shortens long straight Fermi-line segments, and occasionally creates, removes, or merges small Fermi-line pockets. The electronic configuration determines which orbital type dominates the Fermi level. We summarized Fermiology using a single score for each element, termed pocketness, derived from four descriptors that combine element properties (symmetry, coordination) with electronic characteristics (dispersion, Fermi-surface topology). This score enables targeted angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) tests, controlled Lifshitz transitions, and provides a predictive basis for transport and device applications.

Title: Achieving Robust Extrapolation in Materials Property Prediction via Decoupled Transfer Learning
Authors: Tasuku Sugiura, Teruyasu Mizoguchi
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized materials property prediction, yet fails catastrophically when extrapolating beyond training distributions-precisely the capability required for discovering unprecedented materials. Graph neural networks (GNNs) exhibit this collapse because end-to-end training fundamentally couples learned representations to target property distributions, preventing genuine extrapolation. We demonstrate that decoupled transfer learning-separating pretrained GNN feature extractors from simple regressors-overcomes this barrier. Pretrained features provide transferable structural knowledge, while simple regressors enable smooth extrapolation by maintaining learned trends beyond training boundaries. Benchmarked on layered intercalation compounds through four rigorous extrapolation scenarios and a temporal Materials Project split, our framework achieves 68% error reduction (RMSE: 0.881 vs. 2.778 eV/atom) versus end-to-end GNNs for extrapolation. Failure analysis reveals extrapolation succeeds for continuous chemical space but fails for discontinuous space, establishing clear design principles. Validated on Fermi energy prediction, this framework is immediately deployable using existing pretrained models, requiring no architectural innovations-transforming ML-driven materials discovery.

Title: Ultrafast Band-Gap Renormalization in Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Eduard Moos, Zhi-Yuan Deng, Hauke Beyer, Arpit Jain, Chengye Dong, Li-Syuan Lu, Joshua A. Robinson, Kai Rossnagel, Michael Bauer
Abstract: We demonstrate, by femtosecond time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that photoinduced interlayer charge transfer in a heterostructure consisting of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene and a single atomic layer of silver on 6H-SiC(0001) transiently modulates the intrinsic potential landscape across the silver-graphene interface. This acts as an ultrafast optoelectronic gate that drives momentum-dependent band renormalizations, resulting in a transient band-gap opening on femtosecond timescales. Simultaneously, the photogenerated hot-carrier population enhances electronic screening, leading to subsequent closing of the band-gap beyond the thermal equilibrium value. These findings reveal two different mechanisms for photoinduced, reversible control of the electronic band structure in bilayer graphene -- interlayer charge transfer and hot-carrier-enhanced screening -- providing a general framework for the ultrafast control of electronic properties in graphene-based heterostructures. This opens up novel pathways for the realization of ultrafast optoelectronic devices and the exploration of correlated quantum phases in bilayer graphene under non-equilibrium conditions.

Title: A mobility based approach to transport in chiral fluids
Authors: Filippo Faedi, Erik Kalz, Ralf Metzler, Abhinav Sharma
Abstract: Chiral fluids, for which the mobility tensor has antisymmetric, off-diagonal components, exhibit transport phenomena absent in conventional systems, including interaction-enhanced diffusion and negative mobility. While these effects have been predicted theoretically and observed in simulations, their microscopic origin has remained unclear. Here, we address this question using a mobility-based nonequilibrium approach, analysing the steady-state drift of a tracer driven through an interacting chiral fluid. We show that, under strong chirality, the tracer generates a reversed density wake, in which regions of particle accumulation and depletion are inverted compared to the achiral case. This structural inversion of the wake provides a unified physical mechanism underlying both enhanced diffusion and negative mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these phenomena are robust to changes in the interaction potential, highlighting their generality as a consequence of odd mobility.

Title: A contour for the entanglement negativity of bosonic Gaussian states
Authors: Gioele Zambotti, Erik Tonni
Abstract: We construct a contour function for the logarithmic negativity and the logarithm of the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix for multimode bosonic Gaussian states of a free lattice model. In one spatial dimension, numerical results are obtained for harmonic chains either in the ground state or at finite temperature, by considering, respectively, either a subsystem made by two adjacent or disjoint blocks on the line or a bipartition of the circle. The contour function of the logarithmic negativity diverges only at the entangling points, while the contour function for the logarithm of the moments of the partial transpose is divergent also at the boundary of the bipartite subsystem, as functions of the position. In a two-dimensional conformal field theory, analytic expressions that describe these divergencies are discussed. In one spatial dimension, we explore the partial derivative of the logarithmic negativity of two adjacent intervals with respect to the logarithm of the harmonic ratio of their lengths while their ratio and the other parameters are kept fixed. Considering the ground state of the harmonic chain on the line and in the massive regime, we report numerical results showing that this quantity displays a monotonically decreasing behaviour.

Title: Electron-phonon coupling revealed by charge density fluctuations in cuprate superconductors
Authors: Martina Fedele, Giacomo Merzoni, Marco Moretti Sala, Francesco Rosa, Nicholas B. Brookes, Floriana Lombardi, Sergio Caprara, Giacomo Ghiringhelli, Riccardo Arpaia
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) governs lattice dynamics, charge transport, and collective electronic phases in quantum materials. In several families of unconventional superconductors, including transition-metal dichalcogenides and kagome metals, growing evidence points to a cooperative role of EPC and dynamic charge-density fluctuations (CDF) in stabilizing superconductivity. However, how the EPC strength evolves across phase diagrams and relates to superconducting properties in strongly correlated systems remains an open question. Here we investigate the interplay between phonons and the CDF recently identified in cuprate superconductors. Using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we track the dispersion and intensity of bond-stretching phonons in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ over wide ranges of doping, temperature, and momentum. We find that both the phonon softening at the CDF wave vector and the EPC strength, extracted from a pronounced phonon intensity anomaly, are maximized near $p = 0.19$, where superconducting properties are optimal and CDF intensity is strongest. These results identify dynamic charge-density fluctuations, rather than quasi-static charge density waves, as the dominant source of phonon renormalization in cuprates, and establish a direct correlation between EPC strength and the superconducting dome. More broadly, our measurements highlight EPC as a doping-dependent property of correlated materials, shaped by the electronic environment in which lattice vibrations are embedded.

Title: Physical Pictures for Quasisymmetry in Crystals
Authors: Bryan D. Assunção, Emmanuel V. C. Lopes, Tome M. Schmidt, Gerson J. Ferreira
Abstract: Quasisymmetry (QS) provides a novel route to understand and control near-degeneracies, Berry curvature, optical selection rules, and symmetry-protected phenomena in quantum materials. Here we give physical interpretations of the emergence of QS operators across multiple material families. Using density functional theory and the $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ formalism, we identify QS subspaces and calculate their representation matrices, quantifying the quasisymmetry via a metric $\epsilon$ that measures subspace invariance. For Sn/SiC and transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers, QS corresponds to an emergent mirror symmetry, whereas in wurtzite crystals it manifests as an emergent spatial inversion. By contrast, for AgLa the QS appearing in avoided crossings is inherited from a nearby high-symmetry point rather than being an emergent lattice symmetry. Combining group-theoretical analysis and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ modeling, our results establish concrete physical pictures for QS and provide practical criteria to diagnose it in first-principles calculations.

Title: Exact response functions for a compressible thin fluid layer with odd viscosity
Authors: Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Yuto Hosaka, Shigeyuki Komura
Abstract: Fluids composed of chiral active components can exhibit odd viscosity, a property that breaks time-reversal and parity symmetries. We investigate the hydrodynamic response to monopole and dipole singularities in a compressible thin fluid layer with odd viscosity, supported by a conventional lubrication layer. Using the two-dimensional Green's function in Fourier space, we derive exact analytical solutions for the flow and pressure fields. These solutions provide a detailed description of the hydrodynamic interactions governing the motion of colloidal particles and microswimmers in confined chiral fluids, offering insight into the role of odd viscosity in modifying particle dynamics and collective behavior. The derived results are directly applicable to modeling transport, control, and self-organization phenomena in active and chiral microfluidic systems.

Title: Second-Coordination-Sphere Cation Substitution as a Tool for Controlling Phase Transitions and Performance of the Luminescence Thermometry
Authors: Muhammad T. Abbas, M. Szymczak, M. Fandzloch, D. Szymanski, A. Sieradzki, L. Marciniak
Abstract: Despite the exceptionally high relative sensitivities achieved by luminescent thermometers based on first-order structural phase transitions, their principal limitation lies in the inherently narrow thermal operating range associated with the transition temperature. In this work, we demonstrate that partial substitution of Li+ by Na+ ions in the second coordination sphere of Eu3+ ions in LiYO2 enables a substantial shift of the phase transition temperature, thereby allowing controlled optimization of the thermometric performance. This approach represents a significantly more cost-effective and efficient strategy for tuning the phase transition temperature compared with the previously proposed substitution of Y3+ by other lanthanide ions. Importantly, we show that lowering the transition temperature through Na+ incorporation simultaneously introduces static compositional disorder and local lattice strain. As a consequence, the enthalpy difference between the competing structural phases decreases, and the cooperativity of the lattice distortion is reduced, indicating a gradual weakening of the first-order character of the phase transition. Our results demonstrate that such structural modifications, while effective in shifting the transition temperature, inevitably lead to a reduction in the relative sensitivity of phase-transition-based luminescent thermometers.

Title: Correlated phases of moat-band excitons in two-dimensional systems
Authors: L. Maisel Licerán, S. H. Boeve, H. T. C. Stoof
Abstract: We study two-dimensional systems of interacting excitons with a moat dispersion, for which the ground-state energy manifold presents a ring of discrete or continuously degenerate minima around a single point in momentum space. At low densities and for an idealized, perfectly degenerate moat, we show that the excitons undergo statistical transmutation and stabilize a chiral spin liquid. At higher densities, the moat dispersion favors Bose-Einstein condensation into states occupying multiple momenta, leading to inhomogeneous condensate phases and potentially supersolidity. We discuss the impact of band-structure warping present in realistic systems and argue that it generically stabilizes Bose-condensed phases over the chiral spin liquid, and analyze the superfluid response of the former which is unconventional due to the moat band. We also demonstrate that a proper renormalization of the exciton-exciton interaction is essential for describing these phases, and show that even purely repulsive interactions can favor inhomogeneous condensates. To further explore inhomogeneous condensate phases, we employ a Gross-Pitaevskii framework with a pseudopotential approximation and map out the resulting phase diagram. We show that the presence of degenerate dispersion minima can drive supersolidity already at weak coupling, in contrast to systems with a standard parabolic dispersion. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of real excitonic systems and argue that moat-band-induced supersolidity can be within experimental reach for realistic values of the model parameters.

Title: A Computational Study of Organic Molecular Crystals for Photocatalytic Water Splitting
Authors: James D. Green, Daniel G. Medranda, Hong Wang, Andrew I. Cooper, Jenny Nelson, Kim E. Jelfs
Abstract: Organic crystalline materials are potential candidates for photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS). Although organic crystals have been heavily investigated for application in organic electronics, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and solar cells, there have been comparatively fewer studies into OWS in these materials. A major challenge is the large number of electronic and structural criteria that must be met for a material to make a viable OWS photocatalyst. Optical absorption, reduction and oxidation potentials and charge-transport properties are among the key considerations, and these are influenced both by molecular properties and the solid-state packing arrangement, making computational modelling challenging. Here, we investigate a series of known organic electronic materials that have published crystal structures using periodic density functional theory (DFT) and compare their calculated electronic properties of optical absorption and reduction and oxidation potentials with literature experimental data. Furthermore we perform a series of gas-phase molecular calculations which show a good agreement with literature data and periodic DFT for the optoelectronic properties of the organic molecular crystals studied, showing that gas-phase molecular calculations could be used to screen organic crystals for OWS at a reduced computational cost.

Title: Bright-dark exciton splitting in lead halide perovskite crystals accessed via quantum beats in photon echoes
Authors: M. Alex Hollberg, O. Nestoklon, Artur V. Trifonov, Stefan Grisard, Oleh Hordiichuk, Dmitry N. Dirin, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Dimitri R. Yakovlev, Manfred Bayer, Ilya A. Akimov
Abstract: Understanding the fine structure of excitons is crucial for optoelectronic and quantum photonic applications of lead halide perovskites. It is demonstrated that polarization-sensitive photon echo spectroscopy in magnetic field provides a powerful method to access coherent exciton dynamics and reveal their energy level structure, which is hidden by inhomogeneous broadening. Exciton quantum beats observed in both Faraday and Voigt geometries offer a precise probe of the energy splittings among the four 1$s$ exciton states, enabling determination of the fine structure and bright-dark splittings. Application of this technique to bulk mixed halide perovskite crystals FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ reveals a bright-dark exciton splitting of $\Delta_\mathrm{X}=0.46~$meV, along with electron and hole Landé $g$ factors $g_\mathrm{e}=3.38$ and $g_\mathrm{h}=-1.14$, respectively. The quantum beats persist on timescales of 20--50$~$ps, demonstrating remarkably robust spin and optical coherences at cryogenic temperature of 2$~$K. The decay of the quantum beats of the outer doublet is governed by dephasing due to dispersion of the bright-dark splitting of $\sim0.06~$meV caused by localization potential fluctuations, while dephasing in the bright exciton inner doublet originates from a small zero field splitting of $\sim0.035~$meV due to anisotropic potentials.

Title: Machine-learning force-field models for dynamical simulations of metallic magnets
Authors: Gia-Wei Chern, Yunhao Fan, Sheng Zhang, Puhan Zhang
Abstract: We review recent advances in machine learning (ML) force-field methods for Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) simulations of itinerant electron magnets, focusing on scalability and transferability. Built on the principle of locality, a deep neural network model is developed to efficiently and accurately predict the electron-mediated forces governing spin dynamics. Symmetry-aware descriptors constructed through a group-theoretical approach ensure rigorous incorporation of both lattice and spin-rotation symmetries. The framework is demonstrated using the prototypical s-d exchange model widely employed in spintronics. ML-enabled large-scale simulations reveal novel nonequilibrium phenomena, including anomalous coarsening of tetrahedral spin order on the triangular lattice and the freezing of phase separation dynamics in lightly hole-doped, strong-coupling square-lattice systems. These results establish ML force-field frameworks as scalable, accurate, and versatile tools for modeling nonequilibrium spin dynamics in itinerant magnets.

Title: Electrodynamics of swift-electron momentum transfer to a large spherical nanoparticle
Authors: Jesús Castrejón-Figueroa, Jorge Luis Briseño-Gómez, Eduardo Enrique Viveros-Armas, José Ángel Castellanos-Reyes, Alejandro Reyes-Coronado
Abstract: Swift electrons from highly focused beams produced in aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopes offer a powerful route for probing and manipulating matter at the nanoscale. Although linear momentum transfer from swift electrons to nanoparticles has been investigated theoretically and experimentally, subsequent analyzes revealed that several earlier predictions relied on non-causal dielectric functions or insufficient numerical convergence, leading to spurious sign reversals in the transferred momentum. Here, we derive analytical expressions and develop a numerically efficient electrodynamic framework to compute the linear momentum transferred from a swift electron to an isolated spherical nanoparticle described by a fully causal, local dielectric response. We apply our framework to large nanoparticles with 50 nm radius and explicitly resolve the spectral density of linear momentum transfer across the full frequency domain. Using causal dielectric functions for aluminum and bismuth, we analyze the role of electron velocity, impact parameter, and material-specific resonances. We find that, when causality and full multipolar convergence are enforced, the net transverse linear momentum transferred to spherical nanoparticles remains attractive toward the electron trajectory for all nanoparticles considered, despite the presence of material-dependent sign changes in individual electric and magnetic contributions. These results contrast with earlier theoretical predictions of net repulsive behavior and indicate that additional physical mechanisms beyond the present isolated, local description are required to account for experimentally observed repulsion. Our work establishes a robust reference framework for momentum transfer calculations and provides quantitative benchmarks relevant for electron-beam-based nanoscale manipulation.

Title: Properties of Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Foams
Authors: Oliver Dai, Andrew Terentjev, Eugene M. Terentjev
Abstract: We investigate how controlled foaming alters the mechanical dissipation of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs). Using thermal expandable microspheres, we generate homogeneous foams with precisely tuned bubble volume fractions up to 13% and compare their behaviour with non-mesogenic silicon analogues. We show that microsphere expansion induces a particle-centred mesogenic interphase arising from local elastic distortion and preferential alignment of mesogenic units at the inclusion surface. At low bubble volume fraction (0.5 to 5%), these interfaces remain spatially isolated and produce a pronounced no-monotonic enhancement of damping, with the loss factor reaching tan-delta=0.2 even in the isotropic regime. At higher loading, interphase overlaps and mechanical constraints suppress this effect, and the dissipation returns towards baseline elastomeric values. Large-strain tensile tests and impact experiments exhibit the same non-monotonic trend, demonstrating that low density LCE forms achieve the highest mechanical energy absorption per unit mass. Compared with conventional high porosity polymer foams used for acoustic damping, these materials retain sufficient mechanical integrity to sustain impact loads, establishing a microstructural route to engineer high-performance damping in soft solids.

Title: T-linear specific heat in pressurized and magnetized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu2(BO3)2

Abstract: The pressurized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu2(BO3)2 has been found to host a plaquette-singlet phase and an antiferromagnetic phase that break different symmetries this http URL recent experiment showed that their transition is of a first order nature, which seems against the pursuit of exotic and deconfined degrees of freedom in this famous frustrated quantum magnet. We found a new direction in this study. By applying a magnetic field to the material, we discover that SrCu2(BO3)2 exhibits a universal and metallic T-linear specific heat behavior in a large magnetitic field range close to the pressure of zero-field first order transition between plaquette-singlet and antiferromagnetic phases. Such an unexpected gapless response from an electronically gapped Mott insulator could be attributed to magnetized Dirac spinons liberated by the combined effect of magnetic field and pressure, consistently seen from our quantum many-body thermal tensor network computation of the Shastry-Sutherland model under magnetic field. Such a robust and universal T-linear specific heat phase points out the richness of the phase diagram of the material expanded by the axes of pressure and magnetic field and is calling for new theoretical frameworks to its full explanation.

Title: RHEED pattern classification by a convolutional neural network for the growth of chalcogenide thin films and nanostructures
Authors: Nathan Muetzel, Viet Luu, Sara Bey, Muhsin Abdul Karim, Kota Yoshimura, Xinyu Liu, Marwan Gebran, Badih A. Assaf
Abstract: The use of reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) plays a critical role for in-situ characterization in molecular beam epitaxy, pulsed laser deposition and sputtering. While sensitive to crystal symmetries and morphology, it is used ubiquitously to determine the growth modes of thin films. However, analysis of RHEED patterns depends on skilled experts and is therefore difficult to incorporate into the growth strategy in real-time. The development of machine learning (ML) processes, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), presents a unique opportunity towards real-time RHEED pattern recognition. In this study, we develop a CNN model that can accurately classify four common and distinct RHEED patterns present in chalcogenide thin film growth. Its reached accuracy reached 94.9% for single run and 91.2% when averaged over 20 seeds. Our network is able to distinguish the nucleation of three common growth modes encountered in epitaxy, namely Volmer Weber, Stransky-Krastanov and Frank-van der Merwe, potentially enabling future automation of substrate temperature and shutter control informed by RHEED data. The network is material-agnostic and distinguishes the VW process with greater than 98% accuracy but is somewhat more limited in its ability to properly classify roughening and the initiation of Stransky-Krastanov growth. Our findings show that ML techniques can be successfully implemented even in cases where there is no detailed knowledge of growth chemistry providing an avenue towards real-time incorporation of ML to control nanostructure nucleation and thin film morphology.

Title: Quadrupole formation and coupling to magnetic and structural degrees of freedom in the $5d^1$ double perovskites Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$
Authors: Francesco Martinelli, Claude Ederer
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between charge, magnetic, and structural degrees of freedom in the isostructural and isoelectronic $5d^1$ double-perovskites Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$. Using first-principles-based electronic structure calculations, we show that both materials exhibit a tendency toward spontaneous quadrupolar order in the cubic paramagnetic phase, which is slightly weaker in Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ than in Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$. Our analysis further reveals an intimate coupling between the local magnetic moments and charge quadrupoles, mediated by the strong spin-orbit interaction, that leads to the unusual canted configuration of magnetic moments observed in these systems. When structural degrees of freedom are included, the two materials exhibit pronounced differences. In Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ the strong coupling to Jahn-Teller distortions stabilizes the antiferroic $\mathcal{Q}_{x^2-y^2}$ order, yielding excellent agreement with available experimental data. In contrast, the Jahn-Teller coupling is significantly weaker in Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ and appears insufficient to stabilize the antiferroic quadrupolar order. While this is consistent with the absence of any measurable long-range structural distortion above the magnetic transition temperature, it contrasts with experimental results indicating a strong canting of the magnetic moments. Our analysis thus successfully describes the mechanisms shaping the properties of the Re-compound while a full quantitative description of the magnetic ground state of Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ is still elusive.

Title: Phonon assisted light absorption and emission in cubic-Boron Nitride
Authors: Ashwin Pillai, Elena Cannuccia, Aurelien Manchon, Fulvio Paleari, Claudio Attaccalite
Abstract: Cubic boron nitride (cBN) is a wide-bandgap polymorph of boron nitride whose optical response remains only partially understood due to the coexistence of indirect electronic transitions and strong exciton-phonon coupling. Using first-principles many-body perturbation theory, we investigate the optical properties of cBN by combining GW quasiparticle corrections with Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations of excitonic effects. Phonon-assisted absorption and emission processes are explicitly included through the exciton-phonon coupling formalism. We find that phonon-mediated optical transitions provide a dominant contribution to both absorption and luminescence spectra, partially reconciling the discrepancy between the theoretical optical gap ($\simeq$ 11 eV) and experimental emission around 6-7 eV. Our results demonstrate the importance of including exciton-phonon interactions for the correct interpretation of experimental spectra, offering new insights into light emission in wide-bandgap materials.

Title: Emergence of generic first-passage time distributions for large Markovian networks
Authors: Julian B. Voits, Ulrich S. Schwarz (Heidelberg University)
Abstract: First-passage times are often the most relevant aspect of a complex Markovian network, because they signify when information processing has resulted in a definite decision. Previous studies have shown that for kinetic proofreading networks in the limit of large network size the first-passage time distribution converges either to a delta or to an exponential distribution. Remarkably, these two forms correspond to the two extreme distributions of minimal and maximal entropy for a fixed mean, respectively. Here we build on the connection between first-passage times and graph theory to show that these two limits are not model-specific, but arise generically in Markovian networks from the distribution of the eigenvalues of the generator matrix. A deterministic peak emerges when infinitely many eigenvalues contribute, while the exponential limit arises from a single dominant eigenvalue. We also show that the exponential limit emerges robustly for reversible networks when a backward bias exists. In contrast, the deterministic limit is not obtained from a simple reversal of this condition, but under structurally tighter conditions, revealing a fundamental asymmetry between both regimes. Our theoretical analysis is illustrated and validated by computer simulations of one-step master equations and random networks.

Title: Large Pyroelectric Enhancement in Freestanding Epitaxial BaTiO3 Membranes on Si
Authors: Ajay Kumar, Asraful Haque, Shubham Kumar Parate, Harshal DSouza, Jishnu NK, Binoy Krishna De, Srinivasan Raghavan, Pavan Nukala
Abstract: Ferroelectric membranes transferred onto arbitrary substrates provide reduced mechanical clamping at the interfaces that can diminish the effective polarization-rotation barrier offering a pathway to engineer larger electromechanical and thermally driven responses in oxide electronics. Here, we report integration of single crystalline thin film BaTiO3 (BTO) ferroelectric membrane on Si and demonstrate a 4x at 30C and 34x at 60C enhancement of pyroelectric coefficient compared to clamped films. The BTO membrane is grown epitaxially on a water-soluble Sr3Al2O6 sacrificial layer, released by selective dissolution, and transferred onto Si, yielding a strain-relaxed membrane with robust intrinsic polarization. Temperature dependent piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) reveals pronounced thermally driven evolution of domain orientation, consistent with reduced barriers for dipolar modulation in the freestanding state. Variable-temperature Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) quantifies an effective pyroelectric coefficient of ~75 uC/m^2K at 30C and 450 uC/m^2K at 60C with a detectivity of 40 m^2K^-1at room temperature. These results establish lead-free freestanding BTO membranes as a promising silicon-integrable platform for cryogen-free infrared detection and waste-heat energy management.

Title: Martensitic laminate geometry controls electronic phase transitions in a Mott insulator
Authors: Ziming Shao, Benjamin Gregory, Suchismita Sarker, Jacob Ruff, Ivan K. Schuller, Yoav Kalcheim, Andrej Singer
Abstract: Symmetry-lowering structural phase transitions result in multiple degenerate structures whose coexistence is determined by macroscopic strain compatibility. In quantum materials, these structural transformations often couple to electronic degrees of freedom, yet how the structural arrangements influence electronic phase transitions remains poorly understood. By analyzing hundreds of diffraction peaks from X-ray reciprocal space mapping, we determine the lattice basis vectors and mutual orientations of all coexisting phases in epitaxial V2O3 thin films after a symmetry-lowering transformation coincident with a metal-insulator transition. We identify the orientations of interfaces between all coexisting structures using the theory of martensitic phase transformations and find that the low temperature structure comprises finely tuned layered mixtures of alternating twin variants, akin to metal alloys. By comparing films grown on various substrate orientations, we show that the metal-insulator transition temperature increases monotonically with the degree to which these layered mixtures satisfy macroscopic strain compatibility imposed by the substrate.

Title: Magnetic Force Imaging of 2D Topological Insulators
Authors: Timothy W. Carlson, Swathi Kadaba, Motahhare Mirhosseini, Maria Kolesnik-Gray, Gabriel Marcus, Lindsey J. Gray, Anthony Walsh, Vojislav Krstic, D. L. Carroll
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators are central to our understanding of the connection between topological symmetries in a material and its band electronics. Within this class of materials, a breadth of complex quantum behaviors, such as persistent spin-polarized current states in the presence of a broken time reversal symmetry, and temperature-independent topological protection of quantum states, are thought to exist. However, current studies using photoemission and spectroscopic analyses or transport experiments fail to provide insight into the interplay between the physical 2D manifold and the band topology itself, since they do not provide spatial resolution of the phenomena to be understood. In this work, we develop a methodology for applying magnetic force microscopy to such systems to address this issue. Using well-characterized 2D crystallites of bismuth telluride ($Bi_2$$Te_3$), we image the magnetic signal directly associated with topological edge states. The observed phase contrast is remarkably robust at a temperature of 25°C and occurs across crystallite sizes and shapes. A detailed analysis of the magnetic imaging suggests that the current observed is composed of two parts: the first is a persistent current ($I_{Persistent}$) as predicted by theory, and the second is due to Faraday induction, $I_{Faraday}$. Damping dynamics of the cantilever during imaging further suggest that this Faraday EMF is established by spin accumulation along the 1D edge channel of the crystal, which then converts to a charge current in the presence of time reversal symmetry breaking, creating a novel form of rectification in the channel. This unexpected result can prompt new ideas for topology-based circuit elements with extremely low losses and power consumption.

Title: Toroidal Fermi-surface geometry and phonon-limited transport in nodal-line semimetals
Authors: Aman Anand, Alessandro De Martino
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSs) can display unconventional quasiparticle dynamics and charge transport properties due to their extended band degeneracy and the peculiar geometry of their Fermi surface. We consider electron-acoustic phonon scattering as the dominant relaxation mechanism and compute the quasiparticle decay rate and dc conductivity by solving the linearized semiclassical Boltzmann equation in a minimal model of a doped circular NLS. We find that the toroidal geometry of the Fermi surface gives rise to two parametrically distinct Bloch-Grüneisen temperatures, associated with momentum transfers along the poloidal and toroidal directions, respectively. As a result, an intermediate temperature window opens between these two scales, in which the decay rate follows $\Gamma\propto T^2$, while the conductivity follows $\sigma\propto T^{-2}$. We also obtain the low- and high-temperature asymptotic behaviors, and discuss implications for ARPES and transport measurements in candidate NLS materials.

Title: Finely Tunable Thermal Expansion of NiTi by Stress-Induced Martensitic Transformation and Thermomechanical Training
Authors: Won Seok Choi, Won-Seok Ko, Yejun Park, Edward L. Pang, Jong-Hoon Park, Hye-Hyun Ahn, Yuji Ikeda, Pyuck-Pa Choi, Blazej Grabowski
Abstract: Tailoring the thermal expansion of martensitic materials by crystallographic texture and anisotropic variation of lattice parameters is a promising route to a flexible design of thermally stable systems. NiTi alloys are prototype materials in this respect, with shape-memory and superelastic properties owing to their thermoelastic martensitic transformations. Here, we propose a method to realize finely tunable coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) for the NiTi alloy based upon a special combination of mechanical and thermal training. We achieve a near-zero in-plane CTE that is smaller in value than that of the FeNi-based Invar alloy. Atomistic simulations and theoretical calculations guide the method design and clarify the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between the processing conditions, the microstructural evolution, and the thermal expansion behavior. The directions for further, finer adjustments of the CTE without constraints on the shape of the materials are indicated.

Title: Near-optimality of conservative driving in discrete systems
Authors: Jann van der Meer, Andreas Dechant
Abstract: Transferring a physical system from an initial to a final state while minimizing energetic losses is an interdisciplinary control problem that bridges stochastic thermodynamics and optimal transport theory. Recent research typically considers problems in which the optimal solution is realized via conservative forces, but whether this situation applies depends on the problem's constraints. In systems with complex topologies like discrete networks, the optimal, dissipation-minimizing protocol involves applying nonconservative forces along cycles if the timescales of the transitions in the network are fixed. We show that although nonconservative driving is optimal in this setting, a conservative protocol exists whose dissipation is at most twice the optimal one. This finding is complemented with an example modeling transport across an energy barrier, which illustrates such improvements of order 1 explicitly. Qualitatively, conservative driving falls short of achieving optimality because direct transport across the barrier is avoided. We conclude with a discussion that the optimality of nonconservative driving might be a generic phenomenon: As fewer degrees of freedom can be optimized, additional degrees of freedom due to adding nonconservative forces become more significant.

Title: Responsive Disorder in a Metal-Organic Framework Enables Solid-State Reservoir Computing
Authors: Guy Greenbaum, Will R. Branford, Andrew L. Goodwin
Abstract: Complex systems with nonlinear response mechanisms can be applied as reservoir computers for energy-efficient machine learning tasks. Historically explored at the macro- and meso-scale, physical reservoir computing has recently been extended to the atomic scale via chemical mixtures with strong and dynamic heterogeneity. Here we explore the possibility that configurational degeneracy within disordered materials might form the basis for solid-state atomic-scale reservoirs. Our proof-of-concept uses the disordered metal-organic framework DUT-8, which undergoes a series of disorder-disorder transitions on exposure to different guest species. We show that variations in X-ray diffuse scattering associated with these transitions function as suitable readouts for machine learning applications. A combination of nonlinearity and memory effects in the DUT-8 response allows the system to carry out both classification and time-series machine learning tasks with accuracies comparable to those of mesoscale physical reservoir computers. Our results suggest a new avenue for exploiting correlated disorder in solid phases whenever the nature of that disorder can be modulated through external perturbations-a phenomenon we term `responsive disorder'.

Title: A stochastic simulation of the dislocation-mediated etching of porous GaN distributed Bragg reflectors
Authors: Piotr Sokolinski, Ben Thornley, Zetai Xu, Thom R. Harris-Lee, Menno J. Kappers, Rachel A. Oliver
Abstract: Distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) can be fabricated by electrochemically etching nitride epitaxial structures consisting of alternating layers of highly n-type doped and non-intentionally doped (NID) GaN. Threading dislocations (TDs) can be electrochemically etched into transport pipelines that can carry the etchant through the NID layers to access the doped material. Experimentally this has been shown to involve a mechanism where the etching pathway may follow one TD into a doped layer and then propagate sideways through the doped layer to continue via a different TD. Across multiple layers this process creates complex pore structures that have been described as 'cascades'. Here, we build a stochastic simulation for the DBR etching process that can reproduce some key features of the observed microstructures including the cascade morphology. By comparing the simulation output to samples etched at a range of voltages, we show that we can reproduce variations in experimental chronoamperometry data with applied bias by varying the probability of etching the doped layers within the simulation. The outputs of the resulting simulations replicate the experimentally observed cascade morphology. At higher voltages, experimental data reveal a lower proportion of cascade features, a trend that is also replicated by the simulations for relevant probability values. Outputs of the simulations also correlate well with experimental chronoamperometry data for samples where - unlike in a DBR - the thicknesses of the doped layers vary through the epitaxial multilayer, suggesting that the probabilistic simulation can be applied to a range of structures to help understand the dislocation-mediated electrochemical etching process.

Title: Modeling of a magnetic field sensor based on spin Hall magnetoresistance
Authors: Syeda Farwa Bukhari, Alessandro Magni, Witold Skowroński, Elena Losero, Vittorio Basso, Carlo Appino, Piotr Wiśniowski, Juergen Langer, Berthold Ocker, Dario Daghero, Michaela Kuepferling
Abstract: Next-generation spintronic sensors aim to overcome the limitations of traditional tunneling-magnetoresistance (TMR) devices, such as complex manufacturing, high $1/f$ noise, and significant offsets. This work presents a comprehensive modeling and experimental validation of a magnetic field sensor based on Spin Hall Magnetoresistance (SMR) in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. Utilizing a multiphysics approach, we simulate the interplay between SMR, Anisotropic Magnetoresistance (AMR), and Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT) using a Stoner-Wohlfarth model complemented by a Fuchs-Sondheimer analysis of current distribution. To account for the presence of magnetic domains, we incorporate a modified Stoner-Wohlfarth framework that considers non-uniform magnetization and domain wall motion through a "truncated astroid" approach, allowing for a statistical distribution of single-domain particles. The model is validated against experimental measurements of Pt/$\text{Fe}_{60}\text{Co}_{20}\text{B}_{20}$ and Ta/$\text{Fe}_{60}\text{Co}_{20}\text{B}_{20}$ bilayers patterned into Hall bars and Wheatstone bridges. The model provides critical design guidelines for optimizing material properties, layer thickness, and device layout to minimize power consumption and maximize sensitivity in SMR-based sensing applications.

Title: Disentangling Entropic, Active, and Frictional Forces in Cytoskeletal Crosslinking
Authors: Cedrik Barutel, Sebastian Fürthauer
Abstract: The forces that mixtures of motorized and passive crosslinking proteins collectively generate between cytoskeletal filaments within our cells are the key drivers of active cellular mechanics. Despite their importance, a unified theory to describe such crosslinking forces has so far been missing. In this paper, we derive a theory that predicts the forces generated collectively by crosslinking proteins linking two biopolymer filaments from measurable filament and crosslinker properties, using out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics. Our framework allows us to decompose the forces generated by crosslinkers into three separate components: entropic, active, and frictional. In doing so, it offers a clear physical interpretation of the fundamental mechanisms by which crosslinking proteins self-organize and collectively generate forces. We demonstrate the robustness and utility of this framework by applying it to four different experiments that probe the combined roles of passive and motorized crosslinkers. For each experiment, our theoretical approach allows us to disentangle the relative contributions of entropic, active, and frictional forces, clarifying how different physical processes underpin collective force production. In turn, this makes it possible to quantitatively compare and predict how various crosslinker combinations influence force generation between filaments, pattern formation along filaments, and the dynamics of filament pairs.

Title: Mitigation of Magnetic Flux Trapping in Superconducting Electronics Using Moats

Abstract: Magnetic flux (vortex) trapping remains a major obstacle to very large scale integration in superconducting electronics. Moats -- etched regions in circuit layers placed in ground planes and around critical circuitry -- offer a simple passive approach to sequester flux. Here, we systematically examine the effectiveness of moat arrays in superconducting niobium films as a function of geometry (size, shape, and density) and background magnetic field. By measuring the vortex expulsion field, we estimate the flux saturation number and flux trapping temperature for a range of geometries. We find that many moat designs effectively sequester flux in magnetically shielded environments (< 1 $\mu$T), with high-aspect-ratio rectangular "slit" moats providing the strongest mitigation at minimal area cost. However, our measurements show that moats alone do not eliminate flux trapping in non-ideal films, as vortices can preferentially pin at material defects. These results provide design guidance for flux mitigation in superconducting integrated circuits and highlight the need for combined optimization of circuit geometries and materials.

Title: Overlap locking and non-perturbative effects in spin glasses
Authors: Silvio Franz, Giorgio Parisi, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of the locking of the order parameter (or synchronization) in spin glasses at low temperatures. When two systems with independent disorders are coupled, their overlaps become similar. A crucial question is how this effect depends on the strength of the coupling between the two systems. Non-perturbative phenomena are present when $1 \ll \Delta H \ll N$, being $\Delta H$ the coupling Hamiltonian and $N$ the size of the system. In this intermediate-coupling region, the effect is related to finite-size free-energy corrections and to the correlations in the Dyson hierarchical spin glass, a model that mimics the physics of finite-dimensional systems. We study this phenomenon in the mean-field approach, both analytically and numerically, and we finally compute the critical exponents for finite-volume corrections in mean-field theory and for the decay of correlations in the Dyson hierarchical model.

Title: Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks in Solving Hard Constraint Satisfaction Problems
Authors: Geri Skenderi, Lorenzo Buffoni, Francesco D'Amico, David Machado, Raffaele Marino, Matteo Negri, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi, Carlo Lucibello, Maria Chiara Angelini
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly applied to hard optimization problems, often claiming superiority over classical heuristics. However, such claims risk being unsolid due to a lack of standard benchmarks on truly hard instances. From a statistical physics perspective, we propose new hard benchmarks based on random problems. We provide these benchmarks, along with performance results from both classical heuristics and GNNs. Our fair comparison shows that classical algorithms still outperform GNNs. We discuss the challenges for neural networks in this domain. Future claims of superiority can be made more robust using our benchmarks, available at this https URL.

Title: Phase-field simulations of nucleation, growth, and coarsening of $β_1$ precipitates in Mg-Nd alloys

Abstract: The spatial distribution and morphology of precipitates formed during aging are key factors that determine the precipitation hardening response of various magnesium-rare earth alloys. In recent years, the use of high-performance computing clusters and massively parallel frameworks has enabled quantitative simulations of the evolution of individual and multiple precipitates at relevant length and time scales. However, predictive modeling of precipitate evolution remains challenging, in part because many key thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing the underlying physics are either unknown or have a high degree of uncertainty. In this work, we developed a workflow in which experimental data were used to parameterize a phase-field model to perform two-dimensional (2D) simulations of concurrent nucleation and evolution of $\beta_1$ precipitates in magnesium-neodymium alloy during aging. Matrix composition and precipitate number density at different aging times were obtained from atom probe tomography and transmission electron microscopy measurements, respectively. We applied a stereological method to estimate the three-dimensional (3D) number densities from experimental cross-sectional transmission electron micrographs. The estimated 3D number density data were then converted to effective 2D number densities. The effective 2D number density and composition data were used to determine the required model parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between simulation and experimental results. The parameterized model allows for quantitative phase-field simulations of nucleation and growth of $\beta_1$ precipitates, which can be employed to optimize aging time to achieve a target number density of precipitates. This work highlights an approach to overcome the challenges associated with parameterizing a coupled phase-field and nucleation model.

Title: Higher-Dimensional Information Lattice: Quantum State Characterization through Inclusion-Exclusion Local Information
Authors: Ian Matthias Flór, Claudia Artiaco, Thomas Klein Kvorning, Jens H. Bardarson
Abstract: We generalize the information lattice, originally defined for one-dimensional open-boundary chains, to characterize quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries. In one dimension, the information lattice provides a position- and scale-resolved decomposition of von Neumann information. Its generalization is nontrivial because overlapping subsystems can form loops, allowing multiple regions to encode the same information. This prevents information from being assigned uniquely to any one of them. We address this by introducing a higher-dimensional information lattice in which local information is defined through an inclusion-exclusion principle. The inclusion-exclusion local information is assigned to the lattice vertices, each labeled by subsystem position and scale. We implement this construction explicitly in two dimensions and apply it to a range of many-body ground states with distinct entanglement structures. Within this position- and scale-resolved framework, we extract information-based localization lengths, direction-dependent critical exponents, characteristic edge mode information, long-range information patterns due to topological order, and signatures of non-Abelian fusion channels. Our work establishes a general information-theoretic framework for isolating the universal scale-resolved features of quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries.

Title: Liouvillian Gap in Dissipative Haar-Doped Clifford Circuits
Authors: Ha Eum Kim, Andrew D. Kim, Jong Yeon Lee
Abstract: Quantum chaos is commonly assessed through probe-dependent signatures such as spectral statistics, OTOCs, and entanglement growth, which need not coincide. Recently, a dissipative diagnostic of chaos has been proposed, in which an infinitesimal coupling to a bath yields a finite Liouvillian gap in chaotic systems, marking the onset of intrinsic relaxation. This raises a conceptual question: what is the minimal departure from Clifford dynamics needed for this intrinsically relaxing behavior to emerge? In this work, we investigate the dynamics under the Floquet two-qubit Clifford circuit interleaved with a finite density of Haar-random single-site gates, followed by a depolarizing channel with strength $\gamma$. For Floquet Clifford circuits built from an \textit{i}SWAP-class two-qubit gate, our analysis identifies two distinct regimes for the Liouvillian gap in the thermodynamic limit, exemplified by the undoped and fully doped extreme cases. In both regimes, the dissipative diagnostic signals chaotic behavior, differing only in how the gap scales with system size. In the undoped circuit, the gap scales as $\Delta \sim \gamma N$, whereas in the fully doped circuit it remains finite as $N\to\infty$. We find that the doping density $p_h$ governs the crossover: as $p_h\to 0$, any spatial structure remains undoped-like, whereas for finite $p_h$ certain structures can enter a finite-gap regime. These results are analytically established in the strongly dissipative regime $\gamma\gg 1$ by deriving lower bounds on the gap as a function of $p_h$ and explicit finite-gap constructions, and their extension toward $\gamma\to 0$ is supported by numerics. Importantly, our analytic treatment depends only on the spatial doping structure, so the same gap scaling persists even when the Haar rotations are independently resampled each Floquet period.

Title: Neural Network Discovery of Paired Wigner Crystals in Artificial Graphene
Authors: Conor Smith, Yubo Yang, Zhou-Quan Wan, Yixiao Chen, Miguel A. Morales, Shiwei Zhang
Abstract: Moiré systems have emerged as an exciting tunable platform for engineering and probing quantum matter. A large number of exotic states have been observed, stimulating intense efforts in experiment, theory, and simulation. Utilizing a neural-network-based quantum Monte Carlo approach, we discover a new ground state of the two-dimensional electron gas in a honeycomb moire potential at a filling factor of $\nu_m =1/4$ (one electron every four moiré minima). In this state, two opposite-spin electrons pair to form a singlet-like valence bond state which restores local $C_6$ symmetry in hexagonal molecules each spanning $6$ moiré minima. These molecules of pairs then form a molecular Wigner crystal, leaving one quarter of the moiré minima mostly depleted. The formation of such a paired Wigner crystal, absent any confining potential or attractive interaction to facilitate "pre-assembling" the molecule, provides a fascinating case of collective phenomena in strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, and opportunities to engineer exotic properties.

Title: Identification of Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Species by Joint Characterization of Li-ion Battery Chemistry by Mass Spectrometry and Electro-Chemical Reaction Networks

Abstract: The formation and stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) play a central role in determining the long-term performance and safety of modern electrochemical energy storage systems. Despite decades of research, the SEI's heterogeneous, dynamic, and multi-phase nature has defied comprehensive molecular-level characterization, creating a critical knowledge gap that limits rational battery design. In this work, we introduce a computational-experimental framework that integrates high-throughput quantum chemistry calculations, data-driven electro-chemical reaction networks (eCRNs), stochastic algorithms, and Laser Desorption/Ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (LDI-FTICR-MS) to unravel SEI formation in carbonate-based electrolytes without imposing predefined mechanisms. We constructed the most comprehensive eCRN to date, spanning over 10,000 species and 209 million reactions. Through stochastic network analysis, we successfully recovered 27 species that were previously reported in literature and predicted 28 novel SEI species, nearly doubling our scientific knowledge in this area. Each new species was rigorously confirmed through advanced mass spectra analysis of its distinct molecular and isotopic signatures. We kinetically refined the formation pathways for a select set of both previously reported and novel SEI products, revealing kinetically feasible elementary reaction mechanisms with activation barriers below 1 eV. This computational-experimental approach deepens our molecular-level understanding of SEI chemistry and supports the rational design of advanced electrolytes and engineered interphases for next-generation lithium-based batteries.

Title: Clever Materials: When Models Identify Good Materials for the Wrong Reasons
Authors: Kevin Maik Jablonka
Abstract: Machine learning can accelerate materials discovery. Models perform impressively on many benchmarks. However, strong benchmark performance does not imply that a model learned chemistry. I test a concrete alternative hypothesis: that property prediction can be driven by bibliographic confounding. Across five tasks spanning MOFs (thermal and solvent stability), perovskite solar cells (efficiency), batteries (capacity), and TADF emitters (emission wavelength), models trained on standard chemical descriptors predict author, journal, and publication year well above chance. When these predicted metadata ("bibliographic fingerprints") are used as the sole input to a second model, performance is sometimes competitive with conventional descriptor-based predictors. These results show that many datasets do not rule out non-chemical explanations of success. Progress requires routine falsification tests (e.g., group/time splits and metadata ablations), datasets designed to resist spurious correlations, and explicit separation of two goals: predictive utility versus evidence of chemical understanding.

Title: Topological Boundary Time Crystal Oscillations
Authors: Dominik Nemeth, Ahsan Nazir, Alessandro Principi, Robert-Jan Slager
Abstract: Boundary time crystals (BTCs) break time-translation symmetry and exhibit long-lived, robust oscillations insensitive to initial conditions. We show that collective spin BTCs can admit emergent topological winding numbers in operator space. Expanding the density operator in a spherical tensor basis, we map the Lindblad dynamics onto an effective local hopping problem, where collective degrees of freedom label sites of an emergent two-dimensional operator space lattice and identify topological obstructions that enforce the delocalization of operator modes on the lattice. The resulting spectral delocalization provides a natural explanation for the robust oscillatory dynamics observed in BTCs. When combined with non-reciprocal transport of operator weight across operator space, this mechanism moreover also leads to the universality of long-time dynamics across a broad class of initial states. Our results frame BTC dynamics as a form of topologically constrained operator space transport and suggest a close connection to non-Hermitian skin-effects.

Title: Topological Exploration of High-Dimensional Empirical Risk Landscapes: general approach, and applications to phase retrieval
Authors: Antoine Maillard, Tony Bonnaire, Giulio Biroli
Abstract: We consider the landscape of empirical risk minimization for high-dimensional Gaussian single-index models (generalized linear models). The objective is to recover an unknown signal $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star \in \mathbb{R}^d$ (where $d \gg 1$) from a loss function $\hat{R}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ that depends on pairs of labels $(\mathbf{x}_i \cdot \boldsymbol{\theta}, \mathbf{x}_i \cdot \boldsymbol{\theta}^\star)_{i=1}^n$, with $\mathbf{x}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_d)$, in the proportional asymptotic regime $n \asymp d$. Using the Kac-Rice formula, we analyze different complexities of the landscape -- defined as the expected number of critical points -- corresponding to various types of critical points, including local minima. We first show that some variational formulas previously established in the literature for these complexities can be drastically simplified, reducing to explicit variational problems over a finite number of scalar parameters that we can efficiently solve numerically. Our framework also provides detailed predictions for properties of the critical points, including the spectral properties of the Hessian and the joint distribution of labels. We apply our analysis to the real phase retrieval problem for which we derive complete topological phase diagrams of the loss landscape, characterizing notably BBP-type transitions where the Hessian at local minima (as predicted by the Kac-Rice formula) becomes unstable in the direction of the signal. We test the predictive power of our analysis to characterize gradient flow dynamics, finding excellent agreement with finite-size simulations of local optimization algorithms, and capturing fine-grained details such as the empirical distribution of labels. Overall, our results open new avenues for the asymptotic study of loss landscapes and topological trivialization phenomena in high-dimensional statistical models.

Title: Shortcuts to Adiabaticity via Adaptive Quantum Zeno Measurements
Authors: Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: We consider the quantum Zeno dynamics arising from monitoring a time-dependent projector. Starting from a stroboscopic measurement protocol, it is shown that the effective Hamiltonian for Zeno dynamics involves a nonadiabatic geometric connection that takes the form of the Kato-Avron Hamiltonian for parallel transport, stirring the evolution within the time-dependent Zeno subspace. The latter reduces to counterdiabatic driving when projective measurements are performed in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis of the quantum system. The effective Zeno Hamiltonian can also be derived in the context of continuous quantum measurements of a time-dependent observable and the non-Hermitian evolution with a complex absorbing potential varying in time. Our results thus provide a unified framework for realizing shortcuts to adiabaticity via adaptive quantum Zeno measurements.

Title: Scaling and tuning to criticality in resting-state human magnetoencephalography
Authors: Irem Topal, Anna Poggialini, Marco Dal Maschio, Daniele De Martino, Oren Shriki, Fabrizio Lombardi
Abstract: Scaling laws in biological neural networks have long been investigated. From 1/f noise to neuronal avalanches, evidence of scaling in brain activity has been increasingly linked to tuning to or near criticality. The concept of scaling is intimately related to the renormalization group (RG), in essence providing coarse-grained, simplified descriptions that generalize to classes of diverse physical systems. Following the RG idea, a coarse-graining scheme has recently been proposed for populations of real neurons, and scaling behaviors in collective quantities have been reported in the hippocampus and in different areas of the rat cortex. To bridge the gap between neuronal population scales and species, here we consider large-scale, electrophysiological recordings of human brain activity in the awake resting-state. We demonstrate robust scaling behaviors of collective dynamics across coarse-graining scales, with exponents close to those measured in populations of spiking neurons. Further, we show that dynamics of neuronal avalanches, scale-free cascades of neural activity, are invariant under the proposed coarse-graining approach. Simulations of a non-equilibrium adaptive Ising model inferred from data and apt to reproduce a large repertoire of resting-state brain dynamics indicate that the scaling behaviors of the resting human brain activity emerge close to criticality and depend on the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance of the network. While extending the range of validity of previous observations at small spatial scales and pointing to common scaling laws in mammals, the results open the way to a robust (currently missing) non-invasive approach to estimate the E/I balance, a key quantity in neuroscience research.

Title: Measuring and correcting nanosecond pulse distortions in quantum-dot spin qubits
Authors: Jiheng Duan, Fernando Torres-Leal, John M. Nichol
Abstract: Gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots utilize fast electrical control to manipulate spin and charge states of individual electrons. Electrical pulse distortions can limit control fidelities but are difficult to measure at the device level. Here, we use detuning-axis pulsed spectroscopy to characterize baseband pulse distortions in a silicon double quantum-dot. We extract the gate-voltage impulse response and apply a digital pre-distortion filter to eliminate pulse distortions on timescales longer than 1~ns. With the pre-distortion, we reduce the frequency chirp of coherent exchange oscillations in a singlet-triplet qubit. Our results suggest a scalable and tuning-efficient method for characterizing pulse distortions in quantum-dot spin qubits.

Title: Simulating Quantum Field Theories with Boundaries in Curved Spacetimes Using Open Spin Systems
Authors: Shunichiro Kinoshita, Keiju Murata, Daisuke Yamamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii
Abstract: We develop a framework to simulate quantum field theories (QFTs) with boundaries in $(1+1)$-dimenmsional curved spacetimes by employing open spin systems. Building upon our previous work that established a mapping from spin systems to QFTs in periodic geometries, we extend the correspondence to systems with boundaries, where boundary conditions play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics. Focusing on Majorana fermions, we derive the allowed boundary conditions from the requirement of inner product conservation and formulate their realization in spin systems. The corresponding spin model is shown to reproduce boundary conditions of QFT accurately when a free function in the spin model is appropriately chosen. As an explicit demonstration, we analyze a flat spacetime example, comparing spectra, mode functions, and linear responses between the continuum and lattice descriptions. Our findings confirm that open spin systems can successfully replicate QFT dynamics with boundaries.

Title: Dynamic topological exciton-polaritons enabling ultrafast logic operations
Authors: Feng Jin, Hao Zheng, Zhe Zhang, Jiaohao Ren, Yuxi Liu, Qing Zhang, Daniele Sanvitto, Timothy C. H. Liew, Baile Zhang, Rui Su
Abstract: Topological active materials have emerged as powerful paradigm bridging the discovery of exotic topological phases of matter with the development of functional topological devices. The recent extension of these material systems into dynamic regime, where topological properties can be actively manipulated at ultrafast timescales, promises unprecedented control over topological states and their functionalities. However, translating the static topological lasing signals into high-performance logic functions remain highly challenging, which imposes a far more stringent set of materials attributes. Here, leveraging the strong nonlinearity and pronounced spectral isolation of perovskite exciton-polaritons embedded in a Dirac vortex microcavity, we experimentally demonstrate the dynamic topological Majorana-like state polariton condensation with its ultrafast logic operations at room temperature. By actively coordinating pump and control beams in both spectral and temporal domain, we dynamically steer the topological polariton condensation process and demonstrate AND and NOT logic operations, achieving record extinction ratio (~20 dB), extremely low control fluence (~0.2 nJ/cm2) and sub-picosecond response time (~500 fs). Our results expand the frontier of dynamic topology and establish a novel pathway towards robust, ultrafast, and reconfigurable on-chip polaritonic logic circuits.

Title: Decoding cell signaling via optimal transport and information theory
Authors: Mintu Nandi, Sosuke Ito
Abstract: A central challenge in cellular signal processing is understanding how biochemical networks perform reliably despite molecular noise. Traditionally, mutual information has been widely used to quantify signaling fidelity, capturing how well outputs discriminate distinct input states. However, it fails to capture whether the output also faithfully mirrors the statistical structure of the input, a property crucial in processes like morphogen patterning, dose-dependent signaling, and cellular communication. To address this gap, we introduce the 2-Wasserstein distance from optimal transport theory, which provides a geometric basis for comparing input and output distributions. In our proposed framework, we define mutual information as informational fidelity and the inverse of the 2-Wasserstein distance as geometric fidelity. Applying this dual-fidelity framework to canonical regulatory motifs under Gaussian channel approximation reveals a topology-dependent trade-off: coherent feed-forward loops can achieve high performance in both dimensions, whereas feedback architectures typically sacrifice informational fidelity to enhance geometric fidelity. We demonstrate that theoretical predictions of feedback regulation are well supported by experimental data from tumor necrosis factor signaling. Our results demonstrate that maximizing information alone is not always advantageous and that reliable signaling arises from balancing information transmission with the geometric aspects of signaling. Thus, our analysis establishes geometric fidelity as a fundamental, yet previously unrecognized, dimension of signaling fidelity. It also provides a quantitative, experimentally accessible framework for dissecting natural networks and designing task-specific synthetic circuits.

Title: Observation of Robust and Coherent Non-Abelian Hadron Dynamics on Noisy Quantum Processors
Authors: Fran Ilčić, Ritajit Majumdar, Emil Mathew, Nathan Earnest-Noble, Indrakshi Raychowdhury
Abstract: The real-time evolution of strongly interacting matter remains a frontier of fundamental physics, as classical simulations are hampered by exponential Hilbert space growth and entanglement-driven bottlenecks in tensor networks. This study reports the quantum simulation of hadron dynamics within a $(1+1)$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory using a 156-qubit IBM superconducting processor. Leveraging a hardware-efficient Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) encoding, we simulate the dynamics of the physical degrees of freedom on a $60$-site lattice in the weak-coupling regime, as a crucial step toward the continuum limit. We successfully observe the light-cone propagation of a confined meson and internal oscillations indicative of early-time hadronic breathing modes. Notably, these high-fidelity results were obtained directly from the quantum data via a differential measurement protocol, together with measurement error mitigation, demonstrating a robust pathway for large-scale simulations even on noisy hardware. To validate the results, we benchmarked the quantum algorithm and outcome from the quantum processor against state-of-the-art approximated classical algorithms using CPU -- based on tensor network methods and Pauli propagation method, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative comparison demonstrating that as the system approaches the weak-coupling or the continuum limit, the quantum processor maintains a consistent structural robustness where classical tensor networks and Pauli propagation methods encounter an onset of exponential complexity or symmetry violations as an artifact of approximation in the algorithm. These results establish a scalable pathway for simulating non-Abelian dynamics on near-term quantum hardware and mark a critical step toward achieving a practical quantum advantage in high-energy physics.

Abstract: The ability to establish coherent communication channels is key for scaling up quantum devices. Here, we engineer interactions between distant polaritons, hybrid spin-photon excitations formed at different lumped-element superconducting resonators within a chip. The chip consists of several resonator pairs, slightly detuned in frequency to make them addressable, capacitively coupled within each pair and inductively coupled to a common readout line. They interact locally with samples of PTMr and Tripak$^{-}$ organic free radicals, deposited onto their inductors, which provide model $S = 1/2$, $g \simeq 2$ spin ensembles. Frequency-dependent microwave transmission experiments, performed at very low temperatures, measure polariton frequencies as a function of magnetic field in different scenarios. When only one resonator within a pair hosts a molecular sample, the results evidence that spins couple remotely to the empty LER as well as to the local cavity mode. If both resonators interact with a spin ensemble, the magnetic field tunes the polariton frequencies relative to each other, on account of the different spin-photon interactions at each LER. When polaritons are brought into mutual resonance, an avoided level crossing emerges that gives direct spectroscopic evidence for a coherent polariton-polariton interaction mediated by the circuit. Pump-probe experiments reveal that the excitation of a polariton within a connected pair is felt, thus it can be read out, by the other one. These observations, backed by model calculations, illustrate the control and detection of distant photon-photon and spin-spin correlations and entanglement in a scalable modular chip.

Title: Stable Long-Horizon Spatiotemporal Prediction on Meshes Using Latent Multiscale Recurrent Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Lionel Salesses, Larbi Arbaoui, Tariq Benamara, Arnaud Francois, Caroline Sainvitu
Abstract: Accurate long-horizon prediction of spatiotemporal fields on complex geometries is a fundamental challenge in scientific machine learning, with applications such as additive manufacturing where temperature histories govern defect formation and mechanical properties. High-fidelity simulations are accurate but computationally costly, and despite recent advances, machine learning methods remain challenged by long-horizon temperature and gradient prediction. We propose a deep learning framework for predicting full temperature histories directly on meshes, conditioned on geometry and process parameters, while maintaining stability over thousands of time steps and generalizing across heterogeneous geometries. The framework adopts a temporal multiscale architecture composed of two coupled models operating at complementary time scales. Both models rely on a latent recurrent graph neural network to capture spatiotemporal dynamics on meshes, while a variational graph autoencoder provides a compact latent representation that reduces memory usage and improves training stability. Experiments on simulated powder bed fusion data demonstrate accurate and temporally stable long-horizon predictions across diverse geometries, outperforming existing baseline. Although evaluated in two dimensions, the framework is general and extensible to physics-driven systems with multiscale dynamics and to three-dimensional geometries.

Title: Nanoscopy of surface polarization with oblique dipole orientations
Authors: V. G. M. Duarte, D. A. Miranda, D. F. P. Cunha, M. I. Vasilevskiy, N. Asger Mortensen, A. J. Chaves, N. M. R. Peres
Abstract: We present a general electromagnetic description for dipoles confined to surfaces with oblique dipole moment orientations, extending the conventional in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) treatments. This description is useful for describing localized polarization in, \textit{e.g.}, van der Waals heterostructures, thin films of molecular aggregates, and metal-dielectric interfaces. The theory is suitable for any material with vanishingly thin thickness relative to the light wavelength, independent of the geometry of the material and the media interfacing it. We apply the formalism to a uniaxial excitonic sheet, covering a large number of two-dimensional (2D) materials and organic thin films. Our theory reveals pairs of polaritonic resonances originating from the IP and OOP components of the excitonic dipole moment. The formalism suggests experimentally accessible signatures of dipole moment orientation, enhanced by near-field probes. This work proposes a unified language for the description of 2D materials, thin films and interfaces with anisotropic dipolar responses.

Title: High-quality single photons from cavity-enhanced biexciton-to-exciton transition
Authors: Nils Heinisch, Francesco Salusti, Mark R. Hogg, Timon L. Baltisberger, Malwina A. Marczak, Sascha R. Valentin, Arne Ludwig, Klaus D. Jöns, Richard J. Warburton, Stefan Schumacher
Abstract: Resonant laser excitation of a two-level system with subsequent single-photon emission can be used to generate single photons with high indistinguishability or Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) visibility. However, spectral overlap between excitation laser and emitted photons generally poses significant challenges. Furthermore, emitter re-excitation intrinsically limits achievable single-photon purity. Established solutions mitigate these issues at significant cost to source efficiency and with increased source complexity. This motivates the use of few-level systems with spectral separation of excitation and emission pathways. One option is a three-level cascade. However, without targeted lifetime engineering of emitting states, the cascade naturally limits achievable photon indistinguishability. Here we study a semiconductor quantum dot with resonant and selective cavity-enhancement of biexciton-to-exciton transition. Following resonant two-photon excitation of the biexciton state, we collect the emitted single photon with the cavity. This approach circumvents emitter re-excitation and naturally introduces spectral separation of excitation laser and emitted single photon. Supported by first experimental results, we demonstrate theoretically that with selective Purcell enhancement, the observed quality quantifiers of single-photon emission (purity, equivalently $g^{(2)}(0)$, and HOM visibility $\mathcal{V}$, equivalently indistinguishability) are competitive with respect to high-quality deterministic quantum-dot single-photon sources. This is already achieved without systematic optimization or targeted system engineering, which firmly places the reported approach as a viable route to the next generation of highest-quality quantum-dot based deterministic single-photon sources.

Title: Rydberg states with a liquid core
Authors: Juan Carlos Acosta Matos, P. Giannakeas, Jan M. Rost
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent approach that provides an explicit potential for a Rydberg electron whose ionic core consists of a polarizable medium, typically realized with superfluid droplets. The electron's motion remains separable in spherical coordinates, but the radial force exerted by the droplet breaks degeneracy of the angular momentum states non-perturbatively. The ensuing electron spectrum reveals intriguing properties dependent on droplet size and electron excitation. Deviations of the polarizable medium from the continuous spherical distribution can be taken into account as a perturbation of this redefined Rydberg dynamics. We discuss specific but paradigmatic examples for superfluid helium and also propose a way to probe droplet properties including its possible crystallized fraction through stimulated transitions of the Rydberg electron.

Title: Twisted symmetric exclusion processes and set-theoretical $R$-matrices
Authors: Mathieu Dabrowski, Loïc Poulain d'Andecy, Eric Ragoucy
Abstract: We investigate periodic integrable Markov models, constructed from set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We first focus on the simplest class of solutions, called Lyubashenko solutions. We show that the resulting models are equivalent to some twisted Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (SSEP), which are usual periodic SSEP models where a twist is added on a bond of the ring. We also provide various possible interpretations for these Markov models. Then, we study the long time dynamics of the twisted SSEP, characterising its different stationary states and counting them. Allowing the twist to vary, we examine the possible transitions between the different stationary states. Finally, we extend our construction of Markov models to set-theoretical solutions that are more general than Lyubashenko solutions and show that such models are not equivalent to a twisted SSEP in general.

Title: Higher-order spatial photon interference versus dipole blockade effect
Authors: Arthur Rotari, Mihai A. Macovei
Abstract: The steady-state quantum dynamics of three dipole-dipole coupled two-level emitters, fixed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, and interacting via the environmental thermostat is investigated. We have analytically obtained the populations of the involved three-atom cooperative states as well as of the second- and third-order spatial photon correlation functions of the light scattered by the few-qubit sample. As a consequence, we have demonstrated that this incoherently excited system spontaneously generates streams of single photons possessing sub-Poissonian photon statistics. In analogy to the dipole-dipole blockade, one may expect that at smaller inter particle distances, compared to the photon emission wavelength, the reported phenomenon has the same origin. However, we have shown that the quantum photon features are due to the interaction's nature of the few symmetrically arranged two-level emitters with the surrounding thermal reservoir. Respectively, at larger atomic intervals the effect occurs because of high-order spatial interference phenomena. Sub-wavelength interference fringes can be observed too, via measurements of spatial higher-order photon correlation functions.

Authors: Paul Romatschke
Abstract: Scalar field theory is studied by constructing interacting saddle point expansions in the symmetric and broken phase, respectively. Focusing on analytically tractable saddle expansions, it is found that broken and symmetric phases are related by sign flip of the quartic coupling. Applications to dimensions $d<4$ recover previous results for the phase diagram, whereas $d=4$ is possibly new.

Title: Impossibility of Refrigeration and Engine Operation in Minimal Qubit Repeated-Interaction Models
Authors: Gabrielle Barsky-Giles, Alessandro Prositto, Matthew Gerry, Dvira Segal
Abstract: We investigate the operation of a qubit as a quantum thermal device within the repeated interaction framework, allowing for strong system-bath coupling and finite interaction times. We analyze two minimal models: an alternating-coupling setup, in which the qubit sequentially interacts with hot and cold baths, and a simultaneous-coupling setup, where both baths interact with the qubit during each collision. For the alternating model, we obtain an exact analytical solution for the limit-cycle state, valid for arbitrary coupling strengths and collision durations. Using this solution, we rigorously prove a no-go theorem for quantum refrigeration. We further demonstrate that, although work can be generated locally at individual system-bath contacts, the total work over a cycle is always nonpositive, precluding engine operation. In the absence of work, the model describes pure heat conduction, for which we derive a closed-form expression for the heat current and show that it exhibits a nonmonotonic turnover behavior. The simultaneous-coupling model is analyzed perturbatively. In the short-collision-time limit, it reproduces the same steady-state behavior as the alternating model, reinforcing the generality of the constraints identified. Our results establish fundamental limitations on qubit-based quantum thermal machines operating under Markovian repeated interactions and highlight the need for enriched models to realize functional quantum thermal devices.

Title: Phase diagram of a lattice fermion model with symmetric mass generation
Authors: Sandip Maiti, Debasish Banerjee, Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Marina K. Marinkovic
Abstract: We study the phase structure of a model containing two flavors of massless staggered fermions interacting through two independent four-fermion couplings, UI and UB, formulated on a three-dimensional Euclidean space-time lattice. At UB = 0, this model is known to exhibit a direct second-order quantum phase transition between a massless fermion (MF) phase and a phase in which fermions acquire masses through the mechanism commonly referred to as symmetric mass generation (SMG). We demonstrate that introducing a small nonzero value of UB qualitatively alters this structure: the single exotic transition at UB = 0 splits into two distinct, conventional transitions, separated by an intermediate phase in which fermion masses arise through the standard mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The first of these is a Gross-Neveu transition separating the MF phase from the SSB-induced massive phase, while the second is a three-dimensional XY transition between the SSB phase and the SMG phase. Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method, we verify that the critical exponents associated with both transitions are consistent with the literature, thereby yielding a quantitative characterization of the resulting phase structure of the model.

Title: Ori-Sense: origami capacitive sensing for soft robotic applications
Authors: Hugo de Souza Oliveira, Xin Li, Mohsen Jafarpour, Edoardo Milana
Abstract: This work introduces Ori-Sense, a compliant capacitive sensor inspired by the inverted Kresling origami pattern. The device translates torsional deformation into measurable capacitance changes, enabling proprioceptive feedback for soft robotic systems. Using dissolvable-core molding, we fabricated a monolithic silicone structure with embedded conductive TPU electrodes, forming an integrated soft capacitor. Mechanical characterization revealed low stiffness and minimal impedance, with torque values below 0.01 N mm for axial displacements between -15 mm and 15 mm, and up to 0.03 N mm at 30 degrees twist under compression. Finite-element simulations confirmed localized stresses along fold lines and validated the measured torque-rotation response. Electrical tests showed consistent capacitance modulation up to 30%, directly correlated with the twist angle, and maximal sensitivity of S_theta ~ 0.0067 pF/deg at 5 mm of axial deformation.

Title: Snapping Actuators with Asymmetric and Sequenced Motion
Authors: Xin Li, Ye Jin, Mohsen Jafarpour, Hugo de Souza Oliveira, Edoardo Milana
Abstract: Snapping instabilities in soft structures offer a powerful pathway to achieve rapid and energy-efficient actuation. In this study, an eccentric dome-shaped snapping actuator is developed to generate controllable asymmetric motion through geometry-induced instability. Finite element simulations and experiments reveal consistent asymmetric deformation and the corresponding pressure characteristics. By coupling four snapping actuators in a pneumatic network, a compact quadrupedal robot achieves coordinated wavelike locomotion using only a single pressure input. The robot exhibits frequency-dependent performance with a maximum speed of 72.78~mm/s at 7.5~Hz. These findings demonstrate the potential of asymmetric snapping mechanisms for physically controlled actuation and lay the groundwork for fully untethered and efficient soft robotic systems.

Title: Correlated topological band structures of the kagome altermagnets Mn$_3X$ ($X=$ Sn, Ge, Ga)
Authors: Yingying Cao, Yuanji Xu, Yi-feng Yang
Abstract: The interplay of topological band structures and electronic correlations may lead to novel quantum phenomena with potential applications. First-principles calculations are critical for guiding experimental discoveries and interpretations, but often fail if electronic correlations cannot be properly treated. Here we show that this issue occurs also in the kagome altermagnets Mn$_3X$ ($X=$ Sn, Ge, Ga), which were believed to exhibit large anomalous Hall effect due to topological band structures with Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy. Our systematic investigations reveal critical importance of beyond-DFT treatments on three key aspects of their magnetic, electronic, and topological properties: (1) establishment of noncollinear altermagnetic orders, (2) weakly renormalized band structures in excellent agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment, and (3) sensitive tuning of the Weyl nodes. Our work provides a unified basis for understanding topological properties of the Mn$_3X$ family, which challenges previous experimental interpretations based on DFT band structures and predicts potentially higher anomalous Hall conductivity in Mn$_3$Ga under electron doping. This underscores the importance of a correlation-aware framework beyond DFT in understanding topological magnetic materials.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of a controlled conical geometry on the electric charge transport through a two-dimensional quantum ring weakly coupled to both the emitter and the collector. These mesoscopic systems are known for being able to confine highly mobile electrons in a defined region of matter. In particular, we consider a GaAs device having an average radius of $800\hspace{0.05cm}\text{nm}$ in different regimes of subband occupation at non-zero temperature and under the influence of a weak and uniform background magnetic field. Using the adapted Landauer formula for the resonant tunneling and the energy eigenvalues, we explore how the modified surface affects the Van-Hove conductance singularities, the magnetoresistance interference patterns resulting from the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations of different frequencies and the charge transport when an electric potential is applied in the terminals of the device. Magnetoresistance and charge current oscillations depending only on the curvature intensity are reported, providing a new feature that represents an alternative way to optimize the transport through the device by tuning its geometry.

Title: Single-shot latched readout of a quantum dot qubit using barrier gate pulsing
Authors: Sanghyeok Park, Jared Benson, J. Corrigan, J. P. Dodson, S. N. Coppersmith, Mark Friesen, M. A. Eriksson
Abstract: Latching techniques are widely used to enhance readout of qubits. These methods require precise tuning of multiple tunnel rates, which can be challenging to achieve under realistic experimental conditions, such as when a qubit is coupled to a single reservoir. Here, we present a method for single-shot measurement of a quantum dot qubit with a single reservoir using a latched-readout scheme. Our approach involves pulsing a barrier gate to dynamically control qubit-to-reservoir tunnel rates, a method that is readily applicable to the latched readout of various spin-based qubits. We use this method to enable qubit state latching and to reduce the qubit reset time in measurements of coherent Larmor oscillations of a Si/SiGe quantum dot hybrid qubit.

Title: Dynamical scaling study for the estimation of dynamical exponent $z$ of three-dimensional XY spin glass model
Authors: Yusuke Terasawa, Yukiyasu Ozeki
Abstract: To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.

Title: Spin liquids in spin-1 pyrochlore magnets: nematic Coulomb phase, intrinsic spin glass, and its realization in NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$
Authors: Rico Pohle, Nic Shannon
Abstract: The search for spin liquids, magnetic phases which lie outside the Landau paradigm, remains one of the central challenges for modern condensed matter physics. Here, motivated by NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$, we use numerical simulation to explore the phases which arise in a minimal model of a spin-1 pyrochlore magnet, once quadrupole moments are taken into account. We identify seven distinct Coulombic spin liquid phases, including one with nematic correlations. Through quantitative comparison with inelastic neutron scattering, we show that this nematic spin liquid provides a compelling scenario for both the spin liquid observed in NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$, and its spin glass transition, without the need to invoke disorder. These results highlight the great wealth of unconventional phases which arise for magnetic ions capable of supporting both dipole and quadrupole moments.

Title: An anisotropic functional for two-dimensional material systems
Authors: Michael Lorke
Abstract: Density function theory is the workhorse of modern electronic structure theory. However, its accuracy in practical calculations is limited by the choice of the exchange-correlation potential. In this respect, two-dimensional materials pose a special challenge, as all these materials and their heterostructures have a crucial similarity. The underlying atomic structures are strongly spatially inhomogeneous, implying that current exchange-correlation functionals, that in almost all cases are isotropic, are ill-prepared for an accurate description. We present an anisotropic screened-exchange potential, that remedies this problem and reproduces the band-gap of 2D materials as well as the piecewise linearity of the total energy with fractional occupation number.

Title: Microscopic theory of electron quadrupling condensates
Authors: Albert Samoilenka, Egor Babaev
Abstract: Electron pairing at low temperatures leads to superconductivity. A fundamental question is whether more complex states - characterized by order in four-electron composite objects, termed electron quadrupling or composite order - can exist in materials, and if so, under what conditions they emerge and what properties they exhibit. These states lie beyond the scope of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, and a microscopic description of them remained elusive. In the first part of the paper, we provide a general microscopic framework to describe these and the other four-fermion composite states. In the second part of the paper, we derive and solve a specific fermionic model in two and three dimensions that hosts time-reversal symmetry-breaking electron quadrupling order. The fermionic microscopic theory is used to estimate the specific heat and electron density of states.

Title: Number of local minima in discrete-time fractional Brownian motion
Authors: Maxim Dolgushev, Olivier Bénichou
Abstract: The analysis of local minima in time series data and random landscapes is essential across numerous scientific disciplines, offering critical insights into system dynamics. Recently, Kundu, Majumdar, and Schehr derived the exact distribution of the number of local minima for a broad class of Markovian symmetric walks [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{110}, 024137 (2024)]; however, many real-world systems are non-Markovian, typically due to interactions with possibly hidden degrees of freedom. This work investigates the statistical properties of local minima in discrete-time samples of fractional Brownian motion (fBm), a non-Markovian Gaussian process with stationary increments, widely used to model complex, anomalous diffusion phenomena. We derive a complete asymptotic characterization of the fluctuations of the number of local minima $m_N$ in an $N$-step discrete-time fBm. We show that the fluctuations of $m_N$ exhibit a sharp transition at the Hurst exponent $H=3/4$: for $H\le 3/4$ they satisfy a central limit theorem with Gaussian limiting law, whereas for $H>3/4$ they converge to a non-Gaussian Rosenblatt process. The convergence at the process level gives us full statistical description at all times. We exemplify it on the covariance of the rescaled minima process, which displays two qualitatively distinct regimes matching Brownian and Rosenblatt covariances on either side of this threshold. Our analysis relies on a Hermite/Wick decomposition of the local-minimum indicator, which isolates a quadratic functional of an effective long-memory mode as the unique driver of the anomalous statistics. These results identify the count of local minima as a simple and robust diagnostic of long-range dependence in non-Markovian Gaussian processes, a conclusion supported by numerical simulations.

Title: Dynamics of Wound Closure in Living Nematic Epithelia
Authors: Henry Andralojc, Jake Turley, Helen Weavers, Paul Martin, Isaac V. Chenchiah, Rachel R. Bennett, Tanniemola B. Liverpool
Abstract: We study theoretically the closure of a wound in a layer of epithelial cells in a living tissue after damage. Our analysis is informed by our recent experiments observing re-epithelialisation in vivo of Drosophila pupae. On time and length-scales such that the evolution of the epithelial tissue near the wound is well captured by that of a 2D active fluid with local nematic order, we consider the free-surface problem of a hole in a bounded region of tissue, and study the role that active stresses far from the hole play in the closure of the hole. For parallel anchored nematic order at the wound boundary (as we observe in our experiments), we find that closure is accelerated when the active stresses are contractile and slowed down when the stresses are extensile. Parallel anchoring also leads to the appearance of topological defects which annihilate upon wound closure.

Title: Elastic turbulence in highly entangled polymers and wormlike micelles
Authors: Theo A. Lewy, Suzanne M. Fielding, Peter D. Olmsted, Rich R. Kerswell
Abstract: We show theoretically that an initially homogeneous planar Couette flow of a concentrated polymeric fluid is linearly unstable to the growth of two-dimensional (2D) perturbations, within two widely used constitutive models: the Johnson-Segalman model and the Rolie-Poly model. We perform direct nonlinear simulations of both models in 2D to show that this instability leads to a state of elastic turbulence comprising several narrow shear bands that dynamically coalesce, split and interact. Importantly, we show that this 2D instability arises not only in fluids that have a non-monotonic constitutive curve, and therefore show shear banding in 1D calculations, but also in shear thinning fluids with a monotonic constitutive curve, for which an initially homogeneous base state is stable in 1D. For the former category, the high shear branch of the constitutive curve is unstable to 2D instability in both models, so that the high shear band may be turbulent. In the Rolie-Poly model, the low shear branch is also likewise unstable. Our work provides the first simulation evidence for elastic turbulence in highly entangled polymeric fluids. It also potentially explains rheo-chaotic states seen experimentally in shear banding wormlike micelles. We additionally demonstrate elastic turbulence within both models in the planar Poiseuille geometry.

Title: Twisted bilayer graphene as a terahertz plasmonic crystal
Authors: Brian S. Vermilyea, Michael M. Fogler
Abstract: We study surface plasmons in minimally-twisted gapped bilayer graphene that contains a triangular network of partial dislocations (or AB-BA domain walls) hosting topologically protected one-dimensional electronic states. We show that this system behaves as a plasmonic crystal and we calculate its band structure by solving classical equations of motion for charge dynamics on the network links with impedance boundary conditions at the network nodes. The plasmon dispersion exhibits several notable features such as multiple gapless branches, flat bands, and dissipationless modes at high-symmetry points. We compare our network-based formalism with the conventional random phase approximation and discuss when each approach is valid. Calculations of plasmon waves launched by local scatterers are presented to simulate terahertz nano-imaging experiments.

Title: Quintuplet condensation in the skyrmionic insulator Cu2OSeO3 at ultrahigh magnetic fields
Authors: T. Nomura, I. Rousochatzakis, O. Janson, M. Gen, X.-G. Zhou, Y. Ishii, S. Seki, Y. Kohama, Y. H. Matsuda
Abstract: We report ultrahigh magnetic field Faraday rotation results on the chiral helimagnet Cu2OSeO3, the first Mott insulator showing skyrmion lattice phases and a linear magnetoelectric effect. Between 180 and 300 T, we find signatures of a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons, which can be described as a canted XY ferrimagnet. Due to the magnetoelectric coupling, the transverse magnetic order of the indivual Cu2+ spins is accompanied by a characteristic dome-like electric polarization which is crucial for the observation of the condensate via the Faraday rotation effect.

Title: Exact description of fermionic reservoirs via purified damped ancillary fermions
Authors: Pengfei Liang, Neill Lambert, Mauro Cirio
Abstract: We present a method for the modeling of fermionic reservoirs using a new class of ancillary damped fermions, dubbed purified pseudofermions, which exhibit unusual free correlations. We show that this key feature, when combined with existing efficient decomposition algorithms for the reservoir correlation functions, enables the development of an easily implementable and accurate scheme for constructing effective models of fermionic reservoirs. We numerically demonstrate the validity, accuracy, efficiency and potential use of our method by studying the particle transport of spinless fermions in a one-dimensional chain. Beyond its utility as a quantum impurity solver, our method holds promise for addressing a wide range of problems involving extended systems in fields like quantum transport, quantum thermodynamics, thermal engines and nonequilibrium phase transitions.

Title: The role of stacking and strain in mean-field magnetic moments of multilayer graphene
Authors: András Balogh, János Koltai, Péter Nemes-Incze, Zoltán Tajkov
Abstract: Rhombohedral or ABC stacked multilayer graphene hosts a correlated magnetic ground state at charge neutrality, making it one of the simplest systems to investigate strong electronic correlations. We investigate this ground state in multilayer graphene structures using the Hubbard model in a distance dependent Slater-Koster tight binding framework. We show that by using a universal Hubbard-$U$ term, we can accurately capture the spin polarization predicted by hybrid density functional theory calculations for both hexagonal (ABA) and rhombohedral (ABC) stackings. Using this $U$ value, we calculate the magnetic moments of 3-8 layers of ABC and ABA graphene multilayers. We demonstrate that the structure and magnitude of these magnetic moments are robust when heterostructures are built from varying numbers of ABC and ABA multilayers. By applying different types of mechanical distortions, we study the behaviour of the magnetism in graphene systems under uniaxial strain and pressure. Our results establish a computationally efficient framework to investigate correlation-driven magnetism across arbitrary stacking configurations of graphite polytypes.

Title: Coulomb correlated multi-particle states of weakly confining GaAs quantum dots
Authors: Petr Klenovský
Abstract: We compute the electronic and emission properties of Coulomb-correlated multi-particle states (X$^0$, X$^\pm$, XX) in weakly confining GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots using an 8-band $\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{p}$ model coupled to continuum elasticity and configuration interaction (CI). We evaluate polarization-resolved oscillator strengths and radiative rates both in the dipole approximation (DA) and in a quasi-electrostatic beyond-dipole (BDA) longitudinal formulation implemented via a Poisson reformulation exactly equivalent to the dyadic Green-tensor kernel. For the dots studied, BDA yields lifetimes in quantitative agreement with experiment, e.g., $\tau^X=0.279\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.267\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.) and $\tau^{XX}=0.101\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.115\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.). The framework also reproduces electric-field tuning of the multi-particle electronic structure and emission-including the indistinguishability inferred from $P=\tau^X/(\tau^X+\tau^{XX})$-and we assess sensitivity to CI-basis size and to electron-electron and hole-hole exchange.

Title: High-order coupling as a driver for Mott insulating behavior in Holography
Authors: Lin-Yue Bai, René Meyer, Zhen-Hua Zhou
Abstract: We construct a simple holographic model incorporating higher-order coupling terms for electron self-interactions. It can exhibit typical behavior of a Mott insulator, including a metal-insulator transition and a decrease in DC conductivity with the increase of charge density. In the analysis of AC conductivity, a soft gap is generally observed. Notably, when the DC conductivity approaches zero, the AC conductivity reveals a multi-peak structure, which can be attributed to the Mott and charge-transfer gaps observed experimentally in transition metals. With the increase of DC conductivity, the multi-peak structure gradually reverts to soft-gap behavior or even metallic conductivity. The accuracy of the numerical result is guaranteed by $\sigma(\omega\to 0)=\sigma_{DC}$ and sum rules.

Title: The Plastic Origin of van der Waals material GaGeTe
Authors: Qiao Wang, Ping-An Hu
Abstract: Plastic inorganic semiconductors are promising candidates for high performance stable flexible electronics. Germanium based chalcogenide materials are well known for excellent semiconducting properties, specifically superior carrier mobility. However, these materials typically exhibit inherent brittleness, which in germanium tellurides originates from the intrinsic half bond nature of the metavalent Ge Te bond. Here, we report an ultra high plasticity germanium based chalcogenide of GaGeTe. Bulk GaGeTe can sustain a large engineering strain up to 7.5% without fracture. Through a comprehensive multi scale investigation ranging from macroscopic characterization to atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, we reveal that the exceptional plasticity is due to a synergistic effect of interlayer gliding and intralayer lattice distortion. DFT calculations further elucidate the chemical origin. The existence of Ga atoms avoids the formation of brittle metavalent Ge Te bonds. Instead, a robust honeycomb lattice formed by strong Ga Te, Ge Ge, and Ga Ge bonds preserves high bond strength under large tensile strains in simulations, thereby underpinning the macroscopic plastic behavior. This systematic study on the origin of the plasticity in GaGeTe introduces bond engineering as a potential approach for constructing plastic inorganic semiconductors.

Title: Nonequilibrium Quasiparticle Dynamics in a MoRe-Based Superconducting Resonator under IR Excitation
Authors: O. A. Kalenyuk, S. I. Futimsky, I. A. Martynenko, A. P. Shapovalov, O. O. Boliasova, V. I. Shnyrkov, A. L. Kasatkin, A. A. Kordyuk
Abstract: The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.

Title: Robust and tunable Floquet altermagnets in sliding A-type antiferromagnetic bilayers
Authors: Zhe Li, Lijuan Li, Mengxue Guan, Sheng Meng
Abstract: Arranging the stacking orders of A-type antiferromagnetic (A-AFM) bilayers offers a practical pathway to realizing two-dimensional altermagnets. Previous proposals, however, rely on stringent symmetry constraints, including layer groups and stacking registries. In this work, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light (CPL) irradiation breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling altermagnetism without these restrictions. Our comprehensive symmetry analysis reveals that inversionsymmetric A-AFM bilayer building blocks can host altermagnetism that is robust against stacking slides and variations in illumination direction, with rich and continuously tunable symmetry representations. Using bilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as a case study, we show that out-of-plane CPL stabilizes distinct $f$-wave or $p$-wave altermagnetic states in forward stacking, while reverse stacking manifests an even-odd parity conversion of altermagnetism based upon specific sliding configurations. These revealments broaden the scope of altermagnet design in inversion-symmetric A-AFM bilayers and establish CPL as a versatile control knob for engineering altermagnetic symmetries.

Title: Interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling and the origin of the peak-dip-hump structure in the anti-nodal spectrum of high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors
Authors: Xinyue Liu, Tao Li
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling is believed to be responsible for many spectral anomalies in the cuprate superconductors. In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane has been proposed to be responsible for the dramatic peak-dip-hump(PDH) structure in the anti-nodal spectrum. The recent observation of the exceptional flat quasiparticle dispersion in the anti-nodal region and the sudden suppression of the PDH structure around the pseudogap end point cast doubts on such a scenario. Instead, a scenario involving the coupling to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation seems to resolve both puzzles naturally. Here we present a systematic study on the interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling in the cuprate superconductors. We show that the coupling strength to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction caused by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the $\mathbf{q}\rightarrow 0$ limit as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon coupling at electron momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. Counterintuitively, we find that the same vertex correction enhances the phonon contribution to the PDH structure. We also find that while the coupling to either the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation or the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode can generate a PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum with similar phenomenologies, the sudden suppression of such a structure around the pseudogap end point should be mainly attributed to the dramatic change in the nature of the spin fluctuation at such a critical doping. We suggest to take the PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum as a spectral signature for the emergence of fluctuating local moment in the pseudogap phase and the entrance of a doped Mott insulating state.

Title: Laser-Induced Current Transients in Ultrafast All-Optical Switching of Metallic Spin Valves
Authors: Serban Lepadatu, Mohammed Gija, Alexey Dobrynin, Kevin McNeill, Mark Gubbins, Tim Mercer, Steven M. McCann, Philip Bissell
Abstract: All-optical switching in a ferromagnetic spin valve is studied here using atomistic spin drift-diffusion dynamics, which includes contributions from spin pumping and superdiffusive transport. We find the switching is governed principally by spin-polarized currents due to non-equilibrium hot electrons excited by the laser pulse and re-equilibration currents. In particular, an initial superdiffusive forward flow of electrons, polarized by the free layer, is generated. This drives parallel to antiparallel switching of the free layer through accumulation of minority spins at the reference layer. A diffusive backward flow of electrons, repolarized by the reference layer, follows the initial superdiffusive flow as the charge distribution re-equilibrates. Due to the pulse width-dependent asymmetric amplitudes of the forward and backward transients, the latter can drive antiparallel to parallel switching, and create multi-domain structures at higher laser fluences and longer pulses. The results obtained here are in agreement with experimental observations, providing a framework for self-consistent modelling of all-optical switching in metallic heterostructures.

Title: Spin-dependent quasiparticle lifetimes in altermagnets
Authors: Kristoffer Leraand, Kristian Mæland, Asle Sudbø
Abstract: We investigate many-body effects on the spin-split electron bands in altermagnets by computing the electron self-energy arising from interactions with magnons, phonons, and hybridized magnon-phonon modes. These interactions lead to band broadening, which can obscure the intrinsic spin-splitting in spectroscopic measurements. We consider a $d$-wave Lieb lattice altermagnet as a representative example. Our results reveal that the spin-splitting remains spectroscopically resolvable and provide theoretical estimates of lifetime effects relevant for experimental detection. For electron-magnon coupling, we find a distinct difference between spectral function broadening for up and down spins close to the Fermi surface, which is not present in the case of electron-phonon coupling. We relate it to the spin splitting of the magnon modes in altermagnets. The results, including magneto-elastic coupling, are very similar to the pure magnon case. This provides insights into quasiparticle dynamics in altermagnets and contributes to the broader understanding of many-body interactions in spin-split systems. By including the temperature dependence of the self-energies, we also quantify how thermal fluctuations influence the broadening of the electronic states.

Title: Exploring the Thermodynamic, Elastic, and Optical properties of LaRh2X2 (X = Al, Ga, In) low Tc Superconductors through First-Principles Calculations
Authors: Md. Hasan Shahriar Rifat, Mirza Humaun Kabir Rubel, Md. Borhan Uddin, Apon Kumar Datta, Md. Mijanur Rahaman, Jubair Hossan Abir
Abstract: LaRh2X2 (X = Al, Ga, In) compounds crystallize in a tetragonal layered ThCr2Si2-type structure and belong to a family of low critical temperature superconductors. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations implemented in the CASTEP code, we systematically investigated their structural, mechanical, elastic, electronic, vibrational, thermophysical, and optical properties for the first time. The optimized structural parameters show good agreement with available experimental data. The Born stability criteria and negative formation energies confirm the mechanical and thermodynamic stability of these materials. Poisson and Pugh ratios indicate a ductile nature, while low Debye and melting temperatures together with low Vickers hardness suggest that the compounds are relatively soft. The electronic band structures and density of states reveal metallic behavior. Charge density distribution and Mulliken population analysis indicate mixed covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding. The calculated Fermi surfaces contain both hole-like and electron-like sheets, suggesting possible multiband characteristics. Phonon dispersion analysis confirms the dynamical stability of LaRh2Al2 and LaRh2Ga2, while LaRh2In2 shows dynamical instability associated with a possible structural phase transition. Optical property analysis indicates that these superconductors may be promising candidates for high-density optical data storage applications. The estimated electron-phonon coupling constant of about 0.56 indicates that LaRh2X2 compounds are weakly coupled low critical temperature superconductors.

Title: Nodal Superconductivity of UTe$_2$ Probed by Field-Angle-Resolved Specific Heat on a Crystal with $T_{\rm c}=2.1$ K
Authors: Kaito Totsuka, Yohei Kono, Yusei Shimizu, Ai Nakamura, Atsushi Miyake, Dai Aoki, Yasumasa Tsutsumi, Kazushige Machida, Shunichiro Kittaka
Abstract: Field-angle-resolved specific-heat measurements were performed on a clean single crystal of a spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}=2.1$ K and a low residual electronic specific heat. At low temperatures, the specific heat exhibits a linear dependence on the magnetic field when the field is applied precisely along the $b$ axis, in stark contrast to its rapid increase at low fields for other orientations. This pronounced anisotropy suggests the presence of nodal quasiparticle excitations with the Fermi velocity predominantly aligned along the $b$ axis. Considering the characteristic field-angle dependences of both the specific heat and the upper critical field, these observations are broadly compatible with theoretical models that assume a superconducting gap structure featuring either point nodes consistent with $B_{\rm 2u}$ symmetry, allowed in the infinitely strong spin-orbit coupling scheme, or line nodes confined to flat regions of the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface, consistent with $^3B_{\rm 3u}$ symmetry in the finite spin-orbit classification scheme. These results yield crucial hints for resolving the pairing symmetry of UTe$_2$, paving the way for a deeper understanding of its spin-triplet superconductivity.

Title: Altermagnets versus Antiferromagnets
Authors: V.P.Mineev
Abstract: Altermagnets are metals with a momentum-dependent spin splitting of electron bands due to a specific crystal structure that is invariant under time reversal only in combination with rotations and reflections, or lacks time reversal altogether. The developed phenomenological approach allows one to obtain a spectrum of electron bands in an altermagnet corresponding to an antiferromagnet with the same symmetry. There are considered collinear antiferromagnets, weak ferromagnetic antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnetic structures. It is shown that only a weak ferromagnetic antiferromagnet has a nonzero Berry curvature.

Title: MAD-SURF: a machine learning interatomic potential for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces
Authors: Manuel González Lastre, Joakim S. Jestilä, Rubén Pérez, Adam S. Foster
Abstract: Predicting how organic molecules adsorb, assemble, and interact on metal surfaces is central to surface chemistry and molecular electronics, particularly in the context of interpreting high-resolution scanning probe microscopy. Yet, the application of first-principles simulations to interfaces is hampered by the computational cost for evaluating the electronic structure for the large number of atoms typically involved. We hereby present MAD-SURF, a machine learning interatomic potential specifically tailored for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces. Trained on a broad dataset spanning diverse molecules, adsorption motifs, surfaces, molecular dynamics trajectories and non-covalent aggregates, MAD-SURF achieves accuracy comparable to the underlying DFT reference while enabling simulations orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. The model reliably reproduces energies, forces and adsorption geometries across the three coinage metal substrates. We demonstrate its capabilities on experimentally characterized systems, including organic monolayers, polycyclic aggregates, flexible biomolecules and the long-range herringbone reconstruction of gold. By merging accuracy, speed, and generalizability, MAD-SURF offers a practical framework for accelerating atomistic simulations and advancing data-driven workflows in surface science.

Title: Bosonic phases across the superconductor-insulator transition in infinite-layer samarium nickelate

Abstract: Superconductivity arises from the global phase coherence of Cooper pairs. Modulation of phase coherence leads to quantum phase transitions, serving as an important tool for studying unconventional superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate bosonic phases across the superconductor-insulator transition in infinite-layer nickelate superconducting films by the control of spatially periodic network patterns. Magnetoresistance oscillations with a periodicity of h/2e provide direct evidence of 2e Cooper pairing in nickelates. The phase transition is predominantly driven by enhanced superconducting fluctuations, and Cooper pairs are involved in charge transport across the transition. Notably, we observe two types of anomalous metallic phases, emerging respectively at finite magnetic fields and down to zero magnetic field. They can be characterized by bosonic excitations, suggesting the dynamic roles of vortices in the ground states. Our work establishes nickelates as a key platform for investigating the rich landscape of bosonic phases controlled via the phase coherence of Cooper pairs.

Authors: Maria Chiara Angelini, Saverio Palazzi, Giorgio Parisi, Tommaso Rizzo
Abstract: We compute the critical exponents of the zero-temperature spin glass transition in a field on a one-dimensional long-range model, a proxy for higher-dimensional systems. Our approach is based on a novel loop expansion within the Bethe $M$-layer formalism, whose adaptation to this specific case is detailed here. The resulting estimates provide crucial benchmarks for numerical simulations that can access larger system sizes in one dimension, thus offering a key test of the theory of spin glasses in a field.

Title: The Entropies
Authors: Roumen Tsekov
Abstract: Entropy is critically examined as a fundamental concept in contemporary science and informatics. Although the typical Shannon entropy provides a proper framework for describing the canonical ensemble, it fails to represent adequately the microcanonical ensemble. This discrepancy manifests additionally in its inability to support a theoretical derivation of the Second Law of thermodynamics.

Title: Stress-Induced Ferroelectricity in Hafnium Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles
Authors: Anna N. Morozovska, Eugene A. Eliseev, Richard (Yu)Liu, Sergei V. Kalinin, Dean R. Evans
Abstract: In contrast to hafnium oxide (HfO2) thin films, where the appearance of switchable ferroelectric polarization can be induced by strain engineering, reliable methods for controlling ferroelectricity are absent in HfO2 nanoparticles. Direct experimental observations of ferroelectric hysteresis and/or ferroelectric domains in the nanoparticles are absent too. To the best of our knowledge, the possibility of stress-induced ferroelectric states in the HfO2 nanoparticles was not explored. In this work, we study the influence of chemical stress on phase diagrams, dielectric and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional that includes higher-order contributions together with trilinear and biquadratic couplings involving polar, antipolar, and nonpolar order parameters. The ferroelectric phase exhibits reentrant behavior as a function of nanoparticle size, such that the spontaneous polarization exists only within a limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min<R_c<R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is primarily determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects; the maximal critical radius R_cr^max is primarily determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Thus, this work identifies a stress-driven mechanism for reentrant ferroelectricity stabilization in nanoscale hafnia-zirconia, arising from the competition between depolarization field-induced suppression of ferroelectricity and its support by shell-induced chemical stress.

Title: Entropy Has No Direction: A Mirror-State Paradox Against Universal Monotonic Entropy Increase and a First-Principles Proof that Constraints Reshape the Entropy Distribution $P_{\infty}(S;λ)$
Authors: Ting Peng
Abstract: We present a purely theoretical, self-contained argument that the Second Law of Thermodynamics cannot be a universal fundamental law in the form ``entropy does not decrease'' (whether asserted trajectory-wise or as a universal statistical principle) when the underlying microscopic dynamics are time-reversal invariant. The core is a mirror-state construction: for any microstate $A$ one constructs its time-reversed partner $B$ (momenta inverted). If a universal monotonicity statement is applied to both $A$ and $B$, it implies that $A$ is a local minimum of entropy at every moment, which forces entropy to be constant and destroys any entropic arrow of time. The consistent replacement is that entropy is a stochastic variable described by a probability distribution $P(S)$, whose shape depends on constraints and boundary conditions. We then prove from first principles that constraints necessarily reshape the long-time entropy distribution $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$ by altering the invariant measure through changes in the Hamiltonian and/or the accessible phase space. A sharp criterion is given: in the microcanonical setting, the \emph{only} way $P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda)$ can remain the same up to translation is when all accessible macrostate volumes are scaled by a common factor; otherwise the distribution changes structurally. Recent experimental work validates this framework: asymmetric constraints enable spontaneous low-entropy transitions, allowing systems to produce useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir. With both theoretical and experimental barriers overcome, practical devices based on constraint-reshaped entropy distributions become feasible, with profound implications for energy generation and the long-term sustainability of civilization.

Title: Entropy production reveals hidden dynamical constraints rather than stochastic disorder

Abstract: Entropy production is often interpreted as a proxy for microscopic disorder or environmental roughness in stochastic systems. We test this interpretation using controlled simulations of overdamped stochastic dynamics on curved surfaces in which local noise, geometry, and forces are held fixed while global constraints are varied. Trajectories are generated for particles evolving toward a central attractor, and entropy production is quantified using both a continuum probability-current estimator and coarse-grained Markov transition statistics across multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. Across systematic sweeps of timestep size, domain extent, and boundary topology, entropy production is governed primarily by constraint-induced probability flow rather than local stochastic variability. Periodic domains that permit sustained circulation yield substantially higher entropy production than reflecting domains despite identical local stochastic structure, with the magnitude of the separation depending on domain extent. In contrast, coarse-grained estimates decrease as temporal resolution increases and rise with finer spatial binning, demonstrating that discrete estimates depend strongly on observation scale and may fail to resolve topology-induced irreversible structure. Ergo, entropy production is not a direct measure of environmental roughness or randomness. Instead, it quantifies how strongly system dynamics are driven away from reversibility by global constraints, geometry, and the space of allowed trajectories. Interpreted in this way, entropy production maps function as diagnostics of organized probability flow and provide a principled method for detecting hidden dynamical constraints from trajectory data alone.

Title: Melting Coulomb clusters through nonreciprocity-enhanced parametric pumping
Authors: Zhicheng Shu, Wei-Chih Li, Wentao Yu, Justin C. Burton
Abstract: Complex systems out of equilibrium often experience intermittent oscillations between quiescent and highly dynamic states. The type of intermittency depends on how energy is pumped into the system, and how it is dissipated. While intermittency is usually driven by stochastic noise or external forcing, energy can also be sourced from field-mediated interactions between particles, which are often nonreciprocal and effectively violate Newton's 3rd law. Here we demonstrate how nonreciprocal interactions produce intermittency in clusters of charged micron-sized particles confined in a plasma sheath. Through three-dimensional particle tracking, we observe that vertical oscillations, induced by fluctuations of the plasma environment, can be parametrically coupled to the horizontal modes. Experiments and simulations show that nonreciprocal interactions strongly amplify this parametric coupling, creating a positive feedback loop that drives explosive growth of both the horizontal and vertical modes. This mechanism triggers abrupt melting transitions from an ordered cluster to an ergodic gas-like state, and leads to intermittent switching between states over long time scales. Overall, our work identifies nonreciprocal interactions as a key mechanism through which strongly coupled finite systems transform interaction-mediated activity into dynamical nonequilibrium states.

Title: Multi-Method Li Plating Characterization of a Commercial 26 Ah Li-Ion Pouch-Cell

Abstract: Lithium (Li) plating on graphite is a significant degradation mechanism in Li-ion batteries. While numerous experimental techniques have been used to study Li plating in laboratory cells, investigations of commercial high-energy cells often rely on electrochemical methods. Here we present and classify various methods for detecting Li plating on a commercial A123 pouch cell. In a round robin study across multiple battery research laboratories, Li-plated graphitic electrode material was analyzed using electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic methods capable of detecting metallic Li deposits. After cell opening, their overall distribution on the anode surface was examined using a flatbed scanner to ensure comparability of the samples. Optical and electron microscopy provided detailed surface and, in combination with a focused ion beam, subsurface structure and morphology. Spectroscopic methods confirmed the presence and onset of plated Li with varying sensitivity. Moreover, spectroscopic and imaging techniques were combined correlatively where possible. Availability and measurement duration of each technique was compared. Optical methods are fast and easy to use; thus, they are recommended for most samples, with spectroscopic confirmation reserved for reference samples. This multimodal study demonstrates a range of methods that can be used alone or in combination to qualitatively or quantitatively detect Li-plating.

Title: A gradient flow perspective on McKean-Vlasov equations in econophysics
Authors: David W. Cohen
Abstract: We prove that the Gini coefficient of economic inequality is a Lyapunov functional for a class of nonlinear, nonlocal integro-differential equations arising at the intersection of mathematics, economics, and statistical physics. Next, a novel Riemannian geometry is imposed on a subset of probability densities such that the evolutionary dynamics are formally driven by the Gini coefficient functional as a gradient flow. Thus in the same way that classical 2-Wasserstein theory connects heat flow and the Second Law of Thermodynamics by way of Boltzmann entropy, the work here gives rise to a principle of econophysics that is much of the same flavor but for the Gini coefficient. The noncanonical Onsager operators associated to the metric tensors are derived and some transport inequalities proven. The new metric relates to the dual norm of a second-order Sobolev-like factor space, in a similar way to how the classical 2-Wasserstein metric linearizes as the dual norm of a first-order, homogeneous Sobolev space.

Title: Expediting quantum state transfer through the long-range extended XY model
Authors: Sejal Ahuja, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: Going beyond short-range interactions, we explore the role of long-range interactions in the extended XY model for transferring quantum states through evolution. In particular, employing a spin-1/2 chain with interactions decaying as a power law, we demonstrate that long-range (LR) interactions significantly enhance the efficiency of a quantum state transfer (QST) protocol, improving the achievable fidelity, mitigating its slow decline as compared with the nearest-neighbor setting, associated with increasing system-size. Our study identifies the LR regime as providing an optimal balance between interaction range and transfer efficiency, outperforming the protocol with the short-range interacting model. Our detailed analysis reveals the impact of system parameters, such as anisotropy, magnetic field strength, and coordination number, on QST dynamics. Specifically, we find that intermediate coordination numbers lead to a faster and more reliable state transfer, while extreme values diminish performance. Furthermore, we exhibit that the presence of LR interactions considerably reduces the minimum time required to achieve fidelity beyond the classical limit.

Title: Co-Evolution-Based Metal-Binding Residue Prediction with Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Sayedmohammadreza Rastegari, Sina Tabakhi, Xianyuan Liu, Tianyi Jiang, Wei Sang, Haiping Lu
Abstract: Understanding protein-metal interactions is central to structural biology, with metal ions being vital for catalysis, stability, and signal transduction. Predicting metal-binding residues and metal types remains challenging due to the structural and evolutionary complexity of proteins. Conventional sequence- and structure-based methods often fail to capture co-evolutionary constraints that reflect how residues evolve together to maintain metal-binding functionality. Recent co-evolution-based methods capture part of this information, but still underutilize the complete co-evolved residue network. To address this limitation, we introduce the Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network (MBGNN), which leverages the complete co-evolved residue network to better capture complex dependencies within protein structures. Experimental results show that MBGNN substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art co-evolution-based method MetalNet2, achieving F1 score improvements of 2.5% for binding residue identification and 3.3% for metal type classification on the MetalNet2 dataset. Its superiority is further demonstrated on both the MetalNet2 and MIonSite datasets, where it outperforms two co-evolution-based and two sequence-based methods, achieving the highest mean F1 scores across both prediction tasks. These findings highlight how integrating co-evolutionary residue networks with graph-based learning advances our ability to decode protein-metal interactions, thereby facilitating functional annotation and rational metalloprotein design.

Title: Nonstabilizerness generation in a multiparticle quantum walk
Authors: Cătălin Paşcu Moca, Doru Sticlet, Balázs Dóra, Angelo Valli, Dominik Szombathy, Gergely Zaránd
Abstract: We investigate the generation of non-stabilizerness, or magic, in a multi-particle quantum walk by analyzing the time evolution of the stabilizer Rényi entropy $M_2$. Our study considers both single- and two-particle quantum walks in the framework of the XXZ Heisenberg model with varying interaction strengths. We demonstrate that the spread of magic follows the light-cone structure dictated by the system's dynamics, with distinct behaviors emerging in the easy-plane ($\Delta < 1$) and easy-axis ($\Delta > 1$) regimes. For $\Delta < 1$, magic generation is primarily governed by single-particle dynamics, while for $\Delta > 1$, doublon propagation dominates, resulting in a significantly slower growth of $M_2$. Furthermore, the magic exhibits logarithmic growth in time for both one and two-particle dynamics. Additionally, by examining the Pauli spectrum, we show that the statistical distribution of level spacings exhibits Poissonian behavior, independent of interaction strength or particle number. Our results shed light on the role of interactions on magic generation in a many-body system.

Title: Exact analysis of AC sensors based on Floquet time crystals
Authors: Andrei Tsypilnikov, Matheus Fibger, Fernando Iemini
Abstract: We discuss the behavior of general Floquet time crystals (FTCs), including prethermal ones, in closed systems acting as AC sensors. We provide an analytical treatment of their quantum Fisher information (QFI) dynamics, which characterizes the ultimate sensor accuracy. By tuning the direction and frequency of the AC field, we show how to induce transitions resonantly between macroscopic paired cat states in the FTC sensor. This allows for robust Heisenberg scaling precision (QFI $\sim N^2 t^2$) for exponentially long times in the system size. The QFI dynamics exhibit, moreover, a characteristic step-like structure in time due to the eventual dephasing along the cat subspaces. The behavior is discussed for various initial sensor preparations, including ground states and low- and high-correlated states. Furthermore, we examine the performance of the sensor along the FTC phase transition, with the QFI capturing its critical exponents. Our findings are presented for both linear and nonlinear response regimes and illustrated for a specific FTC based on the long-range interacting LMG model.

Title: TasVisAn and InsPy -- Python Packages for Triple-Axis Spectrometer Data Visualization, Analysis, Instrument Resolution Calculation, and Convolution
Authors: Guochu Deng, Garry J. McIntyre
Abstract: Experimental data collected from a triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) are typically analysed by considering the instrument resolution, as the resolution of a TAS instrument is often complex and significantly influences the measured results. Two Python packages, TasVisAn and InsPy, have been developed to visualize and analyse data from TAS instruments - particularly from the cold-neutron TAS Sika and the thermal-neutron TAS Taipan at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. TasVisAn offers a range of functions, including data importing, reduction, plotting, contour mapping, convolution fitting, and more, for data collected on TAS instruments, especially on Sika and Taipan. It also supports data reduction of the current trendy multi-analyser and multiplexing TAS instruments, including the multiplexing mode of Sika. Besides, it includes scan simulation and batch file validation tools for both Taipan and Sika, assisting users in designing and planning experiments in advance. InsPy is a general-purpose Python package designed to calculate the four-dimensional (4D) instrument resolution in momentum-energy space for any TAS instrument. Combined with InsPy, TasVisAn supports both instrument resolution calculation and resolution-convoluted data fitting. Its flexible external data import feature further allows TasVisAn to be adapted for the visualization and convolution analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data across various TAS instruments.

Title: Topological Magneto-optical Kerr Effect without Spin-orbit Coupling in Spin-compensated Antiferromagnet
Authors: Camron Farhang, Weihang Lu, Kai Du, Yunpeng Gao, Junjie Yang, Sang-Wook Cheong, Jing Xia
Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the differential reflection of oppositely circularly polarized light, has traditionally been associated with relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which links a particle's spin with its orbital motion. In ferromagnets, large MOKE signals arise from the combination of magnetization and SOC, while in certain coplanar antiferromagnets, SOC-induced Berry curvature enables MOKE despite zero net magnetization. Theoretically, large MOKE can also arise in a broader class of magnetic materials with compensated spins, without relying on SOC - for example, in systems exhibiting real-space scalar spin chirality. The experimental verification has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such a SOC- and magnetization-free MOKE in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2. Using a Sagnac interferometer microscope, we image domains of scalar spin chirality and their reversal. Our findings establish experimentally a new mechanism for generating large MOKE signals and position chiral spin textures in compensated magnets as a compelling platform for ultrafast, stray-field-immune opto-spintronic applications.

Title: Identification and properties of topological states in the bulk of quasicrystals
Authors: Frode Balling-Ansø, Jeppe Lykke Krogh, Ella Elisabeth Lassen, Anne E. B. Nielsen
Abstract: In contrast to the usual bulk-boundary correspondence, topological states localized within the bulk of the system have been numerically identified in quasicrystalline structures, termed bulk localized transport (BLT) states. These states exhibit properties different from edge states, one example being that the number of BLT states scales with system size, while the number of edge states scales with system perimeter. Here, we define a procedure to identify BLT states, which is based on the physically motivated crosshair marker and robustness analyses. Applying the procedure to the Hofstadter model on the Ammann-Beenker tiling, we find that the BLT states appear mainly for magnetic fluxes within a specific interval. While edge states appear at low densities of states, we find that BLT states can appear at many different densities of states. Many of the BLT states are found to have real-space localization that follows geometric patterns characteristic of the given quasicrystal. Furthermore, BLT states can appear both isolated and in groups within the energy spectrum which could imply greater robustness for the states within such groups. The spatial localization of the states within a certain group can change depending on the Fermi energy.

Title: Quasiprobability Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation
Authors: Kohei Yoshimura, Ryusuke Hamazaki
Abstract: We derive a quantum extension of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation where dynamical fluctuations are quantified by the Terletsky-Margenau-Hill quasiprobability, a quantum generalization of the classical joint probability. The obtained inequality plays a complementary role to existing quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations, focusing on observables' change rather than exchange of charges through jumps and respecting initial coherence. Quasiprobabilities show anomalous behaviors that are forbidden in classical systems, such as negativity; we reveal that negativity or a non-classically enhanced escape rate is necessary to increase an output-to-dissipation ratio beyond classical limitations and show that the requirements are basis-independent and stronger than quantum coherence. To illustrate these statements, we employ a model that can exhibit a dissipationless heat current, which would be prohibited in classical systems; we construct a state that has much coherence but does not lead to a dissipationless current due to the absence of anomalous behaviors in quasiprobabilities.

Title: Theoretical investigations of tetrameric magnetic molecules for sub-kelvin cooling
Authors: D. Westerbeck, J. Schnack (Bielefeld University)
Abstract: Magnetic molecules are a class of compounds that is also investigated in view of their magnetocaloric properties. The isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change are key figures of merit for magnetocaloric performance. Here, we investigate spin systems of realistic molecular structures comprising four spins. In view of potentially large spin quantum numbers as for gadolinium we model these spin systems by a combination of Heisenberg and dipolar spin-spin interactions. It turns out that a tetrahedral structure with ferromagnetic exchange interactions yields the best figures of merit.

Title: Enabling full localization of qubits and gates with a multi-mode coupler
Authors: Zhongyi Jiang, Simon Geisert, Sören Ihssen, Ioan M. Pop, Mohammad H. Ansari
Abstract: Tunable couplers are a key building block of superconducting quantum processors, enabling high on-off ratios for two-qubit entangling interactions. While qubit-qubit interaction can be turned off, residual wavefunctions delocalize single-qubit excitations over the device, yielding weak effective couplings that manifest as unintended crosstalk. Moreover, conventional single-mode couplers lack independent control over interactions in the one- and two-excitation manifolds, leading to unitary errors such as leakage during gate operations. Here, we propose a multi-mode tunable coupler that enforces complete localization, yielding near-perfect qubit isolation at the decoupled point. We further show that the additional degrees of freedom in the coupler enable independent and nonlinear control of effective interactions across distinct excitation manifolds, with large on-off ratios. This architecture provides a new route toward the next generation of couplers for scalable and high-fidelity gate operations in superconducting quantum processors.

Title: Inhomogeneous SSH models and the doubling of orthogonal polynomials
Authors: Nicolas Crampé, Quentin Labriet, Lucia Morey, Gilles Parez, Luc Vinet
Abstract: We analyze Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models using the doubling method for orthogonal polynomial sequences. This approach yields the analytical spectrum and exact eigenstates of the models. We demonstrate that the standard SSH model is associated with the doubling of Chebyshev polynomials. Extending this technique to the doubling of other finite sequences enables the construction of Hamiltonians for inhomogeneous SSH models which are exactly solvable. We detail the specific cases associated with Krawtchouk and $q$-Racah polynomials. This work highlights the utility of polynomial-doubling techniques in obtaining exact solutions for physical models.

Title: Quantum Brownian motion with non-Gaussian noises: Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation and nonlinear Langevin equation
Authors: Hing-Tong Cho, Bei-Lok Hu
Abstract: Building upon the work of Hu, Paz, and Zhang [1,2] on open quantum systems we consider the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model with one oscillator (position variable $x$) as the system, {\it nonlinearly} coupled to an environment of $N$ harmonic oscillators (with mass $m_n$, natural frequency $\omega_n$, position $q_n$ and momentum $p_n$ variables) in the form $\sum_{n}\left(v_{n1}(x)q_{n}^{k}+v_{n2}(x)p_{n}^{l}\right)$ where $k, l$ are integers (the present work only considers the $k=l=2$ cases). The vertex functions $v_{n1}, v_{n2} $ are of the form $v_{n1}=\lambda C_{n1} f(x), v_{n2}(x)=-\lambda\,C_{n2}m_{n}^{-2}\omega_{n}^{-2}f(x)$ where $C_{n1,2}$ are the coupling constants with the $n$th oscillator, $f(x)$ is any arbitrary function of $x$, and $\lambda$ is a dimensionless constant. Employing the closed-time-path formalism the influence action $S_{IF}$ is calculated using a perturbative expansion in $\lambda$. It is possible to identify the terms in $S_{IF}$ quadratic or higher in $\Delta(s)\equiv f(x_{+}(s))-f(x_{-}(s))$ to constitute the noise kernel, while terms linear in $\Delta$ to that of the dissipation kernel. The non-Gaussian noise kernel gives rise to non-zero three-point correlation function of the corresponding stochastic force. The pathway presented here should be useful for the exploration of \textit{non-Gaussian properties of systems nonlinearly coupled with their environments}; examples in early universe cosmology and in quantum optomechanics (QOM) are mentioned. A modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) is also established, which ensures the consistency of the model and the accuracy of results even at higher perturbative orders. Another result of significance is the derivation of a nonlinear Langevin equation which is expected to be useful for many open quantum system applications.
