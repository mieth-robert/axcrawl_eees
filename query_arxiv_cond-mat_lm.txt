Title: Phase Diagrams Construction Using Mean-Field Renormalization and Neural Network Fitting
Authors: Esteban Bedoya Rodriguez, Leon Escobar Diaz, Sebastian Trujillo Hernandez
Abstract: Employing the mean-field renormalization group (MFRG) method, we analyzed the $Fe_p Mn_{0.6-p}Al_{0.4}$ and $Fe_{p}Al_{1-p}$ alloys, incorporating second-neighbor interactions in the latter for the first time within this framework. Our analysis utilized neural network fitting, yielding promising results in both the phase diagram adjustments and the estimation of bond energies.

Title: A geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4
Authors: Nadine Suzan Cetin, Michal Pavelka, Emil Varga
Abstract: A standard description of superfluid helim-4 is based on the concept of two components (superfluid and normal), which leads to the so called two-fluid models. However, as there are no two kinds of atoms in helium-4, the two components can not be separated. Superfluid helium-4 is not a mixture of two components, being rather a single fluid with two motions. Here, we present a geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4, which is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of fluid mechanics. The model is derived from the kinetic theory of excitations and average particle motions. It can be simplified to the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) two-fluid model, where it removes one fitting parameter from the HVBK model, but it also gives extra terms beyond HVBK. Actually, we show that the two-fluid models are problematic in case of higher normal velocities, where the splitting of total momentum to the superfluid and normal component becomes impossible. Finally, we show how vortex line density may be added to the state variables. The one-component model can be seen as a generalization of the two-fluid models that is geometrically consistent, fully compressible, with non-zero superfluid vorticity, and compatible with classical experiments.

Title: Quantized Spin-Hall Conductivity in Altermagnet Fe$_2$Te$_2$O with Mirror-Spin Coupling
Authors: Run-Wu Zhang, Chaoxi Cui, Yang Wang, Jingyi Duan, Zhi-Ming Yu, Yugui Yao
Abstract: Due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC), crucial for the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, a quantized spin-Hall conductivity has not yet been reported in QSH insulators and other realistic materials. Here, we tackle this challenge by predicting robust quantized spin-Hall conductivity in monolayer Fe$_2$Te$_2$O. The underlying physics originates from the unrecognized mirror-spin coupling (MSC), which couples spin-up and spin-down states into two orthogonal mirror eigenstates. We show that the MSC can naturally emerge in the two-dimensional altermagnets with out-of-plane Néel vector and horizontal mirror. A remarkable consequence of the MSC is that it can dramatically weaken the spin hybridization of the altermagnetic materials when SOC is included. When SOC is neglected, Fe$_2$Te$_2$O is an altermagnetic Weyl semimetal with MSC. With SOC, it evolves into the first material candidate for magnetic mirror Chern insulator. Remarkably, under the protection of MSC, the spin hybridization of both bulk and topological edge states in Fe$_2$Te$_2$O with SOC at low energy is negligible. As a consequence, a quantized spin-Hall conductivity emerges within the bulk band gap of the system. By unveiling a novel effect, our findings represent a significant advancement in spin Hall transport, and broaden the material candidates hosting intriguing altermagnetic phenomena.

Title: 3D Multiphase Heterogeneous Microstructure Generation Using Conditional Latent Diffusion Models
Authors: Nirmal Baishnab, Ethan Herron, Aditya Balu, Soumik Sarkar, Adarsh Krishnamurthy, Baskar Ganapathysubramanian
Abstract: The ability to generate 3D multiphase microstructures on-demand with targeted attributes can greatly accelerate the design of advanced materials. Here, we present a conditional latent diffusion model (LDM) framework that rapidly synthesizes high-fidelity 3D multiphase microstructures tailored to user specifications. Using this approach, we generate diverse two-phase and three-phase microstructures at high resolution (volumes of $128 \times 128 \times 64$ voxels, representing $>10^6$ voxels each) within seconds, overcoming the scalability and time limitations of traditional simulation-based methods. Key design features, such as desired volume fractions and tortuosities, are incorporated as controllable inputs to guide the generative process, ensuring that the output structures meet prescribed statistical and topological targets. Moreover, the framework predicts corresponding manufacturing (processing) parameters for each generated microstructure, helping to bridge the gap between digital microstructure design and experimental fabrication. While demonstrated on organic photovoltaic (OPV) active-layer morphologies, the flexible architecture of our approach makes it readily adaptable to other material systems and microstructure datasets. By combining computational efficiency, adaptability, and experimental relevance, this framework addresses major limitations of existing methods and offers a powerful tool for accelerated materials discovery.

Title: Direction-dependent linear response for gapped nodal-line semimetals in planar-Hall configurations
Authors: Fasil Hussain Rather, Muhammed Jaffar A., Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity for ideal nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs), with a finite but tiny mass-gap, in distinct planar-Hall set-ups. Each differing configuration results from the relative orientation of the nodal-ring's plane with respect to the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields. Our results feature the signatures of the inherent topology of a gapped NLSM, revealed through nonzero values of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. In particular, we show that both of these vector fields, arising in the momentum space, give rise to terms of comparable magnitudes in the resulting response. Our explicit theoretical expressions will help identify unique signatures of NLSMs in contemporary experiments.

Title: Single-gate tracking behavior in flat-band multilayer graphene devices
Authors: Kryštof Kolář, Dacen Waters, Joshua Folk, Matthew Yankowitz, Cyprian Lewandowski
Abstract: A central feature of many van der Waals (vdW) materials is the ability to precisely control their charge doping, $n$, and electric displacement field, $D$, using top and bottom gates. For devices composed of only a few layers, it is commonly assumed that $D$ causes the layer-by-layer potential to drop linearly across the structure. Here, we show that this assumption fails for a broad class of crystalline and moiré vdW structures based on Bernal- or rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene. We find that the electronic properties at the Fermi level are largely dictated by special layer-polarized states arising at Bernal-stacked crystal faces, which typically coexist in the same band with layer-delocalized states. We uncover a novel mechanism by which the layer-delocalized states completely screen the layer-polarized states from the bias applied to the remote gate. This screening mechanism leads to an unusual scenario where voltages on either gate dope the band as expected, yet the band dispersion and associated electronic properties remain primarily (and sometimes exclusively) governed by the gate closer to the layer-polarized states. Our results reveal a novel electronic mechanism underlying the atypical single-gate-controlled transport characteristics observed across many flat-band graphitic structures, and provide key theoretical insights essential for accurately modeling these systems.

Title: A continuously-cooled 3He/4He phase separation refrigerator
Authors: P.H. Kim, M. Hirschel, J. Suranyi, J.P. Davis
Abstract: We present a novel cooling method that uses the phase separation and evaporative cooling of 3He to reach and continuously maintain sub-kelvin temperatures. While less complex than a dilution refrigerator, the system performs similarly to a continuous 3He cryostat but with a simpler design, a more efficient cooldown process, and a significantly smaller 3He requirement. Our prototype demonstrated a base temperature of 585 mK and 3 mW cooling power at 700 mK using just two gaseous liters of 3He. Lower temperatures could be expected in systems with improved heat exchangers and pumping efficiency.

Title: Coherent control through phonon anharmonicity
Authors: Gili Scharf, Tomer Hasharoni, Lara Donval, Leah Ben Gur, Alon Ron
Abstract: Anharmonic lattice vibrations play a key role in many physical phenomena. They govern the heat conductivity of solids, strongly affect the phonon spectra, play a prominent role in soft mode phase transitions, allow ultrafast engineering of material properties and more. The most direct evidence for anharmonicity is to measure the oscillation frequency changing as a function of the oscillation amplitude. For lattice vibrations, this is not a trivial task, and anharmonicity is probed indirectly through its effects on thermodynamic properties and spectral features or through coherent decay of one mode to another. However, measurement of the anharmonicity of a single Raman mode is still lacking. We show that ultrafast double pump-probe spectroscopy could be used to directly observe frequency shifts of Raman phonons as a function of the oscillation amplitude and disentangle the coherent contributions from quasi-harmonic sources such as temperature and changes to the carrier density in the thermoelectric materials SnTe and SnSe. Our results have dramatic implications for the material engineering of future thermoelectrics. Moreover, our methodology could be used to isolate the basic mechanisms driving optically induced phase transitions and other nonlinear phenomena based on their unique timestamps.

Title: Solving the SU($N$) Orbital Hatsugai-Komoto Model
Authors: Nico A. Hackner, Peizhi Mai, Philip W. Phillips
Abstract: We show that the physics of the SU($N$) Hubbard model can be realistically simulated with the recent advance of the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. In this approach, the momentum mixing absent from the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto model is included by grouping $n-$Hubbard atoms into a cluster. We take advantage of the rapid convergence of this scheme ($1/n^2$) and show that for $n\approx O(10)$, quantitative agreement with determinantal quantum Monte Carlo arises for the double occupancy and the compressibility across the Mott transition, as well as the spin structure factor in the Mott insulating state. Additional features of this work are that we can obtain low-temperature physics, which could be qualitatively different from its high-temperature counterpart, and dynamical quantities without resorting to analytical continuation, thereby establishing a clear advantage of the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model over quantum Monte Carlo methodology in the study of strong correlations.

Title: Quantum teleportation between simulated binary black holes
Authors: Aiden Daniel, Tanmay Bhore, Jiannis K. Pachos, Chang Liu, Andrew Hallam
Abstract: The quantum description of a black hole predicts that quantum information hidden behind the event horizon can be teleported outside almost instantaneously. In this work, we demonstrate that a chiral spin-chain model, which naturally simulates a binary black hole system, can realise this teleportation process. Our system captures two essential components of this protocol: Hawking radiation, which generates the necessary entanglement between the black holes, and optimal scrambling, which enables high-fidelity teleportation on short timescales. Through numerical simulations, we quantify the key timescales governing the process, including the Page time, radiation time, scrambling time, and butterfly velocity, showing their universal dependence on the chiral coupling strength. Our results establish the feasibility of simulating quantum properties of black holes within condensed matter systems, offering an experimentally accessible platform for probing otherwise inaccessible high-energy phenomena.

Title: Symmetry classification correspondence between quadratic Lindbladians and their steady states
Authors: Liang Mao, Fan Yang
Abstract: Symmetry classification is crucial in understanding universal properties of quantum matter. Recently, the scope of symmetry classification has been extended to open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. However, the classification of Lindbladians and steady states remains largely separate. Because the former requires the non-Hermitian classification framework, while the latter relies on the classification scheme for Hermitian matrices. In this paper we build connections between symmetry classes of quadratic Lindbladian and its steady state, despite their different classification frameworks. We classify the full matrix representation of generic quadratic Lindbladians with particle conservation, showing they fall into 27 non-Hermitian symmetry classes. Among these, 22 classes lead to an infinite-temperature steady state. The remaining five classes have one-to-one correspondence with five steady-state Hermitian symmetry classes. Numerical simulations of random Lindbladian dynamics confirm the convergence to the correct steady-state symmetry classes at long time.

Title: Finding Hidden Numbers with Majorana-based Topological Quantum Algorithms: Simulation of the Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm
Authors: Jasmin Bedow, Dirk K. Morr
Abstract: Executing quantum algorithms using Majorana zero modes - a major milestone for the field of topological quantum computing - requires a platform that can be scaled to large quantum registers, can be controlled in real time and space, and a braiding protocol that uses the unique properties of these exotic particles. Here, we demonstrate the first successful simulation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm in two-dimensional magnet-superconductor hybrid structures from initialization to read-out of the final many-body state. Utilizing the Majorana zero modes' topological properties, we introduce an optimized braiding protocol for the algorithm and a scalable architecture for its implementation with an arbitrary number of qubits. We visualize the algorithm protocol in real time and space by computing the non-equilibrium density of states, which is proportional to the time-dependent differential conductance, and the non-equilibrium charge density, which assigns a unique signature to each final state of the algorithm.

Title: Core Energies in Isolated Edge and Mixed Dislocations in BCC Fe from First-principles Energy Density Method
Authors: Yang Dan, Dallas R. Trinkle
Abstract: We use first-principles spin-polarized energy density method (EDM) to calculate the atomic energies in isolated $a_0[100](010)$ edge, $a_0[100](011)$ edge, $\frac{a_0}{2}[\bar1\bar11](1\bar10)$ edge and $\frac{a_0}{2}[111](1\bar10)$ $71^\circ$ mixed dislocations in body-centered cubic (BCC) Fe. The distribution of atomic energies shows the energetic effects of slip, including non-linear displacements in and near the core, and the elastic field further away. The EDM atomic energies agree well with anisotropic elasticity predictions in the elastic region, while they deviate in the core region due to failure of linear elasticity, and the energy deviation quantifies the core widths. Dislocation line energies are obtained by partial sums of the atomic energies within distance $r$ of the dislocation center; the core energy is extracted from the large $r$ behavior. We compare our results with an EAM and a GAP potential, showing that while both potentials produce core structures similar to DFT predictions, the GAP potential has a closer match with DFT and EDM in core energies.

Title: Coherence of a hole spin flopping-mode qubit in a circuit quantum electrodynamics environment
Authors: Léo Noirot, Cécile X. Yu, José C. Abadillo-Uriel, Étienne Dumur, Heimanu Niebojewski, Benoit Bertrand, Romain Maurand, Simon Zihlmann
Abstract: The entanglement of microwave photons and spin qubits in silicon represents a pivotal step forward for quantum information processing utilizing semiconductor quantum dots. Such hybrid spin circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has been achieved by granting a substantial electric dipole moment to a spin by de-localizing it in a double quantum dot under spin-orbit interaction, thereby forming a flopping-mode (FM) spin qubit. Despite its promise, the coherence properties demonstrated to date remain insufficient to envision FM spin qubits as practical single qubits. Here, we present a FM hole spin qubit in a silicon nanowire coupled to a high-impedance niobium nitride microwave resonator for readout. We report Rabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz and coherence times in the microsecond range, resulting in a high single gate quality factor of 380. This establishes FM spin qubits as fast and reliable qubits. Moreover, using the large frequency tunability of the FM qubit, we reveal for the first time that photonic effects predominantly limit coherence, with radiative decay being the main relaxation channel and photon shot-noise inducing dephasing. These results highlight that optimized microwave engineering can unlock the potential of FM spin qubits in hybrid cQED architectures, offering a scalable and robust platform for fast and coherent spin qubits with strong coupling to microwave photons.

Title: Atomic Altermagnetism
Authors: Rodrigo Jaeschke-Ubiergo, Venkata-Krishna Bharadwaj, Warlley Campos, Ricardo Zarzuela, Nikolaos Biniskos, Rafael M. Fernandes, Tomas Jungwirth, Jairo Sinova, Libor Šmejkal
Abstract: Altermagnetism has been recently experimentally verified by photoemission mapping of the spin order in momentum space in MnTe and CrSb, which feature two anisotropic sublattices with antiparallel magnetic dipole moments. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the presence of an even-parity ferroically ordered non-dipolar spin density on the atomic sites, i.e. atomic altermagnetism, in MnTe, $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$. We do so through spin-symmetry analysis and partial-wave decomposition of the spin density obtained by first-principles calculations. In MnTe we show a ferroically ordered g-wave form factor in the spin density around the Mn site. In the $A_2O_3M_2Se_2$ family (A= La, Sr and M= Mn, Fe, Co), we show that there is a ferroically ordered d-wave form factor coexisting with the antiferroic magnetic dipoles in the M site, while the O site shows no dipole but a pure d-wave atomic spin density. In the Mott-insulating candidate $Ba_2CaOsO_6$, as a key result, we reveal a pure form of atomic altermagnetism - absent of any dipolar sublattice order. This highlights that the altermagnetic order can exist without a Néel vector formed by antiferroic dipole moments on an even number of crystal sublattices, underlining its distinction from collinear Néel antiferromagnetic order. Our calculations predict that $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$ can exhibit giant spin-splitter angles of up to 42° and 26° respectively, thus demonstrating the possibility of large altermagnetic responses without requiring the staggered Néel order of local dipole moments.

Title: Memristive properties and synaptic plasticity in substituted pyridinium iodobismuthates
Authors: Gisya Abdi, Tomasz Mazur, Ewelina Kowalewska, Andrzej Sławek, Mateusz Marzec, Konrad Szaciłowski
Abstract: This study explores the impact of organic cations in bismuth iodide complexes on their memristive behavior in metal-insulator-metal (MIM) type thin-layer devices. The presence of electron-donating and electron withdrawing functional groups (-CN, -CH3, -NH2, and -N(CH3)2) on pyridinium cations induces morphological alterations in crystals, thus influencing the electronic or ionic conductivity of devices comprising sandwiched thin layers (thickness = 200 nm +/-50) between glass/ITO as bottom electrode (~ 110 nm) and copper (~ 80 nm) as the top electrode. It was found that the current-voltage (I-V) scans of the devices reveal characteristic pinched hysteresis loops, a distinct signature of memristors. The working voltage windows are significantly influenced by both the types of cation and the dimensionality of ionic fragments (0D or 1D) in the solid-state form. Additionally, the temperature alters the surface area of the I-V loops by affecting resistive switching mechanisms, corresponding log-log plots at three temperatures (-30 °C, room temperature and 150 °C) are fully studied. Given that a memristor can operate as a single synapse without the need for programming, aligning with the requirements of neuromorphic computing, the study investigates long-term depression, potentiation, and spike-time-dependent plasticity-a specific form of the Hebbian learning rule-to mimic biologically synaptic plasticity. Different polar pulses, such as triangle, sawtooth, and square waveforms were employed to generate Hebbian learning rules. The research demonstrates how the shape of the applied pulse series, achieved by overlapping pre- and post-pulses at different time scales, in association with the composition and dimensionality of ionic fragments, lead to changes in the synaptic weight percentages of the devices.

Title: Lessons from the trenches on evaluating machine-learning systems in materials science
Authors: Nawaf Alampara, Mara Schilling-Wilhelmi, Kevin Maik Jablonka
Abstract: Measurements are fundamental to knowledge creation in science, enabling consistent sharing of findings and serving as the foundation for scientific discovery. As machine learning systems increasingly transform scientific fields, the question of how to effectively evaluate these systems becomes crucial for ensuring reliable progress. In this review, we examine the current state and future directions of evaluation frameworks for machine learning in science. We organize the review around a broadly applicable framework for evaluating machine learning systems through the lens of statistical measurement theory, using materials science as our primary context for examples and case studies. We identify key challenges common across machine learning evaluation such as construct validity, data quality issues, metric design limitations, and benchmark maintenance problems that can lead to phantom progress when evaluation frameworks fail to capture real-world performance needs. By examining both traditional benchmarks and emerging evaluation approaches, we demonstrate how evaluation choices fundamentally shape not only our measurements but also research priorities and scientific progress. These findings reveal the critical need for transparency in evaluation design and reporting, leading us to propose evaluation cards as a structured approach to documenting measurement choices and limitations. Our work highlights the importance of developing a more diverse toolbox of evaluation techniques for machine learning in materials science, while offering insights that can inform evaluation practices in other scientific domains where similar challenges exist.

Title: Solid-State Gravitational Redshift: Transport Signatures of Massless Dirac Fermions in Tilted Dirac Cone Heterostructures
Authors: Marziyeh Karmand, Mohsen Amini, Morteza Soltani, Ebrahim Ghanbari-Adivi, Seyed Akbar Jafari
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of electron waves in a two-dimensional tilted Dirac cone heterostructure where tilt depends on the coordinate $z$ along the junction. The resulting Dirac equation in an emergent curved spacetime for the spinor $\psi(z)$ can be efficiently solved using 4th-order Runge-Kutta numerical method by a transformation to a "suitable" spinor $\varphi$ where the resulting Dirac cone looks locally upright. The spatial texture of the tilt induces oscillatory behaviors in key physical quantities such as the norm $|\varphi(z)|^2$ of the wave function, polar and azimuthal angles $\Theta(z)$ and $\Phi(z)$ of the pseudospin, and the integrated transmission $\tau$ where oscillation wave-lengths get shorter (longer) in stronger (weaker) tilt regions. Such an oscillatory behavior reminiscent of gravitational red-shift is an indicator of an underlying spacetime metric that can be probed in tunneling experiments. We derive analytical approximations for the position-dependent wave numbers $\Delta k_z(z)$ that explain the red-shift patterns and corroborate them with numerical simulations. For a tilt "bump" spread over length scale $\ell$, upon increasing $\ell$, the amplitude of red-shifted oscillations reduces whereas the number of peaks increases. The scale invariance of Dirac equation allows to probe these aspects of $\ell$-dependence by a voltage sweep in transmission experiments. Smooth variations of the tilt reduce impedance mismatch of the electron waves, thereby giving rise to very high transmission rate. This concept can be used in combination with a sigmoid-shaped tilt texture for red-shift or blue-shift engineering of the transmitted waves, depending on whether the sigmoid is downswing or upswing.

Title: Membrane Charge Effects on Solute Transport in Polyamide Membranes
Authors: Suwei Liu, Zi Hao Foo, John H. Lienhard, Sinan Keten, Richard M. Lueptow
Abstract: Polyamide membranes, such as nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, are widely used for water desalination and purification. However, the mechanisms of solute transport and solute rejection due to charge interactions remain unclear at the molecular level. Here we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the transport of single-solute feeds through charged nanofiltration membranes with different membrane charge concentrations of COO$^{\text{-}}$ and NH$_2\!^+$ corresponding to different pH levels. Results show that Na$^+$ and Cl$^{\text{-}}$ solute ions are better rejected when the membrane has a higher concentration of negatively charged groups, corresponding to a higher pH, whereas CaCl$_2$ is well-rejected at all pH levels studied. These results are consistent with experimental findings which are performed at the same pH conditions as simulation setup. Moreover, solute transport behavior depends on the membrane functional group distribution. When COO$^{\text{-}}$ functional groups are concentrated at membrane feed surface, ion permeation into the membrane is reduced. Counter-ions tend to associate with charged functional groups while co-ions seem to pass by the charged groups more easily. In addition, steric effects play a role when ions of opposite charge cluster in pores of the membrane. This study reveals solute transport and rejection mechanisms related to membrane charge and provides insights into how membranes might be designed to achieve specific desired solute rejection.

Title: Reflectionless modes as a source of Weyl nodes in multiterminal Josephson junctions
Authors: David Christian Ohnmacht, Valentin Wilhelm, Wolfgang Belzig
Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to study non-trivial topology in engineered quantum systems. Yet, experimentally meaningful insight into what exactly makes these systems topologically non-trivial remains elusive. In this work, we show that zero energy reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs) of the normal scattering matrix result in topological phase boundaries. By analyzing two different setups, we explain the origin of each topological phase boundary and furthermore provide generalizable insight into these systems. The considerations here can be of help for experimentalists as it connects the properties of the normal scattering region to the Andreev bound state spectrum of superconducting junctions in a multiterminal setup.

Title: Spontaneous Optimal Mixing via Defect-Vortex Coupling in Confined Active Nematics
Authors: Brandon Klein, Alejandro J. Soto Franco, Md Mainul Hasan Sabbir, Matthew J. Deutsch, Robin L. B. Selinger, Kevin A. Mitchell, Daniel A. Beller
Abstract: Active nematic flows in two dimensions, largely driven by motile $+1/2$ disclinations, mix themselves efficiently and exhibit chaos in the bulk steady state. Motivated by recent experimental findings for three-defect braiding in cardioid-shaped domains, we investigate how this tendency toward chaotic fluid mixing can, counterintuitively, produce certain ordered, periodic flows in confinement with a controllable net topological charge. We study two-dimensional active nematics in systems with boundary conditions requiring a prescribed number of excess $+1/2$ disclinations, using Beris-Edwards nematohydrodynamics simulations, alongside an agent-based, hydrodynamic simulation approach. We find ordered flows for systems of three and four defects, and we use tools from braid theory to show that spontaneously occurring periodic defect motions produce maximal topological entropy. Our theory correctly predicts the generic absence of stable periodic orbits of more than four defects in strong confinement in simulation. Our results identify the parameter regime outside of which periodicity is lost, and allow us to probe the limits of topological entropy production.

Title: Predicting Magnetic Janus Particle Assembly with Differential Evolution Algorithm
Authors: Eric A. McPherson, Kenneth Kroenlein, Ilona Kretzschmar
Abstract: Magnetic Janus particles allow access to complex, nonlinear assembled structures that may enable interesting new magnetorheological (MR) fluids with uniquely engineered field responses. However, the overwhelming size of the parameter space for Janus and patchy particles makes exploration of such systems by experimental trial and error or through detailed simulation impractical. Here, a differential evolution (DE)-based simulation method is explored to predict the assembly of magnetic Janus particles as an alternative method for assembly prediction. Structure predictions from the DE simulation for laterally- and radially-shifted magnetic Janus particles are compared to four published experimental and simulation case studies. The DE simulation captures the orientation and structure of magnetic Janus particles for a range of shifts and a variety of external field conditions using the point dipole approximation. Structural predictions that rely on the reorganization of large clusters of particles were less well represented by the DE predictions. Despite this limitation, the DE simulation method can be used to predict key structural factors for magnetic Janus particle assemblies, as demonstrated by favorable comparison with three of the four model studies.

Title: Dynamical Hubbard approach to correlated materials: the case of transition-metal monoxides
Authors: Mario Caserta, Tommaso Chiarotti, Marco Vanzini, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: Electronic correlations beyond static mean-field theories are of fundamental importance in describing the properties of complex materials - such as transition-metal oxides - where the low-energy physics is driven by localized d or f electrons. Here, we show that it is possible to capture these correlations with a local and dynamical self energy, extending to the spin-polarized and multi-site case our recently introduced dynamical Hubbard functional formulation. We apply this formalism to the prototypical transition-metal monoxide series of MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO in their ground state, finding excellent agreement with experiments for the spectral properties. The results are comparable or improved with respect to state-of-the-art theories, both for the densities of states and for the spectral functions - including band renormalization and spectral weight transfer - in a numerically efficient and physically transparent treatment of correlations amenable to the study of realistic, complex materials.

Title: Electronic reconstruction and interface engineering of emergent spin fluctuations in compressively strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ on SrLaAlO$_4$(001)
Authors: Benjamin Geisler, James J. Hamlin, Gregory R. Stewart, Richard G. Hennig, P.J. Hirschfeld
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c \sim 40$ K in La3Ni2O7 on SrLaAlO4(001) (SLAO), we explore the structural and electronic properties as well as the spin-spin correlation function of this bilayer nickelate system by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility via Fermi surface nesting, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations. These results provide insights into the emergence of superconductivity in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, suggest a possible key role of the interface, and highlight fundamental differences from the hydrostatic pressure scenario.

Title: Minimal dissipation with active baths in weakly driven processes
Authors: Pierre Nazé, Fabricio Q. Potiguar
Abstract: Although vastly studied, white noise is just an ideal case of heat baths, which limits us from real-world scenarios. Understanding the underlying thermodynamics of active heat baths is therefore a demanding task, mainly in optimal control. This work investigates such a scenario for finite-time weakly driven processes, observing how the relaxation function changes from the passive to the active case. In particular, we show that the relaxation time modifies according to the active heat bath, bringing the system far from the passive heat bath case from the non-equilibrium point of view. Optimal protocols to minimize the average work and its fluctuation are immediately derived from such observation. Conditions on the kernel are determined to guarantee that the active system also obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Brownian motions subject to harmonic traps with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck baths exemplify our results.

Title: New insight on the phase diagram of the superconducting iron spin ladder BaFe$_2$S$_3$

Abstract: BaFe$_2$S$_3$ and BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ are the only two quasi-one-dimensional iron-based compounds that become superconductors under pressure. Interestingly, these two compounds exhibit different symmetries and properties. While more detailed and recent studies on BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ using single crystals have advanced the filed towards a more universal description of this family, such a study is still lacking for the compound BaFe$_2$S$_3$. Here, we present a detailed study of the crystalline and magnetic structure performed on single crystals using X-ray and neutron diffraction. We demonstrate a polar structure at room temperature within the $Cm2m$ space group, followed by a structural transition at 130 K to the polar $Pb2_1m$ space group. This space group remains unchanged across the magnetic transition at $T_N =95$ K, revealing multiferroic characteristics with a weak magnetoelastic coupling. The determined magnetic structure is monoclinic ($P_am$), with non-collinear magnetic moments, displaying a significant angle of 18$^\circ$ relative to the $a$-axis in the $(a, c)$ plane. This reexamination of the temperature-dependent properties of BaFe$_2$S$_3$ provides new insights into the physics of this system from multiple key perspectives.

Title: Charting the landscape of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors in experimentally known compounds
Authors: Marnik Bercx, Samuel Poncé, Yiming Zhang, Giovanni Trezza, Amir Ghorbani Ghezeljehmeidan, Lorenzo Bastonero, Junfeng Qiao, Fabian O. von Rohr, Giovanni Pizzi, Eliodoro Chiavazzo, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: We perform a high-throughput computational search for novel phonon-mediated superconductors, starting from the Materials Cloud 3-dimensional structure database of experimentally known inorganic stoichiometric compounds. We first compute the Allen-Dynes critical temperature (T$_c$) for 4533 non-magnetic metals using a direct and progressively finer sampling of the electron-phonon couplings. For the candidates with the largest T$_c$, we use automated Wannierizations and electron-phonon interpolations to obtain a high-quality dataset for the most promising 240 dynamically stable structures, for which we calculate spectral functions, superconducting bandgaps, and isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg critical temperatures. For 110 of these, we also provide anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting gaps and critical temperatures. The approach is remarkably successful in finding known superconductors, and we find 24 unknown ones with a predicted anisotropic Tc above 10 K. Among them, we identify a possible double gap superconductor (p-doped BaB$_2$), a non-magnetic half-Heusler ZrRuSb, and the perovskite TaRu$_3$C, all exhibiting significant T$_c$. Finally, we introduce a sensitivity analysis to estimate the robustness of the predictions.

Title: Magnetic moment of electrons in systems with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: I. A. Ado, M. Titov, Rembert A. Duine, Arne Brataas
Abstract: Magnetic effects originating from spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been attracting major attention. However, SOC contributions to the electron magnetic moment operator are conventionally disregarded. In this work, we analyze relativistic contributions to the latter operator, including those of the SOC-type: in vacuum, for the semiconductor 8 band Kane model, and for an arbitrary system with two spectral branches. In this endeavor, we introduce a notion of relativistic corrections to the operation $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $\boldsymbol B$ is an external magnetic field. We highlight the difference between the magnetic moment and $-\partial H/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $H$ is the system Hamiltonian. We suggest to call this difference the abnormal magnetic moment. We demonstrate that the conventional splitting of the total magnetic moment into the spin and orbital parts becomes ambiguous when relativistic corrections are taken into account. The latter also jeopardize the ``modern theory of orbital magnetization'' in its standard formulation. We derive a linear response Kubo formula for the kinetic magnetoelectric effect projected to individual branches of a two branch system. This allows us, in particular, to identify a source of this effect that stems from noncommutation of the position and $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$ operators' components. This is an analog of the contribution to the Hall conductivity from noncommuting components of the position operator. We also report several additional observations related to the electron magnetic moment operator in systems with SOC and other relativistic corrections.

Title: Exploration of metastable A-site-ordered perovskites (Ca,Ba)FeO3-δ by computationally-guided multi-step synthesis
Authors: Masaho Onose, Hidefumi Takahashi, Hajime Sagayama, Yuichi Yamasaki, Shintaro Ishiwata
Abstract: Perovskite-type iron oxides with Fe4+ ions have attracted much attention for their versatile helimagnetic phases. While the introduction of a layered A-site ordered structure to AFeO3 with Fe4+ ions potentially lead to novel helimagnetic phases, the synthetic pathway spanning high pressure range is apparently difficult to elucidate. Here, we explored new A-site ordered perovskite-type iron oxides (Ca,Ba)FeO3-{\delta} with Fe4+ ions with the support of first-principles calculations evaluating thermodynamic stability at selected pressures and chemical compositions. Among the six types of putative A-site ordered perovskites with and without oxygen vacancy, only two types of oxygen-deficient perovskites CaBaFe2O6-{\delta} and Ca(Ba0.9Ca0.1)2Fe3O9-{\delta} ({\delta}~1) were successfully obtained by high-pressure synthesis, being consistent with the DFT-based convex-hull calculations. Considering the evaluated stability of the putative perovskites at selected pressures, we adopted low-temperature topotactic oxidation using ozone at ambient pressure and obtained the oxidized perovskites CaBaFe2O6-{\delta} ({\delta}~0.4) and Ca(Ba0.9Ca0.1)2Fe3O9-{\delta} ({\delta}~0.6), potentially showing novel helimagnetic phases. This study demonstrates that computational visualization of multi-step synthetic pathways involving high pressure can accelerate the search for new metastable perovskites with rich magnetic phases.

Title: The reliability of hybrid functionals for accurate fundamental and optical gap prediction of bulk solids and surfaces
Authors: Francisca Sagredo, María Camarasa-Gómez, Francesco Ricci, Aurélie Champagne, Leeor Kronik, Jeffrey B. Neaton
Abstract: Hybrid functionals have been considered insufficiently reliable for the prediction of band gaps in solids and surfaces. We revisit this issue with a new generation of optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid functionals, focusing on the reconstructed Si(111)-(2x1) and Ge(111)-(2x1) surfaces. We show that certain hybrid functionals can accurately predict the surface-state and bulk fundamental and optical gaps, as well as projected band structures of these surfaces, by combining ground-state and time-dependent density functional theory.

Title: Scattering resonances and pairing in a Rabi-coupled Fermi gas
Authors: Olivier Bleu, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Cesar R. Cabrera, Jesper Levinsen, Meera M. Parish
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of using a Rabi drive to tune the interactions in an atomic Fermi gas. Specifically, we consider the scenario where two fermion species (spins) are Rabi coupled and interacting with a third uncoupled species. Using an exact calculation within a minimal low-energy model, we derive analytical expressions for the effective scattering length and effective range that characterize the collisions between a Rabi-dressed atom and an atom from the third species. In particular, we find that new scattering resonances emerge in the Rabi-coupled system, which we demonstrate are linked to the existence of hybrid two-body bound states. Furthermore, we show via a generalized Thouless criterion that the scattering properties have a direct impact on the superfluid transitions in the Rabi-coupled Fermi gas. The presence of Rabi-induced resonances thus has implications for the investigation of many-body physics with driven atomic gases.

Title: Spin Texture Control and Magnetic Gap Engineering in a Ferromagnetic Insulator-Topological Insulator Sandwiched Heterostructure
Authors: Mohammad T. H. Bhuiyan, Qile Li, James Blyth, Ji-Eun Lee, Jonathan Denlinger, Jaime Sánchez-Barriga, Alexander Fedorov, Anton Tadich, Emile Reinks, Sung-Kwan Mo, Alexei Fedorov, Oliver J. Clark, Mark T. Edmonds
Abstract: Quantum materials combining magnetism and topological fermions are a key platform for low-energy electronics, spintronics, and quantum phases that break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Coupling a topological insulator to a magnetic material allows proximity magnetization with the potential to achieve these phases at elevated temperatures. One potential architecture for realizing QAHE at elevated temperature is a heterostructure comprising two single-septuple layers (1SL) of MnBi2Te4 (a 2D ferromagnetic insulator) with four-quintuple layer (4QL) Bi2Te3 in the middle. However, the origin of this gap has not yet been explicitly determined, as there are other non-magnetic mechanisms that have been shown to produce bandgaps in similar systems. Here, through spin- and angle-resolved photoemission, the magnetic nature of the gap opening is investigated to demonstrates direct control of the spin state via small magnetic fields and confirm the magnetic origin of the gap through spin splitting and broken TRS. Furthermore, the hallmark chiral spin texture of non-magnetic topological insulators is preserved away from the {\Gamma}-point, despite the large 72+/-10 meV exchange gap at the Dirac point. The robust magnetic gap and controllable spin texture hold significant promise for future technologies requiring both magnetic properties and topological protection.

Title: Hybrid-pair superfluidity in a strongly driven Fermi gas
Authors: Brendan C. Mulkerin, Olivier Bleu, Cesar R. Cabrera, Meera M. Parish, Jesper Levinsen
Abstract: We explore the paired superfluid phases of a Fermi gas in the presence of a continuous Rabi drive. We focus on the case where two components are strongly coupled by the drive, forming hybrid superpositions, and interacting with an uncoupled third component. Using a generalized Bardeen- Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) ansatz, we show that there are two coupled superfluid order parameters, and we obtain the associated free energy and quasiparticle excitation spectrum. We find that we can drive BCS-BCS, BCS-Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and BEC-BEC crossovers purely by varying the detuning of the Rabi drive from the bare transition, with the precise crossover depending on the sign of the underlying interactions between the coupled and uncoupled components. We furthermore identify an exotic excited branch which features both normal to BCS superfluid transitions, as well as a BCS-BEC-BCS crossover. Introducing a generalized Thouless criterion, we show that this behavior is reflected in the critical temperature for superfluidity. Our Rabi-coupled scenario also gives possesses additional thermodynamic properties related to the pseudospin of the coupled components, which provide novel signatures of the state of the many-body system. The Rabi-driven Fermi gas thus emerges as a unique platform for engineering and probing a rich array of multi-band superfluid phases.

Title: Observation of High-Temperature Dissipationless Fractional Chern Insulator
Authors: Heonjoon Park, Weijie Li, Chaowei Hu, Christiano Beach, Miguel Gonçalves, Juan Felipe Mendez-Valderrama, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, David Cobden, Liang Fu, B. Andrei Bernevig, Nicolas Regnault, Jiun-Haw Chu, Di Xiao, Xiaodong Xu
Abstract: The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect has recently been experimentally observed in zero-field fractional Chern insulators (FCI). However, an outstanding challenge is the presence of a substantial longitudinal resistance $R_{xx}$ (a few k$\Omega$), even though the anomalous Hall resistance $R_{xy}$ is quantized. This dissipative behavior is likely linked to imperfect sample quality. Here, we report transport measurements of a drastically improved twisted $\text{MoTe}_2$ bilayer device, which exhibits quantized $R_{xy}$ and vanishing $R_{xx}$ for the $-2/3$ state, marking a dissipationless FCI. Contrary to fractional quantum Hall states where the energy gap increases with magnetic field, we find that the thermal activation gap of the observed FCI states decreases rapidly as the magnetic field rises from zero, then plateaus above a few teslas. This observation is attributed to the interplay between spin and charge gaps. Due to the spontaneous ferromagnetism, the spin gap dominates at low field, while the charge gap becomes appreciable once the magnetic field freezes spin fluctuations. For the $-2/3$ state, we estimate the spin and FCI gap of about 55 and 20 K, respectively. Our results provide insights into the energy scale of FCI and offer a pathway for quantum engineering of exotic correlated topological states.

Title: A pseudo-dynamic phase-field model for brittle fracture
Authors: Juan Michael Sargado, Joachim Mathiesen
Abstract: The enforcement of global energy conservation in phase-field fracture simulations has been an open problem for the last 25 years. Specifically, the occurrence of unstable fracture is accompanied by a loss in total potential energy, which suggests a violation of the energy conservation law. This phenomenon can occur even with purely quasi-static, displacement-driven loading conditions, where finite crack growth arises from an infinitesimal increase in load. While such behavior is typically seen in crack nucleation, it may also occur in other situations. Initial efforts to enforce energy conservation involved backtracking schemes based on global minimization, however in recent years it has become clearer that unstable fracture, being an inherently dynamic phenomenon, cannot be adequately resolved within a purely quasi-static framework. Despite this, it remains uncertain whether transitioning to a fully dynamic framework would sufficiently address the issue. In this work, we propose a pseudo-dynamic framework designed to enforce energy balance without relying on global minimization. This approach incorporates dynamic effects heuristically into an otherwise quasi-static model, allowing us to bypass solving the full dynamic linear momentum equation. It offers the flexibility to simulate crack evolution along a spectrum, ranging from full energy conservation at one extreme to maximal energy loss at the other. Using data from recent experiments, we demonstrate that our framework can closely replicate experimental load-displacement curves, achieving results that are unattainable with classical phase-field models.

Title: ARES-Phonon: Phonon Calculation Package using Nondiagonal Supercell Finite Displacement Method with Machine Learning
Authors: Qian Wang, Jiaxiang Li, Yu Xie
Abstract: We have developed a phonon calculation software based on the supercell finite displacement method: ARES-Phonon. It can perform phonon and related property calculations using either non-diagonal or diagonal supercell approaches. Particularly for the non-diagonal supercell method, for phonons with wave vectors $(\frac{n_1}{m_1},\frac{n_2}{m_2},\frac{n_3}{m_3})$, only a non-diagonal supercell of size equal to the least common multiple of $m_1 m_2 m_3$ needs to be constructed, significantly reducing the computational burden. We have tested this method on Diamond, $MoS_2$, and $Si_3O_6$ systems, and the results indicate that this approach can achieve the same level of accuracy as density functional perturbation theory. Speed tests were conducted for systems of different sizes, varying symmetries, and sampling densities of Brillouin zone \textbf{\textit{q}} points, showing that compared to the diagonal supercell method, the non-diagonal approach is approximately an order of magnitude faster and becomes even more efficient with increasing system complexity. Combining this method with machine learning potentials based on synchronous learning techniques, a further reduction of approximately $90\%$ in computational cost can be achieved while maintaining reliable accuracy.

Title: A-site Cation disorder engineering in Ruddlesden-Popper Layered Perovskite Oxide La2(Ba,Sr)In2O7 for Ferroelectricity
Authors: Takumi Terauchi, Wei Yi, Rikuto Takada Hirofumi Akamatsu Ryo Ota Shuki Torii, Koji Fujita
Abstract: The strategic design of ferroelectric materials exhibiting robust and reversible spontaneous polarization remains a pivotal challenge in functional materials research. Here, A-site cation disorder engineering is employed in the n = 2 Ruddlesden-Popper layered perovskite La2Ba1-xSrxIn2O7 to achieve room-temperature ferroelectricity. Systematic substitution of Sr2+ for Ba2+ drives symmetry transitions from a parent centrosymmetric (CS) P42/mnm structure (x = 0) to two emergent phases: a CS Amam phase (for x from 0.3 to 0.4) and a polar A21am phase (for x from 0.5 to 0.9). Multimodal characterization combining synchrotron diffraction, neutron scattering, nonlinear optical spectroscopy, and hysteresis loop of electric polarization versus electric field reveals a hybrid improper ferroelectric (HIF) mechanism in the A21am phase, arising from trilinear coupling between octahedral rotations and tilts. Cation disorder at A-sites suppresses the interfacial rumpling-induced octahedral elongation (deformation) while enhancing the octahedral rotations which are critical for the polar symmetry stabilization. First-principles calculations further elucidate that Sr/La disorder mitigates electrostatic interactions, enabling oxygen octahedral distortions necessary for ferroelectricity. This work establishes cation disorder engineering as a versatile strategy to design high-temperature multiferroics in layered perovskites, advancing the coupling between structural distortions and functional responses in complex oxides.

Title: Bimeron Crystals by a Linearly Polarized AC Electric Field in Frustrated Magnets
Authors: Tatsuya Shirato, Ryota Yambe, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: We theoretically propose a method to generate topological spin textures by irradiating a classical spin system with a linearly polarized AC electric field. To this end, we investigate non-equilibrium steady states in a classical Heisenberg model with frustrated exchange interactions on a two-dimensional triangular lattice by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation at zero temperature. Our results reveal that the linearly polarized AC electric-field irradiation induces a topological phase transition from a single-Q spiral state to a bimeron crystal with the skyrmion number of one in the low-frequency regime. Furthermore, we show that the obtained bimeron crystal remains relatively stable against both easy-axis and easy-plane single-ion anisotropies.

Title: DiracBilinears.jl: A package for computing Dirac bilinears in solids
Authors: Tatsuya Miki, Hsiao-Yi Chen, Takashi Koretsune, Yusuke Nomura
Abstract: this http URL is a Julia package for computing Dirac bilinears, which are fundamental physical quantities of electrons in relativistic quantum theory, using first-principles calculations for solids. In relativistic quantum theory, 16 independent bilinears can be defined using the four-component Dirac field. We take the non-relativistic limit for the bilinears, which corresponds to the $1/m$ expansion, and focus on the low-energy physics typically considered in condensed matter physics. This package can evaluate the spatial distributions and Wannier matrix elements of the Dirac bilinears in solids quantitatively by connecting to the external first-principles calculation packages, including Quantum ESPRESSO, Wannier90, and wan2respack.

Title: Magnetoconductivity due to electron-electron interaction in a non-Galilean--invariant Fermi liquid
Authors: Tatia Kiliptari, Dmitrii L. Maslov
Abstract: The $T^2$-scaling of resistivity with temperature is often viewed as a classic hallmark of a Fermi-liquid (FL) behavior in metals. However, if umklapp scattering is suppressed, this scaling is not universally guaranteed to occur. In this case, the resistivity behavior is influenced by several factors, such as dimensionality (two vs. three), topology (simply- vs. multiply-connected Fermi surfaces), and (in two dimensions) the shape (convex vs. concave) of the Fermi surface (FS). Specifically for an isotropic spectrum, as well as for a two-dimensional (2D) convex FS, the $T^2$ term is absent, and the first non-zero contribution scales as $T^4\ln T$ in 2D and as $T^4$ in 3D. In this paper, we study the $T$-dependence of the resistivity, arising from electron-electron interactions, in the presence of a weak magnetic field. We show that, for an isotropic FS in any dimensions and for a convex 2D FS, the $T^2$ term is also absent in both Hall and diagonal magnetoconductivity, which instead scale as $BT^4\ln T$ and $B^2T^4\ln T$, respectively, in 2D and as $BT^4$ and $B^2T^4$ in 3D. The FL-like scaling, i.e., $BT^2$ and $B^2T^2$ of the Hall and diagonal conductivities is recovered for a concave FS in 2D. Furthermore, we show that, for an isotropic spectrum, magnetoresistance is absent even in the presence of electron-electron interactions. Additionally, we examine the high-temperature limit, when electron-electron scattering prevails over electron-impurity one, and show that all components of the conductivity tensor saturate in this limit at values that are determined by impurity scattering but, in general, differ from the corresponding values at $T=0$.

Title: A controllable theory of superconductivity due to strong repulsion in a polarized band
Authors: Zhiyu Dong, Patrick A. Lee
Abstract: Can strong repulsive interaction be shown to give rise to pairing in a controllable way? We find that for a single flavor polarized band, there is a small expansion parameter in the low density limit, once the Bloch wavefunction overlap is taken into account. A perturbative expansion is possible, even if the interaction is much stronger than the Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$. We illustrate our method with a two-band model that is often used to describe multi-layer rhombohedral graphene and comment on the relationship with experiments. This work opens a reliable pathway to search for topological superconductors with high-$T_c$ (relative to $\epsilon_F$) in materials with strongly interactions. We summarize the requirements and suggest some illustrative design structures.

Title: Stark difference in the in-plane anomalous Hall response in Zintl compounds EuA2Sb2 (A = Zn, Cd) thin films
Authors: Hsiang Lee, Shinichi Nishihaya, Markus Kriener, Jun Fujioka, Ayano Nakamura, Yuto Watanabe, Hiroaki Ishizuka, Masaki Uchida
Abstract: Recent observation of the in-plane anomalous Hall effect in magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd2Sb2 has drawn attention to out-of-plane orbital magnetization induced by an in-plane field component. Here we study EuZn2Sb2, a sister compound of EuCd2Sb2, to demonstrate sensitive changes of the in-plane anomalous Hall effect on the band modulation. The Hall resistivity measured with rotating the magnetic field within the (001) principal plane of EuZn2Sb2 films exhibits a clear three-fold component corresponding to the in-plane anomalous Hall effect, which is distinct from the two-fold component of the planar Hall effect. The in-plane anomalous Hall effect of EuZn2Sb2 is highly contrasting to EuCd2Sb2, especially in terms of its opposite sign and field dependence, which can be explained by model calculations with different band inversion parameters. Our results pave the way for systematically controlling the in-plane anomalous Hall effect and orbital magnetization through elaborate band engineering.

Title: The Role of Hydrogen and Oxygen Interstitial Defects in Crystalline Si cells: Mechanism of Device Degradation in Humid Environment
Authors: Bo Li, Feifei Zhang, Yu Pang, Huiyan Zhao, Guocai Liu, Chao He, Xingtao An
Abstract: The efficiency of silicon solar cells gradually decreases in various environments, with humidity being a key factor contributing to this decline. This study investigates the humidity-induced failure mechanisms in crystalline silicon solar cells. Using density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function method, we systematically examine the microscopic diffusion mechanisms of hydrogen and oxygen defects and their impact on photovoltaic performance. Hydrogen and oxygen are interstitial defects that can introduce both deep-level and resonant-state recombination centers, thereby reducing carrier lifetime and solar cell efficiency. Furthermore, hydrogen exhibits prominent diffusion pathways, particularly in its +1 and 0 charge states at the BC site ( "H" _"i(BC)" ^"+1" and "H" _"i(BC)" ^"0" ), while oxygen in its +1 and 0 charge states shows a higher diffusion barrier at the BC1 site ( "O" _"i(BC1)" ^"+1" and "O" _"i(BC1)" ^"0" ). These defects, induced by moisture and temperature fluctuations, exacerbate the degradation of solar cell performance. By analyzing these defect behaviors, this research provides valuable insights into the failure mechanisms of Si solar cells, especially under humid conditions.

Title: Hole spin splitting in a Ge quantum dot with finite barriers
Authors: Jiawei Wang, Xuedong Hu, Herbert F Fotso
Abstract: We study the low-energy spectrum of a single hole confined in a planar Ge quantum dot (QD) within the effective-mass formalism. The QD is sandwiched between two GeSi barriers of finite potential height grown along the [001] direction. To treat this finite barrier problem, we adopt an independent-band approach in dealing with boundary conditions. The effects of different system parameters are investigated, including the width of the out-of-plane confining well, the size of the dot, and silicon concentration in the confining layers. The more accurate finite-barrier model results in the non-negligible dependence of the anisotropic $g$-factor on the choice of boundary conditions and on the silicon concentration in the barrier. Furthermore, while the ideal model of a planar dot with a square-well heterostructure already has an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, realistic effects arising from the experimental setup may give rise to additional contributions. We investigate the impact from the top-gate electric field and the residual tensile strain on the qubit states. The results indicate that these effects are important contributions to the total spin-orbit coupling which enables fast electric control.

Title: Tuning Electrode Wettability to Optimize Nanobubble Nucleation and Reaction Rates in Electrochemical Gas-Evolving Reactions
Authors: Zhenlei Wanga, Yaxi Yua, Mengkai Qin, Hao Jiang, Zhenjiang Guo, Lu Bai, Limin Wang, Xiaochun Zhang, Xiangping Zhang, Yawei Liu
Abstract: Bubble formation in electrochemical system often hinders reaction efficiency by reducing active surface area and obstructing mass transfer, yet the mechanisms governing their nanoscale nucleation dynamics and impact remains unclear. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to explore nanobubble nucleation and reaction rates during water electrolysis on planar- and nano-electrodes, with systematically tuning electrode wettability through water-electrode and gas-electrode interactions. We identified distinct nucleation regimes: gas layers, surface nanobubbles, bulk nanobubbles, and no nanobubbles, and revealed a volcano-shaped relationship between wettability and reaction rate, where optimal wettability strikes a balance between suppressing bubbles and ensuring sufficient reactant availability to maximize performance. Nanoelectrodes consistently exhibit higher current densities compared to planar electrodes with the same wettability, due to pronounced edge effects. Furthermore, moderate driving forces enhance reaction rates without triggering surface bubble formation, while excessive driving forces induce surface nanobubble nucleation, leading to suppressed reaction rates and complex dynamics driven by bubble growth and detachment. These findings highlight the importance of fine-tuning wettability and reaction driving forces to optimize gas-evolving electrochemical systems at the nanoscale and underscore the need for multiscale simulation frameworks integrating atomic-scale reaction kinetics, nanoscale bubble nucleation, and microscale bubble dynamics to fully understand bubble behavior and its impact on performance.

Title: Magnon thermal conductivity in multiferroics with spin cycloids
Authors: Hyeon Woo Park, Shu Zhang, Peter Meisenheimer, Maya Ramesh, Sajid Husain, Isaac Harris, Jorge Íñiguez-González, Zhi Yao, Ramamoorthy Ramesh, Se Kwon Kim
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, characterized by the occurrence of two or more ferroic properties, hold potential in future technological applications and also exhibit intriguing phenomena caused by the interplay of multiple orders. One such example is the formation of spin cycloid structures within multiferroic materials, which we investigate in this work by focusing on their magnon excitations and transport based on a general multiferroic Hamiltonian with an antiferromagnetic order. More specifically, we identify the ground state and explore the dynamics of magnon modes, revealing distinct in-plane and out-of-plane modes with anisotropic dispersion this http URL magnon modes include a massless excitation, known as the Goldstone boson, originating from the spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry by the formation of the cycloid structures. By employing the Boltzmann transport formalism, the magnonic thermal conductivity with spin cycloids and low-temperature anisotropic behaviors is discussed. This work provides pathways to envision the spin-textured multiferroics, which may serve as a fertile ground to look for novel thermal and spin transport with the rich interplay of quasiparticles such as magnons and phonons.

Title: Unveiling the cRPA: A Comparative Analysis of Methods for Calculating Hubbard Parameters
Authors: Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, M. Kaltak, Bongjae Kim
Abstract: In this study, we present a systematic comparison of various approaches within the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) for calculating the Coulomb interaction parameter U. While defining the correlated space is straightforward for disentangled bands, the situation is more complex for entangled bands, where different projection schemes from hybridized bands to the target space can yield varying sizes of interaction parameters. We systematically evaluated different methods for calculating the polarizability functions within the correlated space. Furthermore, we analyze how different definitions of the correlated space, often constructed through Wannierization from Kohn-Sham orbitals, defines the orbital localization and play a crucial role in determining the interaction parameter. To illustrate these effects, we consider two sets of representative correlated d-orbital oxides: LiMO2 (M = V-Ni) as examples of isolated d-electron systems and SrMO3 (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) as cases of entangled d-electron systems. Through this systematic comparison, we provide a detailed analysis of different cRPA methodologies for computing the Hubbard parameters.

Title: Double-helicoid surface states in Dirac semimetals protected by glide-time-reversal symmetry
Authors: Taiki Yukitake, Daisuke Hara, Shuichi Murakami
Abstract: Recently, some $Z_2$ monopole charges were defined for Dirac semimetals with $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetry ($\mathcal{G}$: glide, $\mathcal{T}$: time-reversal) in previous works, and the charges are believed to lead to double-helicoid surface states. However, no proof of the bulk-surface correspondence is given there. In this paper, we point out one of the $Z_2$ charges in the previous works is gauge-dependent, and newly define another $Z_2$ charge. Using this new $Z_2$ charge, we give a proof of the bulk-surface correspondence. We also compare the new $Z_2$ charge with the $Z_2$ invariant for $\mathcal{G}$-protected topological crystalline insulators, and the second Stiefel-Whitney number for $\mathcal{PT}$-protected nodal line semimetals.

Title: Revisiting LaMnO3: A density functional theory study
Authors: J.-H. Lee, Bongjae Kim
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely applied to a variety of realistic materials but often struggles to explain the properties of correlated systems. The DFT + U method, which introduces a Hubbard U correction to the DFT, has been instrumental in providing the treatment of systems such as transition metal oxide. The methodological details of DFT + U and their specifics on the electronic structures and magnetic properties of the correlated systems remain incompletely understood. In this study, taking the prototypical transition metal oxide system, LaMnO3, as an example, we systematically assess the performance of the two distinct DFT + U methods, spin-polarized DFT (SDFT + U) and spin-un-polarized DFT (CDFT + U). We found that while Coulomb U acts similarly for the two approaches, Hund JH plays a fundamentally different role, particularly in the determination of the magnetic phases. Our investigation shows the active role of Hund JH on the exchange splitting, leading to distinct magnetic ground configurations in the two methods. We further investigate the associated magnetic exchange interactions and compare our results with so-called beyond-DFT methods.

Title: Electrical Spin-Flip Current Switching in Layered Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors for Ultralow-Power Spintronics
Authors: Lan-Anh T. Nguyen, Mallesh Baithi, Tuan Dung Nguyen, Krishna P. Dhakal, Jeongyong Kim, Ki Kang Kim, Dinh Loc Duong, Philip Kim, Young Hee Lee
Abstract: Efficient magnetic switching is a cornerstone for advancing spintronics, particularly for energy-efficient data storage and memory devices. Here, we report the electrical switching of spin-flips in V-doped WSe2 multilayers, a van der Waals (vdW)-layered diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS), demonstrating ultralow-power switching operation at room temperature. Our study reveals unique linear magnetoresistance and parabolic magnetoresistance states, where electrical modulation induces transitions between interlayered ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic configurations. We identify an unconventional linear magnetoresistance hysteresis characterized by electrically driven spin flip/flop switching, distinct from conventional random network disorder or linear band-dispersion mechanisms. Applying an electrical voltage across vertical vdW layered V-doped WSe2 multilayers generates the spin currents at room temperature, driving spin-flip transitions from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic states due to a strong spin transfer torque effect. Notably, the critical current density reaches an ultralow value of 10-1Acm-2, accompanied by pico-watt power consumption, a record-low spin current density by a six-order-of-magnitude improvement over conventional spintronic devices. These findings establish the V-doped WSe2 multilayer device as a transformative platform for ultralow power spintronics, underscoring the potential of vdW-layered DMS systems for next generation energy-efficient spintronic technologies.

Title: Efficient spin-wave excitation by surface acoustic waves in ultra-low damping YIG/ZnO-heterostructures
Authors: Yannik Kunz, Julian Schüler, Finlay Ryburn, Kevin Künstle, Michael Schneider, Katharina Lasinger, Yangzhan Zhang, Philipp Pirro, John Gregg, Mathias Weiler
Abstract: We demonstrate the efficient excitation of spin waves in the ultra-low magnetic damping material yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). To this end, we employ interdigital transducers fabricated on a piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film covering the YIG. This enables the excitation of coherent, propagating Rayleigh-type and Sezawa-type SAWs. We find that the ultralow magnetic damping of YIG is retained after the ZnO-deposition and we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the magnetoelastic interaction due to the different SAW modes as a function of the external magnetic field magnitude and orientation. By measuring the SAW attenuation our experiments reveal a highly anisotropic and non-reciprocal SAW-SW-interaction in agreement with our model caluclation, while demonstrating that low-damping magnons can be efficiently excited by SAWs.

Title: Josephson vortices and persistent current in a double-ring supersolid system
Authors: Malte Schubert, Koushik Mukherjee, Tilman Pfau, Stephanie Reimann
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the properties of ultra-cold dipolar atoms in radially coupled, concentric annular traps created by a potential barrier. The non-rotating ground-state phases are investigated across the superfluid-supersolid phase transition, revealing a particle imbalance between the two rings and a preferential density modulation in the outer ring. Near the phase transition on the superfluid side, applying rotation can induce density modulations in either ring, depending on the angular momentum and barrier strength. For low angular momentum, such rotation-induced density modulation forms in the outer ring, while for high angular momentum and weak barriers, it emerges in the inner ring. Rotation can lead to persistent currents and the nucleation of a vortex residing either at the center (central vortex) or at the ring junction (Josephson vortex). Josephson vortices can also form at the junctions of the localized density sites induced by rotation in the inner ring, a behavior that is unique to our system. By switching off the trap and allowing the system to expand, distinct interference patterns emerge, which can be analyzed to identify and distinguish between various vortex configurations, and thus can be observed in current state-of-the-art experiments.

Title: Pressure Induced Altermagnetism in Layered Ternary Iron-Selenides
Authors: Zilong Li, Xin Ma, Siqi Wu, H.-Q. Yuan, Jianhui Dai, Chao Cao
Abstract: Employing first-principles based calculations, we reexamined the high-pressure phases of the vacancy-ordered iron-selenides, i.e. \a245\ phase. A magnetic transition from the block-spin antiferromagnetic phase to \neelfm\ phase is observed under high pressure when the iron-vacancy order is preserved. The transition is first-order, driven by the collapse of $c$-axis and accompanied by an insulator-metal transition. In addition, the \neelfm\ phase is a rare example of {\it intrinsic} altermagnetism that does not require ligand atoms nor supercell construction to break the spatial inversion or translational symmetry between the two spin sublattices, with a spin-splitting of the band structure as large as 300 meV. The existence of this phase may resulting in nontrivial effect on the re-emerging superconducting phase of \kfsxy\ under high pressure.

Title: Growth Laws and Universality in 2-TIPS: Microscopic and Coarse grained approach
Authors: Nayana Venkatareddy, Partha Sarathi Mondal, Jaydeep Mandal, Shradha Mishra, Prabal K. Maiti
Abstract: Two temperature induced phase separation(2-TIPS) is a phenomenon observed in mixtures of active and passive particles modeled by scalar activity where the temperature of the particle is proportional to its activity. The binary mixture of 'hot' and 'cold' particles phase separate when the relative temperature difference between hot and cold particles defined as activity $\chi$ exceeds a density dependent critical value. The study of kinetics in 2-TIPS, a non-equilibrium phase separation, is of fundamental importance in statistical physics. In this paper, we investigate 2-TIPS kinetics using molecular dynamics (MD) and coarse-grained (CG) modeling in 3D and 2D. The coarse-grained model couples two passive Model B equations for hot and cold particles, with coupling terms emulating the energy transfer between them by raising the temperature of cold particles and lowering that of hot particles, a key observation from the MD simulations. MD simulations reveal that at high densities, phase separation begins immediately after the quench, forming bi-continuous domains rich in hot or cold particles, similar to spinodal decomposition in passive systems. These interconnected domains are also observed in the coarse-grained model for the mixture's critical composition. Both MD and CG models show dynamic scaling of the correlation function, indicating self-similar domain growth. Regardless of dimensionality, both methods report algebraic growth in domain length with a growth exponent of $1/3$, known as the Lifshitz-Slyozov exponent, widely observed in passive systems. Our results demonstrate that the universality of phase separation kinetics observed in passive systems also extends to the non-equilibrium binary mixture undergoing 2-TIPS.

Title: On the origin of bulk-related anisotropies in surface optical spectra
Authors: Max Großmann, Kai Daniel Hanke, Chris Yannic Bohlemann, Agnieszka Paszuk, Thomas Hannappel, Wolf Gero Schmidt, Erich Runge
Abstract: Reflection anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS) is a powerful method for probing the optical properties of surfaces, used routinely in research and industrial applications, yet the origin of 'bulk-related' features that appear in the spectra of various surfaces has been debated for nearly 40 years. It is often argued that these features are related to surface-induced bulk anisotropy (SIBA) because they coincide with critical energies of the bulk dielectric function. In general, any quantitative RAS theory must include excitonic effects as they significantly influence the spectra and are believed to be the key to determining the origin of SIBA features. Here, we introduce a layer-resolved exciton localization (LREL) measure within the framework of many-body perturbation theory, which enables a quantitative analysis of the origins of 'bulk-related' RAS features. Applying LREL to arsenic-modified silicon reconstructions reveals that, depending on the surface reconstruction, the 'apparent' SIBA features arise primarily from states localized at the surface, with only a small contribution from the underlying layers. Our findings, further supported by the fact that the calculated spectra agree well with low-temperature RAS measurements, challenge the conventional explanation of 'bulk-related' RAS features. They indicate that in many instances bulk-enhanced surface anisotropies (BESA)-the opposite of SIBA-contribute to, or are even responsible for, 'bulk-related' RAS features. Therefore, we suggest that previously studied semiconductor surfaces, which exhibit 'bulk-related' features in their spectra, should be reanalyzed using the presented method.

Title: Solubility and dissociation of ionic liquids in epoxides and cyclic carbonate by molecular dynamics simulation
Authors: Sergio Dorado-Alfaro, Elisa Hernández, Jesús Algaba, Pablo Navarro, Felipe J. Blas, José Palomar
Abstract: Climate emergency has led to the investigation of CO$_{2}$ valorization routes. A competitive process included in this framework is the catalytic CO$_{2}$ cycloaddition to epoxides, to produce cyclic carbonates. Halide-based Ionic liquids (ILs) have been postulated to be a competitive choice. Nevertheless, the structure-performance relation for different ILs is still a topic of debate, being the cation-anion dissociation constant a key descriptor. In this work, the ions effect is tackled by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Propylene oxide and carbonate force fields were tested and used for 1,2-epoxyhexane and hexylene carbonate force field construction, while ILs were modelled by the CL\&P force field. Solubilities in an epoxide-carbonate medium were tested for ILs composed of [$\mathrm{N4444^+}$] or [$\mathrm{N2222^+}$] cations combined with the halide anions: Iodide [$\mathrm{I^-}$], Bromide [$\mathrm{Br^-}$] and Chloride [$\mathrm{Cl^-}$]. Results showed that [$\mathrm{N2222^+}$] cation-based ionic liquids were insoluble in the epoxide/carbonate medium, whereas [$\mathrm{N4444^+}$] cation-based ionic liquids demonstrated diffusion. Reaction medium interactions were studied between key atoms for experimentally soluble ILs. It was found that cation-anion interaction follows the catalytic activity trend, being [$\mathrm{I^-}$] the halide anion less associated with ([$\mathrm{N4444^+}$], [$\mathrm{bmim^+}$] and [$\mathrm{emim^+}$]) cations. A correlation between the first peak integration of the radial distribution functions and the experimental yields (including [$\mathrm{N1111^+}$][$\mathrm{Br^-}$]) could be established with a regression coefficient of 0.86. Additionally, [$\mathrm{I^-}$] based ILs displayed a better interaction between the cation and the epoxide oxygen, phenomena linked to epoxide activation and intermediates stabilization.

Title: Out of Equilibrium Behaviour of Quantum Vortices: A Comparison of Point Vortex Dynamics and Fokker-Planck Evolution
Authors: R. J. Tattersall, A. W. Baggaley, T. P. Billam
Abstract: An out of equilibrium two-dimensional superfluid relaxes towards equilibrium via a process of coarsening, driven by the annihilation of vortices with antivortices. Here we present a comparison of two different numerical models of this process, a dissipative point vortex model and Fokker-Planck evolution, across a wide range of initial configurations and levels of dissipation. We find that our dissipative point vortex model is well-approximated by Fokker-Planck evolution only for very low initial energies per vortex, approximately less than -4, when almost all vortices and antivortices are closely bound into dipoles. We observe that the dynamical critical exponent, $z$, in the dissipative point vortex model, undergoes a crossover, from a roughly constant value close to two for energy per vortex approximately greater than -4 to one which depends explicitly on the initial conditions for energy per vortex approximately less than -5.

Abstract: We have computed the vibrational pattern and the electron-phonon coupling at several q-points in the Brillouin Zone for the three known pentacene polymorphs. After having verified that they effectively correspond to three different structures, we revisit the assignment of the experimental Raman modes. Finally, using a pool of post-processing tools, we present the phonon spectra and dispersions, confirming previous indications about the effect of phonon dispersion and charge mobility. In addition, we consider in an effective way the coexistence of more polymorphs and the possible role of defects and energy disorder.

Title: Direct imaging of disordered residual oxygen and its impact on electronic structure in an infinite-layer nickelate superlattice
Authors: Chao Yang, Hongguang Wang, Roberto A. Ortiz, Kelvin Anggara, Eva Benckiser, Bernhard Keimer, Peter A. van Aken
Abstract: Infinite layer nickelates have garnered significant attention due to their potential for high-temperature superconductivity. Despite extensive research, the interplay between oxygen stoichiometry and electronic properties in infinite layer nickelates remains inadequately understood. In this study, we employ advanced electron microscopy techniques and theoretical modeling to directly visualize the distribution of residual oxygen within an 8NdNiO$_2$/2SrTiO$_3$ superlattice, providing novel insights into its structural and electronic effects. Our multislice ptychography analysis reveals a disordered arrangement of apical oxygen atoms, even in regions with low residual oxygen occupancy, invisible in conventional projected images but discernible in depth-resolved phase contrast images. This disordered distribution suggests the formation of local domains with varying degrees of oxygenation, leading to significant structural distortions. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy reveals inhomogeneous hole doping, which may influence the occurrence of superconductivity. Complementary density functional theory calculations show how residual oxygen and associated structural distortions, such as pyramidal and octahedral configurations, alter the electronic structure. Although superconductivity was not observed in the studied superlattice, our findings highlight the critical influence of residual oxygen in shaping electronic phases and suggest that precise control of oxygen stoichiometry is essential in infinite layer nickelates.

Title: 1D fluids with repulsive nearest-neighbour interactions: Low-temperature anomalies
Authors: Igor Travěnec, Ladislav Šamaj
Abstract: A limited number of 2D and 3D materials under a constant pressure contract in volume upon heating isobarically; this anomalous phenomenon is known as the negative thermal expansion (NTE). In this paper, the NTE anomaly is observed in 1D fluids of classical particles interacting pairwisely with two competing length scales: the hard-core diameter $a$ and the finite range $a'>a$ of a soft repulsive potential component. If $a'\le 2a$, the pair interactions reduce themselves to nearest neighbours which permits a closed-form solution of thermodynamics in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble characterized by temperature $T$ and pressure $p$. We focus on the equation of state (EoS) which relates the average distance between particles (reciprocal density) $l$ to $T$ and $p\ge 0$. The EoS is expressible explicitly in terms of elementary or special functions for specific, already known and new, cases like the square shoulder, the linear and quadratic ramps as well as certain types of logarithmic interaction potentials. The emphasis is put on low-$T$ anomalies of the EoS. Firstly, the equidistant ground state as the function of the pressure can exhibit, at some ``compressibility'' pressures, a jump in chain spacing from $a'$ to $a$. Secondly, the analytical structure of the low-$T$ expansion of $l(T,p)$ depends on ranges of $p$-values. Thirdly, the presence of the NTE anomaly depends very much on the shape of the core-softened potential.

Radovic, J. Osiecki, C. Polley, D.A. Sokolov, A. P. Mackenzie, E. Berg, A. Georges, P.J.W. Moll, A. Tamai, F. Baumberger
Abstract: Interacting electrons can form metallic states beyond the Fermi liquid paradigm, a conceptual frontier of many-body physics mainly explored via bulk thermodynamics and transport. In contrast, the microscopics of anomalous single-particle excitations underlying non-Fermi liquid properties have largely remained in the dark. Here we spectroscopically map such quantum-critical excitations in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under uniaxial pressure, an experimental challenge overcome by technical advances combining focused ion beam micro-milling with laser angle resolved photoemission. We show that quasiparticle excitations acquire a non-Fermi liquid scattering rate near the critical point but remain remarkably robust throughout the transition. These experiments serve as a benchmark for the theory of anomalous metals and settle the long-standing question if quantum-critical systems host quasiparticle excitations.

Title: Learning to reset in target search problems
Authors: Gorka Muñoz-Gil, Hans J. Briegel, Michele Caraglio
Abstract: Target search problems are central to a wide range of fields, from biological foraging to the optimization algorithms. Recently, the ability to reset the search has been shown to significantly improve the searcher's efficiency. However, the optimal resetting strategy depends on the specific properties of the search problem and can often be challenging to determine. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to train agents capable of optimizing their search efficiency in environments by learning how to reset. First, we validate the approach in a well-established benchmark: the Brownian search with resetting. There, RL agents consistently recover strategies closely resembling the sharp resetting distribution, known to be optimal in this scenario. We then extend the framework by allowing agents to control not only when to reset, but also their spatial dynamics through turning actions. In this more complex setting, the agents discover strategies that adapt both resetting and turning to the properties of the environment, outperforming the proposed benchmarks. These results demonstrate how reinforcement learning can serve both as an optimization tool and a mechanism for uncovering new, interpretable strategies in stochastic search processes with resetting.

Title: Manipulation of Majorana wave packets at surfaces of nodal noncentrosymmetric superconductors
Authors: Clara J. Lapp, Julia M. Link, Carsten Timm
Abstract: Nodal noncentrosymmetric superconductors can host zero-energy flat bands of Majorana surface states within the projection of the nodal lines onto the surface Brillouin zone. Thus, these systems can have stationary, localized Majorana wave packets on certain surfaces, which may be a promising platform for quantum computation. Such applications require protocols to manipulate the wave packets in order to move them without destroying their localization or coherence. As a step in this direction, we explore the idea that the surface states have a nontrivial spin polarization, which can couple for example to the magnetization of a ferromagnetic insulator in contact to the surface, via an exchange term in the Hamiltonian. Such a coupling can make the previously flat bands weakly dispersive. We aim to model the motion of spatially localized wave packets under the influence of an exchange field which is changed adiabatically. We calculate the time-evolved wave packet for a model system and discuss which factors influence the direction of motion and the broadening of the wave packet.

Title: Hamiltonian Heat Baths, Coarse-Graining and Irreversibility: A Microscopic Dynamical Entropy from Classical Mechanics
Authors: Mingnan Ding, Michael E. Cates
Abstract: The Hamiltonian evolution of an isolated classical system is reversible, yet the second law of thermodynamics states that its entropy can only increase. This has confounded attempts to identify a `Microscopic Dynamical Entropy' (MDE), by which we mean an entropy computable from the system's evolving phase-space density $\rho(t)$, that equates {\em quantitatively} to its thermodynamic entropy $S^{\rm th}(t)$, both within and beyond equilibrium. Specifically, under Hamiltonian dynamics the Gibbs entropy of $\rho$ is conserved in time; those of coarse-grained approximants to $\rho$ show a second law but remain quantitatively unrelated to heat flow. Moreover coarse-graining generally destroys the Hamiltonian evolution, giving paradoxical predictions when $\rho(t)$ exactly rewinds, as it does after velocity-reversal. Here we derive the MDE for an isolated system XY in which subsystem Y acts as a heat bath for subsystem X. We allow $\rho_{XY}(t)$ to evolve without coarse-graining, but compute its entropy by disregarding the detailed structure of $\rho_{Y|X}$. The Gibbs entropy of the resulting phase-space density $\tilde\rho_{XY}(t)$ comprises the MDE for the purposes of both classical and stochastic thermodynamics. The MDE obeys the second law whenever $\rho_X$ evolves independently of the details of Y, yet correctly rewinds after velocity-reversal of the full XY system.

Title: Carbon magneto-ionics: Control of magnetism through voltage-driven carbon transport

Costa-Krämer, Alberto Quintana, Aina Garcia-Tort, Javier Herrero-Martín, Huan Tan, Ignasi Fina, Florencio Sánchez, Aitor F. Lopeandia, Josep Nogués, Eva Pellicer, Jordi Sort, Enric Menéndez
Abstract: Control of magnetism through voltage-driven ionic processes (i.e., magneto-ionics) holds potential for next-generation memories and computing. This stems from its non-volatility, flexibility in adjusting the magnitude and speed of magnetic modulation, and energy efficiency. Since magneto-ionics depends on factors like ionic radius and electronegativity, identifying alternative mobile ions is crucial to embrace new phenomena and applications. Here, the feasibility of C as a prospective magneto-ionic ion is investigated in a Fe-C system by electrolyte gating. In contrast to most magneto-ionic systems, Fe-C presents a dual-ion mechanism: Fe and C act as cation and anion, respectively, moving uniformly in opposite directions under an applied electric field. This leads to a 7-fold increase in saturation magnetization with magneto-ionic rates larger than 1 emu cm-3 s-1, and a 25-fold increase in coercivity. Since carbides exhibit minimal cytotoxicity, this introduces a biocompatible dimension to magneto-ionics, paving the way for the convergence of spintronics and biotechnology.

Title: Toughness of double network hydrogels: the role of reduced stress propagation
Authors: Samuel B. Walker, Suzanne M. Fielding
Abstract: Double network hydrogels show remarkable mechanical performance, combining high strength and fracture toughness with sufficient stiffness to bear load, despite containing only a low density of cross-linked polymer molecules in water. We introduce a simple mesoscale model of a double network material, detailed enough to resolve the salient microphysics of local plastic bond breakage, yet simple enough to address macroscopic cracking. Load sharing between the networks results in a delocalisation of stress such that the double network inherits both the stiffness of its stiff-and-brittle sacrificial network and the ductility of its soft-and-ductile matrix network. The underlying mechanism is a reduction in the Eshelby stress propagator between sacrificial bonds, inhibiting the tendency for the plastic failure of one sacrificial bond to propagate stress to neighbouring sacrificial bonds and cause a follow-on cascade of breakages. The mechanism of brittle macroscopic cracking is thereby suppressed, giving instead ductile deformation via diffusely distributed microcracking.

Title: Metamagnetic ripples in the UTe2 high magnetic field phase diagram

Abstract: The heavy fermion metamagnet uranium ditelluride possesses two distinct magnetic field--induced superconducting states. One of these superconductive phases resides at magnetic fields immediately below a first-order metamagnetic transition to a field--polarized paramagnetic state at a field strength $H_m$, while the other exists predominantly above $H_m$. However, little is known about the microscopic properties of this polarized paramagnetic state. Here we report pulsed magnetic field measurements tracking the evolution of $H_m$ for polar and azimuthal inclinations in the vicinity of the crystallographic $b-a$ plane. We uncover a region of the phase diagram at high fields $>$ 50 T with a ripple-like non-monotonic dependence of $H_m$ on the orientation of field. Within this ripple in the metamagnetic transition surface, $H_m$ exhibits an anomalous temperature dependence. Our results point towards the presence of complex magnetic interactions and possible magnetic sub-phases at high magnetic fields in UTe$_2$, which may have important implications for the manifestation of exotic field-induced superconductivity.

Title: A spinless crystal for a high-performance solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clock
Authors: Harry W. T. Morgan, James E. S. Terhune, Ricky Elwell, Hoang Bao Tran Tan, Udeshika C. Perera, Andrei Derevianko, Eric R. Hudson, Anastassia N. Alexandrova
Abstract: Solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clocks require a host material whose band gap is larger than the 8.4 eV nuclear transition energy. As such, excitation of the $^{229}$Th nuclear state has so far only been demonstrated in metal fluorides, specifically CaF$_2$, LiSrAlF$_6$, and ThF$_4$, where the large electronegativity of the halogen leads to sufficient band gaps. However, it is expected that the nuclear magnetic moment of the fluorine gives rise to a leading order broadening mechanism that limits the clock stability. Here, we use concepts of molecular design to identify a polyatomic anion, SO$_4^{2-}$, that is both nuclear spin free and of sufficient electron affinity to result in a high band gap metal sulfate system. Using state-of-the-art calculations, we find that the band gap of Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ is approximately 9 eV, large enough for direct laser excitation of $^{229}$Th. Low concentrations of $^{229}$Th in the otherwise spinless $^{232}$Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ crystal mitigate $^{229}$Th-$^{229}$Th interactions. Furthermore, the introduction of $^{229}$Th does not modify the material band gap nor introduce electronic states associated with nuclear quenching. By removing one of the primary sources of nuclear line broadening in the crystal, the nuclear magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, a nuclear clock with instability as low as $\sigma = 4.6\times10^{-23}/\sqrt{\tau}$, where ${\tau}$ is the averaging time, may be realized. This is roughly six orders of magnitude lower than previously thought possible.

Title: The stress tensor of dilute active colloidal suspensions
Authors: Pierre Gaspard
Abstract: The stress tensor is calculated for dilute active suspensions composed of colloidal Janus particles propelled by self-diffusiophoresis and powered by a chemical reaction. The Janus particles are assumed to be spherical and made of catalytic and non-catalytic hemispheres. The chemical reaction taking place on the catalytic part of each Janus particle generates local molecular concentration gradients at the surface of the particle and, thus, an interfacial velocity slippage between the fluid and the solid particle, which is the propulsion mechanism of self-diffusiophoresis. In the dilute-system limit, the contributions of the suspended particles to the stress tensor are calculated by solving the chemohydrodynamic equations for the fluid velocity and the molecular concentrations around every Janus particle considered as isolated and far apart from each other. The results are the following. First, the well-known Einstein formula for the effective shear viscosity of colloidal suspensions is recovered, including the effect of a possible Navier slip length. Next, two further contributions are obtained, which depend on the molecular concentrations of the fuel and product species of the chemical reaction and on the orientation of the Janus particles. The second contribution is caused by simple diffusiophoresis, which already exists in passive suspensions with global concentration gradients and no reaction. The third contribution is due to the self-diffusiophoresis generated by the chemical reaction, which arises in active suspensions. The calculation gives quantitative predictions, which depend on the constitutive properties of the fluid and the fluid-solid interfaces, as well as on the geometry of the Janus particles.

Title: Collective Dynamics in Active Polar Polymer Assemblies
Authors: Hossein Vahid, Jens-Uwe Sommer, Abhinav Sharma
Abstract: Active polymers respond to spatial activity gradients by autonomously migrating, a behavior central to biological self-organization and the design of intelligent synthetic materials. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate how the structure and propulsion direction of tangentially driven active polymers (TDAPs) determine their collective response to activity gradients. We show that TDAP assemblies exhibit strikingly different behaviors based on their organization: inward-directed arms form compact bundles that accumulate in low-activity regions, whereas outward-directed arms assemble into asters that undergo directed motion toward high-activity regions. Remarkably, mixed structures, comprising both inward- and outward-directed arms, display enhanced accumulation in the high-activity regions due to cooperative effects. Our results establish a fundamental link between polymer geometry and emergent transport, providing key design principles for programmable active materials.

Title: Charge-transfer-mediated boron magneto-ionics: Towards voltage-driven multi-ion transport
Authors: Zheng Ma, Karim-Alexandros Kantre, Huan Tan, Maciej O. Liedke, Javier Herrero-Martín, Eric Hirschmann, Andreas Wagner, Alberto Quintana, Eva Pellicer, Josep Nogués, Johan Meersschaut, Jordi Sort, Enric Menéndez
Abstract: Voltage control of magnetism via magneto-ionics, where ion transport and/or redox processes drive magnetic modulation, holds great promise for next-generation memories and computing. This stems from its non-volatility and ability to precisely tune both the magnitude and speed of magnetic properties in an energy-efficient manner. However, expanding magneto-ionics to incorporate novel mobile ions or even multiple ion species is crucial for unlocking new phenomena and enabling multifunctional capabilities. Here, we demonstrate voltage-driven multi-ion transport in a FeBO system with increasing oxygen content, progressively transitioning from an electrostatic-like response to a more pronounced electrochemical (magneto-ionic) behavior. The voltage-driven transport of both B and Fe is activated by oxidation state tuning, owing to the larger electronegativity of oxygen. Such charge-transfer effects allow multi-ion magneto-ionics, where O ions move oppositely to Fe and B ions. These results pave the way for programmable functionalities by leveraging elements with different electron affinities through charge-transfer engineering.

Title: Deconfined quantum criticality in a frustrated Haldane chain with single-ion anisotropy
Authors: Niels T. Pronk, Bowy M. La Rivière, Natalia Chepiga
Abstract: We report a phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic spin-1 chain with nearest-neighbor Heisenberg and three-site interactions in the presence of single-ion anisotropy. We show that the Gaussian and Ising transitions that separate the topological Haldane phase from the two anisotropic phases eventually fuse into a higher symmetry point characterized by the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) SU(2)$_2$ critical theory providing a lattice realization of the conformal embedding. On the other side of the WZW multi-critical point, the Ising transition reappears together with the distinct and exotic $c=1$ transition belonging to the eight-vertex universality class. This transition, which separates the dimerized and Ising antiferromagnetic phases - two ordered phases with incompatible order parameters - is thus a one-dimensional realization of a deconfined quantum criticality.

Title: Quantum geometry in the dynamics of band-projected operators
Authors: Chen Xu, Andreas Haller, Suraj Hegde, Tobias Meng, Thomas L. Schmidt
Abstract: We study the dynamics of electrons in crystalline solids in the presence of inhomogeneous external electric and magnetic fields. We present a manifestly gauge-invariant operator-based approach without relying on a semiclassical wavepacket construction, and derive the field-induced corrections to the equations of motion at the operator level. This includes the Berry curvature induced anomalous velocity and contributions arising from the quantum geometry of the Bloch bands. We show explicitly how these multi-band effects are manifested in an effective single band approximation. We present a formalism that allows for a systematic expansion to an arbitrary order in the inhomogeneity of the applied fields, as well as a way to compute the matrix elements in Bloch basis.

Title: Coherent suppression of high harmonics in Dirac materials
Authors: Wolfgang Hogger, Alexander Riedel, Debadrito Roy, Angelika Knothe, Cosimo Gorini, Juan-Diego Urbina, Klaus Richter
Abstract: High-harmonic generation in solids by intense laser pulses provides a fascinating platform for studying ultra-fast electron dynamics and material properties, where the coherent character of the electron dynamics is a central aspect. Using the semiconductor Bloch equations, we expound a mechanism suppressing the high harmonic spectrum arising from the coherent superposition of intra- vs inter-band contributions to the total signal. We provide evidence for the generality of this phenomenon by extensive numerical simulations exploring the parameter space of this coherent suppression of high harmonics in systems of massive Dirac Fermions. We supplement our numerical observations with analytical results for the one-dimensional case. Moreover, we demonstrate reentrant behavior of suppressed high harmonics upon increasing dephasing.

Title: Spontaneous flexoelectricity in cubic lead-halide perovskite MAPbBr$_3$
Authors: Dmytro Rak, Dusan Lorenc, Ayan A. Zhumekenov, Osman M. Bakr, Zhanybek Alpichshev
Abstract: Lead-halide perovskites exhibit remarkable efficiency in photovoltaics, driven by exceptionally long carrier diffusion lengths and recombination times. Paradoxically, this performance persists even in defect-rich, solution-grown samples. Here, we use a suite of optical and charge transport measurements to reveal that key optoelectronic properties of perovskites arise from localized flexoelectric polarization confined to the interfaces between domains of spontaneous strain, present even in nominally cubic single crystals. This insight provides a microscopic link between structural composition and charge transport in these materials, reconciling conflicting prior observations and offering new design principles for perovskite-based solar cells.

Title: Influence of tip materials on the friction force microscopy of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001): comparison of diamond and silicon tips in experiments and atomistic simulations
Authors: Mohammad Zarshenas, Takuya Kuwahara, Bartosz Szczefanowicz, Andreas Klemenz, Lars Pastewka, Gianpietro Moras, Roland Bennewitz, Michael Moseler
Abstract: Friction force microscopy (FFM) with silicon tips on epitaxial graphene supported by SiC(0001) previously revealed a sharp increase in friction at a threshold normal force, linked to the intermittent rehybridization of graphene and the formation of single-layer diamond above 12 GPa. In this study, the FFM behavior of a diamond tip is compared with that of the silicon tip. The diamond tip exhibited a similar abrupt increase in friction, but the threshold normal force was approximately twice as high for comparable tip radii. Simulations of graphene on SiC(0001) sliding against hydroxylated amorphous carbon (a-C) and silicon oxide (SiO2) slabs show that both systems exhibit low shear stress at low pressures, which increases at higher pressures due to bond formation between the graphene and counter slabs. The pressure dependence differs slightly: SiO2 reaches a shear stress plateau around 6 GPa, while a-C continues to increase gradually. For a-C, the transition threshold shifts to higher pressures, consistent with FFM results. Temperature lowers the transition threshold significantly, while sliding velocity has minimal impact on shear stress. These findings provide insights into the stability of low-friction interfaces between epitaxial graphene and the key materials which come into contact with graphene in current micro-electro-mechanical systems.

Authors: Alex Kreuzer, Thilo Krumrey, Hossam Tohamy, Alexandru Ionita, Hannes Rotzinger, Alexey V. Ustinov
Abstract: Low-loss inductors are essential components in various superconducting circuits, such as qubits or digital electronics. In this study, we investigate highly compact inductors formed by vertical stacking of Josephson junctions. Our implementation employs multiple layers of aluminum separated by tunnel barriers. Individual stacks are connected by suspended superconducting bridges, which are free of additional dielectric materials and therefore should not contribute significantly to losses. We present implementation details, fabrication results, and device characterization measurements.

Title: Variational Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo Built on Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
Authors: Yueyi Wang, Kristjan Haule
Abstract: We develop a variational perturbation expansion around dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) that systematically incorporates nonlocal correlations beyond the local correlations treated by DMFT. We apply this approach to investigate how the DMFT critical temperature is suppressed from its mean-field value and how the critical behavior near the finite-temperature phase transition evolves from the mean-field to the Heisenberg universality class. By identifying the breakdown of paramagnetic diagrammatic expansions as a signature of the N'{e}el transition, we accurately predict the N'{e}el temperature of the three-dimensional cubic Hubbard model across all interaction strengths with low computational cost. Introducing a variational order parameter, our method can be applied to both paramagnetic and long-range ordered states, such as antiferromagnetic order. We compute magnetization, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and single-particle spectral functions, demonstrating minor corrections to DMFT solutions in the weak-coupling regime while revealing significant modifications to these properties in the intermediate correlation regime. From the analysis of critical exponents, we establish the emergence of Heisenberg critical behavior beyond the mean-field nature of DMFT.

Title: Controllable Antiferromagnetic-Ferromagnetic phase transition in monolayer MnPSe3 via atomic adsorption of Li, O, and F
Authors: Dong Liu, Sike Zeng, Ji-Hai Liao, Yu-Jun Zhao
Abstract: The engineering of magnetic order and electronic states in two-dimensional (2D) materials is pivotal for advanced spintronic technologies. Despite their potential, the scarcity of intrinsic 2D ferromagnets remains a critical challenge. Here, we employ density functional theory with Hubbard-U corrections to systematically investigate adsorbate-driven magnetic transitions in monolayer MnPSe3. While pristine MnPSe3 exhibits antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with a semiconducting gap, Li, O, and F adatom adsorption induces an AFM-to-ferromagnetic (AFM-FM) phase transition across large coverage ranges. Our calculations reveal enhanced thermodynamic stability at elevated coverages, with full-coverage configurations (Li0.5MnPSe3, MnPSe3O0.5, MnPSe3F0.5) favored energetically. Hybrid functional (HSE06) calculations show that F adsorption drives a semiconductor-to-half-metal transition, whereas Li and O adsorption preserves semiconductivity. Moreover, Li adsorption induces a valley splitting of 20.3 meV at the K1 and K2 points in the band structure of the monolayer MnPSe3. Magnetic anisotropy analysis reveals adsorbate-dependent easy-axis reorientation: Li (electron doping) switches the easy-axis from in-plane to out-of-plane, while O/F (hole doping) stabilizes in-plane easy-axis, consistent with carrier-density-modulation simulations. Crucially, carrier doping results indicate that once the electron doping concentration reaches critical concentration, the magnetic easy axis of monolayer MnPSe3 transitions from in-plane to out-of-plane. This work establishes atomic adsorption as a robust strategy for tailoring 2D magnetism, resolving discrepancies through rigorous treatment of exchange-correlation effects and configurational diversity.

Title: Revealing Superconducting Chiral Edge Modes via Resistance Distributions
Authors: Linghao Huang, Dongheng Qian, Jing Wang
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states offers a promising route to realize topological superconductivity with chiral Majorana edge modes. However, the definitive identification of these modes is challenging. Here we propose detecting superconducting chiral edge modes via the probability distribution of the resistance, or equivalently the charge transmission of QAH-superconductor heterojunctions. Remarkably, the distribution for coherent edge exhibits distinct characteristics for different topological superconducting phases in sufficiently long junctions, and this difference remains robust against weak decoherence. These findings provide new insights into transport phenomena beyond the clean limit and highlight the resistance distribution as a compelling signature for distinguishing topological superconducting phases.

Title: Applications of Superconductor-Normal Metal Interfaces

Abstract: The importance and non-trivial properties of superconductor normal metal interfaces was discovered by Alexander Fyodorovich Andreev more than 60 years ago. Only much later these hybrids have found wide interest in applications such as thermometry and refrigeration, electrical metrology, and quantum circuit engineering. Here we discuss the central properties of such interfaces and describe some of the most prominent and recent applications of them.

Title: Testing Kubo formula on a nonlinear quantum conductor driven far from equilibrium via power exchanges
Authors: Zubair Iftikhar, Jonas Müller, Yuri Mukharsky, Philippe Joyez, Patrice Roche, Carles Altimiras
Abstract: We present an experimental test of Kubo formula performed on a nonlinear quantum conductor, a Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction, driven far from equilibrium by a DC voltage bias. We implement the proposal of Lesovik and Loosen [1] and demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to extract both the emission and absorption noise of the conductor by measuring the power it exchanges with a linear detection circuit whose occupation is tuned close to vacuum levels. We then compare their difference to the real part of the admittance which is independently measured by coherent reflectometry, finding that Kubo formula holds within experimental accuracy.

Title: Edge disorder and magnetism in graphene nanoribbons: an inverse modelling approach
Authors: Shardul Mukim, Meric E. Kucukbas, Stephen R. Power, Mauro S. Ferreira
Abstract: It is difficult to completely eliminate disorder during the fabrication of graphene-based nanodevices. From a simulation perspective, it is straightforward to determine the electronic transport properties of disordered devices if complete information about the disorder and the Hamiltonian describing it is available. However, to do the reverse and determine information about the nature of the disorder purely from transport measurements is a far more difficult task. In this work, we apply a recently developed inversion technique to identify important structural information about edge-disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbons. The inversion tool decodes the electronic transmission spectrum to obtain the overall level of edge vacancies in this type of device. We also consider the role of spin-polarised states at the ribbon edges and demonstrate that, in addition to edge roughness, the inversion procedure can also be used to detect the presence of magnetism in such nanoribbons. We finally show that if the transmission for both spin orientations is available, for example by using ferromagnetic contacts in a transport measurement, then additional structural information about the relative concentration of defects on each edge can be derived.

Title: Partial Backscattering between Helical Edge States Revealed by Energy-Selective Interferometry
Authors: Jonas Erhardt, Mattia Iannetti, Fernando Dominguez, Ewelina M. Hankiewicz, Björn Trauzettel, Gianni Profeta, Domenico Di Sante, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Simon Moser, Ralph Claessen
Abstract: The protection against backscattering of spin-momentum-locked metallic edge states makes quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) highly appealing for spintronic applications, offering exceptional resilience against non-magnetic disorder. This protection arises from the time-reversal symmetry of helical edge modes with opposite spin and momentum, which prohibits single-particle backscattering within a single Kramers pair. However, backscattering remains possible between energy-degenerate helical edge states not linked by time-reversal symmetry, as can occur in strongly non-linear edge dispersions with multiple Kramers pairs. Here, we investigate inter-Kramers pair backscattering in the non-linear edge bands of the QSHI indenene, highlighting a critical aspect of edge-state stability. Using quasiparticle interference in scanning tunneling spectroscopy -- a direct probe of backscattering -- we observe pairwise coupling of energy-degenerate helical edge states, while energy regions with only a single Kramers pair remain strictly protected. Supported by theoretical analysis, our findings extend the conventional understanding of backscattering protection beyond idealized linear dispersions to more realistic, nonlinear edge-mode configurations. This insight has profound implications for numerous QSHI candidates, emphasizing that the mere presence of gap-traversing edge modes does not inherently guarantee their topological protection.

Title: Complex Magnetic Ordering in Candidate Topological Superconductors

Abstract: The search for chiral topological superconductivity in magnetic topological insulator (TI)-FeTe heterostructures is a key frontier in condensed matter physics, with potential applications in topological quantum computing. The combination of ferromagnetism, superconductivity, and topologically nontrivial surface states brings together the key elements required for chiral Majorana physics. In this work, we examine the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity at the interfaces between FeTe and a series of TI overlayers. In superconducting MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/FeTe, any interfacial suppression of antiferromagnetism must affect at most a few nanometers. On the other hand, (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$/FeTe layers exhibit near-total suppression of antiferromagnetic ordering. Ferromagnetic Cr$_x$(Bi,Sb)$_{2-x}$Te$_3$ (CBST)/FeTe bilayers exhibit net magnetization in both CBST and FeTe layers, with evidence of interactions between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. These observations identify magnetic TI/FeTe interfaces as an exceptionally robust platform to realize chiral topological superconductivity.

Title: Real-time edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices
Authors: Tian-Hua Yang, Chen Fang
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic forms of the Green's function at the open edges of general non-Hermitian band systems in all dimensions in the long-time limit, using a modified saddle-point approximation and the analytic continuation of the momentum. The edge dynamics is determined by the "dominant saddle point", a complex momentum, which, contrary to previous conjectures, may lie outside the generalized Brillouin zone. From this result, we obtain the effective edge Hamiltonians that evidently, as demonstrated by extensive numerical simulations, characterize the dynamics on the edges, and can be probed in real-time experiments or spectroscopies.

Title: Perfect Stabilization of Biomolecular Adhesions under Load
Authors: Anton F. Burnet, Julia Müllner, Benedikt Sabass
Abstract: Cells attach to their environment by means of focal adhesions, which are molecular complexes that exhibit the remarkable ability to adapt to mechanical load by changing their size. Drawing from the biomolecular mechanisms underlying this behavior, we present a generic model for mechanically induced adhesion growth where conformational states of molecules already in the adhesion cluster are coupled to the adsorption of further molecules. For sufficiently strong coupling, an instability arises and unbounded system growth ensues in the absence of mechanical load. Unexpectedly, the same type of instability can lead to perfect stability under mechanical load, whereby adhesion clusters adjust their size to withstand arbitrarily large forces without breaking, a phenomenon we term perfect stabilization. We derive state diagrams that characterize adhesion stability under stationary loads and show that perfect stabilization also occurs under dynamic loading on physiologically relevant timescales. Finally, we show that perfect stabilization and related instabilities are generic phenomenona that can be realized in many different ways if internal molecule states are coupled to adsorption in nonequilibrium.

Title: Exact Results for the Ericson Transition in Stochastic Quantum Scattering and Experimental Validation
Authors: Simon Köhnes, Jiongning Che, Barbara Dietz, Thomas Guhr
Abstract: At lower energies, the resonances in scattering experiments are often isolated. The crucial parameter is the ratio of average resonance width and average mean level spacing. Towards larger energies, this parameter grows, because the resonances overlap. Eventually the cross-section becomes a random function and the scattering matrix elements follow a universal Gaussian distribution. For more than sixty years, this Ericson transition awaits a concise analytical treatment. We provide a complete solution within the Heidelberg approach which provides a full-fledged model of the scattering process. As a side result, we obtain explicit formulae for the moments of the distributions. We compare with microwave experiments.

Title: Slow magnetic quantum oscillations in the c-axis magnetoresistance of UTe$_2$
Authors: Freya Husstedt, Motoi Kimata, Sajal Naduvile Thadathil, Beat Valentin Schwarze, Markus König, Gerard Lapertot, Jean-Pascal Brison, Georg Knebel, Dai Aoki, J. Wosnitza, Toni Helm
Abstract: Details of the electronic band structure in unconventional superconductors are key to the understanding of their fundamental ground state. The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.

Title: Single-site quadrupolar Kondo effect in a diluted non-Kramers doublet system Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Ir$_2$Zn$_{20}$ for $x = 0.028$ viewed from magnetization
Authors: Yu Yamane, Takahiro Onimaru, Yasuyuki Shimura, Suguru Tsuda, Kazunori Umeo, Toshiro Takabatake
Abstract: A diluted non-Kramers doublet system Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Ir$_2$Zn$_{20}$ is a promising candidate for exhibiting single-site quadrupolar (two-channel) Kondo effect. We have measured temperature-dependent magnetization of a sample for $x$ = 0.028 down to 0.1 K at various constant magnetic fields to extract the characteristic behaviors due to the quadrupolar Kondo effect. The Curie--Weiss fit to the magnetic susceptibility between 50 and 300 K yields a negative paramagnetic Curie temperature of $-$7.0 K, indicative of on-site antiferromagnetic interaction. The magnetization divided by magnetic field, $M(T)/B$, at $B = 0.5$ T is saturated to a constant value below 3 K. On the contrary, in higher magnetic fields of $B$ = 1 and 2 T, $M(T)/B$ exhibits $-$ln$T$ dependence from 1 to 0.1 K, which temperature dependence is consistent with that of the quadrupolar susceptibility detected from ultrasonic measurements. The $-$ln$T$ form of $M(T)/B$ appears to reflect the behavior of quadrupolar susceptibility, through the magnetic-field-induced magnetic moment due to the mixing of the non-Kramers doublet and crystalline-electric-field excited states of Pr$^{3+}$. In $B$ = 4 T, $M(T)/B$ approaches a constant on cooling below 0.3 K, because of the quenching of the quadrupoles in the field-induced singlet ground state.

Title: Tuning Charge Order in $κ$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br, Cl) via Uniaxial Strain
Authors: Jesse Liebman, Svetlana Torunova, John A. Schlueter, Elena Zhilyaeva, Natalia Drichko
Abstract: The BEDT-TTF (BEDT-TTF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafuvalene) based Mott insulators of the form $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br,Cl) host a correlated electron system on a triangular lattice of (BEDT-TTF)$^{+1}_2$ dimers. Each dimer lattice site carries one hole and one S=1/2 spin which interacts antiferromagnetically. Anionic substitution has been shown to tune across a charge order transition, where unequal share of the hole between the molecules of a dimer site results in electronic ferroelectricity. We demonstrate successful tuning across the charge order transition via uniaxial strain. We use Raman scattering spectroscopy to study the local charge state and collective dipole fulctuations. We induce charge order at 33 K in the quantum dipole liquid material $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Br through application of tensile strain of 0.4% along the c-axis. We suppress charge order down to 10 K in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Cl by applying a tensile strain of 1.6% along the b-axis. We identify the softening of collective dipole fluctuations through the charge order transition, consistent with electronic ferroelectricity. We demonstrate tuning in both directions across a second-order ferroelectric phase transition via uniaxial strain.

Title: Ab initio study of exciton insulator phase: Emergent $\textit{p}$-wave spin textures from spontaneous excitonic condensation
Authors: Fang Zhang, Jiawei Ruan, Gurjyot Sethi, Chen Hu, Steven G. Louie
Abstract: An excitonic insulator$^{1,2}$ (EI) is a correlated many-body state of electron-hole pairs, potentially leading to high-temperature condensate and superfluidity$^{3-7}$. Despite ever-growing experiments suggesting possible EI states in various materials, direct proofs remain elusive and debated. Here we address the problem by introducing an ab initio methodology, enabling the parameter-free determination of electron-hole pairing order parameter and single-particle excitations within a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type formalism. Our calculations on monolayer 1T'-MoS$_{2}$$^{8,9}$ reveals that it is an unconventional EI with a transition temperature ~900K, breaking spontaneously the crystal's inversion, rotation, and mirror symmetries, while maintaining odd parity and unitarity. We identify several telltale spectroscopic signatures emergent in this EI phase that distinguish it from the band insulator (BI) phase, exemplified with a giant $\textbf{k}$-dependent $\textit{p}$-wave spin texture.

Title: Probing the Limit of Heat Transfer in Inorganic Crystals with Deep Learning

Abstract: Heat transfer is a fundamental property of matter. Research spanning decades has attempted to discover materials with exceptional thermal conductivity, yet the upper limit remains unknown. Using deep learning accelerated crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculation, we systematically explore the thermal conductivity landscape of inorganic crystals. We brute-force over half a million ordered crystalline structures, encompassing an extensive coverage of local energy minima in binary compounds with up to four atoms per primitive cell. We confirm diamond sets the upper bound of thermal conductivity within our search space, very likely also among all stable crystalline solids at ambient conditions. We identify over 20 novel crystals with high thermal conductivity surpassing silicon at room temperature validated by density functional theory. These include a series of metallic compounds, especially MnV, exhibiting high lattice and electronic thermal conductivity simultaneously, a distinctive feature not observed before. The fast deep learning-driven screening method, as well as the large comprehensive thermal conductivity database, pave the way for the discovery and design of next-generation materials with tailored thermal properties.

Title: Bosonized 1D quantum systems through enhanced Event-Chain Monte Carlo
Authors: Oscar Bouverot-Dupuis, Alberto Rosso, Manon Michel
Abstract: We design an enhanced Event-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to study 1D quantum dissipative systems, using their bosonized representation. Expressing the bosonized Hamiltonian as a path integral over a scalar field enables the application of Monte Carlo algorithms developed for classical systems. Specifically, we focus on a dissipative XXZ spin chain, exhibiting critical slowing down, minima degeneracy and long-range interactions. Addressing all three bottlenecks, we design an algorithm that combines local persistent Event-Chain Monte Carlo moves with global cluster moves, in a O(1)-complexity implementation. Through systematic performance analysis, we show that such an algorithm outperforms traditional Metropolis algorithms by more than a magnitude factor and is competitive with current state-of-the-art Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. We then use this approach to determine the dissipative spin chain's phase diagram, thereby reinforcing prior analytical predictions.

Title: Peak splitting and bias fields in ferroelectric hafnia mediated by interface charge effects
Authors: Moritz Engl, Wassim Hamouda, Ines Häusler, Suzanne Lancaster, Luca Carpentieri, Thomas Mikolajick, Catherine Dubourdieu, Stefan Slesazeck
Abstract: The pristine state of hafnium based ferroelectric devices exhibits various unwanted properties, such as imprint and peak splitting, which diminish with bipolar cycling. The incorporation of a niobium oxide layer at different positions in metal-ferroelectric-metal and metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal stacks is used to modify the pristine state of the device. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy measurements are used to investigate the influence of niobium oxide on the zirconium hafnium oxide layer. It is hypothesized that the charged vacancies generated by the introduced niobium oxide in the adjacent zirconium hafnium oxide layer result in an electric bias field that influences the pristine polarization state of the domains. A comparison of different stacks shows that peak splitting in the pristine state is most likely related to the formation of opposing electric bias fields in upwards and downwards polarized domains. Furthermore, the incorporation of niobium oxide in the zirconium hafnium oxide/aluminum oxide capacitor stack in between the ferroelectric and insulating layer leads to a peak splitting free device without imprint, which could be explained by the increased influence of charge trapping near the zirconium hafnium oxide-/niobium oxide and niobium oxide-/aluminum oxide interfaces.

Title: Quantum geometry and low-frequency optical conductivity of topological nodal planes
Authors: Raymond Wiedmann, Kirill Alpin, Moritz M. Hirschmann, Andreas P. Schnyder
Abstract: Nodal planes, two-dimensional symmetry-enforced band crossings, can carry a topological charge, similar to Weyl points. While the transport properties of Weyl points are well understood, those of nodal planes remain largely unexplored. These properties are influenced not only by the Berry curvature, but also by other quantum geometric quantities. In this work we study the quantum geometry - specifically the Berry curvature and quantum metric - and the linear optical conductivity of topological nodal planes. We introduce a low-energy model and investigate its low-frequency optical responses to determine the unique signatures of topological nodal planes. By comparing these findings to the optical response in a tight-binding model with a topological nodal plane, we observe consistent low-frequency behavior with a cubic power law. This paves the way for the experimental detection of topological nodal planes through optical conductivity measurements.

Title: Keldysh pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group for quantum magnetism
Authors: Janik Potten, Yasir Iqbal, Ronny Thomale, Tobias Müller
Abstract: The functional renormalization group (FRG) approach for spin models relying on a pseudo-fermionic description has proven to be a powerful technique in simulating ground state properties of strongly frustrated magnetic lattices. A drawback of the FRG framework is that it is formulated in the imaginary-time Matsubara formalism and thus only able to access static correlations, a limitation shared with most other many-body approaches. A description of the dynamical properties of magnetic systems is the key to bridging the gap between theory and neutron scattering spectra. We take the decisive step of expanding the scope of pseudo-fermion FRG to the Keldysh formalism, which, while originally developed to address non-equilibrium phenomena, enables a direct calculation of the equilibrium dynamical spin structure factors on generic lattices in arbitrary dimension. We identify the principal features characterizing the low-energy spectra of exemplary zero-, one- and two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg models as well as the Kitaev honeycomb model.

Title: Thermodynamics of the Hubbard Model on the Bethe Lattice
Authors: Jia-Lin Chen, Zhen Fan, Bo Zhan, Jiahang Hu, Tong Liu, Junyi Ji, Kang Wang, Hai-Jun Liao, Tao Xiang
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice with a coordination number of 3 using the thermal canonical tree tensor network method. Our findings reveal two distinct thermodynamic phases: a low-temperature antiferromagnetic phase, where spin SU(2) symmetry is broken, and a high-temperature paramagnetic phase. A key feature of the system is the separation of energy scales for charge and spin excitations, which is reflected in the temperature dependence of thermodynamic quantities and the disparity between spin and charge gaps extracted from their respective susceptibilities. At the critical point, both spin and charge susceptibilities exhibit singularities, suggesting that charge excitations are not fully decoupled from their spin counterparts. Additionally, the double occupancy number exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, indicative of an entropy-driven Pomeranchuk effect. These results demonstrate that the loopless Bethe lattice effectively captures the essential physics of the Hubbard model while providing a computationally efficient framework for studying strongly correlated electronic systems.

Title: Nodal superconducting gap structure and topological surface states of UTe$_2$
Authors: Hans Christiansen, Max Geier, Brian M. Andersen, Andreas Kreisel
Abstract: The heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$ is a candidate for hosting intrinsic spin-triplet superconductivity. At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.

Title: Excitability and oscillations of active droplets
Authors: Ivar S. Haugerud, Hidde D. Vuijk, Job Boekhoven, Christoph A. Weber
Abstract: In living cells, cycles of formation and dissolution of liquid droplets can mediate biological functions such as DNA repair. However, the minimal physicochemical prerequisite for such droplet oscillations remains elusive. Here, we present a simple model composed of only two independent chemical components with their diffusive and chemical fluxes governed by non-equilibrium thermodynamics. There is turnover of fuel that maintains a chemical reaction away from equilibrium, leading to active droplets. We find that a single active droplet undergoes a pitchfork-bifurcation in the droplet volume upon increasing the fueling strength. Strikingly, the active droplet becomes excitable upon adding a further chemical reaction. For sufficient fueling, the system undergoes self-sustained oscillations cycling between droplet formation and dissolution. The minimal nature of our model suggests self-sustained active droplets as functional modules for de novo life.

Title: Edge Exposure as the Trigger for Structural Instability in LP-N and HLP-N
Authors: Guo Chen, Xianlong Wang
Abstract: LP-N and HLP-N are promising high-energy-density materials. However, these materials synthesized under high pressure cannot be maintained stable at ambient conditions. The mechanism behind their instability remains unclear. Our research, based on first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, reveals that while not edge exposed, LP-N and HLP-N exhibit substantial structural, dynamic, and mechanical stability under ambient conditions. The stability of HLP-N is governed by an interlocking mechanism, which becomes ineffective upon exposure of the edges, leading to internal breakdown. As a result, H saturated adsorption has no impact on it. In contrast, LP-N benefits modestly from H saturated adsorption due to its edge-initiated dissociation. The interlocking mechanism offer valuable insights into the design of new materials.

Title: Altermagnetic splitting of magnons in hematite ($α$-Fe$_2$O$_3$)
Authors: Rhea Hoyer, P. Peter Stavropoulos, Aleksandar Razpopov, Roser Valentí, Libor Šmejkal, Alexander Mook
Abstract: We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to the hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field.

Title: Direct observation of angular momentum transfer among crystal lattice modes
Authors: Olga Minakova, Carolina Paiva, Maximilian Frenzel, Michael S. Spencer, Joanna M. Urban, Christoph Ringkamp, Martin Wolf, Gregor Mussler, Dominik M. Juraschek, Sebastian F. Maehrlein
Abstract: The discrete rotational symmetry of crystals leads to the conservation of quantized angular momentum in solids. While the exchange of energy and linear momentum between lattice vibrations (phonons) via anharmonic coupling is a cornerstone of solid-state physics, conservation and transfer of angular momentum within the lattice remains a postulate. Recently, phonon angular momentum, often in the form of chiral phonons, has been linked to giant magnetic fields, thermal Hall conductivity, dynamical multiferroicity, ultrafast demagnetization, or magnetic switching. However, the inherent process of phonon to phonon angular momentum transfer, fundamentally required to reach any magnetization equilibrium and imperative for all spin relaxation phenomena in solids, remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the coherent transfer of angular momentum from one lattice mode to another by establishing helical nonlinear phononics. We directly observe rotational phonon-phonon Umklapp scattering dictated by pseudo angular momentum conservation and the threefold rotational symmetry of the topological insulator bismuth selenide. We identify nonlinear phonon-phonon coupling as an angular momentum transfer channel, confirmed by our ab-initio calculations. Besides bearing universal implications for angular momentum dissipation abundant in nature, our work actively reverses the natural flow, leading to the nonlinear upconversion of lattice angular momentum. We thus open the field of helical and chiral nonlinear phononics, representing a selective handle for ultrafast control of spins, topology and chiral quasi-particles.

Title: Towards Markov-State Holography
Authors: Xizhu Zhao, Dmitrii E. Makarov, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: Experiments, in particular on biological systems, typically probe lower-dimensional observables which are projections of high-dimensional dynamics. In order to infer consistent models capturing the relevant dynamics of the system, it is important to detect and account for the memory in the dynamics. We develop a method to infer the presence of hidden states and transition pathways based on observable transition probabilities conditioned on history sequences for projected (i.e. observed) dynamics of Markov processes. Histograms conditioned on histories reveal information on the transition probabilities of hidden paths locally between any specific pair of observed states. The convergence rate of these histograms towards a stationary distribution provides a local quantification of the duration of memory, which reflects how distinct microscopic paths projecting onto the same observed transition decorrelate in path space. This provides insight about the hidden topology of microscopic paths in a holography-like fashion. The method can be used to test for the local Markov property of observables. The information extracted is also helpful in inferring relevant hidden transitions which are not captured by a Markov-state model.

Title: Large Thermal Hall Effect in MnPS3
Authors: Mohamed Nawwar, Robin R. Neumann, Jiamin Wen, Alexander Mook, Ingrid Mertig, Joseph P. Heremans
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the thermal Hall effect can originate from magnons (magnon Hall effect), phonons (phonon Hall effect), or their combination (magnon-polaron Hall effect). The magnon-polaron Hall effect, first observed in Fe2Mo3O8, is particularly intriguing as its thermal Hall signal can be remarkably large. In this study, we explore the thermal Hall effect in MnPS3, an insulating antiferromagnetic material exhibiting a spin-flop transition and significant magnetoelastic coupling, making it a strong candidate for studying the thermal Hall effect originating from spin-lattice coupling. We report an exceptionally large thermal Hall angle down to 4 K and show that it cannot be accounted for by standard calculations based on the intrinsic magnon-polaron Berry curvature. Our findings provide an in-depth analysis of the role of the spin-flop transition in the thermal properties of MnPS3 and call for further theory development on magnon-phonon coupling and scattering to reveal their influence on transverse heat transport.

Title: Quantum geometry and adiabaticity in molecules and in condensed matter
Authors: Raffaele Resta
Abstract: The adiabatic theorem states that when the time evolution of the Hamiltonian is "infinitely slow", a system, when started in the ground state, remains in the instantaneous ground state at all times. This, however, does not mean that the adiabatic evolution of a generic observable obtains simply as its expectation value over the instantaneous eigenstate. As a general principle there is an additional adiabatic term, of quantum-geometrical nature, which is the relevant one for several static or adiabatic observables. This is shown explicitly for the cases of polarizability and infrared tensors (in molecules and condensed matter); rotational g factor and magnetizability (in molecules only). Quantum geometry allows for a transparent derivation and a compact expression for these observables, alternative to the well known sum-over-states Kubo formulas.

Title: Quantum complexity in gravity, quantum field theory, and quantum information science
Authors: Stefano Baiguera, Vijay Balasubramanian, Pawel Caputa, Shira Chapman, Jonas Haferkamp, Michal P. Heller, Nicole Yunger Halpern
Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state, or implementing a unitary, using limited resources. Over the past decade, quantum-complexity research has surged. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter and quantum gravity. Different communities apply different tools to quantum complexity, as well as define complexity differently. This review bridges the disciplines' approaches. We cover multiple definitions of complexity, as well as their key properties and applications. In quantum information, random quantum circuits proved to be an invaluable tool in extracting properties of the complexity growth of discrete quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), complexity is defined geometrically through geodesics. Complexity can be defined also in terms of state or operator spreading and tensor-network concepts. In addition to reviewing these approaches, we outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models and QFTs, including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we detail the relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the anti-de Sitter-space (AdS)/CFT correspondence. This review thereby integrates recent quantum-complexity advances across fields.

Title: Chirality, magic, and quantum correlations in multipartite quantum states
Authors: Shreya Vardhan, Bowen Shi, Isaac H. Kim, Yijian Zou
Abstract: We introduce a notion of chirality for generic quantum states. A chiral state is defined as a state which cannot be transformed into its complex conjugate in a local product basis using local unitary operations. We introduce a number of quantitative measures of chirality which vanish for non-chiral states. A faithful measure called the "chiral log-distance" is defined in terms of the maximum fidelity between the state and its complex conjugate under local unitary transformations. We further introduce a set of computable measures that involve nested commutators of modular Hamiltonians. We show general relations between chirality and the amount of "magic" or non-stabilizer resource in a state. We first show that stabilizer states of qubits are non-chiral. Furthermore, magic monotones such as the stabilizer nullity and the stabilizer fidelity are lower-bounded by the chiral log-distance. We further relate chirality to discord-like quantum correlations. We define a measure of discord-like correlations called the intrinsic interferometric power, and show that it is lower-bounded by a nested commutator chirality measure. One interesting aspect of chirality is that it is not monotonic under local partial traces, indicating that it is a unique kind of resource that is not captured by traditional quantum resource theories.

Title: Simple Hamiltonians for Matrix Product State models
Authors: Norbert Schuch, Andras Molnar, David Perez-Garcia
Abstract: Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tensor Networks provide a general framework for the construction of solvable models. The best-known example is the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, which is the ground state of a 2-body nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonian. We show that such simple parent Hamiltonians for MPS models are, in fact, much more prevalent than hitherto known: The existence of a single example with a simple Hamiltonian for a given choice of dimensions already implies that any generic MPS with those dimensions possesses an equally simple Hamiltonian. We illustrate our finding by discussing a number of models with nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonians, which generalize the AKLT model on various levels.

Title: DNA Nanotechnology for Superradiance
Authors: Jaewon Lee, Sung Hun Park, Jangwon Kim, Kyung Hun Rho, Hoyoung Lee, Soyeon Kim, Seungwoo Lee
Abstract: Superradiance, first proposed by Dicke in 1954, is a highly efficient quantum light source that differs from conventional spontaneous emission. Unlike typical spontaneous emission, where intensity scales linearly with the number of electric dipoles, superradiance exhibits an intensity that scales quadratically with the number of electric dipoles. Similarly, the decay rate also increases proportionally to the dipole numbers. To realize superradiance, excited electric dipoles must be arranged in the same orientation with spacing much smaller than the wavelength of the excitation light. While previous studies have accidentally observed superradiance through the random aggregation of quantum dots and organic dyes, a deterministic approach for the materialization of superradiant has yet to be established. Herein, we (i) specifically outline the advantages of DNA nanotechnology in tackling this challenge, (ii) discuss the reasons why superradiance has not yet been realized even with the state-of-the art DNA nanotechnology, and (iii) propose potential solutions for overcoming the current limitations.

Title: Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Mutliwavelets and DMRG
Authors: Martina Nibbi, Luca Frediani, Evgueni Dinvay, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.

Title: Water is a superacid at extreme thermodynamic conditions
Authors: Thomas Thévenet, Axel Dian, Alexis Markovits, Sandro Scandolo, Arthur France-Lanord, Flavio Siro Brigiano
Abstract: The chemical behavior of water under extreme pressures and temperatures lies at the heart of processes shaping planetary interiors, influences the deep carbon cycle, and underpins innovative high-temperature, high-pressure synthesis of materials. Recent experiments reveal that hydrocarbons immersed in ionized water under extreme conditions transform into heavy hydrocarbons and nanodiamonds. However, the chemistry of water at extreme conditions and its role in hydrocarbon condensation remains poorly understood. Here, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with enhanced sampling techniques and machine-learning interatomic potentials, we show that increasing pressure at high temperature induces water ionization, creating a superacid-like environment that favors the protonation of hydrocarbons into transient pentacoordinated carbonium ions like CH$_5^+$. These elusive intermediates release molecular hydrogen and yield highly reactive carbocations, driving hydrocarbon chain growth toward nanodiamonds. We demonstrate how the combination of water ionization and pressure-induced methane polarization leads to superacid-driven hydrocarbon chemistry, famously known at far milder conditions. Our findings reveal, for the first time, a superacid aqueous regime and establish the existence of superacid chemistry under extreme conditions. Moreover, they provide a unifying reaction network that explains chemical transformations in environments such as planetary interiors and high pressure, high temperature experiments.

Title: A theory of ecological invasions and its implications for eco-evolutionary dynamics
Authors: Zhijie Feng, Emmy Blumenthal, Pankaj Mehta, Akshit Goyal
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of species invasions is a central goal of ecology, a task made especially challenging due to ecological feedbacks. To address this, we develop a general theory of ecological invasions applicable to a wide variety of ecological models: including Lotka-Volterra models, consumer resource models, and models with cross feeding. Importantly, our framework remains valid even when invading evolved (non-random) communities and accounts for invasion-driven species extinctions. We derive analytical expressions relating invasion fitness to invader abundance, shifts in the community, and extinction probabilities. These results can be understood through a new quantity we term ``dressed invasion fitness'', which augments the traditional notion of invasion fitness by incorporating ecological feedbacks. We apply our theory to analyze short-term evolutionary dynamics through a series of invasions by mutants whose traits are correlated with an existing parent. We demonstrate that, generically, mutants and parents can coexist, often by driving the extinction of low-abundance species. We validate theoretical predictions against experimental datasets spanning ecosystems from plants to microbial protists. Our work highlights the central role of ecological feedbacks in shaping community responses to invasions and mutations, suggesting that parent-mutant coexistence is widespread in eco-evolutionary dynamics.

Title: Fabrication of Metal Air Bridges for Superconducting Circuits using Two-photon Lithography
Authors: Yi-Hsiang Huang, Haozhi Wang, Zhuo Shen, Austin Thomas, C. J. K. Richardson, B. S. Palmer
Abstract: Extraneous high frequency chip modes parasitic to superconducting quantum circuits can result in decoherence when these modes are excited. To suppress these modes, superconducting air bridges (AB) are commonly used to electrically connect ground planes together when interrupted by transmission lines. Here, we demonstrate the use of two-photon photolithography to build a supporting 3D resist structure in conjunction with a lift-off process to create AB. The resulting aluminum AB, have a superconducting transition temperature $T_{c} = 1.08$ K and exhibit good mechanical strength up to lengths of 100 $\mu$m. A measurable amount of microwave loss is observed when 35 AB were placed over a high-$Q$ Ta quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonator.

Title: Resonant optical bistability in support of enhanced Rydberg atom sensors
Authors: Peter B. Weichman
Abstract: Radio frequency antennas based on highly excited Rydberg atom vapors can in principle reach sensitivities beyond those of any conventional wire antenna, especially at lower frequencies where very long wires are needed to accommodate the growing wavelength. Conventional Rydberg sensors are based on individual atom response, with increased signal resolution relying on the $O(10^3)$ electric dipole moment enhancement, scaling as the square of the Rydberg state principal quantum number $N \sim 50$. However, despite more than thirty years of steady advances, beyond-classical signal sensitivity has yet to be demonstrated. More recently, the optical bistability effect, a many body nonequilibrium phase transition occurring at somewhat higher vapor densities, has been exploited for an order of magnitude or more increased sensitivity for some setups through tuning into the critical region. However, the results fall significantly short of those using more advanced ``conventional'' Rydberg sensor setups -- which achieve even greater enhancement by exploiting resonant interaction between a pair of nearby Rydberg levels. This paper seeks to \emph{combine} the many body and resonant enhancement effects by extending the bistable phase analysis to include a pair of resonant Rydberg levels, supported by an exact treatment of the atom velocity thermal average. A dynamic linear response formalism is developed as well to explore the tradeoff between measurement sensitivity and finite bandwidth signals. We demonstrate regions of the phase diagram which could be exploited for record breaking, beyond-classical sensitivity. Of course, only a limited number of vapor parameters are under full experimental control, and experiments will be needed to quantitatively constrain the effective mean field interaction parameters appearing in the theory, and thereby define the accessible regions of the phase diagram.

Title: Surface Reaction Simulations for Battery Materials through Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization and Local Embedding
Authors: Marco Antonio Barroca, Tanvi Gujarati, Vidushi Sharma, Rodrigo Neumann Barros Ferreira, Young-Hye Na, Maxwell Giammona, Antonio Mezzacapo, Benjamin Wunsch, Mathias Steiner
Abstract: Accurate quantum chemistry calculations are essential for understanding electronic structures, yet exactly solving the many-body Schrödinger equation remains impractical due to electron correlation effects. While Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used, its inherent approximations limit its ability to capture strong correlation effects, particularly in surface reactions. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, especially for localized electron interactions. In this work, we apply a quantum embedding approach to study the Oxygen Reduction Reaction at Lithium battery electrode surfaces. We employ an active space selection strategy, using Density Difference Analysis to identify key orbitals, which are subsequently refined with coupled-cluster natural orbitals. These are treated using Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) and its extended version (Ext-SQD), leveraging the Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz for efficient state preparation on quantum hardware. Ext-SQD significantly improves upon standard SQD by incorporating excitation operators into the quantum-computed electron configurations used in classical Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction. Our approach demonstrates improved accuracy over Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) calculations over ground state energies. The results, validated against Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CASCI), whenever computationally feasible, and Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (HCI), provide new insights into $\mathrm{Li}$-$\mathrm{O_2}$ surface reactions, underscoring the potential of quantum computing in materials discovery and reaction modeling.

Title: Incident beam optics optimization for the single crystal neutron diffractometer Pioneer with a polarized beam option
Authors: Yaohua Liu, Peter Torres
Abstract: Pioneer, a next-generation single-crystal neutron diffractometer, is under development for Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Second Target Station (STS). Designed to address a wide range of scientific questions, Pioneer will deliver homogeneous neutron beams with customizable size and divergence, and provide a polarized beam option. This article introduces its incident beam optics, highlighting the optimization methodology and the simulated performance. Pioneer will utilize a modified elliptical-straight guide for neutron transport and deploy slit packages and insertable apertures to control beam size and divergence. The optimized guide geometry matches the optimal-and-full-sample-illumination condition, and the beam control system effectively filters out unwanted neutrons while preserving the desired ones. Additionally, we have found that polygon-approximated guides provide satisfactory transport efficiency and beam homogeneity, eliminating the need of truly curved guides. To enhance neutronics performance and reduce cost, the coatings of supermirror elements are individually optimized to the lowest half-integer $m$-values that are sufficient to deliver the desired neutrons. After evaluating polarizing V-cavities and $^3$He spin filters over the default polarized wavelength band of 1.2-5.5~Å, we selected a translatable multichannel polarizing V-cavity as the incident beam polarizer. Strategically placed at a location where the beam divergence is low and a large in-guide gap has negligible impact on transport efficiency, the optimized V-cavity achieves an average $P^2T$ of approximately 35\%.

Title: Quantum gate broadcasting on graphs
Authors: Hiroki Sukeno, Tzu-Chieh Wei
Abstract: Given a known or unknown phase encoded in a higher-dimensional qudit gate, it is possible to send copies of a gate that encodes the phase to multiple receivers based on a generalized quantum teleportation. We extend this quantum gate broadcast protocol to a quantum network on directed acyclic graphs in which agents can add phase gates to be distributed and pass unknown phase gates to subsequent receivers. Similarly to the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, we show that the resource state can be efficiently prepared in finite time.

Title: Charge Parity Rates in Transmon Qubits with Different Shunting Capacitors
Authors: Yi-Hsiang Huang, Haozhi Wang, Yizhou Huang, Sylvie McKnight-Milles, Zachary Steffen, B. S. Palmer
Abstract: The presence of non-equilibrium quasiparticles in superconducting resonators and qubits operating at millikelvin temperature has been known for decades. One metric for the number of quasiparticles affecting qubits is the rate of single-electron change in charge on the qubit island ($\textit i.e.$ the charge parity rate). Here, we have utilized a Ramsey-like pulse sequence to monitor changes in the parity states of five transmon qubits. The five qubits have shunting capacitors with two different geometries and fabricated from both Al and Ta. The charge parity rate differs by a factor of two for the two transmon designs studied here but does not depend on the material of the shunting capacitor. The underlying mechanism of the source of parity switching is further investigated in one of the qubit devices by increasing the quasiparticle trapping rate using induced vortices in the electrodes of the device. The charge parity rate exhibited a weak dependence on the quasiparticle trapping rate, indicating that the main source of charge parity events is from the production of quasiparticles across the Josephson junction. To estimate this source of quasiparticle production, we simulate and estimate pair-breaking photon absorption rates for our two qubit geometries and find a similar factor of two in the absorption rate for a background blackbody radiation temperature of $T^*\sim$ 350 mK.

Title: Preparing magnonic non-Gaussian states by adding a single magnon onto Gaussian states
Authors: Zi-Xu Lu, Huai-Bing Zhu, Xuan Zuo, Jie Li
Abstract: Quantum magnonics based on YIG spheres provides a new arena for observing macroscopic quantum states. Here we propose to prepare two kinds of non-Gaussian magnonic states by adding a single magnon onto two Gaussian states, namely, coherent and thermal states. We adopt an optomagnonic system of a YIG sphere and use fast optical pulses to weakly activate the magnon-induced Stokes scattering. Conditioned on the detection of a polarized single photon, a single magnon can be added onto an initial Gaussian state. We use a microwave cavity to prepare an initial magnon coherent state and finally read out the generated single-magnon added coherent or thermal state. Both the non-Gaussian states of a magnon mode in a large-size YIG sphere are macroscopic quantum states, which exhibit many nonclassical properties, such as sub-Poissonian statistics, quadrature squeezing, and a negative Wigner function. Further, both states show a smooth transition from a quantum state to a classical state by changing the coherent or thermal magnon excitations and thus can be used for the fundamental study of the quantum-to-classical transition.

Title: Dynamics of Quantum Correlations within the double Caldeira-Leggett formalism
Authors: S. V. Mousavi
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of decoherence and squeezing on the dynamics of various kinds of quantum features--local quantum coherence, local entropy, EPR correlations, and entanglement--in the high-temperature limit of the double Caldeira-Leggett model, focusing on initially squeezed states. We compare two scenarios: (1) particles interacting with distinct environments and (2) particles coupled to a common environment. Our analysis reveals that common environments better preserve local coherence over time, whereas distinct environments accelerate decoherence. Temperature enhances decoherence and suppresses coherence revivals, while squeezing affects transient dynamics but not long-term coherence saturation. Local entropy increases with temperature and squeezing, though their underlying physical mechanisms differ. EPR correlations degrade due to environmental interactions, with squeezing initially enhancing them but failing to prevent their eventual loss. Entanglement exhibits distinct behaviors: in separate environments, it undergoes sudden death, whereas in common environments, it experiences a dark period whose duration shortens with stronger squeezing. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how decoherence and squeezing influence quantum correlations in open quantum systems.

Title: Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Using $β$-MnO$_2$ Monolayer on Ni Electrode with Engineered Oxygen Vacancies
Authors: Faysal Rahman, Abdul Ahad Mamun, Auronno Ovid Hussain, Muhammad Anisuzzaman Talukder
Abstract: Developing cost-effective and high-performance electrodes is critical for advancing hydrogen (H$_2$) production through electrochemical water splitting. In this study, we present a novel electrode design by depositing a $\beta$-MnO$_2$ monolayer on a conventional Ni(100) substrate (MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100)) and systematically investigate its electrocatalytic properties. This work uniquely explores the influence of oxygen vacancies (OVs) at distinct sites -- Osub-top and bridge sites -- on both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our findings reveal that the Osub-top vacancy (OOV-MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100)) significantly enhances HER activity, achieving a hydrogen Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G_{\rm H}$) of $-0.015$ eV, which surpasses the performance of noble metals such as Pt/C ($-0.082$ eV) and Ir ($-0.08$ eV). Additionally, the cathodic exchange current density $(J_{0,c})$ of OOV-MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100) reaches $10^{-0.774}$ Acm$^{-2}$, outperforming Pt/C ($10^{-0.92}$ Acm$^{-2}$) and Ir ($10^{-1.44}$ Acm$^{-2}$). Electrochemical analysis confirms a cathodic activation overpotential $(\eta_{a,c})$ of 0.141 V at 10 mAcm$^{-2}$ in a 0.5 M H$_2$SO$_4$ solution, achieving a hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 0.91 mmolh$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ at an applied voltage ($V_{\rm app}$) of 1.60 V. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of site-specific oxygen vacancy effects on bifunctional MnO$_2$-based electrodes, demonstrating superior HER activity while maintaining dual functionality for both cathodic and anodic processes. Our results highlight the potential of engineered oxygen vacancies to develop low-cost, high-efficiency electrodes for sustainable hydrogen production, offering a competitive alternative to precious metal-based catalysts.

Title: Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models
Authors: Matteo Baggioli, Kyoung-Bum Huh, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Xuhao Jiang, Keun-Young Kim, Juan F. Pedraza
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we demonstrate that SVD fails to correctly reproduce the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.

Title: Ions at electrochemical interfaces: from explicit to implicit molecular solvent descriptions
Authors: Swetha Nair, Guillaume Jeanmairet, Benjamin Rotenberg
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between electronic screening inside a metal and screening by a polar molecular solvent, focusing on their impact on the charge induced by an ion and the solvent structure at the interface. To that end, we consider atomistically resolved electrodes within the Thomas-Fermi model of screening and describe the molecular solvent either explicitly via classical molecular dynamics or implicitly using Molecular Density Functional Theory (MDFT). Specifically, we examine the effect of screening by tuning the Thomas-Fermi screening length $l_\text{TF}$, the ion charge by considering Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ and the solvent nature by studying water and acetonitrile. Consistently with our previous findings without solvent, $l_\text{TF}$ significantly affects the charge distribution inside the metal. However, $l_\text{TF}$ has no significant impact on the interfacial solvent structure, suggesting that its effect on the charge distribution induced inside the metal by the ion is essentially due to how the metal responds to the (same) external charge distribution, including the solvent, even though the coupling between both sides of the interface may play a secondary role. Furthermore, MDFT accurately reproduces fine details of the interfacial solvent structure around the ion at a fraction of the computational cost of MD simulations. These results highlight the relevance of MDFT as a powerful tool to model electrochemical systems at the molecular level.

Title: Image Reconstruction from an Elastically Distorted Scan
Authors: Adrian Lopez, L. Mahadevan
Abstract: We consider the problem of inverting the artifacts associated with scanning a page from an open book, i.e. "xeroxing." The process typically leads to a non-uniform combination of distortion, blurring and darkening owing to the fact that the page is bound to a stiff spine that causes the sheet of paper to be bent inhomogeneously. Complementing purely data-driven approaches, we use knowledge about the geometry and elasticity of the curved sheet to pose and solve a minimal physically consistent inverse problem to reconstruct the image. Our results rely on 3 dimensionless parameters, all of which can be measured for a scanner, and show that we can improve on the data-driven approaches. More broadly, our results might serve as a "textbook" example and a tutorial of how knowledge of generative mechanisms can speed up the solution of inverse problems.

Title: Noise immunity in quantum optical systems through non-Hermitian topology
Authors: Jamison Sloan, Sachin Vaidya, Nicholas Rivera, Marin Soljačić
Abstract: Multimode nonlinear optical systems are highly valued for their ability to withstand large amounts of optical power, transmit data with high bandwidth, perform physical computations, generate quantum correlations, and much more. For many of these applications, both classical and quantum noise place limitations on important performance metrics. Moreover, it is well known that nonlinear systems tend to develop noise due to their sensitivity to initial conditions, thus motivating the development of general principles which can be used to control and mitigate noise in such systems. In this work, we show that non-reciprocity can enable the unidirectional flow of noise from the non-equilibrium steady states of nonlinear driven-dissipative systems. We demonstrate that this unidirectional flow results from the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) for quantum noise. This effect provides a robust mechanism for isolating parts of the system from degradation due to excess injected noise. Our findings may lead to novel design principles for multimode amplifiers or oscillators that support high power handling while mitigating the buildup of noise. Moreover, our approach provides a new means to connect non-Hermitian topology with nonlinear many-body systems, which is expected to lead to topological descriptions of interacting states of light.

Title: Path-integral approaches to strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems
Authors: Kilian Fraboulet
Abstract: The core of this thesis is the path-integral formulation of quantum field theory and its ability to describe strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems of finite size. Collective behaviors can be efficiently described in such systems through the implementation of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in mean-field approaches. However, as the thermodynamic limit does not make sense in finite-size systems, the latter can not exhibit any SSB and the symmetries which are broken down at the mean-field level must therefore be restored. The efficiency of theoretical approaches in the treatment of finite-size quantum systems can therefore be studied via their ability to restore spontaneously broken symmetries. In this thesis, a zero-dimensional $O(N)$ model is taken as a theoretical laboratory to perform such an investigation with many state-of-the-art path-integral techniques: perturbation theory combined with various resummation methods (Padé-Borel, Borel-hypergeometric, conformal mapping), enhanced versions of perturbation theory (transseries derived via Lefschetz thimbles, optimized perturbation theory), self-consistent perturbation theory based on effective actions (auxiliary field loop expansion (LOAF), Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism, 4PPI effective action, ...), functional renormalization group (FRG) techniques (FRG based on the Wetterich equation, DFT-FRG, 2PI-FRG). Connections between these different techniques are also emphasized. In addition, the path-integral formalism provides us with the possibility to introduce collective degrees of freedom in an exact fashion via Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations: the effect of such transformations on the aforementioned methods is also examined in detail.

Title: Theory of Intermediate Twinning and Spontaneous Polarization in Ferroelectric Potassium Sodium Niobate
Authors: Georgios Grekas, Patricia-Lia Pop-Ghe, Eckhard Quandt, Richard D. James
Abstract: Potassium sodium niobate is considered a prominent material system as a substitute for lead-containing ferroelectric materials. It exhibits first-order phase transformations and ferroelectricity with potential applications ranging from energy conversion to innovative cooling technologies, thereby addressing important societal challenges. However, a major obstacle in the application of potassium sodium niobate is its multi-scale heterogeneity and the lack of understanding of its phase transition pathway and microstructure. This can be seen from the findings of Pop-Ghe et al. (Ceram Int 47(14):20579-20585, 2021, this https URL) which also reveal the occurrence of a phenomenon they term intermediate twinning during the phase transition. Here, we show that intermediate twinning is a consequence of energy minimization. We develop a geometrically nonlinear electroelastic energy function for potassium sodium niobate, including the cubic-tetragonal-orthorhombic transformations and ferroelectricity. The construction of the minimizers is based on compatibility conditions which ensure continuous deformations and pole-free interfaces. These minimizers agree with the experimental observations, including laminates between tetragonal variants under the cubic to tetragonal transformation, crossing twins under the tetragonal to orthorhombic transformation, intermediate twinning and spontaneous polarization. This shows how the full nonlinear electroelastic model provides a powerful tool in understanding, exploring, and tailoring the electromechanical properties of complex ferroelectric ceramics.

Title: Encoding information onto the charge and spin state of a paramagnetic atom using MgO tunnelling spintronics
Authors: Mathieu Lamblin, Victor Da Costa, Loic Joly, Bhavishya Chowrira, Léo Petitdemange, Bertrand Vileno, Romain Bernard, Benoit Gobaut, Samy Boukari, Wolfgang Weber, Michel Hehn, Daniel Lacour, Martin Bowen
Abstract: An electrical current that flows across individual atoms can generate exotic quantum transport signatures in model junctions built using atomic tip or lateral techniques. So far, however, a viable industrial pathway for atom-driven devices has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate that a commercialized device platform can fill this nanotechnological gap. According to conducting tip atomic force microscopy, inserting C atoms into the MgO barrier of a magnetic tunnel junction generates nanotransport paths. Within magnetotransport experiments, this results in quantum interferences, and in Pauli spin blockade effects linked to tunneling magnetoresistance peaks that can be electrically controlled. We report an additional persistent memory effect that we attribute to the charging of a single "gating" C atom that is adjacent to a single C atom forming the microscale junction's effective nanotranport path. Local magnetometry experiments confirm the secondary role of magnetic stray fields on the C atoms. Our results show that, to exhibit atom-level properties, a device need not be nanoscaled, and position MgO tunneling spintronics as a promising platform to industrially implement quantum technologies.

Title: 2-Form U(1) Spin Liquids: Classical Model and Quantum Aspects
Authors: Kristian Tyn Kai Chung, Michel J. P. Gingras
Abstract: We introduce a novel geometrically frustrated classical Ising model, dubbed the "spin vorticity model", whose ground state manifold is a novel classical spin liquid, a "2-form Coulomb phase". We study the thermodynamics of this model both analytically and numerically, exposing the presence of algebraically decaying correlations and demonstrating an extensive ground state entropy, and give a comprehensive account of its ground state properties and excitations. Each classical ground state may be decomposed into collections of closed 2-dimensional membranes, supporting fractionalized string excitations attached to the boundaries of open membranes. At finite temperature, the model can then be described as a gas of closed strings in a background of fluctuating membranes. We demonstrate that the emergent gauge structure of the low-temperature phase is naturally captured in the formalism of 2-form electrodynamics, which describes 1-dimensional charged strings coupled to a rank-2 anti-symmetric gauge field. After establishing the classical spin vorticity model, we consider perturbing it with quantum exchange interactions, from which we derive an effective membrane exchange model of the quantum dynamics of these membranes, which maps to a frustrated 2-form U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show the existence of a fine-tuned Rokhsar-Kivelson point where the quantum ground state is an equal weight superposition of all classical ground state configurations. We further demonstrate how to quantize the string excitations, by coupling a 1-form string field to the emergent 2-form U(1) gauge field, thus mapping a quantum spin model to a 2-form gauge-Higgs model. We discuss the stability of the gapless deconfined phase of this gauge theory and the possibility of realizing a novel class of phases of quantum matter: 2-form U(1) quantum spin liquids.

Title: A quantum critical line bounds the high field metamagnetic transition surface in UTe$_2$

Abstract: Quantum critical phenomena are widely studied across various materials families, from high temperature superconductors to magnetic insulators. They occur when a thermodynamic phase transition is suppressed to zero temperature as a function of some tuning parameter such as pressure or magnetic field. This generally yields a point of instability - a so-called quantum critical point - at which the phase transition is driven exclusively by quantum fluctuations. Here we show that the heavy fermion metamagnet UTe$_2$ possesses a quantum phase transition at extreme magnetic field strengths of over 70 T. Rather than terminating at one singular point, we find that the phase boundary is sensitive to magnetic field components in each of the three Cartesian axes of magnetic field space. This results in the three-dimensional transition surface being bounded by a continuous ring of quantum critical points, the locus of which forms an extended line of quantum criticality - a novel form of quantum critical phase boundary. Within this quantum critical line sits a magnetic field-induced superconducting state in a toroidal shape, which persists to fields over 70~T. We model our data by a phenomenological free energy expansion, and show how a three-dimensional quantum critical phase boundary - rather than a more conventional singular point of instability - anchors the remarkable high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$.

Title: Electron-Phonon Coupling in Many-Body Perturbation Theory: Developments within the Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW approximation and LMTO Formalism
Authors: Savio Laricchia, Casey Eichstaedt, Dimitar Pashov, Mark van Schilfgaarde
Abstract: The calculation of electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling from first principles is a topic of great interest in materials science, offering a robust, non-empirical framework to understand and predict a wide range of physical phenomena. While significant progress has been made using the Kohn-Sham framework of density functional theory (KS-DFT), it is increasingly evident that standard approximations in KS-DFT often fall short of providing accurate results. These shortcomings are frequently linked to the non-local nature of the exchange-correlation potential, prompting the development of advanced methodologies within DFT and many-body perturbation theory. Despite these efforts, a highly reliable and efficient first-principles approach to accurately capture e-ph interactions remains elusive. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel field-theoretical methodology that integrates the foundational work of Baym and Hedin with the Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW (QSGW) approximation, implemented within the Questaal electronic structure suite. Our approach, based on a response function framework, ensures that Pulay-like incomplete-basis-set corrections are not required to account for changes in basis functions, paving the way for a high-fidelity description of e-ph coupling.

Title: Towards electrical domain-wall control in polyacetylene-based electronic nanodevices
Authors: Leandro M. Arancibia, Andrés I. Bertoni, Cristián G. Sánchez, Alejandro M. Lobos
Abstract: We theoretically propose a polymer-based nano-device consisting of a single trans-polyacetylene (tPA) molecule capacitively coupled to external voltage gates. We model the integrated device using a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)-like Hamiltonian, and we demonstrate the emergence of localized domain walls (DWs) with quantized charges (i.e., soliton excitations) localized at the gates. Interestingly, by increasing the applied voltage, multiple discrete charges can be accumulated, which may be useful for potential technological applications. Exploiting the topological character of the solitonic excitations of tPA, this device can be considered as an organic-based quantum dot with a very large and robust quantized charge.

Authors: T. R. Devidas, Dror Yahav, Jonathan T. Reichanadter, Shannon C. Haley, Matan Sterenberg, Joel E. Moore, Jeffrey B. Neaton, James G. Analytis, Beena Kalisky, Eran Maniv
Abstract: Materials that transition between metal and insulator, the two main states that distinguish all solids, are fascinating because they underlie many mysteries at the frontier of solid state physics. In 1T-TaS$_{2}$, the metal-insulator transition is linked to a metastable hidden state arising within a chiral charge density wave (CDW) whose basic nature remains an open question. In this work, we show that pulses of current through these materials create current-carrying filamentary channels that distinguish the 'metallic' hidden state and 'insulating' CDW states. These channels have remained dark to previous measurements, and yet are directly linked to the properties of the hidden state. We leverage the metastability of these conduction channels to demonstrate electrical control of their creation, erasure and location. Our findings show that physical elements, such as boundaries and interfaces, play a key role in the properties of the hidden state characterizing the metal-insulator transition. We suggest new possibilities for in-situ electrical design of synaptic components with possible applications to neuromorphic computing.

Title: Efficient first-principles approach to Gibbs free energy with thermal expansion
Authors: Kota Hashimoto, Tomonori Tanaka, Yoshihiro Gohda
Abstract: We propose a method to evaluate the Gibbs free energy from constant-volume first-principles phonon calculations. The volume integral of the pressure is performed by determining the volume and the bulk modulus in equilibrium at finite temperatures, where the pressure and its volume derivative are evaluated utilizing first-principles calculations of the Grüneisen parameter without varying the volume. We validate our method for fcc Al by comparing with the conventional quasiharmonic approximation. Furthermore, we integrate our method with self-consistent phonon theory and apply it to calculations for bcc Ti, hcp Ti, and tetragonal ZrO$_2$. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our method by comparing results with those obtained from directly volume-varied self-consistent phonon calculations. In all cases, our method accurately evaluates the free energy change due to thermal expansion using only constant-volume phonon calculations.

Title: Arresting Quantum Chaos Dynamically in Transmon Arrays
Authors: Rohit Mukherjee, Haoyu Guo, Keiran Lewellen, Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: Ergodic quantum many-body systems evolving under unitary time dynamics typically lose memory of their initial state via information scrambling. Here we consider a paradigmatic translationally invariant many-body Hamiltonian of interacting bosons -- a Josephson junction array in the transmon regime -- in the presence of a strong Floquet drive. Generically, such a time-dependent drive is expected to heat the system to an effectively infinite temperature, featureless state in the late-time limit. However, using numerical exact-diagonalization we find evidence of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency where the system develops {\it emergent} conservation laws, and {\it approximate} integrability. Remarkably, at these same set of points, the Lyapunov exponent associated with the semi-classical dynamics for the coupled many-body equations of motion drops by orders of magnitude, arresting the growth of chaos. We supplement our numerical results with an analytical Floquet-Magnus expansion that includes higher-order corrections, and capture the slow dynamics that controls decay away from exact freezing.

Abstract: Advances in 3D printing technology now enable the precise positioning of microscopic material voxels to form complex structures. Combined with emerging multi-material capabilities and printable responsive materials, this opens new possibilities for digital composite materials and 3D printing of shape-transforming structures, or 4D printing. Building upon these advancements, we devise a novel methodology for crafting digitized 4D-printed shape-transforming sheets. We 3D print responsive sheets composed of two layers, each consisting of active and passive voxels meticulously positioned to form thin structures that can be actuated on demand. Our approach solves a long-standing problem in the field, i.e., the independent and simultaneous programming of lateral geometry and reference curvature. This unprecedented control over the resulting shape unlocks new opportunities in synthetic shape-morphing materials, with potential applications in programmable mechanical properties and multi-material systems.

Title: Helicity modulus in the bilayer XY model by worm algorithm
Authors: A. Masini, A. Cuccoli, A. Rettori, A. Trombettoni, F. Cinti
Abstract: The behaviour of the helicity modulus has been frequently employed to investigate the onset of the topological order characterizing the low-temperature phase of the two-dimensional XY-model. We here present how the analysis based on the use of this key quantity can be applied to the study of the properties of coupled layers. To this aim, we first discuss how to extend the popular worm algorithm to a layered sample, and in particular to the evaluation of the longitudinal helicity, that we introduce taking care of the fact that the virtual twist representing the elastic deformation one applies to properly define the helicity modulus can act on a single layer or on all of them. We then apply the method to investigate the bilayer XY-model, showing how the helicity modulus can be used to determine the phase diagram of the model as a function of temperature and inter-layer coupling strength

Title: Chiral Gapless Spin Liquid in Hyperbolic Space
Authors: Felix Dusel, Tobias Hofmann, Atanu Maity, Rémy Mosseri, Julien Vidal, Yasir Iqbal, Martin Greiter, Ronny Thomale
Abstract: We analyze the Kitaev model on the $\{9,3\}$ hyperbolic lattice. The $\{9,3\}$ is formed by a regular 3-coordinated tiling of nonagons, where the 3-color coding of bonds according to the inequivalent Kitaev Ising spin couplings yields the natural generalization of the original Kitaev model for Euclidean regular honeycomb tiling. Upon investigation of the bulk spectrum for large finite size droplets, we identify a gapless chiral $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid state featuring spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking. Due to its non-commutative translation group structure, such type of hyperbolic spin liquid is conjectured to feature chiral quasiparticles with a potentially non-Abelian Bloch profile.

Title: Towards Verifying Exact Conditions for Implementations of Density Functional Approximations
Authors: Sameerah Helal, Zhe Tao, Cindy Rubio-González, Francois Gygi, Aditya V. Thakur
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used extensively in the computation of electronic properties of matter, with various applications. Approximating the exchange-correlation (XC) functional is the key to the Kohn-Sham DFT approach, the basis of most DFT calculations. The choice of this density functional approximation (DFA) depends crucially on the particular system under study, which has resulted in the development of hundreds of DFAs. Though the exact density functional is not known, researchers have discovered analytical properties of this exact functional. Furthermore, these exact conditions are used when designing DFAs. We present XCVerifier, the first approach for verifying whether a DFA implementation satisfies the DFT exact conditions. XCVerifier was evaluated on five DFAs from the popular Libxc library and seven exact conditions from recent work. XCVerifier was able to verify or find violations for a majority of the DFA/condition pairs, demonstrating the feasibility of using formal methods to verify DFA implementations.

Title: Nonlinear diode effect and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in purely two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric superconductors
Authors: Naratip Nunchot, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: Phase diagrams and electronic transport properties of the helical states in purely two-dimensional (2D) Rashba superconductors coupled with in-plane Zeeman fields are studied. The continuum XY action is derived microscopically by integrating out the Gaussian amplitude fluctuation from the effective action. We show that the superfluid stiffness obtained from this procedure is exactly equivalent to the second-order derivative of the mean-field free energy density with respect to Cooper pair momentum, indicating an essential role of the amplitude fluctuation. The vortex core energy is also included in this work, and its effects on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition line are discussed. The theory of nonlinear V-I characteristics in purely 2D superconductors is also revised to incorporate recent developments in the theory of the superconducting diode effect. The main results are as follows. We find that the nonlinear V-I characteristics of the system become nonreciprocal in finite in-plane Zeeman fields. This is reminiscent of the superconducting diode effect in 2D systems, although the critical current is zero in purely 2D superconductors. Furthermore, we find that the bare effective superfluid stiffness along the BKT transition line has a local minimum at a certain temperature, and the nonreciprocity of the V-I characteristics is strongly enhanced around this temperature.

Title: Giant Dynamical Paramagnetism in the driven pseudogap phase of $ \rm YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}$
Authors: Marios H. Michael, Duilio De Santis, Eugene A. Demler, Patrick A. Lee
Abstract: In the past decade, photo-induced superconducting-like behaviors have been reported in a number of materials driven by intense pump fields. Of particular interest is the high-$T_c$ cuprate $\rm Y Ba_2 Cu_2 O_{6+x}$ (YBCO), where such effect has been reported up to the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^* \sim 300-400$ K. In a recent tour-de-force experiment, a transient magnetic field which is proportional to and in the same direction of an applied field has been observed outside the sample, suggestive of flux exclusion due to the Meissner effect. In this paper, we point out that the transient magnetic field could be explained by a model of bilayers of copper-oxygen planes with a \textit{local} superconducting phase variable persisting up to the pseudo-gap temperature at equilibrium. Under pumping, the time evolution is described by a driven sine-Gordon equation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, this model exhibits a novel instability which amplifies the current at the edges of the bilayer formed by defects or grain boundaries, producing a giant paramagnetic magnetization in the same direction as the applied field. We show how this scenario can fit most of the available data. To the extent that this model can account for the data, we conclude that the experiments have the important consequence of revealing the presence of local pairing in the pseudogap phase. While the bulk of this paper addresses the experiment on YBCO, this work reveals a new instability in the sine-Gordon equation that is of fundamental interest, with potential applications such as providing a mechanism for amplifying external magnetic fields at ultra-fast time scales in Josephson devices.

Title: Non-equilibrium dynamics of superconductivity in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model
Authors: Ádám Bácsi, Balázs Dóra
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the superconducting order parameter in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. In the absence of superconductivity, its ground state is a non-Fermi liquid, whose properties are controlled by the HK interaction. Our protocol involves quantum quenching the HK interaction but leaving the interaction responsible for superconductivity unchanged. We map out the non-equilibrium dynamical phase diagram of the interacting model which contains three phases where, at long times, the order parameter amplitude vanishes, approaches a constant value or persistently oscillates. We also investigate the Loschmidt echo in searching for dynamical quantum phase transition, and find that its non-analytic temporal behaviour is close but does not match exactly the vanishing of the order parameter. The momentum space entanglement entropy between positive and negative momentum modes, relevant for Cooper pairing, is calculated. Counterintuitively, this momentum space entanglement does not change significantly during the quench dynamics and its value remains reasonably large even for vanishing superconducting order parameter. Nevertheless, its derivative with respect to the HK interaction signals the dynamical phase transition associated to the late time vanishing of superconductivity.

Title: On the phase diagram of extensive-rank symmetric matrix denoising beyond rotational invariance
Authors: Jean Barbier, Francesco Camilli, Justin Ko, Koki Okajima
Abstract: Matrix denoising is central to signal processing and machine learning. Its statistical analysis when the matrix to infer has a factorised structure with a rank growing proportionally to its dimension remains a challenge, except when it is rotationally invariant. In this case the information theoretic limits and an efficient Bayes-optimal denoising algorithm, called rotational invariant estimator [1,2], are known. Beyond this setting few results can be found. The reason is that the model is not a usual spin system because of the growing rank dimension, nor a matrix model (as appearing in high-energy physics) due to the lack of rotation symmetry, but rather a hybrid between the two. Here we make progress towards the understanding of Bayesian matrix denoising when the signal is a factored matrix $XX^\intercal$ that is not rotationally invariant. Monte Carlo simulations suggest the existence of a \emph{denoising-factorisation transition} separating a phase where denoising using the rotational invariant estimator remains Bayes-optimal due to universality properties of the same nature as in random matrix theory, from one where universality breaks down and better denoising is possible, though algorithmically hard. We argue that it is only beyond the transition that factorisation, i.e., estimating $X$ itself, becomes possible up to irresolvable ambiguities. On the theory side, we combine mean-field techniques in an interpretable multiscale fashion in order to access the minimum mean-square error and mutual information. Interestingly, our alternative method yields equations reproducible by the replica approach of [3]. Using numerical insights, we delimit the portion of phase diagram where we conjecture the mean-field theory to be exact, and correct it using universality when it is not. Our complete ansatz matches well the numerics in the whole phase diagram when considering finite size effects.

Title: Exact Replica Symmetric solution for transverse field Hopfield model under finite Trotter size
Authors: Koki Okajima, Yoshiyuki Kabashima
Abstract: We analyze the quantum Hopfield model in which an extensive number of patterns are embedded in the presence of a uniform transverse field. This analysis employs the replica method under the replica symmetric ansatz on the Suzuki-Trotter representation of the model, while keeping the number of Trotter slices $M$ finite. The statistical properties of the quantum Hopfield model in imaginary time are reduced to an effective $M$-spin long-range classical Ising model, which can be extensively studied using a dedicated Monte Carlo algorithm. This approach contrasts with the commonly applied static approximation, which ignores the imaginary time dependency of the order parameters, but allows $M \to \infty$ to be taken analytically. During the analysis, we introduce an exact but fundamentally weaker static relation, referred to as the quasi-static relation. We present the phase diagram of the model with respect to the transverse field strength and the number of embedded patterns, indicating a small but quantitative difference from previous results obtained using the static approximation.

Title: Probing moiré electronic structures through quasiparticle interference
Authors: Luke C. Rhodes, Dylan C. Houston, Olivia R. Armitage, Peter Wahl
Abstract: Moiré lattices are a general feature of bilayer structures, where an additional periodic superstructure is generated by either lattice mismatch or from a twist angle. They have been shown to stabilise new ground states, including unconventional superconductivity and Mott insulating phases, attributed to strong electron correlations. However, controlling these interactions requires a detailed understanding of the low energy electronic structure which is lacking so far. Probing the electronic structure is challenging due to sample inhomogeneity, the low characteristic energy scales involved and small sample sizes. Through quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) can overcome many of these challenges but requires detailed modelling to extract the $k$-space electronic structure. Here, we present realistic calculations of QPI in twisted bilayer structures, which accounts for the effect of the long range moiré lattice on the electronic structure as well as it's interaction at a defect. These calculations reveal that while the moiré supercell significantly reduces the size of the Brillouin zone, the QPI scattering vectors retain characteristics of the individual monolayers with distinct perturbations from the twisted geometry that can be directly linked back to the electronic structure. The procedure introduced here provides a general framework to use QPI to determine the low energy electronic structure in moiré lattice systems.

Title: Stability frontiers in the AM$_6$X$_6$ kagome metals: The LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Lu,Y) family and density-wave transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$
Authors: Brenden R. Ortiz, William R. Meier, Ganesh Pokharel, Juan Chamorro, Fazhi Yang, Shirin Mozaffari, Alex Thaler, Steven J. Gomez Alvarado, Heda Zhang, David S. Parker, German D. Samolyuk, Joseph A. M. Paddison, Jiaqiang Yan, Feng Ye, Suchismita Sarker, Stephen D. Wilson, Hu Miao, David Mandrus, Michael A. McGuire
Abstract: The kagome motif is a versatile platform for condensed matter physics, hosting rich interactions between magnetic, electronic, and structural degrees of freedom. In recent years, the discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductors and structurally-derived bond density waves in FeGe and ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ have stoked the search for new kagome platforms broadly exhibiting density wave (DW) transitions. In this work, we evaluate the known AM$_6$X$_6$ chemistries and construct a stability diagram that summarizes the structural relationships between the $\approx$125 member family. Subsequently we introduce our discovery of the broader LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Nd,Sm,Gd-Tm,Lu,Y) family of kagome metals and an analogous DW transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. Our X-ray scattering measurements clearly indicate a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) ordering wave vector ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ superlattice) and diffuse scattering on half-integer $L$-planes. Our analysis of the structural data supports the ``rattling mode'' DW model proposed for ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and paints a detailed picture of the steric interactions between the rare-earth filler element and the host Nb-Sn kagome scaffolding. We also provide a broad survey of the magnetic properties within the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ members, revealing a number of complex antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions throughout the family. This work integrates our new LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ series of compounds into the broader AM$_6$X$_6$ family, providing new material platforms and forging a new route forward at the frontier of kagome metal research.

Title: Magnetic ground state of the dimer-based hexagonal perovskite Ba$_{3}$ZnRu$_{2}$O$_{9}$
Authors: S. Hayashida, H. Gretarsson, P. Puphal, M. Isobe, E. Goering, Y. Matsumoto, J. Nuss, H. Takagi, M. Hepting, B. Keimer
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic ground state of single crystals of the ruthenium-dimer-based hexagonal perovskite Ba$_{3}$ZnRu$_{2}$O$_{9}$ using magnetic susceptibility and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements. While a previous study on powder samples exhibited intriguing magnetic behavior, questions about whether the spin state within a Ru$_{2}$O$_{9}$ dimer is a conventional $S = 3/2$ dimer or an orbital-selective $S = 1$ dimer were raised. The RIXS spectra reveal magnetic excitations from Hund's intraionic multiplet and intradimer spin-triplet transitions. The observed transition energies of the Hund's intraionic multiplets align with the $S=3/2$ ground state, contrasting with the theoretically proposed orbital-selective $S=1$ dimer state. High-temperature magnetic susceptibility analysis confirms the realization of the spin $S=3/2$ dimer state, and the extracted intradimer coupling is consistent with the spin-triplet transition energy observed in the RIXS spectra. These results highlights the ability of "spectroscopic fingerprinting" by RIXS to determine the magnetic ground states of complex materials.

Title: Stroboscopic measurements in Markov networks: Exact generator reconstruction vs. thermodynamic inference
Authors: Malena T. Bauer, Udo Seifert, Jann van der Meer
Abstract: A major goal of stochastic thermodynamics is to estimate the inevitable dissipation that accompanies particular observable phenomena in an otherwise not fully accessible system. Quantitative results are often formulated as lower bounds on the total entropy production, which capture the part of the total dissipation that can be determined based on the available data alone. In this work, we discuss the case of a continuous-time dynamics on a Markov network that is observed stroboscopically, i.e., at discrete points in time in regular intervals. We compare the standard approach of deriving a lower bound on the entropy production rate in the steady state to the less common method of reconstructing the generator from the observed propagators by taking the matrix logarithm. Provided that the timescale of the stroboscopic measurements is smaller than a critical value that can be determined from the available data, this latter method is able to recover all thermodynamic quantities like entropy production or cycle affinities and is therefore superior to the usual approach of deriving lower bounds. Beyond the critical value, we still obtain tight upper and lower bounds on these quantities that improve on extant methods. We conclude the comparison with numerical illustrations and a discussion of the requirements and limitations of both methods.

Title: Quantum Geometry in Quantum Materials
Authors: Jiabin Yu, B. Andrei Bernevig, Raquel Queiroz, Enrico Rossi, Päivi Törmä, Bohm-Jung Yang
Abstract: Quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum geometric tensor, is pivotal in diverse physical phenomena in quantum materials. In condensed matter systems, quantum geometry refers to the geoemtric properties of Bloch states in the Brillouin zone. This pedagogical review provides an accessible introduction to the concept of quantum geometry, emphasizing its extensive implications across multiple domains. Specifically, we discuss the role of quantum geometry in optical responses, Landau levels, and fractional Chern insulators, as well as its influence on superfluid weight, spin stiffness, exciton condensates, electron-phonon coupling, etc. By integrating these topics, we underscore the pervasive significance of quantum geometry in understanding emergent behaviors in quantum materials. Finally, we present an outlook on open questions and potential future directions, highlighting the need for continued exploration in this rapidly developing field.

Title: Three-body scattering hypervolume of two-component fermions in three dimensions
Authors: Jiansen Zhang, Zipeng Wang, Shina Tan
Abstract: We study the zero-energy collision of three fermions, two of which are in the spin-down ($\downarrow$) state and one of which is in the spin-up ($\uparrow$) state. Assuming that the two-body and the three-body interactions have a finite range, we find a parameter, $D$, called the three-body scattering hypervolume. We study the three-body wave function asymptotically when three fermions are far apart or one spin-$\uparrow$ (spin-$\downarrow$) fermion and one pair, formed by the other two fermions, are far apart, and derive three asymptotic expansions of the wave function. The three-body scattering hypervolume $D$ appears in the coefficients of such expansions at the order of $B^{-5}$, where $B=\sqrt{(s_1^2+s_2^2+s_3^2)/2}$ is the hyperradius of the triangle formed by the three fermions (we assume that the three fermions have the same mass), and $s_1,s_2,s_3$ are the sides of the triangle. We compute the $T$-matrix element for three such fermions colliding at low energy in terms of $D$ in the absence of two-body interactions. When the interactions are weak, we calculate $D$ approximately using the Born expansion. We also analyze the energy shift of three two-component fermions in a large periodic cube due to $D$ and generalize this result to the many-fermion system. $D$ also determines the three-body recombination rates in two-component Fermi gases, and we calculate the three-body recombination rates in terms of $D$ and the density and temperature of the gas.

Title: Relative knot probabilities in confined lattice polygons
Authors: EJ Janse van Rensburg, E Orlandini, MC Tesi
Abstract: In this paper we examine the relative knotting probabilities in a lattice model of ring polymers confined in a cavity. The model is of a lattice knot of size $n$ in the cubic lattice, confined to a cube of side-length $L$ and with volume $V=(L{+}1)^3$ sites. We use Monte Carlo algorithms to approximately enumerate the number of conformations of lattice knots in the confining cube. If $p_{n,L}(K)$ is the number of conformations of a lattice polygon of length $n$ and knot type $K$ in a cube of volume $L^3$, then the relative knotting probability of a lattice polygon to have knot type $K$, relative to the probability that the polygon is the unknot (the trivial knot, denoted by $0_1$), is $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1) = p_{n,L}(K)/p_{n,L}(0_1)$. We determine $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1)$ for various knot types $K$ up to six crossing knots. Our data show that these relative knotting probabilities are small so that the model is dominated by lattice polygons of knot type the unknot. Moreover, if the concentration of the monomers of the lattice knot is $\varphi = n/V$, then the relative knot probability increases with $\varphi$ along a curve that flattens as the Hamiltonian state is approached.

Title: Discovery of a large magnetic nonlinear Hall effect in an altermagnet
Authors: Lei Han, Xizhi Fu, Cheng Song, Yuxiang Zhu, Xiaokang Li, Zengwei Zhu, Hua Bai, Ruiyue Chu, Jiankun Dai, Shixuan Liang, Maciej Sawicki, Junwei Liu, Feng Pan
Abstract: Since Edwin Halls groundbreaking discovery of the Hall effect in 1879, magnetism, spin, and quantization have been expanding the scope of Hall effects, continuously driving transformative progress in science and technology. Among them, the latest nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), where longitudinal electric field tunes quantum geometry to generate nonlinear Hall voltage, attracts wide attention as a sensitive probe of topological phases across a wide range of materials. Here, we report a new Hall effect member: the magnetic nonlinear Hall effect (MNLHE), characterized by a quadratic Hall conductivity dependence on magnetic field, rather than electric field as in NLHE. This finding relies on an altermagnet, Mn5Si3 thin film, whose alternating-sign Berry curvatures ensure higher-order MNLHE clearly distinguishable from the first-order anomalous Hall effect. The observed quadratic dependence originates from chiral next-nearest-neighbor hopping processes that acquire magnetic-exchange-driven Zeeman energies and Haldane-like chiral flux phases. Remarkably, this MNLHE is non-analytic, as reversing the magnetic field flips the alternating spin-splitting bands and reverses the hopping chirality, which is absent in traditional NLHE. Beyond offering a distinctive transport fingerprint for altermagnet Mn5Si3 thin film, this MNLHE is large and unsaturated up to 60 T, providing opportunities for pulsed high-field sensing technologies in both fundamental researches and engineering applications.

Title: Towards a global phase diagram of Ce-based dipolar-octupolar pyrochlore magnets under magnetic fields
Authors: Zhengbang Zhou, Yong Baek Kim
Abstract: Recent experiments have established a strong case for Ce$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf)$_2$O$_7$ to host $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI). However, an irrefutable conclusion still requires strong, multifaceted evidence. In dipolar-octupolar (DO) compounds, external magnetic fields only strongly couple with the dipolar component $\tau_z$ along its local z-axis in contrast to octupolar components $\tau^{x,y}$. This gives rise to the unique ways magnetic fields interact with the system and, in turn, provides us with a variety of tuning knobs to generate comprehensive experimental results. In this work, we focus on magnetic fields along the (110), (111), and (001) directions and present a plethora of remarkable experimental signatures to probe the underlying physics of $\pi$-flux QSI using gauge mean field theory (GMFT) and Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we present unique signatures in magnetic field-dependent phase diagrams, equal-time and dynamical structure factors, and magnetostriction.

Title: Fractional topological states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene modulated by kagome superlattice
Authors: Yanran Shi, Bo Xie, Fengfan Ren, Xinyu Cai, Zhongqing Guo, Qiao Li, Xin Lu, Nicolas Regnault, Zhongkai Liu, Jianpeng Liu
Abstract: Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects realized in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and multilayer-graphene-based moiré heterostructures have captured a tremendous growth of interest. In this work, we propose that rhombohedral multilayer graphene coupled with an artificial kagome superlattice potential is a new platform to realize various fractional topological phases. Taking Bernal bilayer graphene as the simplest example, when it is placed on top of a prepatterned SiO$_2$ substrate with periodic arrays of holes arranged into kagome lattice, the system would be subject to a tunable kagome superlattice potential once an electrostatic voltage drop between the top and bottom gates is applied. Then, we theoretically study the electronic band structures, topological properties, and quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states of Bernal bilayer graphene coupled with a realistic kagome superlattice potential, which is well benchmarked by transport measurements in the weak superlattice-potential regime. We find that the system may exhibit nearly ideal topological flat bands in a substantial region of the parameter space spanned by superlattice constant and electrostatic potential strength. When these topological flat bands are fractionally filled, exact diagonalization calculations suggest that the system would exhibit rich fractional topological phases at 1/3, 2/3, 2/5, 3/5 and 1/2 fillings including both fractional Chern insulators and anomalous composite Fermi liquids under zero magnetic field.

Title: In situ growth and magnetic characterization of Cr Chloride monolayers
Authors: Giuseppe Buccoliero, Pamella Vasconcelos Borges Pinho, Marli Dos Reis Cantarino, Francesco Rosa, Nicholas B. Brookes, Roberto Sant
Abstract: Monolayer Chromium Dihalides and Trihalides materials can be grown on a variety of substrates by molecular beam epitaxy regardless of the lattice mismatch thanks to the van der Waals epitaxy. In this work, we studied the magnetic nature of Cr Chloride monolayers grown on Au(111), Ni(111) and graphene-passivated Ni(111) from the evaporation in ultra-high vacuum of the same halide precursor. Structural, morphological and magnetic characterizations were conducted in situ by low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). Owing to opposite chemical behaviour, Au(111) and Ni(111) promote the formation of two different valence compounds, i.e. CrCl$_3$ and CrCl$_2$, showing distinct magnetic properties at 4 K. When graphene is used to passivate the Ni(111) surface, the formation of CrCl$_3$ becomes allowed also on this substrate. The coexistence of CrCl$_3$ and CrCl$_2$, both showing few nm lateral size and super-paramagnetic properties, is demonstrated by XMCD spectra displaying two dichroic peaks at the characteristic Cr$^{3+}$ and Cr$^{2+}$ energies. Site-selective magnetization measurements performed with the photon energy tuned on the two absorption edges show reversed magnetization of some of the CrCl$_2$ islands with respect to the CrCl3 domains, which is interpreted in terms of magnetic frustration.

Title: Molecular-dynamics study of diffusional creep in uranium mononitride
Authors: Mohamed AbdulHameed, Benjamin Beeler, Conor O.T. Galvin, Michael W.D. Cooper, Nermeen Elamrawy, Antoine Claisse
Abstract: Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising advanced nuclear fuel due to its high thermal conductivity and high fissile density. Yet, many aspects of its mechanical behavior and microstructural features are currently unknown. In this paper, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study UN's diffusional creep. Nanometer-sized polycrystals are used to simulate diffusional creep and to calculate an effective GB width. It is found that Nabarro-Herring creep is not dominant in the temperature range of 1700$-$2000 K and that the dominant diffusional creep mechanism is Coble creep with an activation energy of 2.28 $\pm$ 0.09 eV. A method is proposed to calculate the diffusional GB width and its temperature dependence in polycrystals. The effective GB width of UN is calculated as 2.69 $\pm$ 0.08 nm. This value fits very well with the prefactor of the phenomenological Coble creep formula. It is demonstrated that the most comprehensive thermal creep model for UN can be represented as the combination of our Coble creep model and the dislocation creep model proposed by Hayes et al.

Title: Observation of the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric Hall effect in tellurium
Authors: Tetsuya Nomoto, Akiko Kikkawa, Kazuki Nakazawa, Terufumi Yamaguchi, Fumitaka Kagawa
Abstract: The nonlinear thermoelectric effect is a key factor for realising unconventional thermoelectric phenomena, such as heat rectification and power generation using thermal fluctuations. Recent theoretical advances have indicated that chiral materials can host a variety of exotic nonlinear thermoelectric transport arising from inversion-symmetry breaking. However, experimental demonstration has yet to be achieved. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric Hall effect in chiral tellurium at room temperature, where a voltage is generated as a cross product of the temperature gradient and electric field. The resulting thermoelectric Hall voltage is on the order of {\mu}V, consistent with the prediction from the ab initio calculation. Furthermore, the sign of the thermoelectric Hall voltage is reversed depending on the crystal chirality, demonstrating a novel functionality of sign control of the thermoelectric effect by the chirality degrees of freedom. Our findings reveal the potential of chiral systems as nonlinear thermoelectric materials for advanced thermal management and energy harvesting.

Abstract: The intrinsic electronic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ have been selectively investigated by nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) at the La(2) site outside the NiO$_2$ bilayers. The La(2)$_{\rm a}$ site of the ideal La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ is clearly distinguished from the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site close to the local defects. Below 150K, almost half of the intrinsic La(2)$_{\rm a}$ sites are dominated by a finite internal field within the $ab$ plane, while the other half are dominated by zero internal field. The result is fully consistent with the single spin-spinless stripe order of ($\cdots\uparrow\circ\downarrow\circ\uparrow\circ\cdots$), where the reduced Ni magnetic moments are parallel to the $ab$-plane. Even for the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site, the result is also explained within the same model by considering the inhomogeneous internal magnetic fields enhanced around the nearby defects such as oxygen vacancies. These findings provide unambiguous microscopic evidence for the single spin-spinless stripe order below 150 K at ambient pressure.

Title: Evolution of Adaptive Force Chains in Reconfigurable Granular Metamaterials
Authors: Sven Witthaus, Atoosa Parsa, Dong Wang, Nidhi Pashine, Jerry Zhang, Arthur K. MacKeith, Mark D. Shattuck, Josh Bongard, Corey S. O'Hern, Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio
Abstract: Under an externally applied load, granular packings form force chains that depend on the contact network and moduli of the grains. In this work, we investigate packings of variable modulus (VM) particles, where we can direct force chains by changing the Young's modulus of individual particles within the packing on demand. Each VM particle is made of a silicone shell that encapsulates a core made of a low-melting-point metallic alloy (Field's metal). By sending an electric current through a co-located copper heater, the Field's metal internal to each particle can be melted via Joule heating, which softens the particle. As the particle cools to room temperature, the alloy solidifies and the particle recovers its original modulus. To optimize the mechanical response of granular packings containing both soft and stiff particles, we employ an evolutionary algorithm coupled with discrete element method simulations to predict the patterns of particle moduli that will yield specific force outputs on the assembly boundaries. The predicted patterns of particle moduli from the simulations were realized in experiments using 2D assemblies of VM particles and the force outputs on the assembly boundaries were measured using photoelastic techniques. These studies represent a step towards making robotic granular metamaterials that can dynamically adapt their mechanical properties in response to different environmental conditions or perform specific tasks on demand.

Title: Nonequilibrium hysteretic phase transitions in periodically light-driven superconductors
Authors: Huanyu Zhang, Kazuaki Takasan, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: We find nonequilibrium phase transitions accompanied by multiple (nested) hysteresis behaviors in superconductors coupled to baths under a time-periodic light driving. The transitions are demonstrated with a full phase diagram in the domain of the driving amplitude and frequency by means of the Floquet many-body theory. In the weak driving regime with a frequency smaller than half of the superconducting gap, excited quasiparticles are accumulated at the far edges of the bands, realizing a distribution reminiscent of the Eliashberg effect, which suddenly becomes unstable in the strong driving regime due to multi-photon-assisted tunneling across the gap mediated by the in-gap Floquet sidebands. We also show that superconductivity is enhanced in the weak driving regime without effective cooling, which is attributed to the modulation of the spectrum due to Floquet sidebands.

Title: Reexamining Circular Dichroism in Photoemission From a Topological Insulator
Authors: Ittai Sidilkover, Yun Yen, Sunil Wilfred D'Souza, Jakub Schusser, Aki Pulkkinen, Costel R. Rotundu, Makoto Hashimoto, Donghui Liu, Zhi-Xun Shen, Ján Minár, Michael Schüler, Hadas Soifer, Jonathan A. Sobota
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of electron states is an essential ingredient for topological and quantum geometric quantities in solids. For example, Dirac surface states with helical spin- and orbital-angular momenta are a hallmark of a 3D topological insulator. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with variable circular light polarization, known as circular dichroism (CD), has been assumed to be a direct probe of OAM and, by proxy, of the Berry curvature of electronic bands in energy- and momentum-space. Indeed, topological surface states have been shown to exhibit angle-dependent CD (CDAD), and more broadly, CD is often interpreted as evidence of spin-orbit coupling. Meanwhile, it is well-established that CD originates from the photoemission matrix elements, which can have extrinsic contributions related to the experimental geometry and the inherently broken inversion symmetry at the sample surface. Therefore, it is important to broadly examine CD-ARPES to determine the scenarios in which it provides a robust probe of intrinsic material physics. We performed CD-ARPES on the canonical topological insulator $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Se}_3$ over a wide range of incident photon energies. Not only do we observe angle-dependent CD in the surface states, as expected, but we also find CD of a similar magnitude in virtually all bulk bands. Since OAM is forbidden by inversion symmetry in the bulk, we conclude this originates from symmetry-breaking in the photoemission process. Comparison with theoretical calculations supports this view and suggests that $\textit{hidden}$ OAM - localized to atomic sites within each unit cell - contributes significantly. Additional effects, including inter-atomic interference and final-state resonances, are responsible for the rapid variation of the CDAD signal with photon energy.

Title: On the Automation of High Throughput Modeling of Adsorption In Porous Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks
Authors: Michael O. Atambo, Korir Kiptiemoi
Abstract: The zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) have emerged as a promising candidate for catalysis, carbon-dioxide (CO$_{2}$) capture and storage as well as flue gas separation due to their tunable porosity and chemical stability. ZIFs consists of transition metals in a tetrahedral coordination with imidazolate linkers, allowing for structural modifications that can enhance CO$_{2}$ adsorption and storage. To systematically design and optimize ZIFs for superior CO$_{2}$ capture performance, theoretical modelling provides an effective approach, though hindered by the sheer size of the search space, with hundred to thousands of possible sites per ZIF, and thousands of possible ZIF that can be synthesized. In this work, we employ a high-throughput techniques underpinned by first-principle Density Functional Theory (DFT) to develop a systematic automated method for characterizing adsorption energetics in ZIFs, guiding the rational design and selection of desirable ZIF structures. Using high-throughput computing tools, we perform pore and pore size analysis, and implement automated CO$_{2}$ molecule placement algorithm, accounting for positional symmetry, crystallographic orientation, and collision detection. The results obtained are in good agreement with previous studies, demonstrating the reliability of the approach in accelerating the discovery of next-generation ZIFs for CO$_{2}$ capture and storage.

Title: Spintronic memristors for computing
Authors: Qiming Shao, Zhongrui Wang, Yan Zhou, Shunsuke Fukami, Damien Querlioz, Leon O. Chua
Abstract: The ever-increasing amount of data from ubiquitous smart devices fosters data-centric and cognitive algorithms. Traditional digital computer systems have separate logic and memory units, resulting in a huge delay and energy cost for implementing these algorithms. Memristors are programmable resistors with a memory, providing a paradigm-shifting approach towards creating intelligent hardware systems to handle data-centric tasks. Spintronic nanodevices are promising choices as they are high-speed, low-power, highly scalable, robust, and capable of constructing dynamic complex systems. In this Review, we survey spintronic devices from a memristor point of view. We introduce spintronic memristors based on magnetic tunnel junctions, nanomagnet ensemble, domain walls, topological spin textures, and spin waves, which represent dramatically different state spaces. They can exhibit steady, oscillatory, stochastic, and chaotic trajectories in their state spaces, which have been exploited for in-memory logic, neuromorphic computing, stochastic and chaos computing. Finally, we discuss challenges and trends in realizing large-scale spintronic memristive systems for practical applications.

Title: Exact Quantum Dynamics, Shortcuts to Adiabaticity, and Quantum Quenches in Strongly-Correlated Many-Body Systems: The Time-Dependent Jastrow Ansatz
Authors: Jing Yang, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: The description of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium presents a fundamental challenge due to the vast amount of information it requires. We introduce a generalization of the Jastrow ansatz for time-dependent wavefunctions that offers an efficient and exact description of the time evolution of various strongly correlated systems. Previously known exact solutions are characterized by scale invariance, enforcing self-similar evolution of local correlations, such as the spatial density. However, we demonstrate that a complex-valued time-dependent Jastrow ansatz (TDJA) is not restricted to scale invariance and can describe a broader class of dynamical processes lacking this symmetry. The associated time evolution is equivalent to the implementation of a shortcut to adiabaticity (STA) via counterdiabatic driving along a continuous manifold of quantum states described by a real-valued TDJA, providing a framework for engineering exact STA in strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. We illustrate our findings in systems with inverse-square interactions, such as the Calogero-Sutherland and hyperbolic models, supplemented with pairwise logarithmic interactions, as well as in the long-range Lieb-Liniger model, where bosons experience both contact and Coulomb interactions in one dimension. Our results enable the study of quench dynamics in all these models and serve as a benchmark for numerical and quantum simulations of nonequilibrium strongly correlated systems with continuous variables.

Title: Light Dark Matter Search with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamonds
Authors: So Chigusa, Masashi Hazumi, Ernst David Herbschleb, Norikazu Mizuochi, Kazunori Nakayama
Abstract: We propose new ideas to directly search for light dark matter, such as the axion or the dark photon, by using magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds. If the dark matter couples to the electron spin, it affects the evolution of the Bloch vectors consisting of the spin triplet states, which may be detected through several magnetometry techniques. We give several concrete examples with the use of dc and ac magnetometry and estimate the sensitivity on dark matter couplings.

Title: Bound polariton states in the Dicke-Ising model
Authors: Juan Román-Roche, Álvaro Gómez-León, Fernando Luis, David Zueco
Abstract: We present a study of hybrid light-matter excitations in cavity QED materials using the Dicke-Ising model as a theoretical framework. Leveraging linear response theory, we derive the exact excitations of the system in the thermodynamic limit. Our results demonstrate that the cavity can localize spin excitations, leading to the formation of bound polaritons, where the cavity acts as an impurity of the two-excitation band, localizing spin-wave pairs around single-spin domains. We derive the condition for the existence of these bound states and discuss its satisfiability in different regimes. Finally, we show that these effects persist in finite systems using exact-diagonalization calculations.

Title: Linear response theory for cavity QED materials at arbitrary light-matter coupling strengths
Authors: Juan Román-Roche, Álvaro Gómez-León, Fernando Luis, David Zueco
Abstract: We develop a linear response theory for materials collectively coupled to a cavity that is valid in all regimes of light-matter coupling, including symmetry-broken phases. We present and compare two different approaches. First, using a coherent path integral formulation for the partition function to obtain thermal Green functions. This approach relies on a saddle point expansion for the action, that can be truncated in the thermodynamic limit. Second, by formulating the equations of motion for the retarded Green functions and solving them. We use a mean-field decoupling of high-order Green functions in order to obtain a closed, solvable system of equations. Both approaches yield identical results in the calculation of response functions for the cavity and material. These are obtained in terms of the bare cavity and material responses. In combination, the two techniques clarify the validity of a mean-field decoupling in correlated light-matter systems and provide complementary means to compute finite-size corrections to the thermodynamic limit. The theory is formulated for a general model that encompasses most of the systems typically considered in the field of cavity QED materials. Finally, we provide a detailed application of the theory to the Quantum Hall effect and to a collection of spin models.

Title: Verifying the analogy between transversely coupled spin-1/2 systems and inductively-coupled fluxoniums
Authors: Wei-Ju Lin, Hyunheung Cho, Yinqi Chen, Maxim G. Vavilov, Chen Wang, Vladimir E. Manucharyan
Abstract: We report a detailed characterization of two inductively coupled superconducting fluxonium qubits for implementing high-fidelity cross-resonance gates. Our circuit stands out because it behaves very closely to the case of two transversely coupled spin-1/2 systems. In particular, the generally unwanted static ZZ-term due to the non-computational transitions is nearly absent despite a strong qubit-qubit hybridization. Spectroscopy of the non-computational transitions reveals a spurious LC-mode arising from the combination of the coupling inductance and the capacitive links between the terminals of the two qubit circuits. Such a mode has a minor effect on our specific device, but it must be carefully considered for optimizing future designs.

Title: Impurity-induced counter skin-effect and linear modes in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Nico G. Leumer, Dario Bercioux
Abstract: Non-reciprocal lattice systems are among the simplest non-Hermitian systems, exhibiting several key features absent in their Hermitian counterparts. In this study, we investigate the Hatano-Nelson model with an impurity and unveil how the impurity influences the intrinsic non-Hermitian skin effect of the system. We present an exact analytical solution to the problem under both open and periodic boundary conditions, irrespective of the impurity's position and strength. This exact solution is thoroughly validated by numerical simulations. Our analysis reveals a distinctive phenomenon where a specific impurity strength, determined by the non-reciprocal hopping parameters, induces a unique skin state at the impurity site. This impurity state exhibits a skin effect that counterbalances the boundary-induced skin effect, a phenomenon we term the impurity-induced counter skin-effect. These findings offer unprecedented insights into the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems with impurities, elucidating the complex interplay between impurities and the system's non-reciprocal nature. Furthermore, our results suggest potential applications in quantum sensing, where the unique characteristics of the impurity-induced counter skin-effect could be harnessed for enhanced sensitivity and precision.

Title: Deep thermalization under charge-conserving quantum dynamics
Authors: Rui-An Chang, Harshank Shrotriya, Wen Wei Ho, Matteo Ippoliti
Abstract: "Deep thermalization" describes the emergence of universal wavefunction distributions in quantum many-body dynamics, appearing on a local subsystem upon measurement of its environment. In this work, we study in detail the effect of continuous internal symmetries and associated conservation laws on deep thermalization. Concretely, we consider quantum spin systems with a $U(1)$ symmetry associated with the conservation of magnetization (or `charge'), and analyze how the choice of initial states (specifically, their degree of charge fluctuations) and the choice of measurement basis (specifically, whether or not it can reveal information about the local charge density) determine the ensuing universal wavefunction distributions. We put forth a universal ansatz for the limiting form of the projected ensemble, motivated by maximum-entropy principles rooted in statistical physics and quantum information theory. This limiting form depends on a polynomial amount of data on the initial state and measurement basis, a `coarse-graining' that is an essential feature of bona fide thermodynamic ensembles. We support our ansatz with three complementary approaches: (i) a rigorous proof in the simplest case of no charge fluctuations in either the initial state or the measurement basis; (ii) analytical calculations using a `replica limit' approach, applicable when charge fluctuations are allowed in either the input state or the measurement basis but not both; (iii) extensive numerical simulations of finite-sized systems in the most general case. Our findings demonstrate a rich interplay between symmetries and the information extracted by measurements, which allows deep thermalization to exhibit a range of universal behaviors far beyond regular thermalization.

Title: Splitting and connecting singlets in atomic quantum circuits
Authors: Zijie Zhu, Yann Kiefer, Samuel Jele, Marius Gächter, Giacomo Bisson, Konrad Viebahn, Tilman Esslinger
Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis for digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate on nearest neighbours, many circuits require nonlocal connectivity and necessitate some form of quantum information transport. Yet, connecting distant nodes of a quantum processor still remains challenging, particularly for neutral atoms in optical lattices. Here, we create singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven atomic singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.

Title: Thermalization rates and quantum Ruelle-Pollicott resonances: insights from operator hydrodynamics
Authors: Carolyn Zhang, Laimei Nie, Curt von Keyserlingk
Abstract: In thermalizing many-body quantum systems without conservation laws such as ergodic Floquet and random unitary circuits, local expectation values are predicted to decay to their equilibrium values exponentially quickly. In this work we derive a relationship between said exponential decay rate $\overline{g}$ and the operator spreading properties of a local unitary evolution. A hydrodynamical picture for operator spreading allows us to argue that, for random unitary circuits, $\overline{g}$ is encoded by the leading eigenvalue of a dynamical map obtained by enriching unitary dynamics with dissipation, in the limit of weak dissipation. We argue that the size of the eigenvalue does not depend on the details of this weak dissipation (given mild assumptions on properties of the ergodic dynamics), so long as it only suppresses large operators significantly. Our calculations are based on analytical results for random unitary circuits, but we argue that similar results hold for ergodic Floquet systems. These conjectures are in accordance with existing results which numerically obtain quantum many-body analogues of classical Ruelle-Pollicott resonances [T. Prosen J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35 L737 (2002), T. Mori, arXiv:2311.10304] by studying unitary evolutions subject to weak dissipation.

Title: Quantum Hall liquids in high-density QCD
Authors: Kentaro Nishimura, Naoki Yamamoto, Ryo Yokokura
Abstract: There exist metastable domain walls of the flavor-singlet meson $\eta$ for the ${\rm U}(1)$ axial symmetry in two-flavor color superconductivity (2SC) in QCD at large baryon density. We show that, due to the coupling of $\eta$ to confined ${\rm SU}(2)$ gluons in the 2SC phase, the effective theory on the domain wall is described by the ${\rm SU}(2)_{-1}$ Chern-Simons theory, which is dual to the ${\rm U}(1)_{2}$ Chern-Simons theory. This theory has a spin-1 droplet excitation that does not carry a baryon number, which we identify as a vector meson. We also discuss the effective theories and baryonic droplet excitations on the domain walls of the flavor-singlet mesons in the superfluid phases of QCD at large isospin density and two-color QCD at large baryon density.

Title: Majorana fermions solve the tetrahedron equations as well as higher simplex equations
Authors: Pramod Padmanabhan, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: Yang-Baxter equations define quantum integrable models. The tetrahedron and higher simplex equations are multi-dimensional generalizations. Finding the solutions of these equations is a formidable task. In this work we develop a systematic method - constructing higher simplex operators [solutions of corresponding simplex equations] from lower simplex ones. We call it lifting. By starting from solutions of Yang-Baxter equations we can construct solutions of the tetrahedron equation and simplex equation in any dimension. We then generalize this by starting from a solution of any lower simplex equation and lifting it [construct solution] to another simplex equation in higher dimension. This process introduces several constraints among the different lower simplex operators that are lifted to form the higher simplex operators. We show that braided Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter equations independent of spectral parameters] constructed using Majorana fermions satisfy these constraints, thus solving the higher simplex equations. As a consequence these solutions help us understand the action of an higher simplex operator on Majorana fermions. Apart from these we show that solutions constructed using Dirac (complex) fermions and Clifford algebras also satisfy these constraints. Furthermore it is observed that the Clifford solutions give rise to positive Boltzmann weights resulting in the possibility of physical statistical mechanics models in higher dimensions. Finally we also show that anti-Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter-like equations with a negative sign on the right hand side] can also be lifted to higher simplex solutions.

Title: Hydrodynamic flow field and frictional resistance coefficient of a disk rotating steadily in a compressible fluid layer with odd viscosity on a rigid substrate
Authors: Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Yuto Hosaka, Elsen Tjhung, Andrej Vilfan
Abstract: We analyze the hydrodynamics of a rotating disk in a two-dimensional compressible fluid layer with odd viscosity. Unlike conventional fluids, odd viscosity introduces a radial flow component that can be directed either inward or outward, depending on its sign. This phenomenon is expected to significantly impact the hydrodynamic interactions between two rotating disks, potentially causing effective attraction or repulsion depending on the sign of the odd viscosity and the direction of rotation. Furthermore, we calculate the rotational resistance coefficient and find that odd viscosity increases this coefficient, regardless of its sign.

Title: First-Passage Approach to Optimizing Perturbations for Improved Training of Machine Learning Models
Authors: Sagi Meir, Tommer D. Keidar, Shlomi Reuveni, Barak Hirshberg
Abstract: Machine learning models have become indispensable tools in applications across the physical sciences. Their training is often time-consuming, vastly exceeding the inference timescales. Several protocols have been developed to perturb the learning process and improve the training, such as shrink and perturb, warm restarts, and stochastic resetting. For classifiers, these perturbations have been shown to result in enhanced speedups or improved generalization. However, the design of such perturbations is usually done ad hoc by intuition and trial and error. To rationally optimize training protocols, we frame them as first-passage processes and consider their response to perturbations. We show that if the unperturbed learning process reaches a quasi-steady state, the response at a single perturbation frequency can predict the behavior at a wide range of frequencies. We employ this approach to a CIFAR-10 classifier using the ResNet-18 model and identify a useful perturbation and frequency among several possibilities. Our work allows optimization of perturbations for improving the training of machine learning models using a first-passage approach.

Title: Symmetry Properties of Quantum Dynamical Entropy
Authors: Eric D. Schultz, Keiichiro Furuya, Laimei Nie
Abstract: As quantum analogs of the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, quantum dynamical entropies have emerged as important tools to characterize complex quantum dynamics. In particular, Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) entropy, which quantifies the information production of a coherent quantum system subjected to repeated measurement, has received considerable attention as a potential diagnostic for quantum chaos. Despite this interest, the precise behavior of quantum dynamical entropy in the presence of symmetry has seen little study. In this work, we establish rigorous inequalities of the AFL entropy for arbitrary unitary dynamics (single-particle and many-body) in the presence of various types of symmetry. Our theorems encompass three cases: Abelian symmetry, an anticommuting unitary, and non-Abelian symmetries. We motivate our main results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the role of symmetry in quantum dynamics under measurements, and our framework is easily adaptable for study of symmetry in other probes of quantum chaos.

Title: Assessing zero-shot generalisation behaviour in graph-neural-network interatomic potentials
Authors: Chiheb Ben Mahmoud, Zakariya El-Machachi, Krystian A. Gierczak, John L. A. Gardner, Volker L. Deringer
Abstract: With the rapidly growing availability of machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) models for chemistry, much current research focuses on the development of generally applicable and ``foundational'' MLIPs. An important question in this context is whether, and how well, such models can transfer from one application domain to another. Here, we assess this transferability for an MLIP model at the interface of materials and molecular chemistry. Specifically, we study GO-MACE-23, a model designed for the extended covalent network of graphene oxide, and quantify its zero-shot performance for small, isolated molecules and chemical reactions outside its direct scope--in direct comparison with a state-of-the-art model which has been trained in-domain. Our work provides quantitative insight into the transfer and generalisation ability of graph-neural-network potentials and, more generally, makes a step towards the more widespread applicability of MLIPs in chemistry.

Title: Survival of the fastest -- algorithm-guided evolution of light-powered underwater microrobots
Authors: Mikołaj Rogóż, Zofia Dziekan, Piotr Wasylczyk
Abstract: Depending on multiple parameters, soft robots can exhibit different modes of locomotion that are difficult to model numerically. As a result, improving their performance is complex, especially in small-scale systems characterized by low Reynolds numbers, when multiple aero- and hydrodynamical processes influence their movement. In this work, we optimize light-powered millimetre-scale underwater swimmer locomotion by applying experimental results - measured swimming speed - as the fitness function in two evolutionary algorithms: particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. As these soft, light-powered robots with different characteristics (phenotypes) can be fabricated quickly, they provide a great platform for optimisation experiments, using many competing robots to improve swimming speed over consecutive generations. Interestingly, just like in natural evolution, unexpected gene combinations led to surprisingly good results, including eight-fold increase in speed or the discovery of a self-oscillating underwater locomotion mode.
