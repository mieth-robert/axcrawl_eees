Title: Unveiling the amorphous ice layer during premelting using AFM integrating machine learning
Authors: Binze Tang, Chon-Hei Lo, Tiancheng Liang, Jiani Hong, Mian Qin, Yizhi Song, Duanyun Cao, Ying Jiang, Limei Xu
Abstract: Premelting plays a key role across physics, chemistry, materials and biology sciences but remains poorly understood at the atomic level due to surface characterization limitations. We report the discovery of a novel amorphous ice layer (AIL) preceding the quasi-liquid layer (QLL) during ice premelting, enabled by a machine learning framework integrating atomic force microscopy (AFM) with molecular dynamics simulations. This approach overcomes AFM's depth and signal limitations, allowing for three-dimensional surface structure reconstruction from AFM images. It further enables structural exploration of premelting interfaces across a wide temperature range that are experimentally inaccessible. We identify the AIL, present between 121-180K, displaying disordered two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network with solid-like dynamics. Our findings refine the ice premelting phase diagram and offering new insights into the surface growth dynamic, dissolution and interfacial chemical reactivity. Methodologically, this work establishes a novel framework for AFM-based 3D structural discovery, marking a significant leap in our ability to probe complex disordered interfaces with unprecedented precision and paving the way for future disciplinary research, including surface reconstruction, crystallization, ion solvation, and biomolecular recognition.

Title: Localization from Infinitesimal Kinetic Grading: Critical Scaling and Kibble-Zurek Universality
Authors: Argha Debnath, Ayan Sahoo, Debraj Rakshit
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional lattice model with site-dependent nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes that follow a power-law profile. The hopping variation is controlled by a grading exponent, $\alpha$, which serves as the tuning parameter of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, the ground state becomes localized as $|\alpha| \to 0$, signaling the presence of a critical point characterized by a diverging localization length. Using exact diagonalization, we perform finite-size scaling analysis and extract the associated critical exponent governing this divergence, revealing a universality class distinct from well-known Anderson, Aubry-Andre, and Stark localization. To further characterize the critical behavior, we analyze the inverse participation ratio, the energy gap between the ground and first excited states, and the fidelity susceptibility. We also investigate nonequilibrium dynamics by linearly ramping the hopping profile at various rates and tracking the evolution of the localization length and the inverse participation ratio. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism successfully captures the resulting dynamics using the critical exponents obtained from the static scaling analysis. Our results demonstrate a clean, disorder-free route to localization and provide a tunable platform relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atom arrays with engineered hopping profiles.

Title: A new multiscale modeling approach to unravel the influence of interlayer sp3 bonds on the nonlinear large-deformation and fracture behaviors of 2D carbon nanostructures under tension
Authors: Xiangyang Wang, Huibo Qi, Biao Xu, Shichao Dai, Jiqiang Li
Abstract: To delve deeply into the nonlinear large-deformation and fracture behaviors of 2D carbon nanostructures (2D CNs), including bilayer graphene, diamane, and their transitional structures, this paper introduces a multiscale auxiliary nodes (MAN) method rooted in atomic structures and potentials. This approach simulates 2D CNs by constructing two virtual continuum sheets with high-order continuity. The moving least squares (MLS) approximation is employed to facilitate the transformation between atomic displacements and nodal displacements, thereby converting atomic potential energy into strain energy within the continuum model. Through iterative solutions of nonlinear stiffness equations, the equilibrium configuration of the system under specified loading conditions can be obtained. The flexibility in the density and arrangement of nodes allows for a smooth and seamless cross-scale transition from discrete atomic structures to a continuum model. Numerical simulations demonstrate that MAN method accurately predicts the nonlinear large-deformation and fracture behaviors of 2D CNs. The Young's modulus and shear modulus of diamane in both zigzag and armchair directions closely approach those of diamond and are notably higher than those of graphene. Furthermore, the quantity and distribution of interlayer sp3 bonds significantly influence the fracture behavior of 2D CNs, with strategic placement of these bonds effectively enhancing the tensile strength of the structures.

Title: Ab initio study of mechanical and functional properties of novel CaZnC and CaZnSi half-Heusler materials
Authors: P. K. Kamlesh, U. K. Gupta, S. Verma, M. Rani, Y. Toual, A. S. Verma
Abstract: This research work introduces the DFT through FP-LAPW+lo technique in WIEN2k software to obtain information about structural, thermoelectric, and optoelectronic characteristics of CaZnC and CaZnSi materials. The structural optimization was performed using PBE-GGA functional, while the rest of the characteristics were obtained with the PBE-GGA + TB-mBJ approach. The thermoelectric parameters were evaluated using BoltzTraP software. The elastic constants and other mechanical parameters were computed by utilizing the ELAST code within the WIEN2k software, while the thermodynamic characteristics were evaluated using the Gibbs2 program. The findings show a correlation between atomic composition and lattice dimensions while finding that CaZnC has a direct ($\Gamma$-$\Gamma$) band gap of $1.186$ eV, whereas CaZnSi has an indirect ($\Gamma$-$X$) band gap of $1.067$ eV. The optical studies of the compounds show potential applications for photovoltaics while the thermoelectric results find optimized power factors and figure of merit values for energy conversion performance. The elastic parameters of CaZnC and CaZnSi demonstrate material stability and brittleness. Lastly, the thermodynamic evaluations provide information about the thermal mechanism and disorder of the materials. As a result, this research work provides significant advancements in the understanding of the fundamentals of these compounds and highlights their promising applications in renewable energy technologies.

Title: Examination of Hydrogen Evolution Bubble Trapping in Ordered Porous 3D Printed Metal and Metal Oxide-Coated Microlattice Electrodes
Authors: Matthew Ferguson, Alex Lonergan, Christopher Kent, Dara Fitzpatrick, Colm O'Dwyer
Abstract: Determining the nature of surface roughness and electrode pore structure on H2 bubble evolution rate and quantity, and bubble trapping under electrolytic conditions is important for quantifying useful gas production during total water splitting and hydrogen evolution reactions. Controlled electrode systems involving the design of geometry, surface area, and porosity provides options to understand trapped/redissolved gas bubble evolution and improve overall efficiency. In this study, we use vat polymerization (Vat-P) 3D-printing to create ordered microlattice electrode structures from metal and metal-oxide coated photopolymerized methacrylate-based resins. These micro-lattice structures are designed with various geometries to influence bubble traffic from gas nucleation and evolution during electrochemical HER processes. Using cyclic and linear sweep voltammetry, and chronopotentiometry, this work analyzes the response of metallized (NiO/Ni(OH)2 and Au) microlattice HER electrodes as a function of geometric structure, to gauge influence of material activity, small scale surface roughness, and the larger substrate pore network on the traffic or larger bubbles formed during HER. This work also uses broadband acoustic resonance dissolution spectroscopy (BARDS) to quantify bubble evolution and reabsorption in the electrolyte during electrolysis. The results show that coated 3D printed electrodes are robust HER electrodes, allow efficient transport of small bubbles, but significant limitations are found for larger bubble transport through ordered porous microlattice shown through model simulations and experimental measurements.

Title: Time-resolved Charge Detection in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Quantum Dots
Authors: Markus Niese, Michele Masseroni, Clara Scherm, Christoph Adam, Max J. Ruckriegel, Artem O. Denisov, Jonas D. Gerber, Lara Ostertag, Jessica Richter, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Thomas Ihn, Klaus Ensslin
Abstract: We investigate electronic transport through gate-defined quantum dots in molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ using an integrated charge detector. We observe a crossover from two weakly coupled single dots to a strongly coupled double quantum dot. In the regime of extremely weak dot-lead coupling, where the direct transport current is below the detection limit, we measure the dot occupation via charge detection and access the few-electron regime. Due to the large band gap of MoS$_2$, tunneling rates can be sufficiently suppressed to resolve individual tunneling events. These results establish a platform for single-shot spin- and valley-to-charge conversion and highlight the potential of transition-metal dichalcogenide quantum dots for quantum information applications.

Title: Determining the superconducting order parameter of UPt$_3$ using scanning tunneling microscopy
Authors: Rebecca Bisset, Luke C. Rhodes, Hugo Decitre, Matthew J. Neat, Ana Maldonado, Andrew Huxley, Carolina A. Marques, Peter Wahl
Abstract: Superconductivity, a state in which electrical currents can flow without resistance, occurs because of pairing of electrons into quasiparticles with integer spin $S$. In practically all known superconducting materials, these pairs form a singlet with $S=0$. Finding a material that has triplet pairing, $S=1$, would have profound fundamental and technological implications. UPt$_3$ has been a key candidate material for spin-triplet superconductivity. Because of a lack of direct evidence for the pairing symmetry, the nature of the superconducting pairing remains under debate. Here, we use ultra-low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy to resolve this question. Our data reveals a zero-bias Andreev bound state within the gap for a surface normal to the $c$-axis of UPt$_3$. The superconducting origin of the features is confirmed through vortex imaging. For triplet pairing, such an Andreev state is fragile against Rashba spin-splitting, whereas for singlet pairing it remains robust, classifying UPt$_3$ as a spin-singlet superconductor with a chiral order parameter.

Title: Quadrupolar and dipolar phases of excitons in transition-metal dichalcogenide trilayer heterostructures
Authors: Michal Zimmerman, Daniel Podolsky, Ronen Rapaport, Snir Gazit
Abstract: Recent experiments on trilayer transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructures have revealed the rich behavior of dipolar excitons. Motivated by these experimental observations, we investigate the collective dynamics of planar quantum dipoles whose orientation fluctuates due to charge tunneling between the outer layers. Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the low-temperature phase diagram as a function of experimentally tunable parameters. We uncover a diverse landscape of phases driven by dipolar correlations. Under strong dipole fluctuations, a quadrupolar superfluid emerges. Suppressing charge tunneling nucleates a droplet state stabilized by the attractive interaction between antiparallel dipoles. At high exciton densities, the system gives way to a partially fragmented condensate, characterized by competing quadrupolar and dipolar superfluid states. Furthermore, at a large exciton mass and high density, we find a staggered dipolar crystal. Our detailed study of the dependence of exciton energy shifts on an external electric field directly interprets existing experimental data and underscores the crucial role of the antiparallel dipolar configuration. Our results provide a guide for future experimental explorations of quantum phases of trilayer excitons.

Title: High-throughput discovery of moiré homobilayers guided by topology and energetics
Authors: Naoto Nakatsuji, Jennifer Cano, Valentin Crépel
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures promise on-demand designer quantum phases through control of monolayer composition, stacking, twist angle, and external fields. Yet, experimental efforts have been narrowly focused, leaving much of this vast moiré landscape unexplored and potential promises unrealized. Here, we present a scalable workflow for high-throughput characterization of twisted homobilayers and apply it to $K$-valley semiconductors. Combining small-scale density functional theory with perturbation theory, we efficiently extract moiré band gaps, valley Chern numbers, magic angles, and the threshold for lattice relaxation. Beyond this rapid high-throughput characterization, we parameterize a continuum model for each material, which provides a starting point for more detailed study. Our survey delivers an actionable map for systematic exploration of correlated and topological phases in moiré homobilayers, and identifies promising new platforms: chromium-based transition metal dichalcogenides for high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effects, transition metal nitride halides for intertwined superconducting and moiré physics, and atomically thin $\rm{III-V}$ semiconductors for room-temperature-scale moiré effects.

Title: Spin-dependent quasiparticle lifetimes in altermagnets
Authors: Kristoffer Leraand, Kristian Mæland, Asle Sudbø
Abstract: We investigate many-body effects on the spin-split electron bands in altermagnets by computing the electron self-energy arising from interactions with magnons, phonons, and hybridized magnon-phonon modes. These interactions lead to band broadening, which can obscure the intrinsic spin-splitting in spectroscopic measurements. We consider a $d$-wave Lieb lattice altermagnet as a representative example. Our results reveal that the spin-splitting remains spectroscopically resolvable and provide theoretical estimates of lifetime effects relevant for experimental detection. For electron-magnon coupling, we find a distinct difference between spectral function broadening for up and down spins close to the Fermi surface, which is not present in the case of electron-phonon coupling. We relate it to the spin splitting of the magnon modes in altermagnets. The results, including magneto-elastic coupling, are very similar to the pure magnon case. This provides insights into quasiparticle dynamics in altermagnets and contributes to the broader understanding of many-body interactions in spin-split systems. By including the temperature dependence of the self-energies, we also quantify how thermal fluctuations influence the broadening of the electronic states.

Title: Anyon Dispersion in Aharonov-Casher Bands and Implications for Twisted MoTe${}_2$
Authors: Zihan Yan, Qingchen Li, Tomohiro Soejima, Eslam Khalaf
Abstract: The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in two-dimensional heterostructures has opened the door to realizing phases of dispersing anyons. Here, we develop an analytically controlled theory of anyon dispersion in FQAH states realized in ideal or Aharonov-Casher (AC) bands by projecting interactions onto the space of Laughlin quasiholes. Constructing quasihole momentum eigenstates allows efficient evaluation of the single quasihole dispersion using Monte Carlo. We find that the quasihole bandwidth grows with increasing quantum-geometry inhomogeneity of the AC band and with increasing interaction screening length. For realistic parameters relevant to the bands of twisted MoTe${}_2$, the quasihole bandwidth is of order 1 meV, suggesting that itinerant-anyon physics may play an important role in sufficiently clean samples. Furthermore, we develop a microscopic Lagrangian framework in terms of a quasihole guiding-center coordinate, which reproduces the momentum-space formula for the dispersion. This approach reveals that quasihole dispersion originates from the combined effects of an interaction-generated periodic potential, arising from non-uniform quantum geometry of the single particle bands, and the quasihole many-body Berry phase arising from the background magnetic field. The latter endows the guiding-center coordinate with a noncommutative structure, converting the periodic potential into a finite dispersion. Finally, we outline how this framework generalizes to multiple quasiholes, enabling a microscopic theory of charged excitations in FQAH systems that retains only the anyon degrees of freedom.

Title: Classifying one-dimensional Floquet phases through two-dimensional topological order
Authors: Campbell McLauchlan, Vedant Motamarri, Benjamin Béri
Abstract: Floquet systems display rich phenomena, such as time crystals, with many-body localisation (MBL) protecting the phases from heating. While several types of Floquet phases have been classified, a unified picture of Floquet MBL is still emerging. Static phases have been fruitfully studied via "symmetry topological field theory" (SymTFT), wherein the universal features of $G$-symmetric systems are elucidated by placing them on the boundary of a topological order of one dimension higher. In this work, we provide a SymTFT approach to classifying $G$-symmetric Floquet MBL phases in 1D, for $G$ a finite Abelian group with on-site unitary action. In the SymTFT, these 1D systems correspond to the boundaries of the quantum double associated to $G$, and the classification naturally arises from considering the Lagrangian subgroups and boundary excitations of the quantum double. The classification covers all known Floquet phases while uncovering others previously unexplored, along with bulk features of phases thought to have only boundary signatures. We refer to the latter phases as "dual" time crystals. For static phases, we show how anyons of the quantum double and (string) order parameters provide a natural and simple interpretation of known classification schemes. By extending our framework to the boundaries of twisted quantum doubles, we uncover a new time-crystalline phase with non-onsite symmetry, which cannot be obtained through local, symmetric Hamiltonian drives. We numerically demonstrate evidence for the absolute stability of this phase, and observe that for open boundary conditions it has greater stability to symmetric perturbations. We finally discuss perspectives on using programmable quantum devices to realise and probe the phases we discuss. Our results show that SymTFT provides a powerful approach to unifying phases and features of Floquet systems.

Title: Extracting Anyon Statistics from Neural Network Fractional Quantum Hall States
Authors: Andres Perez Fadon, David Pfau, James S. Spencer, Wan Tong Lou, Titus Neupert, W. M. C. Foulkes
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states host emergent anyons with exotic exchange statistics, but obtaining direct access to their topological properties in real systems remains a challenge. Neural-network wavefunctions provide a flexible computational approach, as they can represent highly correlated states without requiring a tailored basis. Here we use the neural-network variational Monte Carlo method to study the fractional quantum Hall effect on the torus and find the three degenerate ground states at filling factor nu=1/3. From these, we extract the modular S matrix via entanglement interferometry, a technique previously only applied to lattice models. The resulting S matrix encodes the quantum dimensions, fusion rules, and exchange statistics of the emergent anyons, providing a direct numerical demonstration of the topological order. The calculated anyon properties match the well-known theoretical and experimental results. Our work establishes neural-network wavefunctions as a powerful new tool for investigating anyonic properties.

Title: Thermoelectric Signatures of Kondo Physics in Geometry-Tunable Double Quantum Dots
Authors: Diego Perez Daroca, Pablo Roura-Bas
Abstract: The equilibrium thermoelectric and spectral properties of a double quantum dot system are investigated, with the geometry continuously tuned from series to parallel via a parameter $ p $. Within the non-crossing approximation in the infinite-$ U $ limit, the Kondo peak remains robust, while satellite features and the Kondo temperature show strong sensitivity to the geometry. The Seebeck coefficient exhibits sign reversals and non-monotonic behavior as a result of the interplay between Kondo and satellite peaks. These findings underscore the role of interference and coupling asymmetry in governing transport properties, suggesting routes for geometry-based optimization in nanoscale devices.

Title: Quantum theory for edge current and noise in 2D topological superconductors
Authors: S. Pintus, A. Crépieux
Abstract: We calculate the edge current and its fluctuations, i.e. noise, in a 2D topological superconductor using the T-matrix and the Green function techniques. We show that the current is zero for non-chiral edge states and non-zero for chiral edge states, while the edge noise is non-zero whatever the chirality of the edge states. By applying our results to toy models with chiral edge states, we find that the noise is closely related to the Chern number. The edge noise is non-zero only when the Chern number is non-zero, and the bulk noise exhibits a peak each time the Chern number varies, meaning that there is strong current fluctuations when a topological phase transition occurs. Our results suggest that the bulk noise could be seen as a topological susceptibility.

Title: Ultra-Fast Machine-Learned Interatomic Potential for MoS2 Enabling Non-Equilibrium Molecular-Dynamics Simulation of Epitaxial Growth
Authors: Emir Bilgili, Nicholas Taormina, Richard Hennig, Simon R. Phillpot, Youping Chen
Abstract: A machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) for multilayer MoS2 was developed using the ultra-fast force field (UF3) framework. The UF3 MLIP reproduces key properties in strong agreement with DFT including lattice constants, interlayer binding energies, and phase-stability. Furthermore, the potential reasonably captures the phonon spectra and the highly anisotropic elastic tensor across monolayer (1H) and bulk (2H, 3R) MoS2 phases. Critically, defect and edge formation energies are captured with excellent fidelity, exhibiting a strong correlation with DFT (R^2 = 0.91) across ten defective monolayers and reproducing the relative difference between the free energies of zigzag and armchair edges within 5% of DFT. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveal layered homoepitaxial growth consistent with experimental observations, demonstrating the formation of van der Waals gaps between successive epilayers and triangular domains bounded by zigzag edges. The robust UF3 MLIP, which is only ~2X slower than the fastest empirical potentials, enables large-scale atomistic simulations of MoS2 epitaxial growth.

Title: Active Learning Discovery of High Temperature Oxidation Resistant Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys
Authors: Akhil Bejjipurapu, Sharmila Karumuri, Joseph C. Flanagan, Victoria Tucker, Ilias Bilionis, Alejandro Strachan, Kenneth H. Sandhage, Michael S. Titus
Abstract: Refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs) are of significant interest for advanced high-temperature applications, owing to their broad compositional range and potential for attractive mechanical properties and oxidation resistance. However, their compositional complexity poses significant challenges to conventional alloy discovery methodologies. In this study, an active learning framework is introduced that integrates Gaussian process regression with Bayesian global optimization to accelerate identification of oxidation-resistant RCCAs. Focusing on aluminum-containing quaternary systems, alloy and oxide descriptors were used to predict oxidation performance at 1000$^\circ$C. Beginning with a dataset of 81 experimentally validated RCCAs, this framework was used to iteratively select alloy batches (five alloys per batch) with optimization based on a balance between exploration and exploitation to minimize associated experimental costs. After six iterations, two alloys were identified (nominal Al$_{30}$Mo$_5$Ti$_{15}$Cr$_{50}$ and Al$_{40}$Mo$_5$Ti$_{30}$Cr$_{25}$) that exhibited specific mass gains less than 1 mg/cm$^2$ at 1000$^\circ$C in air. Both of these alloys formed adherent external $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ scales and exhibited parabolic oxidation kinetics consistent with diffusion-limited scale growth. Furthermore, our multiobjective analysis demonstrates that these alloys simultaneously achieve high specific hardness ($>0.12$ HV$_{0.5}$m$^3$/kg) and thermal expansion compatibility with thermal barrier coating systems, positioning them as promising bond coat candidates. This work underscores the efficacy of active learning in traversing complex compositional landscapes, and offers a scalable strategy for the development of advanced materials suitable for extreme environments.

Title: Visualizing metal-mediated nucleation and growth of GaN
Authors: Abby Liu, Zhucong Xi, Xiaobo Chen, Catherine Huang, Meng Li, Judith C. Yang, Liang Qi, Dmitri N. Zakharov, Rachel S. Goldman
Abstract: Understanding the atomic-scale mechanisms governing metal-mediated nucleation and growth of gallium nitride (GaN) and related alloys is critical for tailoring their structural and functional properties in advanced electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices. Using real-time environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) in conjunction with Gibbs free energy calculations, we elucidate the distinct processes of GaN nucleation and growth from Ga droplet arrays with and without GaN pre-nuclei. For the lowest temperatures, although GaN nucleation at Ga droplet arrays is not observed, GaN growth occurs preferentially at pre-existing GaN nuclei, presumably due to the reduced Gibbs free energy for NH3 decomposition at Ga/GaN interfaces. For intermediate to high temperatures, E-TEM reveals nucleation and growth of GaN from Ga droplets with and without GaN nuclei, with enhanced crystallinity for the GaN nuclei, due to epitaxial templating. These results highlight the critical role of the Ga/GaN interface in facilitating NH3 decomposition and GaN growth, offering fundamental insights into metal-mediated nucleation and growth of GaN and related materials.

Title: Magneto-optical Kerr effect in pump-probe setups
Authors: Amir Eskandari-asl, Adolfo Avella (Dipartimento di Fisica 'E.R. Caianiello', Università degli Studi di Salerno, Fisciano (SA), Italy)
Abstract: We develop a general theoretical framework for computing the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect in ultrafast pump-probe setups, formulated within the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA) and its application to the generalized linear-response theory for pumped systems. Furthermore, we exploit this formalism to express the post-pump optical conductivity and consequently the Kerr rotation in terms of the time-evolved single-particle density matrix (SPDM), providing a transparent and computationally efficient description of photo-excited multi-band systems. This extension, in addition to its lower computational cost, has the advantage of allowing the inclusion of phenomenological damping. We illustrate the formalism using both (i) a two-band tight-binding model, which captures the essential physics of ultrafast spin-charge dynamics and the Kerr rotation, and (ii) weakly spin-polarized germanium, as a realistic playground with a complex band structure. The results demonstrate that, by exploiting DPOA and/or its SPDM extension, one can reliably reproduce both the short-time features under the pump-pulse envelope and the long-time dynamics after excitation, offering a versatile framework for analyzing time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect experiments in complex materials. Moreover, this analysis clearly shows that the Kerr rotation can be used to deduce experimentally the relevant n-photon resonances for a given specific material.

Title: Transient Surface Oxides Form on Pt(111) - But Vanish During Ammonia Oxidation
Authors: David Simonne, Allesandro Coati, Alina Vlad, Yves Garreau, Benjamin Voisin, Marie-Ingrid Richard, Andrea Resta
Abstract: Ammonia oxidation on platinum catalysts is pivotal for industrial nitric acid production and environmental abatement, yet the role of surface oxides in this process remains debated. Using operando surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD), crystal truncation rod (CTR) analysis, and near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), we reveal that Pt(111) does not form stable surface oxides under ammonia oxidation conditions. Instead, transient hexagonal monolayers and a Pt(111)-(8x8) superstructure emerge under oxygen-rich atmospheres and above the catalyst light-off temperature, but vanish upon ammonia exposure. Real-time mass spectrometry and NAP-XPS demonstrate that the reaction proceeds via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where adsorbed NHx and O species availability dictate selectivity toward NO or N2. Reducing the oxygen pressure by an order of magnitude slows the kinetics of oxide growth, only detected after 24 hr, and facilitated by transient and precursor structures.

Title: Minority Takeover in Majority Dynamics: Searching for Rare Initializations via the History Passing Algorithm
Authors: Marek Jankola, Freya Behrens, Cédric Koller, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: We investigate how much bias in the initial configuration is required to drive global agreement in synchronous, deterministic majority dynamics on large random $d$-regular graphs. Nodes take values $\pm 1$ and update their states at each discrete time step to align with the majority of their neighbors. Using the backtracking dynamical cavity method (BDCM), we estimate the minimal fraction of initial $+1$ nodes required to achieve a $+1$ consensus in $p$ time steps. Our analysis predicts that for $d\geq4$ an initial global minority of $+1$ nodes is sufficient to quickly steer the entire system toward consensus on $+1$. We then investigate whether such initial conditions can be determined explicitly for a given large random regular graph. To this end, we introduce a new algorithm, which we name history-passing reinforcement (HPR), designed to find such initial configurations with a minority of $+1$ nodes. We find, as a main result, that the HPR algorithm finds initial configurations where the minority takes over the majority for $d$-regular random graphs with $d\geq4$. The HPR algorithm outperforms standard simulated annealing-based methods, but does not reach the lowest densities predicted by the BDCM. Rather, the lowest density achievable by the algorithm is near the onset of a dynamical one-step replica symmetry breaking (d1RSB) phase, which we estimate using a one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) formulation of the BDCM. While we focus on the majority dynamics and random $d$-regular graphs, the algorithm can be extended to other dynamical rules and classes of sparse graphs.

Using numerical Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations and edge-theory analysis, we demonstrate how realistic materials such as MoTe2/NbSe2 can host parafermionic excitations with experimentally accessible signatures, including fractional Josephson effects, localized zero modes, interferometry, and thermal transport. Our work outlines concrete strategies for experimentally accessing parafermionic excitations in FCI-superconductor heterostructures.

Title: Entropy-production fluctuation theorem for a generalized Langevin particle in crossed electric and magnetic fields
Authors: L. C. González-Morales, I. Pérez Castillo, J. I. Jiménez-Aquino
Abstract: We study fluctuations of entropy production for a charged Brownian particle confined in a harmonic trap and driven out of equilibrium by crossed electric and magnetic fields. The magnetic field is constant and perpendicular to the plane of motion, while the electric field is time dependent and provides the driving. The non-Markovian dynamics is modeled by a generalized Langevin equation with memory and Gaussian noise. Using the exact solution of this linear dynamics, we obtain the time-dependent Gaussian phase-space probability density and from it compute the trajectory-dependent total entropy production. For two solvable driving protocols, we prove analytically that the entropy production obeys a detailed fluctuation theorem.

Title: Correlated many-body quantum dynamics of the Peregrine soliton
Authors: D. Diplaris, G. A. Bougas, P.G. Kevrekidis, C.-L. Hung, P. Schmelcher, S. I. Mistakidis
Abstract: We explore the correlated dynamics underlying the formation of the quantum Peregrine soliton, a prototypical rogue-wave excitation, utilizing interaction quenches from repulsive to attractive couplings in an ultracold bosonic gas confined in a one-dimensional box trap. The latter emulates the so-called semi-classical initial conditions and the associated gradient catastrophe scenario facilitating the emergence of a high-density, doubly localized waveform. The ensuing multi-orbital variant of the Peregrine soliton features notable deviations from its mean-field sibling, including a reduced peak amplitude, wider core, absence of the side density dips, and earlier formation times. Moreover, Peregrine soliton generation yields coherence losses, while experiencing two-body bunching within each of its sides which show anti-bunching between each other. Controllable seeding of the Peregrine soliton is also demonstrated by tuning the atom number or the box length, while reducing the latter favors the generation of the time-periodic Kuznetsov-Ma breather. Our results highlight that correlations reshape the morphology of rogue-waves in the genuinely quantum, non-integrable realm, while setting the stage for the emergent field of quantum dispersive hydrodynamics.

Title: Pulse-Mode Operation and Reliability of BEOL-Compatible Ferroelectric Non-Volatile Capacitive Memories with Amorphous Oxide Semiconductor Channels
Authors: Junmo Lee, Chengyang Zhang, Tae-Hyeon Kim, Suman Datta, Shimeng Yu
Abstract: Non-volatile capacitive memories (nvCAPs) exhibiting AC small-signal capacitance on/off ratio (Con/Coff) with non-destructive read have emerged as a promising device for next-generation memory paradigms. Recently, BEOL-compatible ferroelectric nvCAPs with an amorphous oxide semiconductor channel have been reported, suggesting the possibility of monolithic 3D integration of nvCAPs on top of CMOS. So far, the characterization studies on oxide-channel ferroelectric nvCAPs have been done using dual DC sweep C-V measurements which are typically performed over a time scale of a few seconds. However, non-volatile memory arrays typically require nvCAPs to operate under pulse-mode. It is thus crucial to advance understanding of the behavior of oxide-channel ferroelectric nvCAPs under pulse-mode operation, governed by the unique interplay between ferroelectric layer and oxide channel physics. In this study, we provide a systematic study of the pulse-mode operation of ferroelectric nvCAPs with an amorphous oxide semiconductor channel, including its pulse-based write characteristics and reliability characteristics. We examine overlap area, wake-up and pulse-width dependent Con and Coff writing characteristics under pulse-mode. Further, we suggest the importance of optimizing ferroelectric depolarization for Con retention, while reducing read-after-delay for Coff retention under pulse-mode. Lastly, non-destructive read operation for >10^9 read stress cycles at |Vread|=1V is demonstrated.

Title: Imaging Electron-Hole Asymmetry in the Quantum Melting of Generalized Wigner Crystals

Abstract: Two-dimensional moiré materials provide a versatile platform to explore phase transitions in strongly correlated systems. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have imaged the density-driven melting of generalized Wigner crystals (GWCs) and Mott insulators (MIs) in electron-doped, near-60° twisted MoSe2 bilayers featuring a triangular moiré superlattice. We observe striking electron-hole asymmetry in GWC melting: hole-doped GWCs yield interaction-driven disordered states whereas electron-doped GWCs melt into delocalized liquid-like states. This asymmetry arises from the broken particle-hole symmetry of the moiré superlattice, which produces electron and hole Fermi pockets with different momentum geometries upon GWC condensation. MI states melt without such asymmetry, consistent with the absence of a symmetry-breaking density modulation. This work provides direct visualization of the novel emergent phases that appear as GWCs undergo quantum melting transitions.

Abstract: Quantum wells made of two-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D-PKs) offer a high degree of flexibility in tailoring optoelectronic properties through carrier confinement and functional interlayers. Compared to their 3D counterparts, 2D-PKs exhibit tunable photoluminescence, excitonic binding at room temperature and enhanced structural stability. However, the dynamics of photo-induced charge carriers and their transport properties are highly intertwined due to the interplay of diverse excitation species, charge carrier cooling, transport, and radiative and non-radiative recombination. In this study, we employ optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy (OPTP) to analyze the local conductivity dynamics of 2D and 3D methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskites at timescales down to picoseconds. Remarkably, we observe an intensity-dependent, 2D-specific buildup of an ultrafast, few-picosecond decay in local conductivity. By combining OPTP with transient absorption (TA) and picosecond time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), we demonstrate the disentanglement of photoconductivity and carrier population. This allows us to attribute the 2D-specific ultrafast THz response to delayed hot-carrier cooling and subsequent exciton formation, which effectively reduces the free-carrier conductivity. This intensity-dependent, ultrafast THz response is a signature of the recently identified hot-carrier bottleneck in 3D MAPI, and this effect manifests itself in a unique form in the 2D material. These results encourage further investigations on the impact of functional organic interlayers and provide insights into designing tunable carrier responses for ultrafast devices via adapted heterostructures and confinement.

Title: Echelon crack formation explained through a strength-constrained phase-field model
Authors: Olivia Ward, Aditya Kumar
Abstract: Understanding the growth of large cracks in brittle materials is the most fundamental problem in fracture mechanics. Under out-of-plane shear loading, an initially planar crack may fragment into multiple cracks, forming an echelon crack pattern. Explaining this phenomenon is essential for developing a general theory of crack growth. Although numerous empirical criteria have been proposed in the literature, none provide a unified explanation of all observed features and are largely restricted to two-dimensional growth in linear elastic isotropic materials. In this Letter, we confront a classical set of echelon crack growth experiments using two phase-field approaches: the classical variational model and a strength-constrained model. We show that, contrary to prevailing views, the variational model based solely on Griffith's energetic competition between elastic and fracture energies is fundamentally incomplete even for predicting the growth of large cracks. By incorporating a material strength surface that constrains the regions in which a crack can grow, the resulting model accurately predicts echelon crack growth without invoking any ad hoc assumptions about material or geometrical disorder. Results are presented for both soft and hard materials, confirming the model's general applicability to any brittle material. We further identify two governing non-dimensional parameters that control crack orientation and morphology and demonstrate that one of them, the ratio of shear to tensile strength, determines whether crack paths are more influenced by energy-based or stress-based empirical criteria, thereby reconciling these criteria within a single framework.

Title: Tuning Carrier Type and Density in Highly Conductive and Infrared-Transparent (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 films
Authors: Xiangren Zeng, Shenjin Zhang, Zhiheng Li, Weiyue Ma, Renjie Xie, Yanwei Cao, Fengguang Liu, Fengfeng Zhang, Haichao Zhao, Xiong Yao
Abstract: Infrared transparent conductors have long been sought due to their broad optoelectronic applications in the infrared wavelength range. However, the search for ideal materials has been limited by the inherent trade-off between electrical conductance and optical transmittance. Band engineering offers an effective approach to modulate carrier type and density, enabling concurrent tuning of both conductance and transmittance. In this work, we present a band engineering strategy that enables effective tuning of both infrared transmittance and electrical conductance in topological insulator (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3, bridging the gap and paving the way for applying topological insulators to infrared photoelectric devices. More importantly, with the combination of high carrier mobility and a large optical dielectric constant as suggested by previous report, Sb2Te3 achieves a high electrical conductance (~1000 S/cm) and outstanding infrared transmittance (92.3%) in the wavelength range of 8~13 um, demonstrating strong potential as an infrared transparent conductor. Our findings reveal that concurrent enhancement of both carrier mobility and optical dielectric constant is key to overcoming the conductance-transmittance trade-off. This work provides valuable insight for the exploration of high-performance infrared transparent conducting materials.

Title: Complete Decomposition of Anomalous Diffusion in Variable Speed Generalized Lévy Walks
Authors: Abhijit Bera, Kevin E. Bassler
Abstract: Variable Speed Generalized Lévy Walks (VGLWs) are a class of spatio-temporally coupled stochastic processes that unify a broad range of previously studied models within a single parametrized framework. Their dynamics consist of discrete random steps, or flights, during which the walker's speed varies deterministically with both the elapsed time and the total duration of the flight. We investigate the anomalous diffusive behavior of VGLWs and analyze it through decomposition into the three fundamental constitutive effects that capture violations of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT): the Joseph effect, reflecting long-range increment correlations, the Noah effect, arising from heavy-tailed step-size distributions with infinite variance, and the Moses effect, associated with statistical aging and non-stationarity. Our results show that anomalous diffusion in VGLWs is typically generated by a nontrivial combination of all three effects, rather than being attributable to a single mechanism. Strikingly, we find that within the VGLW framework the Noah exponent $L$, which quantifies the strength of the Noah effect, is unbounded from above, revealing a richer and more extreme landscape of anomalous diffusion than in previously studied Lévy-walk-type models.

Title: Machine Learning Enabled Graph Analysis of Particulate Composites: Application to Solid-state Battery Cathodes
Authors: Zebin Li, Shimao Deng, Yijin Liu, Jia-Mian Hu
Abstract: Particulate composites underpin many solid-state chemical and electrochemical systems, where microstructural features such as multiphase boundaries and inter-particle connections strongly influence system performance. Advances in X-ray microscopy enable capturing large-scale, multimodal images of these complex microstructures with an unprecedentedly high throughput. However, harnessing these datasets to discover new physical insights and guide microstructure optimization remains a major challenge. Here, we develop a machine learning (ML) enabled framework that enables automated transformation of experimental multimodal X-ray images of multiphase particulate composites into scalable, topology-aware graphs for extracting physical insights and establishing local microstructure-property relationships at both the particle and network level. Using the multiphase particulate cathode of solid-state lithium batteries as an example, our ML-enabled graph analysis corroborates the critical role of triple phase junctions and concurrent ion/electron conduction channels in realizing desirable local electrochemical activity. Our work establishes graph-based microstructure representation as a powerful paradigm for bridging multimodal experimental imaging and functional understanding, and facilitating microstructure-aware data-driven materials design in a broad range of particulate composites.

Title: Recent progress in quantum spin liquids, fractional magnetization plateaus, and unconventional superconductivity in kagome lattices
Authors: Li-Wei He, Shun-Li Yu, Jian-Xin Li
Abstract: The kagome lattice, with its unique geometric structure, has emerged as a leading platform for exploring quantum many-body physics, particularly in the study of quantum spin liquids (QSLs) and unconventional superconductivity. This review highlights recent advancements in the investigations of QSLs, fractional magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets, and unconventional superconductivity in vanadium-based kagome superconductors. We begin by examining the classical ground-state properties of the nearest-neighbor kagome antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and introducing recent experimental progress in the study of QSLs and fractional magnetization plateau phases. Next, we discuss the fermionic description of the QSL states, along with related gauge theory and the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. We then focus on discussing the VMC studies of QSLs and magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets. For superconductivity in kagome systems, we first analyze the characteristics of the electronic structure and the possible associated electronic instabilities. Finally, we review recent experimental advances in unconventional superconductivity in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), with a particular focus on chiral superconductivity and pairing density waves.

Title: Power-Law Suppression of Phonon Thermal Transport by Magnetic Excitations in a Molecular Quantum Spin Liquid
Authors: S. Fujiyama, K. Ueda, Y. Otsuka
Abstract: We present large-scale ab initio phonon calculations for the molecular quantum spin liquid X[Pd(dmit)2]2. An unusually low average phonon velocity ( 700 {m/s}) and optical modes below 10 cm^{-1} confine the Debye T^{3} regime to T < 2 K. As the transfer-integral anisotropy approaches the maximally frustrated regime (t'/t \to 1), the lattice stiffens, ruling out lattice softening as the origin of the spin-liquid state. By quantifying the additional suppression of the thermal conductivity from experimental data, we observe a power-law behavior consistent with two-dimensional magnetic excitations with a nodal, approximately linear (Dirac-like) spectrum.

Title: Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Holistic Design of Catalysts Tailored for Semiconducting Carbon Nanotube Growth
Authors: Liu Qian, Yue Li, Ying Xie, Jian Zhang, Pai Li, Yue Yu, Zhe Liu, Feng Ding, Jin Zhang
Abstract: Catalyst design is crucial for materials synthesis, especially for complex reaction networks. Strategies like collaborative catalytic systems and multifunctional catalysts are effective but face challenges at the nanoscale. Carbon nanotube synthesis contains complicated nanoscale catalytic reactions, thus achieving high-density, high-quality semiconducting CNTs demands innovative catalyst design. In this work, we present a holistic framework integrating machine learning into traditional catalyst design for semiconducting CNT synthesis. It combines knowledge-based insights with data-driven techniques. Three key components, including open-access electronic structure databases for precise physicochemical descriptors, pre-trained natural language processing-based embedding model for higher-level abstractions, and physical - driven predictive models based on experiment data, are utilized. Through this framework, a new method for selective semiconducting CNT synthesis via catalyst - mediated electron injection, tuned by light during growth, is proposed. 54 candidate catalysts are screened, and three with high potential are identified. High-throughput experiments validate the predictions, with semiconducting selectivity exceeding 91% and the FeTiO3 catalyst reaching 98.6%. This approach not only addresses semiconducting CNT synthesis but also offers a generalizable methodology for global catalyst design and nanomaterials synthesis, advancing materials science in precise control.

Title: In situ XRD Study of Strain Evolution in AlGaN/GaN HEMT at High Temperatures up to 1000 °C
Authors: Botong Li, Bobby G. Duersch, Hunter Ellis, Imteaz Rahaman, Aidan Belanger, Zlatan Aksamija, Brian Roy Van Devener, Kathy Anderson, Kai Fu
Abstract: The thermal stability and structural evolution of a GaN high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) heterostructure grown on a Si (111) substrate were investigated using in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD), reciprocal space mapping (RSM), Raman spectroscopy, and rocking-curve (RC) analysis at varying temperatures. The heterostructure, consisting of a p-GaN cap, an AlGaN barrier, and a GaN channel supported by two AlGaN/AlGaN superlattice (SL) buffer layers, maintained clear and periodic satellite peaks up to a temperature of 1000 deg C, confirming excellent structural integrity. Symmetric and asymmetric RSM results reveal that both the Si and GaN diffraction peaks shift to lower angles with increasing temperature, consistent with thermal expansion, and show no significant broadening or relaxation throughout the heating process. The c-lattice constant follows the theoretical expansion predicted by the multi-frequency Einstein model, whereas the a-lattice expansion is slower due to in-plane strain constraints imposed by the underlying Si substrate and buffer layers. Rapid lattice contraction during the fast-cooling stage induces a residual compressive strain of approximately 0.3 percent in the GaN channel after cooling. Raman spectra further confirm this strain state through a blue shift of approximately 1.5 cm-1 of the GaN E2 (high) phonon mode, corresponding to an in-plane strain of about 0.2 percent. Rocking-curve analysis reveals an increase in both screw and edge dislocation densities by 28 percent and 12 percent, respectively. These results collectively demonstrate that the GaN HEMT heterostructure exhibits robust crystalline stability up to 1000 deg C, with only minor strain redistribution and limited dislocation activity, providing experimental evidence for GaN device applications under high-temperature conditions.

Title: Tunable Topological Phases in an Organic One-Dimensional Mott Chain: Odd-Haldane (S = 1/2) and Haldane (S = 1)
Authors: Khalid N. Anindya, Hong Guo
Abstract: Establishing symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with interactions in chemically realistic systems remains an open challenge. We show that a single, synthetically plausible organic one-dimensional chain, tunable via chemical modification of its radical sites, hosts two such phases: an odd-Haldane phase of a dimerized $S=\tfrac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain and a Haldane phase of an $S=1$ chain realized when Hund coupling locks two $S=\tfrac{1}{2}$ spins per monomer into $S=1$. Density-functional theory places the active manifold deep in the Mott regime ($U/t\!\approx\!126$), justifying a spin-only Heisenberg description; a compact $(t,U)\!\to\!J$ mapping then fixes exchange couplings. Exact diagonalization and DMRG reveal a consistent SPT fingerprint across both phases, including a quantized many-body Zak phase, even-degenerate entanglement spectrum, protected edge spins, and characteristic triplon/Haldane features in $S^{+-}(q,\omega)$. Our results identify a chemically programmable molecular platform for interacting SPT physics in one dimension and suggest concrete spectroscopic routes to organic Haldane spin chains for nanoscale quantum devices.

Title: Emergent topological properties in spatially modulated sub-wavelength barrier lattices
Authors: Giedrius Žlabys, Wen-Bin He, Domantas Burba, Sarika Sasidharan Nair, Thomas Busch, Tomoki Ozawa
Abstract: We investigate topological phenomena in a spatially modulated Dirac-$\delta$ lattice, where the scattering potential varies periodically in space. Changing the potential modulation frequency leads to Hofstadter's butterfly-like energy spectrum and enables the emergence of topological transport regimes characterized by non-trivial Chern numbers. We show how the considered modulated system is connected to the Hofstadter model via the Harper equation. By adiabatically varying spatial modulation parameters, we demonstrate controllable quantum transport and verify the topological nature of these effects through Wannier center displacement and bulk invariant calculations. We also propose an experimentally feasible realization of such a system using optically controlled three-level atoms. Our findings showcase spatially engineered Kronig-Penney-type systems as versatile platforms for investigating and exploiting different topological quantum transport regimes.

Title: Atomic-scale control of substrate-spin coupling via vertical manipulation of a 2D metal-organic framework
Authors: Benjamin Lowe, Bernard Field, Dhaneesh Kumar, Daniel Moreno Cerrada, Oleksandr Stetsovych, Julian Ceddia, Andrés Pinar Solé, Amelia Domínguez-Celorrio, Jack Hellerstedt, Sinéad M. Griffin, Pavel Jelínek, Agustin Schiffrin
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with frustrated crystal geometries can host strongly correlated electrons, potentially leading to a range of exotic many-body quantum phases such as Mott insulators, quantum spin-liquids, and Kondo lattices. The ability to control exchange-coupling within these systems is therefore highly desirable. Here, we use an atomically sharp scanning tunneling microscope probe to vertically manipulate a 2D Mott insulating kagome metal-organic framework (MOF) featuring Kondo-screened local magnetic moments on Ag(111). We show that by controlling the adsorption height of the MOF, we can also controllably and reversibly change the strength of Kondo coupling between the MOF's local spins and the substrate's conduction electrons. This mechanical control of Kondo coupling could be extended to other forms of interlayer exchange coupling, potentially allowing for atomic-scale design or control of spintronics technologies.

Title: On-demand phase-field modeling: Three-dimensional Landau energy for HfO2 through machine learning
Authors: Yusuke Tamura, Kairi Masuda, Yu Kumagai
Abstract: The unexpected emergence of ferroelectricity in HfO2 at reduced dimensions has attracted considerable attention, as it provides a pathway toward the realization of ultrasmall ferroelectric devices. Ab initio calculations suggest that this effect arises from a unique mode coupling, in which an antipolar displacement mode stabilizes a robust polar distortion. Based on these insights, Landau-Devonshire energy models have been proposed using such lattice modes as order parameters. However, most existing models are limited to a simplified one-dimensional model because of the computational cost of ab initio calculations and the limitations of conventional Landau polynomials. Here, we constructed a three-dimensional Landau-Devonshire potential for HfO2 by employing the tetragonal, antipolar, and polar modes as coupled order parameters, based on the latest machine-learning technologies. We generated a large-scale dataset of energies over a three-dimensional structural space, with the computational cost drastically reduced through the use of machine-learning interatomic potentials, and trained a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to learn the relationship between the order parameters and the energy. The energy predicted by the MLP successfully captures the characteristic coupling behavior whereby the antipolar modes induce the polar mode. Furthermore, by extending this MLP-based Landau potential to a position-dependent functional, that is, to a phase-field modeling framework, we revealed that the polarization magnitude in thin films decreases compared with the bulk state, while the critical strain required for the onset of spontaneous polarization increases due to surface effects. This study presents a new framework for the on-demand construction of Landau energy and phase-field modeling using the latest machine-learning techniques, enabling multiscale analysis of complex ferroelectric phenomena.

Title: Visualizing Pair-breaking Scattering Interference in Bulk FeSe
Authors: Matthew Toole, Nileema Sharma, James McKenzie, Fangjun Cheng, Sheng Ran, Xiaolong Liu
Abstract: Spatially periodic modulations of the superconducting gap have been recently reported in diverse materials and are often attributed to pair density wave order. An alternative mechanism, termed pair-breaking scattering interference (PBSI), was proposed to produce gap modulations without finite-momentum pairing. Here we investigate signatures of PBSI in bulk FeSe using scanning tunneling microscopy with superconductive tips, enabling enhanced energy resolution and Josephson tunneling. Subsurface magnetic scatterers with Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states are identified in FeSe, around which we observe particle-hole symmetric gap modulations accompanied by spatial modulation of the Josephson current. Those modulations have wavevectors consistent with intra-pocket PBSI. We further demonstrate that phase-referenced quasiparticle interference imaging offers an independent and direct probe of PBSI beyond gap mapping. These results establish PBSI as a viable origin of gap modulations in superconductors lacking preexisting charge/spin density wave orders, and motivate further investigation of the intriguing gap modulation phenomenology.

Title: Beyond dpa: an atomistic framework for a quantitative description of radiation damage in YBa2Cu3O7
Authors: Federico Ledda, Daniele Torsello, Davide Gambino, Flyura Djurabekova, Fabio Calzavara, Niccolò Di Eugenio, Ville Jantunen, Antonio Trotta, Erik Gallo, Kai Nordlund, Francesco Laviano
Abstract: Radiation damage in high-temperature cuprate superconductors represents one of the main technological challenges for their deployment in harsh environments, such as fusion reactors and accelerator facilities. Their complex crystal structure makes modeling irradiation effects in this class of materials a particularly demanding task, for which existing damage models remain inadequate. In this work, we develop an atomistic-based approach for describing primary radiation damage in YBa2Cu3O7, by coupling Molecular Dynamics and Binary Collision Approximation simulations in a way that makes them complementary. When integrated with Primary Knock-on Atom spectra obtained from Monte Carlo codes, our results establish a framework for multiscale modeling of radiation damage, enabling quantitative estimates of several damage descriptors, such as defect production, defect clustering, and the effective damaged volume for any specific irradiation conditions where collision cascades dominate. This computational approach is suitable for the prediction of irradiation effects in any complex functional oxide, with applications ranging from aerospace to nuclear fusion and high-energy physics.

Title: Magnetic-field-induced insulating behavior in black phosphorus under pressure
Authors: Kazuto Akiba, Yuzuki Sega, Yuichi Akahama, Yuta Seo, Tomoki Machida, Masashi Tokunaga
Abstract: We investigated the out-of-plane magnetoresistance of pressurized black phosphorus (BP) with a longitudinal field configuration. Despite the absence of the Lorentz force in the present configuration, we observed a significant enhancement of magnetoresistance marked with a clear onset field in both the semiconducting (1.1 GPa) and semimetallic (1.3 GPa) phases. The insulating behavior observed near the semiconductor-semimetal transitio pressure is possibly associated with emergence of an excitonic phase, which has been suggested in a recent theoretical study. BP under finely tuned pressure can be a candidate to realize the field-induced electronic phase transition in a moderate magnetic field below 9 T.

Title: Field-free Josephson diode and tunable $ϕ_0$-junction in chiral kagome antiferromagnets
Authors: Jin-Xing Hou, Chuang Li, Lun-Hui Hu, Song-Bo Zhang
Abstract: The recent realization of superconducting proximity effect in chiral antiferromagnets (cAFMs) opens a new route to nonreciprocal superconducting transport of fundamental interest and practical importance. Using microscopic modeling and symmetry analysis, we show that Josephson junctions formed by conventional $s$-wave superconductors (SCs) and cAFMs on the kagome lattice exhibit Josephson diode effects and anomalous phase shifts ($\phi_0$-junction state) when space inversion $\mathcal{I}$, time-reversal $\mathcal{T}$, and combined mirror-time-reversal $\mathcal{TM}_z$ symmetries are simultaneously broken. We propose two setups to realize these phenomena and achieve high diode efficiency. (i) An SC/cAFM/SC junction with spin-orbit coupling, which enables a field-free diode effect with a robust tunable $\phi_0$-junction state. (ii) An SC/cAFM/cAFM$^\prime$/SC junction, where two cAFM layers with different in-plane order orientations, under an out-of-plane Zeeman exchange field, produces significant diode effect and anomalous phase shifts. These results establish a direct link between $\mathcal{TM}_z$ symmetry breaking and nonreciprocal superconductivity, suggesting cAFMs as versatile platforms for symmetry-engineered Josephson diodes and tunable $\phi_0$-junctions.

Title: A geometric framework for curvature-dependent collective behavior of polar active agents on curved surfaces
Authors: Tatsuo Shibata
Abstract: In biological systems, active agents such as actomyosin and cells move and interact on curved surfaces, exhibiting diverse phenomena. These observations have motivated studies of how curvature shapes their collective behavior. Here, using a geometric framework, a minimal model is presented for interacting active agents on curved surfaces with Vicsek-like polar alignment. A transition between disordered and ordered states occurs on spheres as well as on oblate and prolate spheroids. As the deviation from sphericity increases, the transition point shifts to higher alignment strengths, and swarming localizes to an equatorial belt away from the poles, indicating that curvature heterogeneity influences the emergence of the polar-ordered state.

Title: Entropy stabilization and effect of A-site ionic size in bilayer nickelates
Authors: Jia-Yi Lu, Jia-Xin Li, Xin-Yu Zhao, Yi-Qiang Lin, Guang-Han Cao
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has sparked a surge of research into Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates. Currently, stabilizing the bilayer RP phases with smaller $A$-site ions remains a significant challenge. In this work, we have successfully synthesized medium- and high-entropy bilayer nickelates, La$_{1.2}$Pr$_{0.6}$Nd$_{0.6}$Sm$_{0.6}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and La$_{0.67}$Pr$_{0.67}$Nd$_{0.67}$Sm$_{0.33}$Eu$_{0.33}$Gd$_{0.33}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, by utilizing the concept of configuration entropy stabilization. The high-entropy nickelate exhibits the smallest unit-cell volume and the largest orthorhombic distortion reported to date. The chemical pressure induced by the smaller A-site ions significantly enhances the NiO$_6$ octahedral rotation/distortion and shortens the interlayer Ni-Ni interatomic spacing. Physical property measurements reveal bad electrical conductivity alongside a markedly elevated density-wave transition temperature. Notably, the superconducting transition temperature extrapolated from structural correlations is projected to exceed 100 K. Our work not only demonstrates entropy stabilization of bilayer nickelates, but also reveals the effect of $A$-site-ion size on the crystal structure and physical properties, opening a new pathway for developing nickelate superconductors and tuning their electronic properties.

Title: On the Properties of Elemental and High-Tc Superconductors in an Applied Magnetic Field in a Unified Framework
Authors: G.P. Malik, V.S. Varma
Abstract: The unified approach based on the Generalized BCS equations incorporating chemical potential employed to deal with the critical temperature, gap(s) and coherence length(s) of any superconductor (SC) in an earlier paper is shown here to be also applicable when the SC is in an applied field. Presented herein are the calculated values of the following parameters related to its penetration depth and critical current density: the interaction parameter governing the formation of Cooper pairs (CPs), the number of occupied Landau levels, the number density of charge carriers, the critical velocity of CPs, and the values of chemical potential at T = Tc and zero. Our study is found to corroborate the finding reported by Rasolt and Tesanovic [Revs. Mod. Phys., 64, 709 (1992)] that in some systems the effective electron-electron interaction is enhanced with increasing magnetic field and sheds new light on the finding reported by Audouard et al. [Euro. Phys. Lett., 109, 27003 (2015)] that the properties of a superconductor in magnetic fields are controlled by a single band despite the multiband nature of the Fermi surface. The SCs dealt with are Cd, Zn, Al, In, Hg, MgB2, YBCO, Bi-2212 Bi-2223, Tl-2212, Tl-2223 and compressed H3S and LaH10.

Title: Explosive dispersal of non-motile microbes through metabolic buoyancy
Authors: Jimreeves David, Shashi Thutupalli
Abstract: For non-motile microorganisms, spatial expansion in quiescent fluids is presumed to be limited by diffusion. We report that microbial colonies can explosively circumvent this constraint through a self-amplifying physical process. As non-motile yeast and bacteria metabolize dense nutrients into lighter waste within their fluid environment, they generate buoyancy-driven Rayleigh-Bénard convection, an ubiquitous fluid-dynamical phenomenon that organizes material on scales from chemical reactors to planetary atmospheres. This robust, self-generated flow fragments and disperses cellular aggregates, which seed new growth sites, enhancing total metabolic activity and further strengthening the convective flow in an autocatalytic cycle. The resulting expansion follows accelerating power-law kinetics, quantitatively captured by a physical theory linking metabolic flux to flow velocity, and produces fractal patterns through a flow-focusing instability we term Circulation-Driven Aggregation, the hydrodynamic analogue of Diffusion-Limited Aggregation. This `metabolic fireworks' mechanism establishes a canonical instance of proliferating active matter, where cellular metabolic activity self-organizes a physical transport engine--a living Rayleigh-Bénard convection--providing a fundamental, physics-based dispersal strategy.

Title: Finite-temperature quantum rotor approach for ultracold bosons in optical lattices
Authors: M. Rodríguez Martín, T. A. Zaleski
Abstract: Interacting bosons in optical lattices directly expose quantum phases in a clean, highly controllable environment. This requires engineering systems with very low entropies, but the resulting temperature--interaction ratios $T/U$ of present experiments remain well above the domain where zero-temperature theories are expected to be reliable. The quantum-rotor approach (QRA), while analytically powerful and extremely flexible, inherits ground-state phase correlations and therefore breaks down once thermal winding of the phase field becomes significant. Here we construct a finite-temperature extension of QRA by (i) performing resummation of winding-number contributions for temperatures $k_{B}T/U\lesssim 0.2$ and (ii) developing an auxiliary-variable expansion that remains accurate toward the classical limit. The resulting closed expression for the phase correlator is inserted into the standard spherical-approximation QRA without sacrificing the method's flexibility with respect to lattice geometry and dimensionality. The approach reproduces the shrinkage of Mott lobes from $T=0$ up to $k_{B}T/U\simeq 0.2$ in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions and with in-situ imaging experiments. This finite-T QRA thus supplies an analytic, computationally light tool for strongly correlated lattice bosons and sets the stage for amplitude-fluctuation upgrades required at higher temperatures.

Title: Extending the Flory-Huggins Theory for Crystalline Multicomponent Mixtures
Authors: Maxime Siber, Olivier J. J. Ronsin, Jens Harting
Abstract: The Flory-Huggins theory is a well-established lattice model that is commonly used to study the mixing of distinct chemical species. It can successfully predict phase separation phenomena in blends of incompatible materials. However, it is limited to amorphous mixtures, excluding systems where the phase segregation is shaped by the concurrent crystallization of one or several blend components. A generalization of the Flory-Huggins formalism is thus necessary to capture the coupling and the interplay of crystallization with amorphous demixing mechanisms, such as spinodal decomposition. This work therefore revolves around the derivation of a free energy model for multicomponent mixtures that encompasses the physics of both processes. It is detailed which concepts from the original Flory-Huggins theory are required to apprehend the presented developments and how the current framework is built upon them. Furthermore, additional discussion points address chemical potential calculations and selected examples of binary and ternary phase diagrams, thereby highlighting the variety of blend behaviors that can be represented.

Title: Tight-binding and density-functional study of the Raman tensor in two-dimensional massive Dirac fermion systems
Authors: Selçuk Parlak, Abhishek Kumar, Runhan Li, Maia G. Vergniory, Ion Garate
Abstract: Recently, two unusual features were theoretically predicted for the Raman response of out-of-plane phonons in magnetic two-dimensional materials hosting massive Dirac fermions. First, the phase difference between certain Raman tensor elements was found to be quantized to $\pm \pi/2$, sensitive only to the sign of the Dirac fermion mass. Second, a selection rule was identified in the Raman intensity under circularly polarized light, which generalizes the well-known optical valley selection rule. These predictions were based on a low-energy effective model in the continuum approximation. Here, we test the robustness of those results for more realistic theoretical approaches. First, we calculate the Raman tensor for an electronic tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice with broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries. Second, we compute the Raman tensor from density functional theory (DFT) for a monolayer of ferromagnetic 2H-RuCl$_2$. Both calculations corroborate the analytical results found in the continuum model, thereby theoretically confirming the peculiar behaviour of the Raman tensor for two dimensional massive Dirac fermion systems.

Title: Magnetic behavior and phase diagram of epitaxial Er3Fe5O12 thin films across the compensation temperature
Authors: Satakshi Pandey, Antoine Barbier, Anne Forget, Brice Sarpi, Francesco Maccherozzi, Roberto Sant, Nicholas B. Brookes, Jean-Baptiste Moussy, Pamella Vasconcelos Borges Pinho
Abstract: Rare-earth iron garnet (RE3Fe5O12) films are promising insulating ferrimagnets. They can show low magnetic damping, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and ultrafast spin dynamics, which makes them ideal for spin transport applications. In this work, we investigate the interaction between the magnetic sublattices in Er3Fe5O12 thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition on a Gd3Ga5O12 substrate. Structural and magnetic characterization reveals high-quality single-crystal growth, with compensation temperature close to the reported bulk value (~80 K). Magnetic phase diagrams based on element-specific measurements map out the regions where ferrimagnetic, canted, and aligned phases are stable across the compensation temperature. The micromagnetic dynamics resulting from perpendicular magnetic pulse perturbation of an in-plane magnetized layer was investigated at room temperature and reveals complex configurations. These results are a key feature for modulating magnetization dynamics through the compensation phenomenon, which is essential for spin-based devices operating in a low-temperature regime.

Title: Repulsive fermions and shell effects on the surface of a sphere
Authors: Lorenzo Frigato, Andrea Bardin, Luca Salasnich
Abstract: In recent years, ultracold atomic gases confined in curved geometries have obtained considerable theoretical interest. This is motivated by recent realizations of bubble traps in microgravity conditions, which open the possibility of investigating quantum many-body physics beyond the conventional flat-space paradigm. The theoretical interest up to now was mainly focused on Bose gases and their phenomenology, and had left the study of Fermi gases behind. In this paper, we investigate a two-component repulsive Fermi gas constrained to the surface of a sphere at finite temperature. We first analyze the non-interacting case, showing how the intrinsic geometrical features of the spherical surface give rise to a shell structures and modify the low-temperature thermodynamics compared to the flat two-dimensional gas. Repulsive interactions are then considered through an effective path-integral approach within a Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, enabling us to derive the grand canonical potential and to regularize the associated Matsubara summation. We then investigate the stability of the spin-balanced state and obtain the finite-temperature Stoner criterion for fermions on a sphere, highlighting the interplay between the repulsive interactions and shell effects.

Title: Orbital-related gyrotropic responses in Cu$_2$WSe$_4$ and chirality indicator
Authors: Kazuki Nakazawa, Terufumi Yamaguchi, Ai Yamakage
Abstract: In recent years, counterparts of phenomena studied in spintronics have been actively explored in the orbital sector. The relationship between orbital degrees of freedom and crystal chirality has also been intensively investigated, although the distinction from gyrotropic properties has not been fully clarified. In this work, we investigate spin and orbital Edelstein effects as well as the nonlinear responses in the ternary transition-metal chalcogenide Cu$_2$WSe$_4$, which has a gyrotropic but achiral crystal structure. We find that in the Edelstein effect, magnetization is dominated by the orbital contribution rather than the spin contribution. On the other hand, both the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric (NCTE) Hall effect--a response to the cross product of the electric field and the temperature gradient--and the nonlinear Hall effect--conventional second-order response to the electric field--are found to be dominated by the Berry curvature dipole. We further find that spin-orbit coupling plays only a minor role in these effects, whereas the orbital degrees of freedom are essential. Finally, we demonstrate that the orbital magnetic-moment contributions to both the Edelstein effect and the NCTE Hall effect are closely linked to chirality, and we discuss the possibility of using them as a chirality indicator.

Title: Interplay of Crystallization and Amorphous Spinodal Decomposition during Thermal Annealing of Organic Photoactive Layers
Authors: Maxime Siber, Olivier J. J. Ronsin, Gitti L. Frey, Jens Harting
Abstract: Tailoring the nanomorphology of organic photoactive layers through a specialized chain of processing steps is an imperative challenge on the path towards reliable and performant organic electronic manufacturing. This hurdle generally proves delicate to be overcome, as organic materials can be subject to many different phase transformation phenomena that are able to interfere with each other and produce a wide variety of morphological configurations with distinct structural, mechanical, and optoelectronic properties. A typical combination of such mechanisms, which the present systems are often prone to, and which is complex to investigate experimentally at the nanoscale, is the phase separation resulting from the interplay between amorphous demixing and crystallization. In this work, an in-house Phase-Field modeling framework is employed to simulate and, consequently, explain the phenomenological behavior of a photoactive bulk heterojunction during a thermal annealing treatment. The model predictions are validated against available electron microscopy imaging of the nanostructural evolution during the process. It is demonstrated that the simulations can successfully provide a detailed comprehension of crystal nucleation and growth shaped by amorphous spinodal decomposition, so as to yield valuable insights for physically-based morphology control. In addition, this study shows the relevance of extensive thermodynamic and kinetic characterizations of organic semiconductor mixtures (e.g., phase diagram assessments, surface tension measurements, composition-dependent molecular diffusivity evaluations) for the associated field of research.

Title: Machine Learning-based Optimal Control for Colloidal Self-Assembly
Authors: Andres Lizano-Villalobos, Fangyuan Ma, Wentao Tang, Wei Sun, Xun Tang
Abstract: Achieving precise control of colloidal self-assembly into specific patterns remains a longstanding challenge due to the complex process dynamics. Recently, machine learning-based state representation and reinforcement learning-based control strategies have started to accumulate popularity in the field, showing great potential in achieving an automatable and generalizable approach to producing patterned colloidal assembly. In this work, we adopted a machine learning-based optimal control framework, combining unsupervised learning and graph convolutional neural work for state observation with deep reinforcement learning-based optimal control policy calculation, to provide a data-driven control approach that can potentially be generalized to other many-body self-assembly systems. With Brownian dynamics simulations, we demonstrated its superior performance as compared to traditional order parameter-based state description, and its efficacy in obtaining ordered 2-dimensional spherical colloidal self-assembly in an electric field-mediated system with an actual success rate of 97%.

Title: A single-chain nanoparticle-based mean-field theory for associative polymers
Authors: Marco Cappa, Stefano Chiani, Francesco Sciortino, Lorenzo Rovigatti
Abstract: Associative polymers are a class of polymers containing attractive stickers that can reversibly bind to each other. Their fully-bonded state gives rise, in dilute conditions, to a fluid phase of so-called single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs). These constructs have been used in a wide range of applications, from the design of new materials (e.g. biomolecular condensates) to drug-delivery vectors. The thermodynamic properties of SCNPs sensitively depend on the number of different sticker types, since numerical simulations show that a continuous transition to a network of chains upon increase of polymer concentration in the single sticker-type case can be replaced by an abrupt network formation (via a first-order phase transition) in the multiple sticker-type case. We present here a theory that, using the SCNP fluid as the reference system, quantifies the free energy change associated with transferring an intra-molecular bond to an inter-molecular bond, elucidating the impact on the phase separation process of the sticker topology. Despite its simplicity, the theory highlights which microscopic assumptions (looping statistics, chain-level excluded volume) are most relevant for accurately capturing the thermodynamics of these systems. Our results match available numerical predictions obtained via coarse grained simulations of these systems, highlighting in particular the sensitivity of the phase behaviour on the sequence of the stickers along the chain.

Title: Interfacial Strain Modulated Correlated Plasmons in La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 and Their Role in High-temperature Superconductivity
Authors: Xiongfang Liu, Shengwei Zeng, Xun Liu, Kun Han, Difan Zhou, Chi Sin Tang, Ping Yang, Mark B. H. Breese, Chuanbing Cai, Ariando Ariando, Mi Jiang, Xinmao Yin
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials remains a major challenge in physics due to the complexity of their strongly correlated electronic states. Interfacial strain is a powerful lever for tuning electronic correlations in complex oxides, offering new pathways to control emergent quantum phases. Here, we report the discovery of interfacial strain modulated correlated plasmons observed exclusively in superconducting La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO) through spectroscopic ellipsometry. This form of plasmons is absent in the non-superconducting LSCO counterparts. Detailed analysis reveals that these correlated plasmons, arising from the collective excitations within Mott-correlated bands, are driven by long-range electronic correlations in the Cu-O planes. Furthermore, long-range electronic correlations, intricately modulated by interfacial strain, may play a crucial role in the emergence of superconductivity and in tuning the transition temperature. Dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the extended Hubbard model suggest that long-range Coulomb interactions play an important role in LSCO, showing good agreement with our experimental findings. The collective evidence from both the experimental results and theoretical findings provides new insights into the nature of collective excitations and their pivotal role in the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity.

Title: Charge order in the Pr substituted YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ from high-field Hall effect measurements
Authors: C. M. Duffy, M. Altangerel, S. Badoux, D. Vignolles, T. Oustric, C. M. Moir, Keke Feng, A. Frano, M. B. Maple, L. Taillefer, C. Proust
Abstract: The mechanism of doping in the composite Pr$_x$Y$_{1-x}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (Pr-YBCO) system is distinct from that of pure YBCO, offering a means to explore the requirements for the numerous electronic orders appearing in the phase diagram. One such example is the ubiquitous 2D charge order and concomitant Fermi surface reconstruction in underdoped YBCO. Here, using magnetotransport and Hall effect measurements, we find signatures of a Fermi surface reconstruction similar to that in pure YBCO indicating the presence of 2D charge order in Pr-YBCO. Additionally, we find that the phase diagrams of Pr-YBCO and YBCO are decidedly symmetric despite the additional disorder in the former and the distinction between hole depletion through Pr substitution and through O reduction. This indicates that while the mechanism of doping differs, the amount of charge carriers in the planes is the most important factor governing the electronic orders in these systems.

Title: Moiré-modulated $Γ$ valley in twisted bilayer and twisted double-bilayer MoTe$_2$
Authors: Wanying Chen, Hongyun Zhang, Jinxi Lu, Yu Gu, Qiyun Xu, Fei Wang, Xuanxi Cai, Jiansong Li, Jiayong Xiao, Rui Chen, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jose Avila, Pavel Dudin, Matthew D. Watson, Pu Yu, Shengwei Jiang, Wenhui Duan, Tingxin Li, Chong Wang, Shuyun Zhou
Abstract: Twisted MoTe$_2$ hosts intriguing correlated quantum phenomena including the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted bilayer (t-BL) MoTe$_2$ near 3.7$^\circ$, which is sensitive to the twist angle and moiré superlattices. Here, we directly visualize the twist-angle-modulated electronic structure of t-BL and twisted double-bilayer (t-DBL) near this critical angle. We find that the moiré superlattice not only modifies the relative energy between $\Gamma$ and K valleys in t-BL MoTe$_2$, but also strongly reconstructs the $\Gamma$ valley for both t-BL and t-DBL. Specifically, the deep $p_z$-derived band at $\Gamma$ exhibits a distinct splitting that systematically varies with increasing twist angle. Theoretical analysis suggests that this modulation arises from the twist-angle-dependent lattice relaxation, especially interfacial corrugations. Our work directly visualizes the moiré-modulated electronic structure and provides key spectroscopic information of lattice relaxation and interlayer interactions underlying the physics of twisted MoTe$_2$.

Title: Fractional Chern insulator with higher Chern number in optical lattice
Authors: Ying-Xing Ding, Wen-Tong Li, Li-Min Zhang, Yu-Biao Wu, Duanlu Zhou, Lin Zhuang, Wu-Ming Liu
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators arise in topologically nontrivial flat bands, characterized by an integer Chern number C that corresponds to the number of dissipationless edge states in the non-interacting regime. Higher Chern numbers can replicate the physics of higher Landau levels and often confer enhanced topological robustness. However, realizing correlated fractional phases with higher Chern numbers in such flat band systems remains challenging. Here, we propose an interlayer coupling scheme to generate higher Chern numbers in a flat-band system, where the interlayer coupling transforms two C = 1 bands in a bilayer checkerboard lattice into a single flat band with C = 2 by lifting their degeneracy and merging their topological indices. Exact diagonalization calculation reveals that this engineered band hosts two fractional Chern insulator states with C = 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. An experimental setup is proposed to simulate these states using cold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an effective bilayer optical lattice. Our work provides a general and widely applicable strategy for constructing higher Chern number flat bands, opening a pathway to explore exotic fractional quantum phases

Title: Atomic forces from correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem
Authors: Damian Contant, Maria Hellgren
Abstract: We extend the capabilities of correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem by implementing the analytical atomic forces within the random phase approximation (RPA), in the context of plane waves and pseudopotentials. Forces are calculated at self-consistency through the optimized effective potential method and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. In addition, non-self-consistent RPA forces, starting from the PBE generalized gradient approximation, are evaluated using density functional perturbation theory. In both cases, we find forces of excellent numerical quality. Furthermore, for most molecules and solids studied, self-consistency is found to have a negligible impact on the computed geometries and vibrational frequencies. The RPA is shown to systematically improve over PBE and, by including the exact-exchange kernel within RPA + exchange (RPAx), through finite-difference total energy calculations, we obtain an accuracy comparable to advanced wavefunction methods. Finally, we estimate the anharmonic shift and provide accurate theoretical references based on RPA and RPAx for the zone-center optical phonon of diamond, silicon, and germanium.

Title: Hyperfine coupling in singlet ground state magnets
Authors: Peter Thalmeier
Abstract: The influence of hyperfine coupling to nuclear spins and of their quadrupolar splitting on the induced moment order in singlet ground state magnets is investigated. The latter are found among non-Kramers f electron compounds. Without coupling to the nuclear spins these magnets have a quantum critical point (QCP) separating paramagnetic and induced moment regime. The hyperfine interaction suppresses the QCP and leads to a gradual crossover between induced electronic and nuclear hyperfine coupling dominated magnetic order. It is shown how the critical temperature depends on the electronic and nuclear control parameters including the nuclear spin size and its possible nuclear quadrupole splitting. In particular the dependence of the specific heat on the control parameters and applied field is investigated for ferro- and antiferromagnetic order. It is shown that the three peak structure in the electronic induced moment regime gradually changes to a two-peak structure in the hyperfine coupling dominated nuclear moment order regime or for increasing field strength. Most importantly the possibility of a reentrance behaviour of magnetic order or likewise nonmonotonic critical fields due to hyperfine coupling influence is demonstrated. Finally the systematic evolution of the phase diagram under the influence of nuclear quadrupole coupling is clarified.

Title: Probing formation and epitaxy of ultrathin Titanium Silicide using low and medium energy ion scattering
Authors: Philipp M. Wolf, Eduardo Pitthan, Zhen Zhang, Tuan T. Tran, Radek Holeňák, Daniel Primetzhofer
Abstract: Titanium silicide is a key contact material in advanced three-dimensional semiconductor device architectures. Here, we examine the formation of ultrathin Ti-silicide on Si(100) using a combination of non-destructive in-situ and ex-situ ion scattering techniques capable of resolving composition and structure at the nanoscale. In-situ Time-of-Flight Low-Energy Ion Scattering (ToF-LEIS) indicates intermixing after annealing at 350 °C, with further compositional changes after annealing at 500 °C, including the emergence of a Si terminating layer at the surface. Consecutive ex-situ Time-of-Flight Medium-Energy Ion Scattering (ToF-MEIS) reveals a Ti-rich polycrystalline surface layer and a Si-rich interface layer exhibiting strong ordering along the Si [100] axis. High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) images confirm these findings, revealing a $\approx$1.5 nm thick epitaxial silicide layer at the interface. The presence of an epitaxial interface is particularly promising for minimizing contact resistivity in ultrathin contact layers, where interfacial order can dominate electronic performance. In addition, both ToF-MEIS and HR-TEM unveil significant variations in the thickness of the silicide layer, with a substantial interface roughness but no translation of this roughness to the surface.

Title: Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells: Bridging Materials Development and Process System Engineering for Gigawatt-Scale Applications
Authors: Matthias Riegraf, Marc Riedel, Soren Hojgaard Jensen, Srikanth Santhanam, S. Asif Ansar, Marc Heddrich
Abstract: High-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are a potential core power-to-X (P2X) technology due to their unparalleled system efficiencies, that can exceed 85 % when excess heat from exothermic downstream processes is available. Recent advancements in materials, cell and stack design have enabled the deployment of megawatt (MW) scale demonstration plants and gigawatt (GW) scale manufacturing capacities. Consequently, key challenges to industrial-scale adoption scale now increasingly lie at the system level. Unlike previous SOEC reviews focused on materials and stack-level innovations, this work uniquely addresses emerging interdisciplinary system-level challenges and highlights the need for a paradigm shift. Several key insights are identified. Pressurized operation plays a crucial role in enhancing SOEC system performance and enabling better process integration. The dynamic capabilities of SOECs are better than often assumed and can further be improved via advanced operating strategies and modularization. Balance-of-plant (BoP) component costs rival stack capital expenditure, emphasizing the need for cost reductions through economies of scale via mass production and cross-industry synergies. Co-electrolysis remains at a lower technology readiness level and lacks MW scale demonstration. Furthermore, demonstrated integration with downstream processes across entire P2X chains remains scarce. Future research and development strategies are proposed, offering a roadmap to overcome these challenges and accelerate SOEC commercialization.

Title: Supersolid crystals of dipolar excitons in a lattice
Authors: C. Morin, C. Lagoin, T. Gupta, N. Reinic, K. Baldwin, L. Pfeiffer, G. Pupillo, F. Dubin
Abstract: In condensed-matter physics, long-range correlations introduce quantum states of matter that challenge intuition. For instance, supersolids combine symmetry-breaking crystalline structure, i.e. density order, and frictionless superfluid flow. Envisioned over fifty years ago, supersolids have proven to only exist under very stringent conditions, with experimental evidence limited to few observations. Many-body phases with supersolid properties in fact reduce to a few recent observations for weakly interacting Bose gases. Here, we demonstrate a new framework to realize supersolid crystals in the strong interaction regime, by confining dipolar bosons in a lattice with long-range hopping. We study dipolar excitons that genuinely realize this lattice model. At fractional lattice fillings - 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 - we report mesoscopic quantum solids, across over 100 sites, spontaneously breaking translational symmetry. At the same time, we show that off-diagonal long-range order is induced by long-range hopping, such that exciton solids are superfluids. State-of-the-art numerical methods quantitatively confirm that supersolidity builds up in the ground-state of the lattice Hamiltonian. Our studies of strongly-correlated supersolid crystals open new frontiers for exploration in condensed matter physics.

Title: Quartic energy band engineering in artificial semiconductor honeycomb lattices
Authors: Emre Okcu, Emre Mesudiyeli, Hâldun Sevinçli, A. Devrim Güçlü
Abstract: Artificially engineered lattices provide a flexible platform for reproducing and extending the electronic behavior of atomic-scale materials. Artificial graphene systems, in particular, mimic graphene-like linear dispersion with tunable Dirac cones and offer a route to realizing more exotic band structures. Here we examine the emergence of quartic energy dispersion in artificial graphene heterostructures using analytical modeling and numerical solutions of the effective Hamiltonian. We identify three distinct quartic band types: Mexican-hat-shaped (MHS), purely quartic, and non-MHS quartic bands, and determine the conditions under which each arises. We find that a staggered honeycomb lattice supports all three classes of quartic dispersion, whereas its planar counterpart yields only purely quartic and non-MHS forms. These results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering quartic band edges in artificial lattices and clarify how lattice geometry can be used to tailor their characteristics.

Title: Predictive Inorganic Synthesis based on Machine Learning using Small Data sets: a case study of size-controlled Cu Nanoparticles
Authors: Brent Motmans, Digvijay Ghogare, Thijs G.I. van Wijk, An Hardy, Danny E.P. Vanpoucke
Abstract: Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) have a broad applicability, yet their synthesis is sensitive to subtle changes in reaction parameters. This sensitivity, combined with the time- and resource-intensive nature of experimental optimization, poses a major challenge in achieving reproducible and size-controlled synthesis. While Machine Learning (ML) shows promise in materials research, its application is often limited by scarcity of large high-quality experimental data sets. This study explores ML to predict the size of Cu NPs from microwave-assisted polyol synthesis using a small data set of 25 in-house performed syntheses. Latin Hypercube Sampling is used to efficiently cover the parameter space while creating the experimental data set. Ensemble regression models, built with the AMADEUS framework, successfully predict particle sizes with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.74$), outperforming classical statistical approaches ($R^2 = 0.60$). Overall, this study highlights that, for lab-scale synthesis optimization, high-quality small datasets combined with classical, interpretable ML models outperform traditional statistical methods and are fully sufficient for quantitative synthesis prediction. This approach provides a sustainable and experimentally realistic pathway toward data-driven inorganic synthesis design.

Title: Spectroscopy of Wigner crystal polarons in an atomically thin semiconductor
Authors: L. Wang, F. Menzel, F. Pichler, P. Knüppel, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, M. Knap, T. Smoleński
Abstract: Strongly interacting electrons in two-dimensional systems can spontaneously break translational symmetry, forming a periodic Wigner crystal. Although these crystals have been realized in several platforms, experimental studies of their collective many-body excitations in the absence of a magnetic field remain an outstanding challenge. Here, we access this regime optically by uncovering Wigner crystal polarons: novel light-matter excitations arising from the dressing of excitons by collective excitations of the Wigner crystal. These hybrid quasiparticles manifest as new optical resonances in cryogenic reflectance spectra of a charge-tunable WSe$_2$ monolayer, appearing concurrently with previously identified exciton umklapp transitions. In contrast to the latter, the energies of Wigner crystal polarons are governed not only by the electronic lattice constant but also by their hybridization with attractive exciton-polarons, whose strength is controlled by electronic interactions. These novel many-body excitations provide an optical interface to the spin state of the Wigner crystal, which as we demonstrate, can be controlled both magnetically and optically. Our work establishes layered materials as a unique platform for exploring dynamical impurity dressing by strongly correlated electronic orders.

Title: Unified Description of Learning Dynamics in the Soft Committee Machine from Finite to Ultra-Wide Regimes
Authors: Assem Afanah, Bernd Rosenow
Abstract: We study the learning dynamics of the soft committee machine (SCM) with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation using a statistical-mechanics approach within the annealed approximation. The SCM consists of a student network with $N$ input units and $K$ hidden units trained to reproduce the output of a teacher network with $M$ hidden units. We introduce a reduced set of macroscopic order parameters that yields a unified description valid from the conventional regime $K \ll N$ to the ultra-wide limit $K \ge N$. The control parameter $\alpha$, proportional to the ratio of training samples to adjustable weights, serves as an effective measure of dataset size. For small $\gamma = M/N$, we recover a continuous phase transition at $\alpha_{c} \approx 2\pi$ from an unspecialized, permutation-symmetric state to a specialized state in which student units align with the teacher. For finite $\gamma$, the transition disappears and the generalization error decreases smoothly with dataset size, reaching a low plateau when $\gamma=1$. In the asymptotic limit $\alpha \to \infty$, the error scales as $\varepsilon_{g} \propto 1/\alpha$, independent of $\gamma$ and $K$. The results highlight the central role of network dimensions in SCM learning and provide a framework extendable to other activations and quenched analyses.

Title: Current-Induced Modulation of Spin-Wave Propagation in a Y-Junction via Transverse Spin-Transfer Torque
Authors: Lorenzo Gnoatto, Rai M. Menezes, Artim L. Bassant, Rembert A. Duine, Milorad V. Milosevic, Reinoud Lavrijsen
Abstract: We report the transverse control of spin-wave propagation in the configuration where the spin-wave wavevector k is perpendicular to the charge-current density J. Building on theoretical predictions of spin-wave refraction by nonuniform spin-polarized currents, and guided by micromagnetic simulations used to optimize the device geometry and current distribution, we experimentally explore a Y-shaped Permalloy structure in which a locally injected current perturbs the spin-wave dispersion. Measurements reveal current-dependent amplitude differences between the two output branches, providing initial experimental indications consistent with transverse, spin-transfer-torque-driven deflection. Although the magnitude of the effect is modest and accompanied by significant uncertainties, the observed trends qualitatively follow expectations from the simulations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of influencing spin-wave routing through local current injection and establish a proof-of-concept basis for current-controlled manipulation of spin-wave propagation in reconfigurable magnonic circuits.

Title: Turing instability and electronic self-oscillatory dynamics in Dirac fluids
Authors: Prayoga Liong, Aliaksandr Melnichenka, Anton Bukhtatyi, Albert Bilous, Leonid Levitov
Abstract: Viscous films flowing down an incline can form self-sustained running waves, known as Kapitsa roll waves. Here we describe an analogous electron-hydrodynamic instability that produces similar running waves in Dirac materials such as graphene mono- and multilayers. It arises when carrier kinetics near charge neutrality make current dissipation strongly density-dependent. As the flow velocity $u$ exceeds a critical value, the system transitions to a state with coupled spatial and temporal oscillations. Experimentally, the instability should manifest as (i) a nonanalytic behavior characteristic of a second-order transition--an abrupt increase in time-averaged current--and (ii) narrow-band emission at the characteristic ``washboard'' frequency $f=u/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the modulation wavelength. This behavior parallels the AC and DC transport of sliding charge-density waves, but here it originates from a distinct, intrinsic mechanism unrelated to disorder. Estimates indicate that the emission frequency $f$, tunable by current, spans a broad range, highlighting Dirac bands as a promising platform for high-frequency electron-fluid dynamics.

Title: High-Temperature Activation of Single-Photon Emitters in monolayer WS2
Authors: Gyeongjun Lee, Antoine Borel, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Fausto Sirotti, Fabian Cadiz
Abstract: Controlled activation of defect-bound excitonic states in two-dimensional semiconductors provides a route to isolated quantum emitters and a sensitive probe of defect physics. Here we demonstrate that \textit{in situ} high-temperature annealing of hBN-encapsulated monolayer WS$_2$ on a suspended microheater leads to the emergence of spectrally isolated single-photon emitters at cryogenic temperatures. Annealing at temperatures around 1100 K produces a sharp emission line, $X_L$, red-shifted by approximately 80 meV from the neutral exciton and exhibiting a linewidth below 200 $\mu$eV. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy and power-dependent measurements show that $X_L$ originates from annealing-induced defects in the WS$_2$ monolayer, while second-order photon correlation measurements reveal clear antibunching with $g^{(2)}(0)<0.5$. These results establish high-temperature \textit{in situ} annealing as a controlled means to access defect-bound excitonic states and single-photon emission in van der Waals materials.

Abstract: This paper reviews recent advances in the field of metallic glasses, focusing on the development of novel experimental techniques and in silico models. We discuss progress in experimental characterization, additive manufacturing, multiscale modeling approaches, and the growing role of machine learning in understanding and designing these complex materials. On the experimental side, we highlight measurements of thermophysical properties of supercooled liquids via fast chip calorimetry and enhancements in mechanical properties through rejuvenation treatments. This work underscores the crucial role of short-range order and medium-range order in controlling metallic glass mechanical properties. Recent progress in structural probes allows in situ observations of deformation mechanisms, positioning the field well to further advance our understanding of mechanical properties. Additive manufacturing of metallic glasses is discussed as one encouraging new manufacturing route for metallic glasses. We examine laser powder-bed fusion process physics and the central trade-off between amorphicity and densification, including heat affected zone devitrification and defects formation, together with emerging mitigation strategies and applications. On the theoretical and simulation side, we review advances in nanoscale, mesoscale, and continuum modeling of metallic glasses that have led to promising approaches by which multiscale schemes can incorporate data sourced from atomic-scale simulations. These efforts have helped to elucidate the connection between the glass structure and mechanical and rheological responses. We also cover the development of machine learning interatomic potentials for metallic glasses, along with machine learning driven prediction of glass forming ability and inverse design methods. Finally, challenges and directions for future research are presented and discussed.

Title: Controlling Spin-Waves by Inhomogeneous Spin-Transfer Torques
Authors: Lorenzo Gnoatto, Jean F. O. da Silva, Artim L. Bassant, Rai M. Menezes, Rembert A. Duine, Milorad V. Milossevic, Reinoud Lavrijsen
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between spin currents and spin waves in nanofabricated Permalloy waveguides with geometrical constrictions. Using propagating spin-wave spectroscopy, micromagnetic simulations, and analytical modeling, we provide experimental evidence that spin-wave phase can be modulated by inhomogeneous spin-transfer torques generated by current-density gradients shaped by the constriction geometry. Narrower constrictions enhance these gradients and modify the internal field for Damon-Eshbach spin waves, resulting in pronounced changes in spin-wave group velocity and phase. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first demonstration of deterministic phase modulation via engineered nonuniform spin-transfer torques. Beyond enabling a scalable route to magnonic interferometry - a building block for spin-wave-based computing - our findings establish a platform to control spin-wave dynamics in spatially varying current landscapes, relevant for analogue-gravity experiments in condensed matter systems.

Title: Wigner polarons reveal Wigner crystal dynamics in a monolayer semiconductor

Abstract: Wigner crystals, lattices made purely of electrons, are a quintessential paradigm of studying correlation-driven quantum phase transitions. Despite decades of research, the internal dynamics of Wigner crystals has remained extremely challenging to access, with most experiments probing only static order or collective motion. Here, we establish monolayer WSe2 as a new materials platform to host zero-field Wigner crystals and then demonstrate that exciton spectroscopy provides a direct means to probe both static and dynamic properties of these electron lattices. We uncover striking optical resonances that we identify as Wigner polarons, quasiparticles formed when the electron lattice is locally distorted by exciton-Wigner crystal coupling. We further achieve all-optical control of spins in the Wigner crystal, directly probing valley-dependent Wigner polaron scattering well above the magnetic ordering temperature and in the absence of any external magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate optical melting of the Wigner crystal and observe intriguingly different responses of the umklapp (static) and Wigner polaron (dynamic) resonances to optical excitation. Our results open up exciting new avenues for elucidating electron dynamics and achieving ultrafast optical control of interaction-driven quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated electron systems.

Title: Observation of REBCO delamination in the resistive insulation nested coils
Authors: Jun Lu, Iain Dixon, Kwangmin Kim, Yan Xin, Hongyu Bai
Abstract: The REBCO coated conductor has the potential to be widely used in ultrahigh field magnets. It is well known, however, that it is not mechanically strong against delamination in the direction normal to its surface due to its intrinsic layered structure. Therefore, conductor delamination is one of the major design challenges for REBCO magnet coils. As a part of the development of the 40 T all-superconducting magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, USA (NHMFL), a dry-wound resistive-insulation-nested-coils (RINC) was designed to reach 25.8 T. It used surface-treated stainless-steel tape as a co-wind to control the turn-to-turn contact resistance, and was fabricated and tested in a liquid helium bath. During the test, two of the double pancake modules exhibited resistive transitions at a current significantly lower than the designed value. The postmortem inspection of the REBCO conductor of these modules by reel-to-reel magnetization at 77 K found sections of very low critical current. Further investigations of one section by chemical etching, visual inspection, and electron microscopy revealed that conductor of this section was delaminated. We present the detailed findings of these postmortem characterizations. The implication of this type of delamination for future magnet designs will be discussed.

Title: Theory of exciton polarons in 2D Wigner crystals
Authors: Haydn S. Adlong, Eugen Dizer, Richard Schmidt, Atac Imamoglu, Arthur Christianen
Abstract: Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a platform for realizing Wigner crystals and enable their detection via exciton spectroscopy. We develop a microscopic theoretical model for excitons interacting with the localized electrons of the Wigner crystal, including their vibrational motion. In addition to the previously observed exciton-Umklapp feature, the theory reproduces and explains the higher-band attractive-polaron resonances recently reported experimentally. Our model further uncovers that the appearance of two equal-strength and parallel attractive polarons, as commonly observed in WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, is a signature of strong correlations in the electronic system. Altogether, our results demonstrate that accounting for electronic interactions is essential to reproduce and interpret the exciton-polaron spectra of TMDs.

Title: Photoinduced phase heterogeneity and charge localization in SnSe
Authors: Benjamin J. Dringoli, Zhongzhen Luo, Mercouri G. Kanatzidis, David G. Cooke
Abstract: Time-resolved multi-terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is used to observe pump fluence-dependent dynamics in the optical conductivity of photoexcited tin selenide (SnSe) over an ultrabroadband spectral range of 0.5 - 11 THz at fluences from 0.1 - 7.5 mJ/cm$^2$. At pump fluences below 3 mJ/cm$^2$, we observe a free carrier Drude spectrum and broad phonon resonances typical of a photoexcited semiconductor. With increasing fluence, a suppression of the DC photoconductivity is observed, indicating an interruption of long range transport due to phase disorder. Concomitantly, the c-axis polarized $B^2_{1u}$ optical phonon narrows and blueshifts, consistent with a transition to a higher symmetry structure. At intermediate fluences of 3.1 mJ/cm$^2$, a high frequency Lorentzian component appears that red shifts on a 50 ps time scale, where a Drude spectrum is eventually restored. Our results provide evidence for a non-thermal, photo-induced nucleation of higher symmetry, semi-metallic phase domains in SnSe appearing within 200 fs with the system relaxing back to its homogeneous $Pnma$ semiconducting phase on a 200 ps time scale.

Authors: Charles Parton-Barr, Stuart R. Berrow, Calum J. Gibb, Jordan Hobbs, Wanhe Jiang, Caitlin O'Brien, Will C. Ogle, Helen F. Gleeson, Richard J. Mandle
Abstract: Fluid ferroelectrics, a recently discovered class of liquid crystals that exhibit switchable, long-range polar order, offer opportunities in ultrafast electro-optic technologies, responsive soft matter, and next-generation energy materials. Yet their discovery has relied almost entirely on intuition and chance, limiting progress in the field. Here we develop and experimentally validate a deep-learning data-to-molecule pipeline that enables the targeted design and synthesis of new organic fluid ferroelectrics. We curate a comprehensive dataset of all known longitudinally polar liquid-crystal materials and train graph neural networks that predict ferroelectric behaviour with up to 95% accuracy and achieve root mean square errors as low as 11 K for transition temperatures. A graph variational autoencoder generates de novo molecular structures which are filtered using an ensemble of high-performing classifiers and regressors to identify candidates with predicted ferroelectric nematic behaviour and accessible transition temperatures. Integration with a computational retrosynthesis engine and a digitised chemical inventory further narrows the design space to a synthesis-ready longlist. 11 candidates were synthesised and characterized through established mixture-based extrapolation methods. From which extrapolated ferroelectric nematic transitions were compared against neural network predictions. The experimental verification of novel materials augments the original dataset with quality feedback data thus aiding future research. These results demonstrate a practical, closed-loop approach to discovering synthesizable fluid ferroelectrics, marking a step toward autonomous design of functional soft materials.

Title: Structural transitions related to order-disorder and thermal desorption of D atoms in TbFe$_{2}$D$_{4.2}$
Authors: V. Paul-Boncour, O. Isnard
Abstract: TbFe$_{2}$D$_{4.2}$ deuteride crystallizes in a monoclinic structure ($Pc$ space group) with deuterium inserted into 18 tetrahedral [Tb2Fe2] and [TbFe3] interstitial sites. Its structural evolution versus temperature has been investigated by combining in-situ X-ray and neutron diffraction (XRD and NPD) with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) this http URL heating, the deuteride undergoes a reversible order-disorder transition from an ordered monoclinic structure to a disordered cubic structure between 320 and 380 this http URL, a multipeak thermal desorption occurs between 400 and 550 K, which can be explained by the transitions between different cubic deuterides separated by two-phase ranges. After controlled partial D desorption of TbFe$_{2}$D$_{4.2}$ , the XRD patterns of several TbFe$_{2}$D$_{x}$ deuterides were measured ex-situ using synchrotron radiation at room temperature, revealing the formation of different phases with cubic or monoclinic structures separated by two phase ranges.A tetragonal superstructure was observed for a phase with $x$ = 2. This work can explain previous results of the literature indicating the existence of cubic and, or rhombohedral hydrides depending on the hydrogenation conditions and the H content. The monoclinic structures reported here correspond to a slight distortion of the previous rhombohedral structures described by other authors.

Title: How accurate are foundational machine learning interatomic potentials for heterogeneous catalysis?
Authors: Luuk H. E. Kempen, Raffaele Cheula, Mie Andersen
Abstract: Foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are being developed at a rapid pace, promising closer and closer approximation to ab initio accuracy. This unlocks the possibility to simulate much larger length and time scales. However, benchmarks for these MLIPs are usually limited to ordered, crystalline and bulk materials. Hence, reported performance does not necessarily accurately reflect MLIP performance in real applications such as heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we systematically analyze zero-shot performance of 80 different MLIPs, evaluating tasks typical for heterogeneous catalysis across a range of different data sets, including adsorption and reaction on surfaces of alloyed metals, oxides, and metal-oxide interfacial systems. We demonstrate that current-generation foundational MLIPs can already perform at high accuracy for applications such as predicting vacancy formation energies of perovskite oxides or zero-point energies of supported nanoclusters. However, limitations also exist. We find that many MLIPs catastrophically fail when applied to magnetic materials, and structure relaxation in the MLIP generally increases the energy prediction error compared to single-point evaluation of a previously optimized structure. Comparing low-cost task-specific models to foundational MLIPs, we highlight some core differences between these model approaches and show that -- if considering only accuracy -- these models can compete with the current generation of best-performing MLIPs. Furthermore, we show that no single MLIP universally performs best, requiring users to investigate MLIP suitability for their desired application.

Title: Exfoliation and Cleavage of Crystals from a Universal Potential
Authors: Tom Barnowsky, Carsten Timm, Rico Friedrich
Abstract: Exfoliation and cleavage create two-dimensional (2D) materials and surfaces with physical and chemical properties distinct from their bulk parents. The rising class of non-van der Waals (non-vdW) 2D materials derived from non-layered crystals provides a fascinating new platform - greatly expanding the landscape of low-dimensional materials. Current computational models, however, provide limited guidance: existing descriptors are largely tailored to vdW layered systems. Here, we introduce a general framework predicting crystal cleavage and exfoliable 2D subunits directly from bulk structures. At its core is a universal eXfoliation and Cleavage Potential (XCP) enabling large-scale screening of diverse materials at negligible computational cost. Applying this approach, we obtain 37,208 cleavable surfaces and candidate non-vdW 2D materials from which we investigate 2,377 likely exfoliable ones using high-throughput density functional theory. We identify sheets with square and rectangular lattices, semiconducting systems exhibiting an indirect-to-direct band-gap transition upon exfoliation, and first non-vdW 2D metals. Our study thus opens a systematic route to explore and design new 2D materials with unprecedented chemical and structural diversity.

Title: Approximation of forces and torques from anisotropic pairwise interactions using multivariate polynomials
Authors: Mohammadreza Fakhraei, Michaela Bush, Chris A. Kieslich, Michael P. Howard
Abstract: The dynamics of anisotropic particles are dictated by forces and torques that can be challenging to mathematically represent in computer simulations. Several data-driven approaches have been developed to approximate these interactions, but they often rely on having large amounts of training data that may be practically difficult to generate. Here, we extend a framework we recently developed for approximating anisotropic pair potentials to the approximation of pairwise forces and torques. The framework uses multivariate polynomials and physics-motivated coordinate transformations to produce accurate approximations using limited amounts of data. We first derive expressions relating the force and torque to partial derivatives of the potential energy with respect to the transformed coordinates used to represent the particle configuration. We then explore several options for approximating the forces and torques, and we critically assess their accuracy using model two- and three-dimensional shape-anisotropic nanoparticles as test cases. We find that interpolation of the pairwise potential energy produces the best result when it is known, but force and torque matching (regression) is a viable strategy when only the force and torque is available.

Title: Reduction of interaction order in hard combinatorial optimization via conditionally independent degrees of freedom
Authors: Alexandru Ciobanu, David Dahmen, John Paul Strachan, Moritz Helias
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems have a broad range of applications and map to physical systems with complex dynamics. Among them, the 3-SAT problem is prominent due to its NP-complete nature. In physics terms, its solution corresponds to finding the ground state of a disordered Ising spin Hamiltonian with third-order, or tensor, interactions. The large growth of the number of third-order interactions with number of variables poses technical difficulties for the physical implementation of minimizers. Therefore, researchers have proposed quadratization techniques which reduce the order of the system, however, at the cost of including additional degrees of freedom. Their inclusion induces a drastic slow down in the minimization, which makes such procedures technically infeasible for large problems. In this work, we take a physics approach by employing the renormalization group to create a pairwise interacting system from the original third-order system while preserving the free energy. Our procedure utilizes additional degrees of freedom that exhibit an independent dynamics provided the original degrees of freedom are fixed. A step-wise trace of the extra variables while running the minimization is therefore theoretically manageable, yielding a state-dependent effective interaction. We use the effective interaction to reconstruct the original third-order energy spectrum, as this yields equal scaling of computations-to-ground-state compared to the original tensor formulation. Here, the original degrees of freedom interact with a subsystem that appears to be in a superposition of an exponentially large number of states. In the zero-temperature limit, the superposition concentrates on one state. Our spectrum-engineering techniques reveal new routes toward the ground state of disordered Ising systems, through Markov chains, and allow for efficient technological implementations.

Title: Self-supported bulk MXene electrodes for electrochemical hydrogen applications
Authors: Rebeca Miyar, Bar Favelukis, Eva B. Mayer, Manoj Prabhakar, Yug Joshi, Gerhard Dehm, Jochen M. Schneider, Maria Jazmin Duarte, Barak Ratzker, Maxim Sokol
Abstract: MXenes are promising candidates for electrochemical applications due to their high conductivity, tunable surface chemistry, and catalytic potential. However, their use in bulk electrode form remains unexplored despite advantages such as higher current density and improved mechanical integrity. Herein, we present a methodology for the fabrication of self-supported vdW solid Ti3C2Tz MXene electrodes, produced by cold compaction followed by vacuum heat treatment at 600 °C, which effectively removes interlayer confined water and stabilizes the bulk 3D structure. The resulting binder-free electrodes exhibit enhanced mechanical robustness along with structural and chemical stability in various electrolytes. The MXene electrodes demonstrate adequate HER activity while maintaining electrochemical stability over time, with minimal oxidation or changes in termination surface chemistry. This approach is scalable and cost-effective, overcoming limitations of nanoscale MXene architectures in electrochemical environments and offering a practical pathway toward MXene-based materials for sustainable hydrogen energy technologies.

Title: Accurate coarse-graining of small organic molecules in melts and thin films using density-dependent potentials
Authors: Sayan Dutta, Maria C. Lesniewski, Muhammad Nawaz Qaisrani, W. G. Noid, Denis Andrienko, Arash Nikoubashman
Abstract: Conjugated organic molecules play a central role in a wide range of optoelectronic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes, organic field-effect transistors, and organic solar cells. A major bottleneck in the computational design of these materials is the discrepancy between simulation and experimental time and length scales. Coarse-graining (CG) offers a promising solution to bridge this gap by reducing redundant degrees of freedom and smoothing the potential energy landscape, thereby significantly accelerating molecular dynamics simulations. However, standard CG models are typically parameterized from homogeneous bulk simulations and assume density-independent effective interactions. As a consequence, they often fail to replicate inhomogeneous systems, such as (free-standing) thin films, due to an incorrect representation of liquid-vacuum interfacial properties. In this work, we develop a CG parametrization strategy that incorporates local-density-dependent potentials to capture material heterogeneities. We evaluate the methodology by simulating free-standing films and comparing interfacial orientational order parameters between all-atom and CG simulations. The resulting CG models accurately reproduce bulk densities and radial distribution functions as well as molecular orientations at the liquid-vacuum interface. This work paves the way for reliable, computation-driven predictions of atomically resolved interfacial ordering in organic molecular systems.

Title: Spin-Dependent Nonorthogonal Generalized Wannier Functions and their Integration with PAW and Hubbard Corrections in Linear-Scaling DFT
Authors: Miguel Escobar Azor, David D. O'Regan, Ali Safavi, Jacek Dziedzic, Chris-Kriton Skylaris, Nicholas D. M. Hine
Abstract: We present a spin-dependent extension of the non-orthogonal generalized Wannier function (NGWF) formalism within the framework of linear-scaling density functional theory (LS-DFT) as implemented in the ONETEP code. In traditional LS-DFT representations, both spin channels are constrained to share a common variational basis, which limits the accuracy for systems that are spin-polarized or exhibit magnetic order. Our approach allows NGWFs to vary independently for each spin channel, enabling a more accurate representation of spin-polarization in the electronic density. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through a series of test cases, including localized magnetic defects in two-dimensional hBN, transition metal complexes, two-dimensional van der Waals magnetic materials, and both bulk and nanocluster ferromagnetic Co. In each scenario, the incorporation of spin-dependent NGWFs results in enhanced accuracy for total energy calculations, improved localization of spin density, and accurate predictions of magnetic ground states. This improvement is particularly notable when combined with DFT+U and DFT+U+J corrections. In this work, we take the opportunity to describe the combination of DFT+U+J and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) formalism within the LS-DFT framework, including how PAW participates in the ionic Pulay force, and in the minimum-tracking linear response approach for computing parameters in situ. Our findings demonstrate that spin-dependent NGWFs are a crucial and computationally efficient advancement in the linear-scaling DFT simulation of spin-polarized materials.

Title: Correlation between the first-reaction time and the acquired boundary local time
Authors: Yilin Ye, Denis S. Grebenkov
Abstract: We investigate the statistical correlation between the first-reaction time of a diffusing particle and its boundary local time accumulated until the reaction event. Since the reaction event occurs after multiple encounters of the particle with a partially reactive boundary, the boundary local time as a proxy for the number of such encounters is not independent of, but intrinsically linked to, the first-reaction time. We propose a universal theoretical framework to derive their joint probability density and, in particular, the correlation coefficient. To illustrate the dependence of these correlations on the boundary reactivity and shape, we obtain explicit analytical solutions for several basic domains. The analytical results are complemented by Monte Carlo simulations, which we employ to examine the role of interior obstacles on correlations in disordered media. Applications of these statistical results in chemical physics are discussed

Title: Structure of the mean-field yrast spectrum of a two-component Bose gas in a ring: role of interaction asymmetry
Authors: Hui Tang, Guan-Hua Huang, Eugene Zaremba, Shizhong Zhang, Zhigang Wu
Abstract: The mean-field yrast spectrum of an SU(2)-symmetric two-component Bose gas confined to a ring geometry is known to exhibit an intricate nonanalytic structure that is absent in single-component systems. In particular, due to the interplay between the species concentration and the atomic interactions, a sequence of plane-wave states can emerge as yrast states at fractional values of the angular momentum per particle. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the single-component case, where plane-wave states occur only at integer angular momenta. In this paper, we investigate how the structure of the yrast spectrum in a two-component Bose gas is modified by interaction asymmetry. By numerically solving the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for propagating soliton states, we compute the mean-field yrast spectrum and, in particular, determine the critical curves associated with the emergence of various plane-wave yrast states. We find that both the behavior of these critical curves and the mechanisms by which plane-wave yrast states arise depend sensitively on the relative strengths of the inter- and intra-component interactions. When the inter-component interaction is weaker, the plane-wave yrast states replace soliton states through a continuous evolution, as in the SU(2)-symmetric case, although the conditions for their existence become more restrictive. In contrast, when the inter-component interaction is stronger, plane-wave yrast states emerge by overtaking soliton states via branch crossings, and their stability is significantly enhanced. Our results have important implications for the existence and stability of persistent currents in asymmetric, two-component Bose gases.

Title: Strain-Controlled Magnetic Phase Transitions through Anisotropic Exchange Interactions: A Combined DFT and Monte Carlo Study
Authors: Sudip Mandal, Mihir Ranjan Sahoo, Kalpataru Pradhan
Abstract: Epitaxial strain provides a powerful, non-chemical route to tune the properties of functional materials by manipulating the coupling between spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and $\rm BiFeO_3$ as a model system, we first demonstrate how epitaxial strain exactly leads to anisotropic magnetic interactions where the exchange coupling along the $c$-axis differs from that in the $ab$-plane. We show that subtle structural modifications, specifically the distortion from a cubic to a tetragonal lattice, drive a magnetic phase transition from a G-type to a C-type antiferromagnetic (AF) phase. The anisotropy in magnetic interactions, which becomes prominent in the lower symmetry tetragonal phase, provides a direct link between the structural distortion and the potential change in magnetic ordering. For a more comprehensive study, we next investigate the role of strain in driving magnetic phase transitions within a half-filled one-band Hubbard model in three dimensions. In this framework, strain is introduced through anisotropic hopping processes between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor sites, inspired by the DFT calculations. Using a semiclassical Monte Carlo (s-MC) approach, we construct ground state phase diagrams in the nonperturbative regime, which show how uniaxial strain stabilizes distinct magnetic ground states: Compressive strain drives a transition from a G-type to a C-type AF insulator, whereas tensile strain suppresses the C-type AF order, favoring an A-type AF phase. Overall, our combined DFT and s-MC calculations highlight that strain is a powerful tuning parameter for controlling competing magnetic phases by governing exchange coupling mechanisms in correlated systems, offering valuable insights for the design of strain-controlled materials.

Abstract: FeSe stands out among iron-based superconductors due to its extended nematic phase without the onset of long-range magnetic order. While strain-dependent electrical resistivity has been extensively explored to probe nematicity, its influence on magneto-transport properties remains less understood. In this work, we present measurements of the magneto-elasto-resistivity in FeSe as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. Using a minimal multiband Boltzmann model for transport we derive analytical expressions that capture the magnetic behavior of the whole set of experimental data both in the paramagnetic and in the nematic phase. These findings indicate that a multiband framework can robustly describe the magneto-elasto-transport properties in FeSe and arguably in other iron-based superconductors.

Title: Comparing Hubbard parameters from linear-response theory and Hartree-Fock-based approach
Authors: Wooil Yang, Iurii Timrov, Francesco Aquilante, Young-Woo Son
Abstract: Density-functional theory with on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$+$V$) is a powerful and accurate method for predicting various properties of transition-metal compounds. However, its accuracy depends critically on the values of these Hubbard parameters. Although they can be determined empirically, first-principles methods provide a more consistent and reliable approach; yet, their results can vary, and a comprehensive comparison between methods is still lacking. Here, we present a systematic comparison of two widely used approaches for computing $U$ and $V$, namely linear-response theory (LRT) and the Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism, applied to a representative set of oxides (MnO, NiO, CoO, FeO, BaTiO$_3$, ZnO, and ZrO$_2$). We find that for partially occupied transition-metal $d$ states, these two methods yield consistent $U$ values, but they differ for nearly empty or fully filled $d$ shells. For O-$2p$ states, LRT always predicts large $U$ values ($\sim$10 eV), whereas the pseudohybrid formalism produces system-dependent values depending on the level of localization and hybridization for the electronic states. Even larger differences are found for the inter-site $V$: the former predicts consistently small values ($<1$ eV), while the latter produces larger values ($\sim3$ eV), reflecting its explicit dependence on relative charge redistribution. Our results show that while parallels between these two methods exist, they rely on distinct assumptions for determining $U$ and $V$, leading to variations in predictions of material properties.

Title: Efficient Monte-Carlo sampling of metastable systems using non-local collective variable updates
Authors: Christoph Schönle, Davide Carbone, Marylou Gabrié, Tony Lelièvre, Gabriel Stoltz
Abstract: Monte-Carlo simulations are widely used to simulate complex molecular systems, but standard approaches suffer from metastability. Lately, the use of non-local proposal updates in a collective-variable (CV) space has been proposed in several works. Here, we generalize these approaches and explicitly spell out an algorithm for non-linear CVs and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove reversibility of the resulting scheme and demonstrate its performance on several numerical examples, observing a substantial performance increase compared to methods based on overdamped Langevin dynamics as considered previously. Advances in generative machine-learning-based proposal samplers now enable efficient sampling in CV spaces of intermediate dimensionality (tens to hundreds of variables), and our results extend their applicability toward more realistic molecular systems.

Title: Thermodynamical study of N$_2$ clathrate hydrate from DFT calculations
Authors: L. Martin-Gondre, V. Meko Fotso, C. Métais, A. Patt, J. Ollivier, A. Desmedt
Abstract: Thermodynamic stability of N$_2$ clathrate hydrates in the sI and sII structures is investigated using density functional theory with several exchange-correlation functionals, explicitly accounting for composition (cage occupancies) and pressure at T = 0 K. Among the tested functionals, revPBE-D3(0) best reproduces experimental lattice parameters and bulk moduli B$_0$ . Energetic analyses confirm the strong impact of large cage double occupancy on sI, whereas the convex-hull results show that sI with single occupancy remains thermodynamically stable up to $\sim$ 0.8 GPa alongside sII with single occupancy. Increasing pressure then stabilizes sII with double occupancy, consistent with its larger large-cage volume and lower framework strain. These results provide a coherent, first-principles thermodynamic framework for N$_2$ hydrate stability and a baseline for finite-temperature extension.

Title: Nonunitary spin-triplet superconductors in Zeeman magnetic field
Authors: Wen Li, Vahid Hassanzade, Maxim Dzero, Vladyslav Kozii
Abstract: We study spin-triplet superconductivity with both unitary and nonunitary pairing in the presence of an external Zeeman magnetic field. Within a mean-field framework, we exactly diagonalize the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and derive general expressions for the quasiparticle spectrum, superconducting gap, critical temperature, and spin magnetization, valid for arbitrary magnetic-field strengths and temperatures. We analyze in detail the nonlinear spin susceptibility and the field evolution of the superconducting gap and transition temperature, highlighting qualitative differences between unitary and nonunitary pairing states. Our results are broadly applicable to a wide range of materials, including systems with both weak and strong spin-orbit coupling. We show that systematic measurements of the critical temperature and spin susceptibility as functions of the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field provide a powerful means to identify the structure of the spin-triplet order parameter, and we discuss implications of our findings for candidate materials such as 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$.

Title: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy of CoNb$_2$O$_6$
Authors: Yoshito Watanabe, Simon Trebst, Ciarán Hickey
Abstract: With recent advances in terahertz (THz) sources and detection, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), which allows to probe nonlinear responses in a two-frequency plane, now reaches the meV regime relevant for quasiparticle excitations in magnetic materials. This opens a promising route to reveal many-body phenomena that evade linear-response probes. To date most experimental applications have focused on classical magnets, and a solid demonstration in a quantum magnet has yet to be established. Here we present a theoretical study of 2DCS in CoNb$_2$O$_6$, a quasi-one-dimensional Ising magnet that is believed to host fractionalized spinons which at low temperatures are confined by weak interchain coupling. Our analysis, which builds on an effective $S=1/2$ Hamiltonian is found to reveal unambiguous 2DCS signatures of spinon deconfinement above the low-temperature ordered phase. Using a four-spinon approximation, we track these 2DCS signatures by sequentially building a faithful microscopic model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$, starting from the exactly solvable one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (1$d$ TFIM) and successively adding interactions to capture its key low-energy physics. In particular, adding a bond-dependent staggered YZ interaction to the 1$d$-TFIM already reproduces many key spectral features of the full material Hamiltonian. Within this TFIM+YZ model, we find a series of bound states, including a four-spinon bound state that is distinct from the familiar two-spinon bound states. We further find that introducing a confinement potential suppresses sharp spinon-echo features in the two-frequency space, which are thought to reflect an underlying continuum of fractionalized excitations. Our results provide concrete predictions and clear targets for future THz 2DCS experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and related quasi-one-dimensional quantum magnets.

Title: Optimal array geometries for kinetic magnetism and Nagaoka polarons
Authors: N. Hernandez-Cepeda, Sergio E. Ulloa
Abstract: Quantum dot (QD) platforms have enabled the direct observation of Nagaoka ferromagnetism (NFM) in small arrays and non-infinite interaction strength. However, optimizing the cluster connectivity characteristics that yield a ground state with maximal spin and their robustness against magnetic fields remains unexplored. Employing exact diagonalization of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, we find a connection between the existence of kinetic ferromagnetism and graph theory descriptions. Algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) and Katz centrality (KC) are shown to be related to the spin-correlation over the system. In square arrays, the onset of NFM is found to be $t_c/U\simeq \lambda_2^2$. In optimal cluster geometries, large $\lambda_2$ and low KC fluctuation per site are found to enhance $t_c/U$, extending the NFM phase while diminishing the strength of spin correlation clouds. A perpendicular magnetic field introduces Aharonov-Bohm phases, and a critical flux for which NFM is destroyed. We further find that tuning the flux phase to $\pi$ results in a ground state that exhibits antiferromagnetic correlations (counter-Nagaoka state). Our results illustrate how NFM and polaron formation can be predicted from the array's connectivity ($\lambda_2$ and KC), and how the introduction of flux results in the counterintuitive destruction of kinetic ferromagnetism in the system.

Title: Revival Dynamics from Equilibrium States: Scars from Chords in SYK
Authors: Debarghya Chakraborty, Dario Rosa
Abstract: We develop a novel framework to build quantum many-body scar states in bipartite systems characterized by perfect correlation between the Hamiltonians governing the two sides. By means of a Krylov construction, we build an interaction term which supports a tower of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. This gives rise to finite-time revivals whenever the system is initialized in a purification of a generic equilibrium state. The dynamics is universally characterized, and is largely independent of the specific details of the Hamiltonians defining the individual partitions. By considering the two-sided chord states of the double-scaled SYK model, we find an approximate realization of this framework. We analytically study the revival dynamics, finding rigid motion for wavepackets localized on the spectrum of a single SYK copy. These findings are tested numerically for systems of finite size, showing excellent agreement with the analytical predictions.

Title: Signatures of real-space geometry, topology, and metric tensor in quantum transport in periodically corrugated spaces
Authors: Benjamin Schwager, Theresa Appel, Jamal Berakdar
Abstract: The motion of a quantum particle constrained to a two-dimensional non-compact Riemannian manifold with non-trivial metric can be described by a flat-space Schroedinger-type equation at the cost of introducing local mass and metric and geometry-induced effective potential with no classical counterpart. For a metric tensor periodically modulated along one dimension, the formation of bands is demonstrated and transport-related quantities are derived. Using S-matrix approach, the quantum conductance along the manifold is calculated and contrasted with conventional quantum transport methods in flat spaces. The topology, e.g. whether the manifold is simply connected, compact or non-compact shows up in global, non-local properties such as the Aharonov-Bohm phase. The results vividly demonstrate emergent phenomena due to the interplay of reduced-dimensionality, particles quantum nature, geometry, and topology.

Title: Random planting with harvest: A statistical-mechanical analysis
Authors: Julian Talbot
Abstract: We formulate a statistical-mechanical description of a recently introduced random planting model in which plants are represented by growing hard disks. Seedlings of negligible size are introduced at random positions in a field, grow at a prescribed rate, and are harvested upon reaching a fixed maturity diameter. Planting attempts that would lead to an overlap at any time during growth are rejected. Starting from an empty field, this simple dynamical rule drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state in which the mean planting and harvesting rates coincide. We show that the steady state can be mapped onto a nonadditive polydisperse hard-disk fluid and exploit this mapping to develop analytical predictions based on a low-density virial expansion and on scaled particle theory. The resulting description yields an effective adsorption isotherm for the steady-state plant density as a function of the planting rate and compares favorably with numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters. At large planting rates, the density approaches the optimal value achieved by desynchronized regular planting, and the data are consistent with an algebraic approach to this limit with an exponent close to 1/3. Beyond density and yield, we show that the spatial organization of the field at high planting rates exhibits clear signatures of the same underlying geometric constraints that characterize optimal desynchronized planting. This connection is revealed through both the conventional radial distribution function and a radius-resolved pair correlation g(z,r) which highlights strong size correlations associated with parent-child seeding events and whose structure can be interpreted as a dynamically broadened precursor of the corresponding ideal mixe--size lattice. Finally, we extend the theory to sigmoidal growth laws and compute the associated virial coefficient.

Title: Wiedemann-Franz violation and thermal Hall effect in kagome metal TbCr6Ge6
Authors: Jhinkyu Choi, Mohan B. Neupane, L. H. Vilela-Leão, Bishnu P. Belbase, Arjun Unnikrishnan, Syeda Neha Zaidi, Jukka I. Väyrynen, Arnab Banerjee
Abstract: The thermal Hall effect has emerged as a powerful probe of exotic excitations in correlated quantum materials, providing access to charge-neutral heat carriers that remain invisible to electrical transport. To directly examine how heat and charge respond in relation within a kagome metal, we investigate the ferrimagnetic rare-earth 1-6-6 compound TbCr6Ge6 using the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) framework. We observe a dramatic breakdown of the WF law across the ferrimagnetic transition, where both longitudinal and transverse Lorenz ratios, L_{xx,xy} = \kappa_{xx,xy} / (T \sigma_{xx,xy}), deviate strongly from the Sommerfeld value L_0. After a partial recovery toward L_0 near 5-7 K, the Lorenz ratios are sharply suppressed well below L_0 despite a metallic charge response. We further find a pronounced low-temperature suppression of both L_{xx} and L_{xy} and a sign-changing transverse Lorenz ratio, indicating a clear decoupling between heat and charge transport and signaling substantial contributions from charge-neutral excitations whose Berry-curvature-driven transverse response evolves with temperature and magnetic field. TbCr6Ge6 thus provides a tunable metallic platform in which exchange-driven ferrimagnetism governs both longitudinal and transverse thermal responses, enabling controlled departures from Wiedemann-Franz behavior over an experimentally accessible temperature and field range.

Title: Photonics of topological magnetic textures
Authors: Vakhtang Jandieri, Ramaz Khomeriki, Daniel Erni, Nicolas Tsagareli, Qian Li, Douglas H. Werner, Jamal Berakdar
Abstract: Topological textures in magnetically ordered materials are important case studies for fundamental research with promising applications in data science. They can also serve as photonic elements to mold electromagnetic fields endowing them with features inherent to the spin order, as demonstrated analytically and numerically in this work. A self-consistent theory is developed for the interaction of spatially structured electromagnetic fields with non-collinear, topologically non-trivial spin textures. A tractable numerical method is designed and implemented for the calculation of the formed magnetic/photonic textures in the entire simulation space. Numerical illustrations are presented for scattering from point-like singularities, i.e. Bloch points, in the magnetization vector fields, evidencing that the geometry and topology of the magnetic order results in photonic fields that embody orbital angular momentum, chirality as well as magnetoelectric densities. Features of the scattered fields can serve as a fingerprint for the underlying magnetic texture and its dynamics. The findings point to the potential of topological magnetic textures as a route to molding photonic fields.

Title: The Motile Josephson Array: Bridging Active Turbulence and Superconductivity
Authors: Magnus F Ivarsen
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support an emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this letter, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for the emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as a macroscopic superconducting phase governed by the Adler equation. The validity of this mapping is confirmed analytically by a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity, corresponding to the saddle-node bifurcation of phase-locking systems. These results define the new minimal chiral flocking model as a motile, disordered Josephson array, bridging active turbulence and quantum superconductivity.

Title: An exciton interacting with the phonons of an electronic Wigner crystal
Authors: Jens Havgaard Nyhegn, Esben Rohan Christensen, Georg M. Bruun
Abstract: With the advent of atomically thin and tunable van der Waals materials, a two-dimensional electronic Wigner crystal has recently been observed. The smoking gun signal was the appearance of an umklapp branch in optical exciton spectroscopy coming from the periodic potential generated by the Wigner crystal assumed to be static. Vibrations of the Wigner crystal however leads to a gapless phonon spectrum, which may affect the exciton spectrum. To explore this, we develop a field theoretical description of an exciton interacting with electrons forming a Wigner crystal including the coupling to the phonons. We show that importance of the exciton-phonon coupling scales with the exciton-electron interaction strength relative to the typical phonon energy squared. The motion of the exciton leads to two kinds of scattering processes, where the exciton emits a phonon either staying within the same Bloch band (intraband scattering) or changing its band (interband scattering). Using a non-perturbative self-consistent Born approximation, we demonstrate that these scattering processes lead to the formation of quasiparticles (polarons) consisting of the exciton in Bloch states dressed by Wigner crystal phonons. The energy shift and damping of these polarons depend on the electron density in a non-trivial way since it affects both the exciton-phonon interaction strength, as well as the phonon and exciton spectra. In particular, the damping is strongly affected by whether the polaron energy is inside the gapless phonon scattering continuum or not. Using these results, we finally analyse their effects on the observed spectral properties of the exciton.

Title: Machine learning assisted high throughput prediction of moiré materials
Authors: Daniel Kaplan, Alexander C. Tyner, Eva Y. Andrei, J. H. Pixley
Abstract: The world of 2D materials is rapidly expanding with new discoveries of stackable and twistable layered systems composed of lattices of different symmetries, orbital character, and structural motifs. Often, however, it is not clear a priori whether a pair of monolayers twisted at a small angle will exhibit correlated or interaction-driven phenomena. The computational cost to make accurate predictions of the single particle states is significant, as small twists require very large unit cells, easily encompassing 10,000 atoms, and therefore implementing a high throughput prediction has been out of reach. Here we show a path to overcome this challenge by introducing a machine learning (ML) based methodology that efficiently estimates the twisted interlayer tunneling at arbitrarily low twist angles through the local-configuration based approach that enables interpolating the local stacking for a range of twist angles using a random forest regression algorithm. We leverage the kernel polynomial method to compute the density of states (DOS) on large real space graphs by reconstructing a lattice model of the twisted bilayer with the ML fitted hoppings. For twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we show the ability of the method to resolve the magic angle DOS at a substantial improvement in computational time. We use this new technique to scan through the database of stable 2D monolayers (MC2D) and reveal new twistable candidates across the five possible points groups in two-dimensions with a large DOS near the Fermi energy, with potentially exciting interacting physics to be probed in future experiments.

Title: Hybrid satellite-fiber quantum network
Authors: Yanxuan Shao, Saikat Guha, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: Quantum networks hold promise for key distribution, private and distributed computing, and quantum sensing, among other applications. The scale of such networks for ground users is currently limited by one's ability to distribute entanglement between distant locations. This can in principle be carried out by transmitting entangled photons through optical fibers or satellites. The former is limited by fiber-optic attenuation while the latter is limited by atmospheric extinction and diffraction. Here, we propose a hybrid network and protocol that outperform both ground- and satellite-based designs and lead to high-fidelity entanglement at a continental or even global scale.

Title: A Unified Generative-Predictive Framework for Deterministic Inverse Design
Authors: Reza T. Batley, Sourav Saha
Abstract: Inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures is a fundamentally ill-posed and famously computationally expensive problem. This is exacerbated by the high-dimensional design spaces associated with finely resolved images, multimodal input property streams, and a highly nonlinear forward physics. Whilst modern generative models excel at accurately modeling such complex forward behavior, most of them are not intrinsically structured to support fast, stable \emph{deterministic} inversion with a physics-informed bias. This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem. Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive KHRONOS head, a separable neural architecture. Topologically speaking, Janus learns a latent manifold simultaneously isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction; the joint objective inducing \emph{disentanglement} of the latent space. Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity. It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\% relative error) and sub-5\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold. By unifying prediction and generation within a single latent space, Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure generation at a lower computational cost typically associated with classical optimization-based approaches.

Title: Solvable Quantum Circuits from Spacetime Lattices
Authors: Michael A. Rampp, Suhail A. Rather, Pieter W. Claeys
Abstract: In recent years dual-unitary circuits and their multi-unitary generalizations have emerged as exactly solvable yet chaotic models of quantum many-body dynamics. However, a systematic picture for the solvability of multi-unitary dynamics remains missing. We present a framework encompassing a large class of such non-integrable models with exactly solvable dynamics, which we term \emph{completely reducible} circuits. In these circuits, the entanglement membrane determining operator growth and entanglement dynamics can be characterized analytically. Completely reducible circuits extend the notion of space-time symmetry to more general lattice geometries, breaking dual-unitarity globally but not locally, and allow for a rich phenomenology going beyond dual-unitarity. As example, we introduce circuits that support four and five directions of information flow. We derive a general expression for the entanglement line tension in terms of the pattern of information flow in spacetime. The solvability is shown to be related to the absence of knots of this information flow, connecting entanglement dynamics to the Kauffman bracket as knot invariant. Building on these results, we propose that in general non-integrable dynamics the curvature of the entanglement line tension can be interpreted as a density of information transport. Our results provide a new and unified framework for exactly solvable models of many-body quantum chaos, encompassing and extending known constructions.

Title: Anticoncentration and State Design of Doped Real Clifford Circuits and Tensor Networks
Authors: Beatrice Magni, Markus Heinrich, Lorenzo Leone, Xhek Turkeshi
Abstract: We investigate the statistical properties of orthogonal, or real, Clifford circuits doped with magic and imaginary resources. By developing the Weingarten calculus for the real Clifford group, we derive the exact overlap distribution of real stabilizer states, identifying a new universality class: the orthogonal Clifford Porter-Thomas distribution. We prove that local real architectures recover this global statistic in logarithmic depth. Furthermore, we uncover a sharp hierarchy in resource requirements: while retrieving Haar statistics necessitates a polylogarithmic amount of magic states, recovering the full unitary Clifford statistics requires only a single phase gate.

Title: Noncooperative Quantum Networks
Authors: Yanxuan Shao, Jannik L. Wyss, Don Towsley, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: Existing protocols for quantum communication networks usually assume an initial allocation of quantum entanglement resources, which are then manipulated through local operations and classical communication (LOCC) to establish high-fidelity entanglement between distant parties. It is generally held that the resulting fidelity would increase monotonically with the entanglement budget. Here, we show that for noncooperative LOCC protocols, the resulting fidelity may decrease as more entanglement is added to a network with non-pure states. This effect results from a quantum analog of selfish routing and constitutes a potential obstacle to the optimal use of resources in large quantum networks.

Title: Universal and Maximal Entanglement Swapping in General Fermionic Gaussian States
Authors: Jiyuan Fang, Qicheng Tang, Xueda Wen
Abstract: Exploring universal entanglement structure in many-body systems is both fundamental and challenging, particularly when the system undergoes non-unitary operations. In this work, we uncover a universal mechanism for realizing maximal entanglement swapping in fermionic Gaussian states subjected to projective Bell measurements. We consider two initially decoupled, half-filled copies of a free-fermion system in arbitrary dimensions and perform post-selective Bell measurements on half of the corresponding sites across the two copies. Remarkably, the post-measurement state factorizes into a product of Bell pairs, establishing maximal interlayer entanglement entirely independent of the initial Gaussian state. We derive this post-measurement state exactly for general particle-number-conserving fermionic Gaussian states, establishing both the validity and universality of the mechanism, with numerical simulations serving as consistency checks. This phenomenon arises from a robust interplay between fermionic statistics and Gaussianity, revealing a distinct fermionic route to measurement-induced maximal entanglement.

Title: Higher-form entanglement asymmetry. Part I. The limits of symmetry breaking
Authors: Francesco Benini, Eduardo García-Valdecasas, Stathis Vitouladitis
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a relative entropy that faithfully diagnoses symmetry breaking in quantum states, possibly within a spatial subregion. In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman--Mermin--Wagner theorem, for $0$- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields.

Title: Unleash $Q$! Cohomology, Localization, and Interpolation in Parisi-Sourlas Supersymmetry
Authors: Bruno Le Floch, Gela Patashuri, Emilio Trevisani
Abstract: Parisi--Sourlas supersymmetric models are known to undergo dimensional reduction; that is, their physics is captured by models in two fewer dimensions. In this work, we revisit dimensional reduction, providing new arguments and reformulating existing proofs in terms of the cohomology of a supercharge $Q$. We obtain three main results. First, we show that the recently developed picture of dimensional reduction via decoupling of operators admits a natural explanation in terms of $Q$-exactness. Second, we provide a new proof of dimensional reduction using the supersymmetric localization argument. Third, we revisit Cardy's ``interpolation'' proof -- which is reminiscent of localization but does not rely on saddle-point methods -- and show that it can be understood as a consequence of deforming the action by a $Q$-exact term. Finally, we show that while existing nonperturbative proofs of dimensional reduction apply only to scalar Lagrangians, our formulation of Cardy's argument extends to any theory with Parisi--Sourlas supersymmetry.

Title: Nonlinearly Realised Defect Symmetries and Anomalies
Authors: Nadav Drukker, Ziwen Kong, Petr Kravchuk
Abstract: Conformal defects -- extended objects in conformal field theories -- carry localised excitations inherited from symmetry currents, known as the displacements and tilts. They capture the linear response of the defect to deformations of its shape or of its profile along internal symmetry directions. There is no universal formula for deformations beyond the linear order and this is subject to ambiguities of coordinate choices on coset spaces and scheme dependence in the quantum theory. We analyse the exact match between the two and identify the scheme independent quantities capturing nonlinearly realised symmetries. This leads to universal integral identities for correlation functions in the presence of tilts and displacements. We present several applications of them. We also study possible anomalies, recovering known ones, finding new expressions for them, and uncovering new ones.

Title: Resource-resolved quantum fluctuation theorems in end-point measurement scheme
Authors: Sukrut Mondkar, Sayan Mondal, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems provide universal constraints on nonequilibrium energy and entropy fluctuations, making them a natural framework to assess how and to what extent quantum resources become thermodynamically relevant. We develop a unified framework for incorporating a generic quantum resource, including athermality, quantum coherence, and entanglement, into fluctuation theorems. We work within the end point measurement scheme, which avoids an initial energy measurement and allows quantum resources in the initial state to affect nonequilibrium energy statistics. We derive a family of quantum fluctuation theorems, including generalized Jarzynski equalities and Crooks type fluctuation relations, in which corrections decompose into resource resolved contributions. For single systems, we introduce the concept of weight of athermality, and combine it with the weight of coherence to isolate distinct thermodynamic effects of these quantum resources. For bipartite systems, we furthermore obtain two families of entanglement-resolved fluctuation theorems using an appended correlation operator and the best separable approximation, respectively. Finally, we introduce the concepts of coherence and entanglement fluctuation distances, as Kullback Leibler divergences, which quantify the thermodynamic relevance of quantum resources in a process-dependent and operational manner.

Title: Exploring Overlapping Mechanisms of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization in Type 1b HPHT Diamond
Authors: Brendan C. Sheehan, Margaret Hubble, Daphna Shimon, Chandrasekhar Ramanathan
Abstract: The inhomogeneous distribution of P1 centers in type 1b HPHT diamond samples allows multiple DNP mechanisms to occur within the same crystal, resulting in complex DNP spectra. At some crystal orientations, different DNP mechanisms can compete to drive hyperpolarization with different signs at the same applied microwave frequency. We perform microwave-irradiated DNP using both monochromatic and frequency-modulated microwave excitation to explore the competition between these DNP mechanisms in diamond at room temperature. We demonstrate that frequency-modulated DNP is a tool for suppressing certain DNP mechanisms while enhancing others in a single-crystal diamond sample. Frequency modulation also enables higher enhancement of the NMR signal beyond traditional monochromatic DNP under some conditions. In a powder sample, competing enhancement mechanisms can also arise from different crystallite orientations in the powder. We observe that at certain microwave frequencies the DNP signal changes sign during the polarization build-up, even with monochromatic microwave irradiation. We do not observe this phenomenon in any single-crystal spectrum. We discuss both methods of investigating competing mechanisms of DNP as a means of selectively enhancing different DNP mechanisms driving $^{13}$C NMR signal enhancement.

Title: Discrete time crystals enhanced by Stark potentials in Rydberg atom arrays
Authors: Jian-Jia Wang, Ling-Zhi Tang, Yan-Xiong Du, Dan-Wei Zhang
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are non-equilibrium phases in periodically driven systems that exhibit spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translation symmetry. The stabilization of most DTC phases is achieved via the disorder-induced many-body localization. In this work, we propose an experimental scheme to realize disorder-free DTCs in a periodically driven Rydberg atom array. Our scheme utilizes a linear potential in the atomic detuning to enhance the DTC order, without being tired to (Stark) many-body localization. We numerically demonstrate that the Stark potential enhances the robustness of the DTC against the flip imperfections and extends its lifetime, which are independent of initial states. Thus, our scheme provides a promising way to explore DTCs in Rydberg atom arrays without disorder averaging and special state preparation.

Title: Intermittent Motility of a Synthetic Active Particle in Changing Environments
Authors: Rudra Sekhri, Rahil N. Valani, Tapio Simula
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the dynamics of synthetic active particles composed of gravitationally bouncing, superwalking droplets confined within an annular fluid bath. Driven by a topologically pumping dual-frequency waveform, the droplets exhibit alternating active (walking) and dormant (bouncing) phases, producing intermittent azimuthal motion. Tracking individual droplets reveals pseudolaminar chaotic dynamics in the time series of particle's angular position, characterized by laminar plateaus that are interrupted by short irregular bursts of activity. Increasing the driving amplitude induces a qualitative change in the active particle's intermittent dynamics, arising from a symmetry-breaking transition in its Faraday-wave field environment: continuous SO(2)-symmetric "channelling" waves give way to discrete "trapping" patterns. These findings demonstrate how environmental symmetry and spatiotemporal structure modulate motility and intermittency in synthetic active matter.

Title: Predicting the Interfacial Energy and Morphology of DNA Condensates
Authors: Sihan Liu, Andrej Košmrlj
Abstract: The physics and morphology of biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation underpin diverse biological processes, exemplified by the nested organization of nucleoli that facilitates ribosome biogenesis. Here, we develop a theoretical and computational framework to understand and predict multiphase morphologies in DNA-nanostar solutions. Because morphology is governed by interfacial energies between coexisting phases, we combine Flory-Huggins theory with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to examine how these energies depend on key microscopic features of DNA nanostars, including size, valence, bending rigidity, Debye screening length, binding strength, and sticky-end distribution. The phase behavior of DNA nanostars is quantitatively captured by a generalized lattice model, in which the interplay between sticky-end binding energy and conformational entropy determines the effective interactions. Focusing on condensates comprising two dense phases, we find that Janus-like morphologies are ubiquitous because the interfacial energies between the dense and dilute phases, $\gamma_{i\in\{1,2\}}$, are typically comparable. In contrast, nested morphologies are rare as they require a large asymmetry in $\gamma_i$, which arises only for highly dissimilar nanostars such as those differing markedly in valence or size. Moreover, the interfacial energy between the two dense phases, $\gamma_{12}$, can be modulated either discretely, by varying sticky-end distribution, or continuously, by tuning the crosslinker ratio; the former may even eliminate nested configurations. These findings establish physical design principles for constructing complex condensate architectures directly from microscopic molecular parameters.

Title: Emergence of higher-order interactions in systems of coupled Kuramoto oscillators with time delay
Authors: Narumi Fujii, Keisuke Taga, Riccardo Muolo, Bob Rink, Hiroya Nakao
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms that govern collective synchronization is a paramount task in nonlinear dynamics. While higher-order (many-body) interactions have recently emerged as a powerful framework for capturing collective behaviors, real-world examples regarding dynamics remain scarce. Here, we show that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from time-delayed pairwise coupling in Kuramoto oscillators. By expanding the delay term up to second order in the coupling strength, we derive an effective Kuramoto model featuring both two-body and three-body interactions, but without delay, hence, easier to be analyzed. Numerical simulations show that this reduced model can reproduce the bistability and synchronization transitions of the original time-delayed system. Furthermore, applying the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we obtain a stability diagram for incoherent and synchronized states that closely matches the results of the original model. Our findings reveal that time delays can be effectively recast in the form of higher-order interactions, offering a new perspective on how delayed interactions shape the dynamics.

Title: Numerical Identification of Stationary States and Their Stability in a Model of Quantum Droplets
Authors: Sun Lee, Panayotis G. Kevrekidis, Wenrui Hao
Abstract: In this work, we are motivated by a recent variant of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation describing cold, dilute atomic condensates with quantum fluctuation effects. Our goal is to develop robust numerical methods capable of uncovering diverse stationary solutions in such NLS models. Specifically, and in line with recent theoretical and experimental interest, we focus on ultracold quantum droplets in Bose mixtures influenced by the Lee Huang Yang quantum fluctuation correction and study these systems in one and two dimensional settings. To this end, we deploy several numerical techniques. The homotopy grid method allows systematic refinement from coarse to fine spatial discretizations in one dimension, while the dimension by dimension homotopy approach extends one-dimensional solutions to two-dimensional domains. These methods effectively detect broad families of stationary states, many of which have not been previously reported, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, they enable the monitoring of solution continuation and bifurcation phenomena. During our investigation, we encounter unusual bifurcation events, including nonstandard pitchforks and saddle-center bifurcations, which exhibit novel stability transitions. For example, we identify continuous pathways connecting vortex and dark soliton stripe branches, absent in the standard cubic defocusing model. Overall, the presence of competing mean-field and quantum fluctuation interactions leads to a richer bifurcation structure than in traditional cubic NLS systems. These findings suggest that similar complex bifurcation and stability phenomena may appear in other settings, including higher-dimensional systems or models with competing nonlinearities such as cubic-quintic interactions, highlighting the importance of further theoretical and numerical exploration.

Title: Learning holographic QCD with unflavoured meson spectra
Authors: Mathew Thomas Arun, Ritik Pal
Abstract: We develop a neural network framework to predict the five-dimensional background geometry, dilaton potential, and chiral symmetry breaking scalar potential of holographic QCD from unflavored meson mass spectra. The model was trained in a discretized form of the Schrödinger-like equation, which resembles a linear moose in ``deconstructed" 5 dimensions with Dirichlet boundary conditions, in contrast to the AdS/DL with ``emergent" space-time. Using the $\rho$, $a_1$, $a_2$, and $f_0$ unflavored mesons and their excitations as training data, the model learns confining effective potentials and computes a dilaton profile that satisfies the null energy condition. The network predicts the IR behavior of dilaton to be in-between linear and quadratic forms. Moreover, the symmetry-breaking bulk potential of the scalar field, $V(X)= k_1 X^3+k_2 X^4$, was computed, and the parameters $k_1$ and $k_2$ predicted to be $\sim - \ 8$ and $\sim 17$ respectively. The deep-learned parameters, metric, and the dilaton profile were then used to predict the pion mass and its spectrum with good accuracy. A Python code, along with the trained models, is provided to facilitate further studies

Title: Timelike Entanglement Entropy and Renormalization Group Flow Irreversibility
Authors: Dimitrios Giataganas
Abstract: We study holographic c-theorems based on timelike entanglement entropy and show that a timelike c-function captures irreversible renormalization group (RG) flow. We demonstrate that timelike c-functions are applicable to both relativistic and non-relativistic quantum matter in nematic phases with broken rotational symmetry, and that they remain monotonic even under anisotropic RG flows, thereby passing some of the most stringent consistency tests. Across all classes of theories examined, we find that the null energy condition, thermodynamic stability, and a constraint on an effective spatial dimensionality are jointly sufficient to guarantee monotonicity of the timelike c-function along the RG flow. Moreover, we identify a geometric upper bound on the rate of change of the timelike c-function, which constrains how rapidly effective degrees of freedom can be coarse-grained along the RG flow whenever a timelike c-theorem applies. The applicability of holographic c-theorems is thus extended to highly nontrivial RG flows and points toward a new information-theoretic diagnostic of holographic RG dynamics.

Title: Replica Keldysh field theory of quantum-jump processes: General formalism and application to imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting
Authors: Felix Kloiber-Tollinger, Lukas M. Sieberer
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions have largely been explored for projective or continuous measurements of Hermitian observables, assuming perfect detection without information loss. Yet such transitions also arise in more general settings, including quantum-jump processes with non-Hermitian jump operators, and under inefficient detection. A theoretical framework for treating these broader scenarios has been missing. Here we develop a comprehensive replica Keldysh field theory for general quantum-jump processes in both bosonic and fermionic systems. Our formalism provides a unified description of pure-state quantum trajectories under efficient detection and mixed-state dynamics emerging from inefficient monitoring, with deterministic Lindbladian evolution appearing as a limiting case. It thus establishes a direct connection between phase transitions in nonequilibrium steady states of driven open quantum matter and in measurement-induced dynamics. As an application, we study imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting in a one-dimensional lattice system: monitored gain and loss of fermions occurring at different rates, with a fraction of gain and loss jumps undetected. For imbalanced but efficient counting, we recover the qualitative picture of the balanced case: entanglement obeys an area law for any nonzero jump rate, with an extended quantum-critical regime emerging between two parametrically separated length scales. Inefficient detection introduces a finite correlation length beyond which entanglement, as quantified by the fermionic logarithmic negativity, obeys an area law, while the subsystem entropy shows volume-law scaling. Numerical simulations support our analytical findings. Our results offer a general and versatile theoretical foundation for studying measurement-induced phenomena across a wide class of monitored and open quantum systems.

Title: Critical coupling in $ϕ_2^4$ theory
Authors: Stephan Durr, Tolga S. H. Kiel
Abstract: We consider $\phi^4$ theory with $\phi(x)\in\mathbb{R}$ in two Euclidean dimensions. We determine for a variety of self-couplings $\hat{\lambda}$ the (negative) critical bare mass $\hat{\mu}_{0\mathrm{c}}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ where the lattice-regularized system changes from the symmetric to the broken phase. Based on these data, the transition to infinite volume and a universal scheme with the renormalized parameter $\hat{\mu}_\mathrm{c}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ is made. Finally, $f_\mathrm{c}=\lim_{\hat{\lambda}\to0}\hat{\lambda}/\hat{\mu}_\mathrm{c}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ is determined, with a judicious choice of the parameterizations considered. Our final result reads $f_\mathrm{c}=11.1097(20)_\mathrm{stat}(09)_\mathrm{sys}=11.1097(22)_\mathrm{tot}$.

Title: Riemannian Stochastic Interpolants for Amorphous Particle Systems
Authors: Louis Grenioux, Leonardo Galliano, Ludovic Berthier, Giulio Biroli, Marylou Gabrié
Abstract: Modern generative models hold great promise for accelerating diverse tasks involving the simulation of physical systems, but they must be adapted to the specific constraints of each domain. Significant progress has been made for biomolecules and crystalline materials. Here, we address amorphous materials (glasses), which are disordered particle systems lacking atomic periodicity. Sampling equilibrium configurations of glass-forming materials is a notoriously slow and difficult task. This obstacle could be overcome by developing a generative framework capable of producing equilibrium configurations with well-defined likelihoods. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging an equivariant Riemannian stochastic interpolation framework which combines Riemannian stochastic interpolant and equivariant flow matching. Our method rigorously incorporates periodic boundary conditions and the symmetries of multi-component particle systems, adapting an equivariant graph neural network to operate directly on the torus. Our numerical experiments on model amorphous systems demonstrate that enforcing geometric and symmetry constraints significantly improves generative performance.

Title: Condensation of slow $γ$-quanta in strong magnetic fields
Authors: Leah Folkerts, Reinhold Egger, Carsten Müller, Selym Villalba-Chávez
Abstract: The implications of the root singularity of the vacuum polarization tensor near the first pair creation threshold on blackbody radiation are investigated for magnetic fields above the characteristic scale of quantum electrodynamics. We show that the vacuum birefringence in such a strong background leads to an anisotropic behavior of the Planck radiation law. The thermal spectrum is characterized by a resonance that competes with the Wien maximum, causing a crossover in the low $\gamma$-spectrum of the heat radiation. A light state resembling a many-body condensate with slow motion is linked to the high-temperature phase. This novel state of radiation may coexist with nuclear or quark matter in a neutron star's core, increasing its compactness and influencing its stability.

Title: Scalable tests of quantum contextuality from stabilizer-testing nonlocal games
Authors: Wanbing Zhao, H. W. Shawn Liew, Wen Wei Ho, Chunxiao Liu, Vir B. Bulchandani
Abstract: Soon after the dawn of quantum error correction, DiVincenzo and Peres observed that stabilizer codewords could give rise to simple proofs of quantumness via contextuality. This discovery can be recast in the language of nonlocal games: every $n$-qubit stabilizer state defines a specific "stabilizer-testing" $n$-player nonlocal game, which quantum players can win with probability one. If quantum players can moreover outperform all possible classical players, then the state is contextual. However, the classical values of stabilizer-testing games are largely unknown for scalable examples beyond the $n$-qubit GHZ state. We introduce several new methods for upper-bounding the classical values of these games. We first prove a general coding-theory bound for all stabilizer-testing games: if the classical value $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* < 1$, then $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* \leq 7/8$, i.e., there is no classical strategy that can perform as well as the optimal quantum strategy even in an asymptotic sense. We then show how to tighten this bound for the most common scalable examples, namely GHZ, toric-code and cyclic cluster states. In particular, we establish an asymptotically tight upper bound for cyclic cluster states using transfer-matrix methods. This leads to the striking conclusion that measuring an exponentially small fidelity to the cyclic cluster state will suffice to witness its contextuality.

Title: Self-Affine Scaling of Earth's Islands
Authors: Matthew Oline, Jeremy Hoskins, David Seekell, Mary Silber, B.B. Cael
Abstract: Earth's relief is approximately self-affine, meaning a zoom-in on a small region looks statistically similar to a large region upon a suitable rescaling. Fractional Brownian surfaces give an idealized self-affine model of Earth's relief with one parameter, the Hurst exponent $H$, characterizing the roughness of the surface. To quantitatively assess agreement with Earth elevation data, we compile a large dataset of topographic profiles of islands (N=131,063 with the range of areas covering 8+ orders of magnitude) and obtain four estimates for the Hurst exponent of Earth's surface by fitting four statistical laws from the theory of self-affine surfaces concerning islands: (i) distribution of areas, (ii) volume-area relationship, (iii) perimeter-area relationship, and (iv) maximum height-area relationship. The estimated Hurst exponents differ greatly, indicating different fractal scaling behavior for different geometric features, but are sorted in order of increasing expected influence of erosion at the shorelines.

Title: Pattern recognition in complex systems via vector-field representations of spatio-temporal data
Authors: Ingrid Amaranta Membrillo Solis, Maria van Rossem, Tristan Madeleine, Tetiana Orlova, Nina Podoliak, Giampaolo D'Alessandro, Jacek Brodzki, Malgosia Kaczmarek
Abstract: A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.

Title: Relativistic superfluid profiles near critical surfaces
Authors: Lorenzo Gavassino, Alexander Soloviev
Abstract: Landau's two-fluid model of superfluidity ceases to apply in regions where the condensate amplitude exhibits rapid spatial variation, such as vortex cores or in the vicinity of container walls. A recently proposed relativistic Gross-Pitaevskii-type framework treats the condensate as an independent scalar degree of freedom, enabling a controlled analysis of such regimes. We use it to construct stationary superflows close to the superfluid-normal phase boundary, and examine their stability. We obtain an exact expression for Landau's critical velocity and show that the standard Newtonian profiles (such as the near-vortex condensate depletion or the boundary-layer decay) persist unmodified in the relativistic setting. We further analyse a genuinely relativistic configuration in which an accelerated superfluid develops a phase boundary induced by Tolman temperature gradients.

Title: Numerically exact open quantum system work statistics with process tensors
Authors: Mike Shubrook, Moritz Cygorek, Erik Gauger, Jake Iles-Smith, Ahsan Nazir
Abstract: Accurately quantifying the thermodynamic work costs of quantum operations is essential for the continued development and optimisation of emerging quantum technologies. This present a significant challenge in regimes of rapid control within complex, non-equilibrium environments - conditions under which many contemporary quantum devices operate and conventional approximations break down. Here, we introduce a process tensor framework that enables the computation of the full numerically exact quantum work statistics of driven open quantum systems. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a Landauer erasure protocol operating beyond the weak-coupling, Markovian, and slow-driving limits. The resulting work probability distributions reveal distinct quantum signatures that are missed by low-order moments yet significantly impact the erasure fidelity of the protocol. Our framework delivers non-perturbative accuracy and detail in characterising energy-exchange fluctuations in driven open quantum systems, establishing a powerful and versatile tool for exploring thermodynamics and control in the operating regimes of both near-term and future quantum devices.

Title: A MAPS Detector for High Resolution Low Dose EBSD
Authors: Barnaby D.A. Levin, Kalani Moore, Nicolò M. Della Ventura, McLean P. Echlin, Tresa M. Pollock, Daniel S. Gianola
Abstract: The use of highly sensitive pixelated direct detectors has dramatically improved the performance of high energy instrumentation such as transmission electron microscopy. Here, we describe a recently developed monolithic active pixel sensor designed for low energy scanning electron microscopy applications. This detector enables electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) at lower energies and dose than are accessible with existing scintillator-coupled detectors, expanding grain orientation mapping capabilities to materials such as ceramics that are poor electron conductors. The high detector sensitivity allows collection of rich diffraction information - providing dislocation defect contrast that is otherwise not accessible via EBSD. Indeed, even the energy of single electron interaction events can be measured with this detector, which we demonstrate to energy filter diffraction patterns revealing details of how diffraction occurs at low energy.

Title: Multimer Embedding for Molecular Crystals Utilizing up to Tetramer Interactions
Authors: Alexander List, A. Daniel Boese, Johannes Hoja
Abstract: Molecular crystals possess a highly complex crystallographic landscape which in many cases results in the experimental observation of multiple crystal structures for the same compound. Accurate results can often be obtained for such systems by employing periodic density functional theory using hybrid functionals; however, this is not always computationally feasible. One possibility to circumvent these expensive periodic calculations is the utilization of multimer embedding methods. Therein, the fully periodic crystal is described at a lower level of theory, and subsequently monomer energies, dimer interaction energies, etc. are corrected via high-level calculations. In this paper, we further extend such a multimer embedding approach by one multimer order for all investigated properties, allowing us to compute lattice energies up to the tetramer embedding level, and atomic forces, the stress tensor, and harmonic phonons up to the trimer level. We test the significance of including these higher-order multimers by embedding PBE0+MBD multimers into periodic PBE+MBD calculations utilizing the X23 benchmark set of molecular crystals and comparing the results to explicit periodic PBE0+MBD calculations. We show that tetramer interactions systematically improve the lattice energy approximation and explore multiple possibilities for multimer selection. Furthermore, we confirm that trimer interactions are crucial for the description of the stress tensor, yielding cell volumes within 1 % of those of PBE0+MBD. Subsequently, this also results in an improvement of the description of vibrational properties, giving on average gamma point frequencies within 1.3 wave numbers and vibrational free energies within 0.3 kJ/mol of the PBE0+MBD results.

Title: Random purification channel for passive Gaussian bosons
Authors: Francesco Anna Mele, Filippo Girardi, Senrui Chen, Marco Fanizza, Ludovico Lami
Abstract: The random purification channel, which, given $n$ copies of an unknown mixed state $\rho$, prepares $n$ copies of an associated random purification, has proved to be an extremely valuable tool in quantum information theory. In this work, we construct a Gaussian version of this channel that, given $n$ copies of a bosonic passive Gaussian state, prepares $n$ copies of one of its randomly chosen Gaussian purifications. The construction has the additional advantage that each purification has a mean photon number which is exactly twice that of the initial state. Our construction relies on the characterisation of the commutant of passive Gaussian unitaries via the representation theory of dual reductive pairs of unitary groups.

Title: Cartesian-nj: Extending e3nn to Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Product and Contracion
Authors: Zemin Xu, Chenyu Wu, Wenbo Xie, Daiqian Xie, P. Hu
Abstract: Equivariant atomistic machine learning models have brought substantial gains in both extrapolation capability and predictive accuracy. Depending on the basis of the space, two distinct types of irreducible representations are utilized. From architectures built upon spherical tensors (STs) to more recent formulations employing irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs), STs have remained dominant owing to their compactness, elegance, and theoretical completeness. Nevertheless, questions have persisted regarding whether ST constructions are the only viable design principle, motivating continued development of Cartesian networks. In this work, we introduce the Cartesian-3j and Cartesian-nj symbol, which serve as direct analogues of the Wigner-3j and Wigner-nj symbol defined for tensor coupling. These coefficients enable the combination of any two ICTs into a new ICT. Building on this foundation, we extend e3nn to support irreducible Cartesian tensor product, and we release the resulting Python package as cartnn. Within this framework, we implement Cartesian counterparts of MACE, NequIP, and Allegro, allowing the first systematic comparison of Cartesian and spherical models to assess whether Cartesian formulations may offer advantages under specific conditions. Using TACE as a representative example, we further examine whether architectures constructed from irreducible Cartesian tensor product and contraction(ICTP and ICTC) are conceptually well-founded in Cartesian space and whether opportunities remain for improving their design.

Title: Many-body contextuality and self-testing quantum matter via nonlocal games
Authors: Oliver Hart, David T. Stephen, Evan Wickenden, Rahul Nandkishore
Abstract: Contextuality is arguably the fundamental property that makes quantum mechanics different from classical physics. It is responsible for quantum computational speedups in both magic-state-injection-based and measurement-based models of computation, and can be directly probed in a many-body setting by multiplayer nonlocal quantum games. Here, we discuss a family of games that can be won with certainty when performing single-site Pauli measurements on a state that is a codeword of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting quantum code. We show that these games require deterministic computation of a code-dependent Boolean function, and that the classical probability of success is upper bounded by a generalized notion of nonlinearity/nonquadraticity. This success probability quantifies the state's contextuality, and is computed via the function's (generalized) Walsh-Hadamard spectrum. To calculate this, we introduce an efficient, many-body-physics-inspired method that involves identifying the symmetries of an auxiliary hypergraph state. We compute the classical probability of success for several paradigmatic CSS codes and relate it to both classical statistical mechanics models and to strange correlators of symmetry-protected topological states. We also consider CSS submeasurement games, which can only be won with certainty by sharing the appropriate codeword up to local isometries. These games therefore enable self-testing, which we illustrate explicitly for the 2D toric code. We also discuss how submeasurement games enable an extensive notion of contextuality in many-body states.

Title: Topological materials with extensive flat-band surface states
Authors: Protyush Nandi, Subinay Dasgupta
Abstract: Materials that have zero-energy flat band states on the surface may show surface superconductivity. Here we report a theoretical observation that a Hamiltonian describing a thin slab of topological nodal line semimetal, has zero energy eigenstate spanning the entire surface of the Brillouin zone under certain conditions, namely (i) the hopping amplitude of fermions in the direction of thickness is more than that in other directions (ii) the onsite energy should be less than some limiting value determined by the hopping probability. Our claim is substantiated by analytic and numerical approach. We also report new phase transitions in a region of parameter space and indicate that the Hamiltonian can also be realised by stacked layers described by a suitable Hamiltonian.

Title: On-demand analog space-time in superconducting networks: grey holes, dynamical instability and exceptional points
Authors: Mohammad Atif Javed, Daniel Kruti, Ahmed Kenawy, Tobias Herrig, Christina Koliofoti, Oleksiy Kashuba, Roman-Pascal Riwar
Abstract: There has been considerable effort to mimic analog black holes and wormholes in solid state systems. Lattice realizations in particular present specific challenges. One of those is that event horizons in general have both white and black hole (grey hole) character, a feature guaranteed by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We here explore and extend the capability of superconducting circuit hardware to implement on-demand spacetime geometries on lattices, combining nonreciprocity of gyrators with the nonlinearity of Josephson junctions. We demonstrate the possibility of the metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the modulation of system parameters is "trans-Planckian", and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. Instead of regular Hawking radiation, we find an instability in the form of an exponential burst of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales - a robust signature even in the presence of an environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/white hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: exceptional points in the dispersion relation allow for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons, at the expense of a radical change in the dynamics of the wormhole interior.

Title: Real-Time Out-of-Equilibrium Quantum Dynamics in Disordered Materials
Authors: Luis M. Canonico, Stephan Roche, Aron W. Cummings
Abstract: We report a linear-scaling numerical method for exploring nonequilibrium electron dynamics in systems of arbitrary complexity. Based on the Chebyshev expansion of the time evolution of the single-particle density matrix, the method gives access to nonperturbative excitation and relaxation phenomena in models of disordered materials with sizes on the experimental scale. After validating the method by applying it to saturable optical absorption in clean graphene, we uncover that disorder can enhance absorption in graphene and that the interplay between light, anisotropy, and disorder in nanoporous graphene might be appealing for sensing applications. Beyond the optical properties of graphene-like materials, the method can be applied to a wide range of large-area materials and systems with arbitrary descriptions of defects and disorder.

Title: Paramagnon-Interference Mechanism for Three-Dimensional Bond Order in Kagome Metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K): Analysis by the Density-Wave Equation
Authors: Seiichiro Onari, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani
Abstract: The mechanism of CDW and its 3D structure are important fundamental issues in kagome metals. We have previously shown that, based on a 2D model, $2\times 2$ bond order (BO) emerges due to the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism and that its fluctuations lead to $s$-wave superconductivity. This paper studies these issues based on realistic 3D models of kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K). We reveal that a commensurate 3D $2\times 2\times 2$ BO is caused by the PMI mechanism, by performing the 3D density-wave (DW) equation analysis for all A=Cs, Rb, K models in detail. Our results indicate a BO transition temperature $T_{\rm BO}\sim 100$K within the regime of moderate electron correlation. The 3D structure of BO is attributed to the three-dimensionality of the Fermi surface, while the 3D structure of BO is sensitively changed, since the Fermi surface is quasi-2D. Based on the analysis of the DW equation, by taking into account a finite third-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) term, (i) shift stacking $2\times 2\times 2$ BO can be realized via a first-order transition below $T_{\rm BO}$. Here, the in-plane BO pattern (tri-hexagonal or star-of-David) is determined by the sign of the third-order GL term, with hole doping tending to favor the tri-hexagonal state. On the other hand, if the third-order GL term is very small, (ii) alternating vertical stacking BO may instead be realized via a second-order transition. The present study enhances our understanding of the rich variety of BOs observed experimentally. It is confirmed that the PMI mechanism is the essential origin of the 3D CDW of kagome metals.

Title: Anomalous Hall effect from nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling
Authors: Longju Yu, Hong Jian Zhao, Yurong Yang, Laurent Bellaiche, Yanming Ma
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a topology-related transport phenomenon being of potential interest in spintronics, because this effect enables the efficient probe of magnetic orders (i.e., data readout in memory devices). It is well known that AHE spontaneously occurs in ferromagnets or antiferromagnets with magnetization. While recent studies reveal electric-field induced AHE (via linear magnetoelectric coupling), an AHE originating from {\it nonlinear} magnetoelectric coupling remains largely unexplored. Here, by symmetry analysis, we establish the phenomenological theory regarding the spontaneous and electric-field driven AHE in magnets. We show that a large variety of magnetic point groups host an AHE that is driven by uni-axial, bi-axial, or tri-axial electric field and that comes from nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling. Such electric-field driven anomalous Hall conductivities are reversible by reversing the magnetic orders. Furthermore, our first-principles calculations suggest Cr$_2$O$_3$ and CoF$_2$ as candidates hosting the aforementioned AHE. Our work emphasizes the important role of nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling in creating exotic transport phenomena, and offers alternative avenues for the probe of magnetic orders.

Title: Direct Imaging of Hydrogen-Driven Dislocation and Strain Field Evolution in a Stainless Steel Grain
Authors: David Yang, Mujan Seif, Guanze He, Kay Song, Adrien Morez, Benjamin de Jager, Dmytro Nykypanchuk, Ross J. Harder, Wonsuk Cha, Edmund Tarleton, Ian K. Robinson, Felix Hofmann
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron-transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen-induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to track three-dimensional dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen-enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen-induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen-driven dislocation behavior. The quantified nanoscale phenomena serve as critical inputs for multiscale modeling frameworks to predict bulk material responses and accelerate the development of HE-resistant alloys.

Title: Multichannel active-space embedding of atomic multiplets in plane-wave DFT/PAW for core-level spectroscopies
Authors: Alessandro Mirone, Mauro Rovezzi, Christoph Sahle, Alessandro Longo
Abstract: We introduce an active-space embedding framework for core-level spectroscopies that connects localized atomic multiplets to continuum resonances within a plane-wave DFT/PAW description. The approach is complementary to widely used core-level Bethe--Salpeter implementations based on a two-particle (core-exciton) picture with typically static screening: here a correlated multiplet manifold of the absorber (including the core hole and open-shell configurations) is coherently coupled to a plane-wave photoelectron, enabling a unified treatment of localized multiplet structure and continuum lineshapes. Spectra are computed in a general time-domain formulation equivalent to Fermi's golden rule: a transition operator tailored to the specific spectroscopy technique is applied to the correlated ground state to generate an excited wavepacket, and the corresponding wavepacket autocorrelation function is evaluated without explicit real-time propagation, using Lanczos tridiagonalization or the kernel polynomial method; the spectral intensity follows from its Fourier representation. We validate the method at the Ce \(N_{4,5}\) edges, reproducing in quantitative agreement with experiment both high-\(Q\) multiplet features and the low-\(Q\) giant dipole resonance continuum, including a characteristic low-energy shoulder relevant for robust Ce valence assignments. The implementation is available open-source within the Quantum ESPRESSO XSPECTRA package (xspectruplet mode), together with reproducible inputs and scripts.

Title: Electrically switchable non-relativistic Zeeman spin splittings in collinear antiferromagnets
Authors: Longju Yu, Hong Jian Zhao, Laurent Bellaiche, Yanming Ma
Abstract: Magnetic or electrical manipulation of electronic spin is elementary for spin-based logic, computing, and memory, where the latter is a low-power manipulation scheme. Rashba-like spin splittings stemming from spin-orbit interaction (SOI) enable electric-field manipulation of spin, but the relativistic SOI causes spin relaxations and yields dissipative transport of spin-encoded information. Recent works suggest the occurrence of electric-field switchable non-relativistic Zeeman spin splittings (NRZSSs) in collinear antiferromagnets -- allowing for electrical manipulation of spin in the non-relativistic regime; yet, a theory elucidating the mechanisms for these NRZSSs and guiding the materials discovery remains missing. Here, we develop such a theory by analyzing the symmetries of spin point groups. We highlight the linear magnetoelectric and bilinear piezomagnetoelectric mechanisms for NRZSSs that depend linearly on electric field and are electrically switchable. First-principles calculations further confirm that FeOOH and NaMnP showcase such NRZSSs. Our theory provides guidelines for discovering light-element collinear antiferromagnets with electrically switchable NRZSSs, which are promising for the design of high-performance spin-based devices.

Title: Experiments and modeling of mechanically-soft, hard magnetorheological foams with potential applications in haptic sensing
Authors: Zehui Lin, Zahra Hooshmand-Ahoor, Laurence Bodelot, Kostas Danas
Abstract: This study proposes a family of novel mechanically-soft and magnetically-hard magnetorheological foams that, upon deformation, lead to robust and measurable magnetic flux changes in their surroundings. This allows to infer qualitatively and even quantitatively the imposed deformation and, eventually from that, an estimation of the stiffness and average stress on the sample even in complex loading scenarios involving combinations of uniform or nonuniform compression/tension with superposed shearing in different directions. The work provides a complete experimental, theoretical and numerical framework on finite strain, compressible magneto-elasticity, thereby allowing to measure and predict coupled magneto-mechanical properties of such materials with different particle volume fractions and then use it to estimate and design potential haptic sensing devices.

Title: Atomic structure of the PL5 defect in silicon carbide revealed by single-spin spectroscopy and oxygen implantation
Authors: Yu Chen, Qi Zhang, Mingzhe Liu, Junda Wu, Jinpeng Liu, Xin Zhao, Jingyang Zhou, Pei Yu, Shaochun Lin, Yuanhong Teng, Wancheng Yu, Ya Wang, Changkui Duan, Fazhan Shi
Abstract: PL5 and PL6 centers in 4H-SiC are promising for quantum applications due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection were insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this work, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5/PL6 at the single-defect level, definitively ruling out any spatial correlation and demonstrating that these centers are not associated with stacking faults. Furthermore, we find that substituting oxygen for nitrogen in ion implantation enhances the yields of PL5 and PL6 by more than $11$-fold and $23$-fold, respectively. Single-spin ODMR spectroscopy of PL5 reveals six distinct orientations, determines the transverse zero-field splitting parameter $E$, and characterizes the hyperfine coupling. Combined with our ab initio calculations, these results provide compelling evidence for the assignment of PL5 as an OV($kh$) defect, consisting of an oxygen atom occupying the C($k$) site as the nearest neighbor to a Si($h$) vacancy. The structural analysis together with the demonstrated defect yield enhancement lays the foundation for fabricating high-sensitivity, high-contrast ensemble quantum sensors in two and three dimensions.

Title: Electrical generation of surface plasmon polaritons in plasmonic heterostructures
Authors: Maxim Trushin
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) can be understood as two-dimensional light confined to a conductor-dielectric interface via plasmonic excitations. While low-energy SPPs behave similarly to photons, higher-frequency SPPs resemble surface plasmons. Electrically generating mid-range SPPs is particularly challenging because it requires compensating for momentum mismatch, a process conventionally achieved through inelastic electron transport in nanostructures. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that electrical SPP generation is possible by directly coupling electron-hole dipoles to the quantized SPP field across an insulating spacer without accompanying electron transport. This approach can be realized in plasmonic van der Waals heterostructures composed of strongly-biased monolayer graphene as the emitter, few-layer hexagonal boron nitride as the spacer, and silver (or gold) as the plasmonic material. In this configuration, graphene's remarkable ability to support a strongly non-equilibrium steady-state electron-hole population results in non-thermal, bias-tunable SPP emission that is uniform along the hBN/Ag interface, achieving a power conversion efficiency of up to 1% and a Purcell factor of up to 100. These findings pave the way for integrating photonic and electronic functionalities within a single two-dimensional heterostructure.

Title: Number of local minima in discrete-time fractional Brownian motion
Authors: Maxim Dolgushev, Olivier Bénichou
Abstract: The analysis of local minima in time series data and random landscapes is essential across numerous scientific disciplines, offering critical insights into system dynamics. Recently, Kundu, Majumdar, and Schehr derived the exact distribution of the number of local minima for a broad class of Markovian symmetric walks [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{110}, 024137 (2024)]; however, many real-world systems are non-Markovian, typically due to interactions with possibly hidden degrees of freedom. This work investigates the statistical properties of local minima in discrete-time samples of fractional Brownian motion (fBm), a non-Markovian Gaussian process with stationary increments, widely used to model complex, anomalous diffusion phenomena. We derive a complete asymptotic characterization of the fluctuations of the number of local minima $m_N$ in an $N$-step discrete-time fBm. We show that the fluctuations of $m_N$ exhibit a sharp transition at the Hurst exponent $H=3/4$: for $H\le 3/4$ they satisfy a central limit theorem with Gaussian limiting law, whereas for $H>3/4$ they converge to a non-Gaussian Rosenblatt process. The convergence at the process level gives us full statistical description at all times. We exemplify it on the covariance of the rescaled minima process, which displays two qualitatively distinct regimes matching Brownian and Rosenblatt covariances on either side of this threshold. Our analysis relies on a Hermite/Wick decomposition of the local-minimum indicator, which isolates a quadratic functional of an effective long-memory mode as the unique driver of the anomalous statistics. These results identify the count of local minima as a simple and robust diagnostic of long-range dependence in non-Markovian Gaussian processes, a conclusion supported by numerical simulations.

Title: Kondo effect under arbitrary spin-momentum locking
Authors: Kinari Goto, Yusuke Nishida
Abstract: The Kondo effect originates from the spin exchange scattering of itinerant electrons with a localized magnetic impurity. Here, we consider generalization of Weyl-type electrons with their spin locked on a spherical Fermi surface in an arbitrary way and study how such spin-momentum locking affects the Kondo effect. After introducing a suitable model Hamiltonian, a simple formula for the Kondo temperature is derived with the second-order perturbation theory, which proves to depend only on the spin averaged over the Fermi surface. In particular, the Kondo temperature is unaffected as long as the average spin vanishes, but decreases as the average spin increases in its magnitude, and eventually vanishes when the spin is completely polarized on the Fermi surface, illuminating the role of spin-momentum locking in the Kondo effect.

Title: Zeeman-type spin splittings in strained d-wave altermagnets
Authors: Yahui Zhai, Longju Yu, Jian Lv, Wei Zhang, Hong Jian Zhao
Abstract: Recently, altermagnetic materials have become rather attractive because such materials showcase combined advantages of ferromagnets (e.g., spin current) and antiferromagnets (e.g., low stray field and ultrafast spin dynamics). Symmetry arguments imply that $d$-wave altermagnets may host strain-induced nonrelativistic Zeeman-type spin splittings (ZSSs), and a theoretical, numerical, and experimental justification of such phenomena are of high necessity. In the present work, we work with collinear spin point groups (SPGs) and use symmetry analysis to identify 15 SPGs that host strain-induced nonrelativistic ZSSs. These 15 SPGs coincide with the cases associated with $d$-wave alternating spin splittings reported in literature. We further corroborate our analysis by first-principles numerical simulations, which indicate that a shear strain of $2\%$ creates sizable nonrelativistic ZSSs of up to 177, 100, and 102 meV in CoF$_2$, LiFe$_2$F$_6$ and La$_2$O$_3$Mn$_2$Se$_2$ $d$-wave altermagnetic semiconductors, respectively. Our work suggests an alternative route toward creating spin current in altermagnets, which may be used to design altermagnetic-based spintronic devices.

Title: Mechanically Interlocked Polymers in Dilute Solution under Shear and Extensional Flows: A Brownian Dynamics Study
Authors: Ali Seyedi, Alex Albaugh
Abstract: Mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs) are a novel class of polymer structures in which the components are connected by mechanical bonds instead of covalent bonds. We measure the single-molecule rheological properties of polyrotaxanes, daisy chains, and polycatenanes under steady shear and steady uniaxial extension using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations with hydrodynamic interactions. We obtain key rheological features, including tumbling dynamics, molecular extension, stress, and viscosity. By systematically varying structural features, we demonstrate how MIP topology governs flow response. Compared to linear polymers, all three MIP architectures exhibit enhanced tumbling in shear flow and lower normal stress differences in extensional flow. While polyrotaxanes show higher shear and extensional viscosities, polycatenanes and daisy chains have lower viscosities. In extensional flow, polyrotaxanes and polycatenanes extend earlier than linear polymers. We find that mechanical bonds suppress shear thinning and alter the coil-stretch transition observed in linear polymers. These effects arise from the mechanically bonded rings in MIPs, which expand the polymer profile in gradient direction and increase backbone stiffness due to ring-backbone repulsions. This study provides key insights into MIP flow properties, providing the foundation for their systematic development in engineering applications.

Title: Few-body bound states of bosonic mixtures in two-dimensional optical lattices
Authors: Matias Volante-Abovich, Felipe Isaule, Luis Morales-Molina
Abstract: We study the formation of bound states in a binary mixture of a few bosons in small square optical lattices. Using the exact diagonalization method, we find that bound clusters of all available bosons can form. We provide a comprehensive numerical examination of these bound states for a wide range of repulsive intraspecies and attractive interspecies interactions. In contrast to binary mixtures in one-dimensional chains, we reveal that the binding energy of the clusters shows a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction strengths for small tunneling rates, developing a local minimum for intermediate attractive interactions. The findings of this work highlight the difference between the binding mechanisms of binary bosonic mixtures in one- and higher-dimensional lattices.

Title: Entanglement across scales: Quantics tensor trains as a natural framework for renormalization
Authors: Stefan Rohshap, Jheng-Wei Li, Alena Lorenz, Serap Hasil, Karsten Held, Anna Kauch, Markus Wallerberger
Abstract: Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively, the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the information exchange between different length scales, has received far less attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping, where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.

Title: Energy-Resolved EBSD using a Monolithic Direct Electron Detector
Authors: Nicolò M. Della Ventura, Kalani Moore, McLean P. Echlin, Matthew R. Begley, Tresa M. Pollock, Marc De Graef, Daniel S. Gianola
Abstract: Accurate quantification of the energy distribution of backscattered electrons (BSEs) contributing to electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns remains as an active challenge. This study introduces an energy-resolved EBSD methodology based on a monolithic active pixel sensor direct electron detector and an electron-counting algorithm to enable the energy quantification of individual BSEs, providing direct measurements of electron energy spectra within diffraction patterns. Following detector calibration of the detector signal as a function of primary beam energy, measurements using a 12 keV primary beam on Si(100) reveal a broad BSE energy distribution across the diffraction pattern, extending down to 3 keV. Furthermore, an angular dependence in the weighted average BSE energy is observed, closely matching predictions from Monte Carlo simulations. Pixel-resolved energy maps reveal subtle modulations at Kikuchi band edges, offering insights into the backscattering process. By applying energy filtering within spectral windows as narrow as 2 keV centered on the primary beam energy, significant enhancement in pattern clarity and high-frequency detail is observed. Notably, BSEs in the 9--10 keV range dominate Kikuchi pattern formation, while BSEs in the 2--8 keV range, despite having undergone substantial energy loss, still produce Kikuchi patterns. By enabling energy determination at the single-electron level, this approach introduces a versatile tool-set for expanding the quantitative capabilities of EBSD, thereby offering the potential to deepen the understanding of diffraction contrast mechanisms and to advance the precision of crystallographic measurements.

Title: Quantum thermalization and the route to ergodicity
Authors: Amichay Vardi, Doron Cohen
Abstract: We consider a minimal model for quantum thermalization of coupled chaotic subsystems. The route towards ergodicity is explored as a function of the coupling strength. The results are contrasted with the predictions of standard Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and the Eigenstates Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We highlight a coupling regime of disparity between the spectral statistics that indicates chaos, and ergodicity measures that indicate lack of ETH thermalization. The analysis involves a revision of the energy shell concept, in a way that is consistent but independent of the semiclassical perspective.

Title: Almost half-quantized planar Hall effects in $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$
Authors: Motohiko Ezawa
Abstract: The planar Hall effect is a phenomenon that the Hall conductivity emerges perpendicular to the electric field in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. We investigate the planar Hall effect in two-dimensional metal coupled with higher symmetric $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$,\ where those with $X=d,g,i$ are altermagnets. The $X$-wave magnet is characterized by the number $N_{X}$ of the nodes in the band structure, where $N_{X}=1,2,3,4,6$ corresponding to $X=p,d,f,g,i$. Although the system is metallic, provided the Dirac gap is tiny, we demonstrate that the Hall conductivities are almost half quantized and well approximated by the formula $\sigma _{xy}=\pm (e^{2}/2h)$ sgn$\left( J\sin N_{X}\Phi \right) $, where $J$ is the coefficient of the coupling between the $X$-wave magnet and the electrons, and $\Phi $ is the direction of the applied magnetic field. Hence, the Hall conductivity is periodic in $\Phi $, and the periodicity is equal to the number $N_{X}$ of the nodes. This property may be used to confirm that the target material is indeed an $X $-wave magnet. Furthermore, the sign of $J$ may be used as a bit for antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Phase field modelling of the growth and detachment of bubbles in a hydrogen electrolyzer
Authors: Carlos Uriarte, Marco A. Fontelos, Manuel Arrayás
Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the growth and detachment of a gas bubble resting on an electrode and being filled with hydrogen produced by water electrolysis. The bubble is surrounded by a viscous liquid, has a prescribed static contact angle and is also subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the time at which the bubble detaches from the substrate and what volume it has at that time. We also investigate de dependence of the detachment time on other parameters such as the applied voltage and the hydrogen ion concentration at the fluid bulk.

Title: Quantum diatomic chain: a supersolid structure in three-component Bose mixture
Authors: Francesco Ancilotto
Abstract: The formation and properties of a supersolid structure in a three-component ultracold Bose gas mixture at T=0 are investigated theoretically. The system consists of 23Na, 39K, and 41K atomic species, in which the binary mixtures of (23Na,39K) and (39K,41K) can form self-bound quantum droplets stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Two such droplets can bind together by the shared 39K component, forming a stable "dimer" structure, which displays vibrational modes analogous to a classical diatomic molecule. A simple protocol is proposed to create a stable linear chain formed by periodic repetition of this basic building block, i.e. an alternating sequence of (23Na,39K) and (39K,41K) droplets. This structure exhibits both periodic density modulations from the droplet ordering and global phase coherence due to the shared 39K component, satisfying the criteria for supersolidity. This expands the class of known supersolids by adding a system where mediated binding, rather than intrinsic long-range interactions or engineered band-structures as in previously known supersolids, is the key organizing principle, thereby offering new directions for both theory and experiment. The low-energy excitation spectrum, probed by density perturbations, identifies modes corresponding to droplet vibrations close to the ones expected from a classical diatomic chain, coexisting with low-energy superfluid (Goldstone-type) modes.

Title: Quantum Spin Hall Phase in the Truncated Trihexagonal Lattice: A Topological Archimedean Structure
Authors: L. V. Duc Pham, Nicki F. Hinsche, Ingrid Mertig
Abstract: Archimedean lattices constitute a unique family of two-dimensional tilings formed from regular polygons arranged with uniform vertex configurations. While the kagome and snub square lattices, the simplest members of the Archimedean lattice family, have been extensively investigated -- the former as a paradigmatic system for geometric frustration and nontrivial band topology, and the latter primarily as a quasicrystal approximant -- the broader family remains largely unexplored in terms of electronic and topological properties. In this work, we present a systematic Python-based tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean lattices, modeled as two-dimensional carbon-based networks serving as a proof-of-principle system. We analyze their band structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the truncated trihexagonal lattice supports topologically protected, highly spin-polarized edge states across multiple ribbon geometries. These states are stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and give rise to quantized spin Hall currents.

Title: Application of perturbation theory to finding vibrational frequencies of a spheroid
Authors: M.O. Nestoklon, L. Saviot, S.V. Goupalov
Abstract: We apply perturbation theory of boundary conditions, originally developed by A.B. Migdal and independently by S.A. Moszkowski for deformed atomic nuclei, to finding eigenfrequencies of Raman-active spheroidal modes of a spheroid from these of a sphere and compare the outcomes with the results of numerical calculations for CdSe and silver nanoparticles. The modes are characterized by the total angular momentum $j=2$ and are five-fold degenerate for a sphere but split into three distinct modes, characterized by the absolute value of the total angular momentum projection onto the spheroidal axis, in case of a spheroid. The perturbation method works well in case of the rigid boundary conditions, with the displacement field set to zero at the boundary, and accurately predicts the splittings when the spheroidal shape is close to a sphere, but fails in case of the stress-free boundary conditions.

Title: Kekulé Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Ke Wang, K. Levin
Abstract: While it has been one of the most important new physics discoveries in the last decade, the nature of superconductivity in the twisted graphene family remains an unsolved problem. Motivated by recent scanning tunneling experiments that report Kekulé ordering in moiré graphene superconductors, we develop a microscopic theory of this superconductivity for the twisted bilayer system. The pairing we find is an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) that intrinsically carries a Kekulé modulation. This state exhibits four salient features: (i) spontaneous breaking of $C_3$ rotation symmetry, producing nematic order (ii)with triplet pairing; and (iii) a quasiparticle density of states that evolves from a V-shaped profile to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum as the attraction increases which is accompanied by (iv) systematic behavior of the temperature dependent zero bias conductance. These features align with key experimental signatures. We find, as well, that with only modest interaction strengths, the state is near to a BEC-like phase, consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Taken together, these results identify a microscopic intra-valley Kekulé PDW as a compelling candidate for unconventional superconductivity in the twisted graphene family.

Title: Benchmarking Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Elastic Property Prediction
Authors: Pengfei Gao, Haidi Wang
Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials have emerged as efficient tools for materials simulation, yet their reliability for elastic property prediction remains unclear. Here, we present a systematic benchmark of four uMLIPs -- MatterSim, MACE, SevenNet, and CHGNet -- against first-principles data for nearly 11\,000 elastically stable materials from the Materials Project database. The results show that SevenNet achieves the highest accuracy, MACE and MatterSim balance accuracy with efficiency, while CHGNet performs less effectively overall. To further improve predictive quality, we perform targeted fine-tuning on all four uMLIPs using strained configurations derived from 185 high-error materials. After fine-tuning, CHGNet exhibits the largest overall improvement, with an average mean absolute percentage error reduction of about 23\%, followed by MatterSim at around 21\% and SevenNet at 18\%, whereas MACE shows a performance degradation of roughly 14\%. This work provides quantitative guidance for model selection and data refinement, advancing uMLIPs toward reliable applications in mechanical property prediction.

Title: From Three-Particle Dynamics to the Structural Origin of the Arrow of Time in Classical and Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Shuhei Kobayashi
Abstract: This paper presents a unified formulation of the origin of the arrow of time in classical and quantum mechanics. We begin with a mechanical analysis of a one-dimensional three-particle system, which provides a concrete example in which macroscopic irreversibility emerges despite microscopically reversible dynamics. By abstracting this mechanism, we identify coarse-graining as the essential ingredient responsible for macroscopic time asymmetry. We then formulate a general structural criterion for the thermodynamic arrow of time. We show that when microscopic time evolution forms a group while the induced macroscopic evolution forms only a semigroup, macroscopic time-reversal symmetry is necessarily broken. We prove that this semigroup structure arises if and only if the coarse-graining map from microscopic to macroscopic states is non-injective. This result holds independently of whether the underlying system is classical or quantum. In the quantum case, using density matrices, antiunitary time reversal, and CPTP coarse-graining maps, we show that macroscopic irreversibility follows inevitably from information loss, without requiring any asymmetry in the microscopic laws. Our results demonstrate that the thermodynamic arrow of time has a universal structural origin: the loss of microscopic information inherent in coarse-graining.

Title: Quasiperiodicity-induced bulk localization with self similarity in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Yu-Peng Wang, Chuo-Kai Chang, Ryo Okugawa, Chen-Hsuan Hsu
Abstract: We analyze the localization behavior in a non-Hermitian system subject to a quasiperiodic onsite potential. We characterize localization transitions using multiple quantitative indicators, including inverse participation ratio (IPR), eigenstate fractal dimension (EFD), extended eigenstate ratio (EER), and spectral survival ratio. Despite the breaking of self-dual symmetry due to non-Hermiticity, our results reveal the existence of a critical potential strength, with its value increasing linearly with the nearest-neighbor antisymmetric hopping term. On the other hand, the inclusion of longer-range hopping not only enriches the topological properties but also gives rise to novel localization phenomena. In particular, it induces the emergence of mobility edges, as evidenced by both IPR and EFD, along with distinct features in the spectrum fractal dimension, which we extract using the box-counting method applied to the complex energy spectrum. Additionally, we uncover self-similar structures in various quantities, such as EER and complex eigenvalue ratio, as the potential strength varies. These findings highlight important aspects of localization and fractal phenomena in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems.

Title: Real Chern insulators in two-dimensional altermagnetic Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O
Authors: Yong-Kun Wang, Shifeng Qian, An-Dong Fan, Si Li
Abstract: Altermagnets, recently identified as a third class of collinear magnetic materials, have attracted significant attention in condensed matter physics. Despite this growing interest, the realization of real Chern insulators in intrinsic altermagnetic systems has rarely been reported. In this work, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we identify monolayer Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O as a novel class of two-dimensional altermagnetic real Chern insulators. We demonstrate that these materials possess altermagnetic ground states and host a nontrivial mirror real Chern number, leading to the emergence of symmetry-protected zero-dimensional corner states. Notably, these corner modes are spin-polarized, giving rise to a unique spin-corner coupling effect. We further show that the real Chern insulating phases and their associated corner states remain robust against spin-orbit coupling, as well as under both uniaxial and biaxial strain. Additionally, these materials exhibit pronounced linear dichroism and strong optical absorption. Our findings uncover the novel topological character of Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O, establishing them as promising platforms for exploring real Chern insulators in altermagnetic systems.

Title: Local Geometric and Transport Properties of Networks that are Generated from Hyperuniform Point Patterns
Authors: James V. Raj, Xiaohan Sun, Charles Emmett Maher, Katherine A. Newhall, Mason A. Porter
Abstract: Hyperuniformity, which is a type of long-range order that is characterized by the suppression of long-range density fluctuations in comparison to the fluctuations in standard disordered systems, has emerged as a powerful concept to aid in the understanding of diverse natural and engineered phenomena. In the present paper, we harness hyperuniform point patterns to generate a class of disordered, spatially embedded networks that are distinct from both perfectly ordered lattices and uniformly random geometric graphs. We refer to these networks as \emph{hyperuniform-point-pattern-induced (HuPPI) networks}, and we compare them to their counterpart \emph{Poisson-point-pattern-induced (PoPPI) networks}. By computing the local geometric and transport properties of HuPPI networks, we demonstrate how hyperuniformity imparts advantages in both transport efficiency and robustness. Specifically, we show that HuPPI networks have systematically smaller total effective resistances, slightly faster random-walk mixing times, and fewer extreme-curvature edges than PoPPI networks. Counterintuitively, we also find that HuPPI networks simultaneously have more negative mean Ollivier--Ricci curvatures and smaller total effective resistances than PoPPI networks, indicating that edges with moderately negative curvatures need not create severe bottlenecks to transport. Moreover, HuPPI networks are consistently more robust under both random edge removals and curvature-based targeted edge removals, maintaining larger connected components for larger fractions of removed edges than their PoPPI counterparts. We also demonstrate that the network-generation method strongly influences these properties and in particular that it often overshadows differences that arise from underlying point patterns.

Title: Moiré pattern multiplicity driven by electronic effects in two-dimensional CrCl3/Au heterostructures
Authors: Eugenio Gambari, Hugo Le Du, Mathieu Lizée, Arindam Mukherjee, Laurent Limot, Fabrice Scheurer, Marie D'angelo, François Debontridder, Tristan Cren, Marie Hervé
Abstract: Moiré patterns are a central motif in van der Waals heterostructures arising from the superposition of two-dimensional (2D) incommensurate lattices. These patterns reveal a wealth of correlated effects, influencing electronic, magnetic, and structural phenomena. While diffraction techniques typically resolve multiple moiré wave-vectors corresponding to the incommensurate nature of the underlying lattices, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) often reveals only a dominant superperiod. In this work, we address this apparent discrepancy through an STM study of a twisted monolayer of CrCl3 on Au(111). We observe the coexistence of several moiré patterns at a fixed twist angle, whose relative intensity depends on the tunneling bias. Fourier analysis of STM data uncovers hidden higher-order moiré components not visible in STM topographic images, while spectroscopy maps reveal that the spectral weight of each pattern varies with electron energy. Our results establish that STM selectively probes on the same area distinct moiré modulations depending on electronic confinement, providing a unified framework that reconciles real space and reciprocal space observations of complex moiré superstructures.

Title: Hyperuniform patterns nucleated at low temperatures: Insight from vortex matter imaged in unprecedentedly large fields-of-view
Authors: Alexey Cruz-García, Joaquín Puig, Sergii Pylypenko, Gladys Nieva, Alain Pautrat, Alejandro Benedykt Kolton, Yanina Fasano
Abstract: Hyperuniform patterns present enhanced physical properties that make them the new generation of cutting-edge technological devices. Synthesizing devices with tens of thousands of components arranged in a hyperuniform fashion has thus become a breakthrough to achieve in order to implement these technologies. Here we provide evidence that extended two-dimensional hyperuniform patterns spanning tens of thousands of components can be nucleated using as a template the low-temperature vortex structure obtained in pristine Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 samples after following a field-cooling protocol.

Title: A sine-square deformation approach to quantum critical points in one-dimensional systems
Authors: Yuki Miyazaki, Shiori Tanigawa, Giacomo Marmorini, Nobuo Furukawa, Daisuke Yamamoto
Abstract: We propose a method to determine the quantum phase boundaries of one-dimensional systems using sine-square deformation (SSD). Based on the proposition, supported by several exactly solved cases though not proven in full generality, that "if a one-dimensional system is gapless, then the expectation value of any local observable in the ground state of the Hamiltonian with SSD exhibits translational symmetry in the thermodynamic limit," we determine the quantum critical point as the location where a local observable becomes site-independent, identified through finite-size scaling analysis. As case studies, we consider two models: the antiferromagnetic Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions. We calculate the ground state of these Hamiltonians with SSD using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm and evaluate the local transverse magnetization. For the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the quantum critical point can be accurately estimated by our procedure with systems of up to 84 sites, or even smaller, in good agreement with results from the literature. For the long-range model, we find that the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is slightly shifted relative to the nearest-neighbor case, leading to a reduced region of antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, we propose an experimental procedure to implement the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising couplings with SSD using Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers, which can be achieved within a very good approximation. Because multiple independent scaling conditions naturally emerge, our approach enables precise determination of quantum critical points and possibly even the extraction of additional critical phenomena, such as critical exponents, from relatively small system sizes.

Title: On the applicability of the cumulant expansion method for the calculation of transport properties in electron-phonon systems
Authors: Petar Mitrić, Veljko Janković, Darko Tanasković, Nenad Vukmirović
Abstract: We assess the accuracy of the cumulant expansion (CE) method, combined with the independent-particle approximation (IPA), for calculating charge mobility in electron-phonon systems. As representative testbeds, we consider the Peierls and Fröhlich models, which serve as simplified frameworks where accurate or numerically exact benchmarks are available. These are used to compare the CE results with those obtained using the Boltzmann formalism, the Migdal approximation, and its self consistent extension-approaches that are presently the most commonly employed alternatives for transport calculations. Supported by analytical arguments based on spectral sum rules and by our previous results for the Holstein model, we argue that, for weak to moderate coupling strengths and not-too-low temperatures, the CE within the IPA framework yields accurate results. In the case of the Peierls model, the role of vertex corrections is also discussed.

Title: Pressure-Induced Changes in Structure, Magnetic Order and Development of Superconductivity in the Ferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi8Te13
Authors: S. Huyan, T. Qian, L. Wang, W. Bi, F. Xue, D. Zhang, C. Hu, B. Kalkan, Y. Huang, Z. Li, A. Das, J. Schmidt, R. A. Ribeiro, T. J. Slade, N. Ni, P. C. Canfield, S. L. Bud'ko
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of pressure-induced evolution of the magnetism and development of superconductivity (SC) in MnBi8Te13, a promising ambient pressure, ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulator candidate. By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n < 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials.

Title: Current fluctuations in open quantum systems: Bridging the gap between quantum continuous measurements and full counting statistics
Authors: Gabriel T. Landi, Michael J. Kewming, Mark T. Mitchison, Patrick P. Potts
Abstract: Continuously measured quantum systems are characterized by an output current, in the form of a stochastic and correlated time series which conveys crucial information about the underlying quantum system. The many tools used to describe current fluctuations are scattered across different communities: quantum opticians often use stochastic master equations, while a prevalent approach in condensed matter physics is provided by full counting statistics. These, however, are simply different sides of the same coin. Our goal with this tutorial is to provide a unified toolbox for describing current fluctuations. This not only provides novel insights, by bringing together different fields in physics, but also yields various analytical and numerical tools for computing quantities of interest. We illustrate our results with various pedagogical examples, and connect them with topical fields of research, such as waiting-time statistics, quantum metrology, thermodynamic uncertainty relations, quantum point contacts and Maxwell's demons.

Title: Operator space fragmentation in perturbed Floquet-Clifford circuits
Authors: Marcell D. Kovács, Christopher J. Turner, Lluis Masanes, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: Floquet quantum circuits are able to realise a wide range of non-equilibrium quantum states, exhibiting quantum chaos, topological order and localisation. In this work, we investigate the stability of operator localisation and emergence of chaos in random Floquet-Clifford circuits subjected to unitary perturbations which drive them away from the Clifford limit. We construct a nearest-neighbour Clifford circuit with a brickwork pattern and study the effect of including disordered non-Clifford gates. The perturbations are uniformly sampled from single-qubit unitaries with probability $p$ on each qubit. We show that the interacting model exhibits strong localisation of operators for $0 \le p < 1$ that is characterised by the fragmentation of operator space into disjoint sectors due to the appearance of wall configurations. Such walls give rise to emergent local integrals of motion for the circuit that we construct exactly. We analytically establish the stability of localisation against generic perturbations and calculate the average length of operator spreading tunable by $p$. Although our circuit is not separable across any bi-partition, we further show that the operator localisation leads to an entanglement bottleneck, where initially unentangled states remain weakly entangled across typical fragment boundaries. Finally, we study the spectral form factor (SFF) to characterise the chaotic properties of the operator fragments and spectral fluctuations as a probe of non-ergodicity. In the $p = 1$ model, the emergence of a fragmentation time scale is found before random matrix theory sets in after which the SFF can be approximated by that of the circular unitary ensemble. Our work provides an explicit description of quantum phases in operator dynamics and circuit ergodicity which can be realised on current NISQ devices.

Title: On the mean-field antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled 2D Hubbard model at zero temperature
Authors: Edwin Langmann, Jonatan Lenells
Abstract: We consider the antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model (on a square lattice) at zero temperature in Hartree-Fock theory. It was conjectured by Hirsch in 1985 that this gap, $\Delta$, vanishes like $\exp(-2\pi\sqrt{t/U})$ in the weak-coupling limit $U/t\downarrow 0$ ($U>0$ and $t>0$ are the usual Hubbard model parameters). We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.

Title: Near-deterministic photon entanglement from a spin qudit in silicon using third quantisation
Authors: Gözde Üstün, Samuel Elman, Jarryd J. Pla, Andrew C. Doherty, Andrea Morello, Simon J. Devitt
Abstract: Unlike other quantum hardware, photonic quantum architectures can produce millions of qubits from a single device. However, controlling photonic qubits remains challenging, even at small scales, due to their weak interactions, making non-deterministic gates in linear optics unavoidable. Nevertheless, a single photon can readily spread over multiple modes and create entanglement within the multiple modes deterministically. Rudolph's concept of third quantization leverages this feature by evolving multiple single-photons into multiple modes, distributing them uniformly and randomly to different parties, and creating multipartite entanglement without interactions between photons or non-deterministic gates. This method requires only classical communication and deterministic entanglement within multi-mode single-photon states and enables universal quantum computing. The multipartite entanglement generated within the third quantization framework is nearly deterministic, where ``deterministic'' is achieved in the asymptotic limit of a large system size. In this work, we propose a near-term experiment using antimony donor in a silicon chip to realize third quantization. Utilizing the eight energy levels of antimony, one can generate two eight-mode single-photon states independently and distribute them to parties. This enables a random multipartite Bell-state experiment, achieving a Bell state with an upper-bound efficiency of 87.5% among 56 random pairs without non-deterministic entangling gates. This approach opens alternative pathways for silicon-based photonic quantum computing.

Abstract: Dark current in silicon-based blocked impurity band (BIB) infrared detectors has long been a critical limitation on device performance. This work proposes a chiral-phonon-assisted spin current model at interfaces to explain the parabolic-like dark current behavior observed at low bias voltages. Concurrently, the spatially-confined charge transport theory is employed to elucidate the dark current generation mechanism across the entire operational voltage range.

Title: The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations
Authors: Francesco Sylos Labini
Abstract: Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with { varying resolutions and box sizes}, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.

Title: Quantum Fisher information as a witness of non-Markovianity and criticality in the spin-boson model
Authors: Daniele Parlato, Grazia Di Bello, Fabrizio Pavan, Giulio De Filippis, Carmine Antonio Perroni
Abstract: The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing due to its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian are linked to the entanglement growth and signal the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. We also point out that the static quantum Fisher information exhibits a non-perturbative behavior in the zero-coupling limit, which we justify with an analytic argument. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point, remaining robust under pure dephasing noise. Non-monotonic signatures of the quantum Fisher information matrix reflect changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.

Title: Decay of two-dimensional superfluid turbulence over pinning surface
Authors: Filip Novotný, Marek Talíř, Emil Varga
Abstract: We report on the free decay of quasi-two-dimensional turbulence in superfluid $^4$He confined within nanofluidic channels. Using a pump-probe technique, we observe a complex decay of the vortex density $L(t)$ that deviates from a simple power law. The decay exhibits a universal fast transient, scaling as $L\propto t^{-2}$, followed by a slower non-universal regime that depends on the geometry and flow conditions. We demonstrate that this behavior is governed by the interplay between vortex pinning on the disordered topography of the channel walls and the mobilizing effect of the weak probe flow. A numerical model that treats pinning as a velocity-dependent effective mutual friction successfully reproduces the essential features of our experimental observations.

Title: TACE: A unified Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Framework for Atomistic Machine Learning
Authors: Zemin Xu, Wenbo Xie, Daiqian Xie, P. Hu
Abstract: Here, we introduce the Tensor Atomic Cluster Expansion (TACE), a unified framework formulated entirely in Cartesian space, enabling systematic and consistent prediction of arbitrary structure-dependent tensorial properties. TACE achieves this by decomposing atomic environments into a complete hierarchy of irreducible Cartesian tensors, ensuring symmetry-consistent representations that naturally encode invariance and equivariance constraints. Beyond geometry, TACE incorporates universal embeddings that flexibly integrate diverse attributes including computational levels, charges, magnetic moments and field perturbations. This allows explicit control over external invariants and equivariants in the prediction process. Long-range interactions are also accurately described through the Latent Ewald Summation module within the short-range approximation, providing a rigorous yet computationally efficient treatment of electrostatic and dispersion effects. We demonstrate that TACE attains accuracy, stability, and efficiency on par with or surpassing leading equivariant frameworks across finite molecules and extended materials. This includes in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, spectra, Hessian, external-field responses, charged and magnetic systems, multi-fidelity training, heterogeneous catalysis, and even superior performance within the uMLIP benchmark. Crucially, TACE bridges scalar and tensorial modeling and establishes a Cartesian-space paradigm that unifies and extends beyond the design space of spherical-tensor-based methods. This work lays the foundation for a new generation of universal atomistic machine learning models capable of systematically capturing the rich interplay of geometry, fields and material properties within a single coherent framework.

Title: Adiabatic hydrodynamization and quasinormal modes of nonthermal attractors
Authors: Matisse De Lescluze, Michal P. Heller, Aleksas Mazeliauskas, Bruno Scheihing-Hitschfeld, Clemens Werthmann
Abstract: Nonthermal attractors govern the emergent self-similar dynamics of far-from-equilibrium quantum systems, from ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions to cold-atom experiments. Within the framework of adiabatic hydrodynamization, the approach to a nonthermal attractor is described by the decay of excited states of an effective Hamiltonian. Using an exactly solvable kinetic theory -- the longitudinally expanding, overoccupied gluon plasma dominated by small-angle elastic scattering -- we establish a direct correspondence between the eigenmodes of adiabatic hydrodynamization and the quasinormal mode spectrum of the nonthermal attractor. This equivalence suggests a general framework for identifying universal dynamical structures in nonequilibrium systems. As a byproduct, we derive analytic prescaling solutions for strongly longitudinally expanding systems.

Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character - which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements - and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum's Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.

Title: Variational Method in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Arthur Hutsalyuk, Márton Lájer, Giuseppe Mussardo, Andrea Stampiggi
Abstract: We develop a variational framework for addressing two-dimensional non-integrable quantum field theories through the exact structure of their integrable counterparts. Concentrating on the $\varphi^4$ Landau-Ginzburg model, we use the analytical Vacuum Expectation Values and Form Factors of local operators in the sinh-Gordon theory as the foundation of a variational ansatz. In this way, we obtain controlled estimates of central physical quantities of the $\varphi^4$ theory - such as the finite-volume ground-state energy and the physical mass as a function of the coupling constant. The strengths of the variational methods are leveraged in combination with the Hamiltonian truncation techniques and the LeClair-Mussardo formula, which also allow to probe the accuracy of the variational approximation varying the system size. Within the weak-coupling regime, a detailed numerical analysis reveals the behaviour of the finite-volume spectrum, the ground-state energy, and the elastic part of the scattering matrix, showing how the rigorous machinery of integrable models can serve as a guiding light into the complex landscape of non-integrable quantum field dynamics.

Title: Multiphase transport and compositional mixing mechanisms in twin-wire laser directed energy deposition: toward process stability and graded material fabrication
Authors: Yi Li, Yuhui Li, Jianzhao Wu, Luxuan Zhang, Maoyuan Li, Chaochao Wu, Zhenzhong Wang
Abstract: Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.

Title: Friendship-paradox paradox: Do most people's friends really have more friends than they do?
Authors: Sang Hoon Lee
Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.

Title: Extended regime of nematic order in an interacting monomer-dimer model of Heilmann and Lieb
Authors: Qidong He
Abstract: We revisit a two-dimensional model of liquid crystals introduced by Heilmann and Lieb (1979), which consists of a system of dimers on the square lattice at chemical potential $\lambda$, interacting via a hard-core repulsion and an attractive interaction of strength $-a<0$ between adjacent, colinear dimers. The model is conjectured to exhibit nematic order at low temperatures, in the sense of orientational symmetry breaking coupled with the absence of translational order, provided that $\lambda+a>0$. In this paper, we prove the conjecture under the additional condition that $3a>\lambda$, which corresponds physically to the regime where vacancies, as opposed to misaligned dimers, are the dominant mechanism for decorrelation, significantly extending the parameter regime under which the conjecture is known to hold. Our proof adapts the strategy of Hadas and Peled (2025) for proving the existence of a columnar phase in the hard-square model, combining a mesoscopic characterization of orientational order with the disagreement percolation method of van den Berg (1993) to prove the absence of translational order. To deal with the non-nearest neighbor interactions in the model, we also introduce an extension of the chessboard estimate applicable to finite products of periodic Gibbs measures.

Title: Polylogarithmic-Depth Quantum Algorithm for Simulating the Extended Hubbard Model on a Two-Dimensional Lattice Using the Fast Multipole Method
Authors: Yu Wang, Martina Nibbi, Maxine Luo, Isabel Nha Minh Le, Yanbin Chen, J. Ignacio Cirac, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: The extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional lattice captures key physical phenomena, but is challenging to simulate due to the presence of long-range interactions. In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.

Abstract: Fiber reinforcement and polymer matrix respond differently to manufacturing conditions due to mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion and matrix shrinkage during curing of thermosets. These heterogeneities generate residual stresses over multiple length scales, whose partial release leads to process-induced deformation (PID), requiring accurate prediction and mitigation via optimized non-isothermal cure cycles. This study considers a unidirectional AS4 carbon fiber/amine bi-functional epoxy prepreg and models PID using a two-mechanism framework that accounts for thermal expansion/shrinkage and cure shrinkage. The model is validated against manufacturing trials to identify initial and boundary conditions, then used to generate PID responses for a diverse set of non-isothermal cure cycles (time-temperature profiles). Building on this physics-based foundation, we develop a data-driven surrogate based on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). A DeepONet is trained on a dataset combining high-fidelity simulations with targeted experimental measurements of PID. We extend this to a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) DeepONet, where branch-network features are modulated by external parameters, including the initial degree of cure, enabling prediction of time histories of degree of cure, viscosity, and deformation. Because experimental data are available only at limited time instances (for example, final deformation), we use transfer learning: simulation-trained trunk and branch networks are fixed and only the final layer is updated using measured final deformation. Finally, we augment the framework with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) to quantify uncertainty under experimental conditions and to support optimization of cure schedules for reduced PID in composites.
