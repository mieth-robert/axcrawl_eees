Title: Spontaneous Emergence of Phase Coherence in a quasiparticle Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Malte Koster, Matthias R. Schweizer, Timo Noack, Vitaliy I. Vasyuchka, Dmytro A. Bozhko, Burkard Hillebrands, Mathias Weiler, Alexander A. Serga, Georg von Freymann
Abstract: Since their prediction by Einstein at the dawn of quantum mechanics, Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), owing to their property to show quantum phenomena on macroscopic scales, are drawing increasing attention across various fields in physics. They are the subject of many fascinating observations in various physical systems, from liquid helium to diluted atomic gases. In addition to real particles like atoms and composite bosons such as Cooper pairs or excitons, this phenomenon is also observed in gases of quasiparticles such as polaritons and magnons - quanta of spin-wave excitations in magnetic media. The fundamental property of the BEC state is its coherence, which is represented by a precisely defined phase of the corresponding wave function, which arises spontaneously and encompasses all particles gathered at the bottom of their spectrum. Until now, the BEC phase was only revealed in phenomena depending on the spatial phase difference, such as interference, second order coherence, and macroscopic BEC motions - supercurrents, superfluidity and Josephson oscillations. Here, we present a method for the direct time-domain measurement of the magnon BEC coherent state phase relative to an outside reference signal. We report the emergence of spontaneous coherence from a freely evolving magnon gas, which manifests as the condensation of magnons into a uniform precession state with minimal energy and a well-defined phase. These findings confirm all postulated fundamental properties of quasiparticle condensates, provide access to a new degree of freedom in such systems, and open up the possibility of information processing using microwave-frequency magnon BECs.

Title: Superconductivity in kagome metals due to soft loop-current fluctuations
Authors: Daniel J. Schultz, Grgur Palle, Yong Baek Kim, Rafael M. Fernandes, Jörg Schmalian
Abstract: We demonstrate that soft fluctuations of translation symmetry-breaking loop currents provide a mechanism for unconventional superconductivity in kagome metals that naturally addresses the multiple superconducting phases observed under pressure. Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.

Title: Superfluid stiffness of superconductors with delicate topology
Authors: Tijan Prijon, Sebastian D. Huber, Kukka-Emilia Huhtinen
Abstract: We consider superconductivity in two-dimensional delicate topological bands, where the total Chern number vanishes but the Brillouin zone can be divided into subregions with a quantized nontrivial Chern number. We formulate a lower bound on the geometric contribution to the superfluid weight in terms of the sum of the absolute values of these sub-Brillouin zone Chern numbers. We verify this bound in Chern dartboard insulators, where the delicate topology is protected by mirror symmetry. In iso-orbital models, where the mirror representation is the same along all high-symmetry lines, the lower bound increases linearly with the number of mirror planes. This work points to delicate bands as promising candidates for particularly stable superconductivity, especially in narrow bands where the kinetic energy is suppressed due to lattice effects.

Title: Exact downfolding and its perturbative approximation
Authors: Jonas B. Profe, Jakša Vučičević, P. Peter Stavropoulos, Malte Rösner, Roser Valentí, Lennart Klebl
Abstract: Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.

Title: Unveiling the Miniband Structure of Graphene Moiré Superlattices via Gate-dependent Terahertz Photocurrent Spectroscopy
Authors: Juan A. Delgado-Notario, Stephen R. Power, Wojciech Knap, Manuel Pino, JinLuo Cheng, Daniel Vaquero, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Jesús E. Velázquez-Pérez, Yahya M. Meziani, Pablo Alonso-González, José M. Caridad
Abstract: Moiré superlattices formed at the interface between stacked two-dimensional atomic crystals offer limitless opportunities to design materials with widely tunable properties and engineer intriguing quantum phases of matter. However, despite progress, precise probing of the electronic states and tantalizingly complex band textures of these systems remain challenging. Here, we present gate-dependent terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy as a robust technique to detect, explore and quantify intricate electronic properties in graphene moiré superlattices. Specifically, using terahertz light at different frequencies, we demonstrate distinct photocurrent regimes evidencing the presence of avoided band crossings and tiny (~1-20 meV) inversion-breaking global and local energy gaps in the miniband structure of minimally twisted graphene and hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures, key information that is inaccessible by conventional electrical or optical techniques. In the off-resonance regime, when the radiation energy is smaller than the gap values, enhanced zero-bias responsivities arise in the system due to the lower Fermi velocities and specific valley degeneracies of the charge carriers subjected to moiré superlattice potentials. In stark contrast, above-gap excitations give rise to bulk photocurrents -- intriguing optoelectronic responses related to the geometric Berry phase of the constituting electronic minibands. Besides their fundamental importance, these results place moiré superlattices as promising material platforms for advanced, sensitive and low-noise terahertz detection applications.

Title: Rigidity control of general origami structures
Authors: Rongxuan Li, Gary P. T. Choi
Abstract: Origami, the traditional paper-folding art, has inspired the modern design of numerous flexible structures in science and engineering. In particular, origami structures with different physical properties have been studied and utilized for various applications. More recently, several deterministic and stochastic approaches have been developed for controlling the rigidity or softness of the Miura-ori structures. However, the rigidity control of other origami structures is much less understood. In this work, we study the rigidity control of general origami structures via enforcing or relaxing the planarity condition of their polygonal facets. Specifically, by performing numerical simulations on a large variety of origami structures with different facet selection rules, we systematically analyze how the geometry and topology of different origami structures affect their degrees of freedom (DOF). We also propose a hypergeometric model based on the selection process to derive theoretical bounds for the probabilistic properties of the rigidity change, which allows us to identify key origami structural variables that theoretically govern the DOF evolution and thereby the critical rigidity percolation transition in general origami structures. Moreover, we develop a simple unified model that describes the relationship between the critical percolation density, the origami facet geometry, and the facet selection rules, which enables efficient prediction of the critical transition density for high-resolution origami structures. Altogether, our work highlights the intricate similarities and differences in the rigidity control of general origami structures, shedding light on the design of flexible mechanical metamaterials for practical applications.

Title: Speed of sound in dense simple liquids
Authors: Sergey Khrapak
Abstract: The speed of sound of simple dense fluids is shown to exhibit a pronounced freezing temperature scaling of the form $c_{\rm s}/v_{\rm T}\simeq \sqrt{\gamma} +\alpha (T_{\rm fr}/T)^{\beta}$, where $c_s$ is the speed of sound, $v_{\rm T}$ is the characteristic thermal velocity, $\gamma$ is the ideal gas heat capacity ratio, $T$ is the temperature, $T_{\rm fr}$ is the freezing temperature, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are dimensionless parameters. For the Lennard-Jones fluid we get $\gamma=5/3$, $\alpha\simeq 7$ with a weak temperature dependence, and $\beta = 1/3$. Similar scaling works in several real liquids, such as argon, krypton, xenon, nitrogen, and methane. In this case, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are substance-dependent fitting parameters. A comparison between the prediction of this freezing temperature scaling and a recent experimental measurement of the speed of sound in methane under conditions of planetary interiors is presented and discussed. The results provide a simple practical tool to estimate the speed of sound in regimes where no experimental data are yet available.

Title: Space-time crystals from particle-like topological solitons
Authors: Hanqing Zhao, Ivan I. Smalyukh
Abstract: Time crystals are unexpected states of matter that spontaneously break time translation symmetry either in a discrete or continuous manner. However, spatially-mesoscale space-time crystals that break both the space and time symmetries have not been reported. Here we report a continuous space-time crystal in a nematic liquid crystal driven by ambient-power, constant-intensity unstructured light. Our numerically constructed 4-dimensional configurations exhibit good agreement with these experimental findings. While meeting the established criteria to identify time-crystalline order, both experiments and computer simulations reveal a space-time crystallization phase formed by particle-like topological solitons. The robustness against temporal perturbations and spatiotemporal dislocations shows the stability and rigidity of the studied space-time crystals, which relates to their locally topological nature and many-body interactions between emergent spontaneously-twisted, particle-like solitonic building blocks. Their potential technological utility includes optical devices, photonic space-time crystal generators, telecommunications, and anti-counterfeiting designs, among others.

Title: Emergent discrete space-time crystal of Majorana-like quasiparticles in chiral liquid crystals
Authors: Hanqing Zhao, Rui Zhang, Ivan I. Smalyukh
Abstract: Time crystals spontaneously break the time translation symmetry, as recently has been frequently reported in quantum systems. Here we describe the observation of classical analogues of both 1+1-dimensional and 2+1-dimensional discrete space-time crystals in a liquid crystal system driven by a Floquet electrical signal. These classical time crystals comprise particle-like structural features and exists over a wide range of temperatures and electrical driving conditions. The phenomenon-enabling period-doubling effect comes from their topological Majorana-like quasiparticle features, where periodic inter-transformations of co-existing topological solitons and disclinations emerge in response to external stimuli and play pivotal roles. Our discrete space-time crystals exhibit robustness against temporal perturbations and spatial defects, behaving like a time-crystalline analogues of a smectic phase. Our findings show that the simultaneous symmetry breaking in time and space can be a widespread occurrence in numerous open systems, not only in quantum but also in a classical soft matter context.

Title: Modifying electronic and structural properties of 2D van der Waals materials via cavity quantum vacuum fluctuations: A first-principles QEDFT study
Authors: Hang Liu, Simone Latini, I-Te Lu, Dongbin Shin, Angel Rubio
Abstract: Structuring the photon density of states and light-matter coupling in optical cavities has emerged as a promising approach to modifying the equilibrium properties of materials through strong light-matter interactions. In this article, we employ state-of-the-art quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT) to study the modifications of the electronic and structural properties of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials by the cavity vacuum field fluctuations. We find that cavity photons modify the electronic density through localization along the photon polarization directions, a universal effect observed for all the 2D materials studied here. This modification of the electronic structure tunes the material properties, such as the shifting of energy valleys in monolayer h-BN and 2H-MoS$_2$, enabling tunable band gaps. Also, it tunes the interlayer spacing in bilayer 2H-MoS$_2$ and T$_\text{d}$-MoTe$_2$, allowing for adjustable ferroelectric, nonlinear Hall effect, and optical properties, as a function of light-matter coupling strength. Our findings open an avenue for engineering a broad range of 2D layered quantum materials by tuning vdW interactions through fluctuating cavity photon fields.

Title: Thermophysical and Mechanical Properties Prediction of Rear-earth High-entropy Pyrochlore Based on Deep-learning Potential
Authors: Yuxuan Wang, Guoqiang Lan, Huicong Chen, Jun Song
Abstract: High-entropy pyrochlore oxides possess ultra-low thermal conductivity and excellent high-temperature phase stability, making them promising candidate for next-generation thermal barrier coating (TBC) materials. However, reliable predictive models for such complex and disordered systems remain challenging. Ab initio methods, although accurate in describing anharmonic phonon-phonon interactions, struggle to capture the strong inherent phonon-disorder scattering in high-entropy systems. Moreover, the limited simulation cell size, hundreds of atoms, cannot fully represent the configurational complexity of high-entropy phases. On the other hand, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations lack accurate and transferable interatomic potentials, particularly in multi-component systems like high-entropy ceramics. In this work, we employed Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics (DPMD) to predict the thermophysical and mechanical properties of rare-earth high-entropy pyrochlore oxide system. The deep-potential (DP) model is trained on a limited dataset from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations, enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with on-the-fly potential evaluations. This model not only achieves high accuracy in reproducing ab initio results but also demonstrates strong generalizability, making it applicable to medium-entropy ceramics containing the same constituent elements. Our study successfully develops a deep potential model for rare-earth pyrochlore systems and demonstrates that the deep-learning-based potential method offers a powerful computational approach for designing high-entropy TBC materials.

Title: A Novel Discovery of Negative Thermal Expansion in Rare-earth Pyrochlore through Anion Order-Disorder Transition
Authors: Yuxuan Wang, Guoqiang Lan, Jun Song
Abstract: In this study, we report for the first time the occurrence and investigation of the negative thermal expansion (NTE) effect in rare-earth pyrochlores. It is found that the NTE originates from the migration of oxygen anions from 48f sites to 8b sites, where one-twelfth of the original anions gradually occupy half of the available oxygen vacancies. This initial rapid transition leads to the distortion and rotation of polyhedral units, effectively contracting the lattice and manifesting as macroscopic NTE. The transition is sensitive to external isotropic pressure, where increasing pressure delays the onset of anion migration. This study deepens our understanding of NTE in complex oxides and demonstrates the utility of deep learning potentials for exploring intricate structural behaviors.

Title: Dopant-induced stabilization of three-dimensional charge order in cuprates
Authors: Zheting Jin, Sohrab Ismail-Beigi
Abstract: We investigate the microscopic mechanisms behind the stabilization of three-dimensional (3D) charge order by Pr doping in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO7). Density-functional-theory calculations locate the lowest-energy Pr superlattices for both Ba- and Y-site substitution. In the Ba-site case, the smaller Pr ion pulls the surrounding atoms inward. This breathing-mode distortion pins charge-stripe walls to the Pr columns and forces them to align along the $c$ axis. Y-site Pr is larger than the host ion, produces an outward distortion, and fails to pin the stripes. Coarse-grained Monte-Carlo simulations show that the stripe correlation length rises in step with the structural correlation length of the Pr dopant as observed in prior experiments. We thus identify dopant-induced lattice pinning as the key mechanism behind 3D charge order in Pr-doped YBCO7. This approach provides quantitative guidelines for engineering electronic orders through targeted ionic substitution.

Title: Fast 4D-STEM-based phase mapping for amorphous and mixed materials
Authors: Andreas Werbrouck, Nikhila C. Paranamana, Xiaoqing He, Matthias J. Young
Abstract: All materials are made from atoms arranged either in repeating (crystalline) or in random (amorphous) structures. Diffraction measurements probe average distances between atoms and/or planes of atoms. A transmission electron microscope in scanning mode (STEM) can collect spatially resolved 2-dimensional diffraction data, effectively creating a 4-dimensional (4D) hyperspectral dataset (4D-STEM). Interpretation strategies for such 4D data are well-developed for crystalline materials, because their diffraction spectra show intense peaks, allowing for effective phase and crystal orientation mapping at the nanoscale. Yet, because of the continuous nature of the diffraction data for amorphous and mixed materials, it is challenging to separate different amorphous contributions. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) allows separation of 4D-STEM data into components with interpretable diffraction signatures and intensity maps, independent of the structure. However, NMF is a non-convex optimization problem and scales ~ O(nmk) with n the number of positions probed, m the number of diffraction features and k the number of components, making analysis of large 4D datasets inaccessible. Here, we apply QB decomposition as a preprocessing step for NMF (Randomized NMF or RNMF) to achieve scaling independent of the largest data dimension (~O(nk)), opening the door for NMF analysis of 4D-STEM data. We demonstrate our approach by mapping a thin TiO$_2$ layer on top of SiO$_2$, and a LiNi$_{0.6}$Co$_{0.2}$Mn$_{0.2}$O$_{2}$ (NMC) - Li$_{10}$GeP$_2$S$_{12}$ (LGPS) mixed crystalline-amorphous battery interface, illustrating strengths and limitations of using RNMF for structure-independent phase mapping in 4D-STEM experiments.

Title: Successive orthorhombic distortions in kagome metals by molecular orbital formation
Authors: Ryo Misawa, Shunsuke Kitou, Rinsuke Yamada, Tobi Gaggl, Ryota Nakano, Yudai Shibata, Yoshihiro Okamura, Markus Kriener, Yuiga Nakamura, Yoshichika Ōnuki, Youtarou Takahashi, Taka-hisa Arima, Milena Jovanovic, Leslie M. Schoop, Max Hirschberger
Abstract: The kagome lattice, with its inherent frustration, hosts a plethora of exotic phenomena, including the emergence of $3\mathbf{q}$ charge density wave order. The high rotational symmetry, required to realize such an unconventional charge order, is broken in many kagome materials by orthorhombic distortions at high temperature, the origin of which is much less discussed despite their ubiquity. In this study, synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals a structural phase transition from a parent hexagonal phase to an orthorhombic ground state, mediated by a critical regime of diffuse scattering in the prototypical kagome metals $R$Ru$_3$Si$_2$ ($R$=rare-earth). Structural analysis uncovers an interlayer dimerization of kagome atoms in the low-temperature phase. Accordingly, a dimer model with one-dimensional disorder on kagome layers successfully reproduces the diffuse scattering. The observations point to molecular orbital formation between kagome $4d_{z^2}$ orbitals as the driving force behind the transition, consistent with \textit{ab initio} calculations. A framework based on electronegativity and atomic radii is proposed to evaluate the stability of the hexagonal phase in kagome metals, guiding the design of highly symmetric materials.

Title: Defect-Mediated Aggregation and Motility-Induced Phase Separation in Active XY Model
Authors: Shun Inoue, Satoshi Yukawa
Abstract: We propose an ``active XY model'' that incorporates key elements of both the classical XY model and the Vicsek model to study the role of topological defects in active matter systems. This model features self-propelled particles with XY spin degrees of freedom on a lattice and introduces a self-propulsion parameter controlling the directional bias of particle motion. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that self-propulsion induces motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), where particles aggregate into clusters around topological defects with positive vortex charge. In contrast, negative charge defects tend to dissipate. We analyze the evolution of these clusters and show that their growth follows a two-stage exponential relaxation process, with characteristic time scaling as $\tau \sim L^{3}$ with the system size $L$, reminiscent of first-order phase separation in equilibrium systems. Our results highlight the important role of topological defects in phase separations and clustering behavior in active systems, bridging nonequilibrium dynamics and equilibrium theory.

Title: Exact solution of asymmetric gelation between three walks on the square lattice
Authors: Aleksander L Owczarek, Andrew Rechnitzer
Abstract: We find and analyse the exact solution of a model of three different polymers with asymmetric contact interactions in two dimensions, modelling a scenario where there are different types of polymers involved. In particular, we find the generating function of three directed osculating walks in star configurations on the square lattice with two interaction Boltzmann weights, so that there is one type of contact interaction between the top pair of walks and a different interaction between the bottom pair of walks. These osculating stars are found to be the most amenable to exact solution using functional equation techniques in comparison to the symmetric case where three friendly walks in watermelon configurations were successfully solved with the same techniques. We elucidate the phase diagram, which has four phases, and find the order of all the phase transitions between them. We also calculate the entropic exponents in each phase.

Title: Tunable spin-wave nonreciprocity in ferrimagnetic domain-wall channels
Authors: Tingting Liu, Shuhong Li, Yunlong Liu, Shuchao Qin, Yang Liu, Wenjun Wang, Minghui Qin
Abstract: The nonreciprocal propagation of spin waves (SWs) offers opportunities for developing novel functional magnonic logic devices, where controllability is crucial for magnetic signal processing. Domain walls act as natural waveguides due to their magnetic configuration, offering a platform for the in-depth investigation of nonreciprocal SW propagation and its manipulation. In this work, we theoretically and numerically investigate the tunable spin-wave nonreciprocity in ferrimagnetic domain-wall channels under the influence of an external field. It is revealed that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) exerts dual control over both nonreciprocal spin-wave propagation and spin-splitting phenomena. Moreover, SW nonreciprocity is magnetically tunable, with its sign reversibly switched by inverting the applied field direction, while preserving the host spin configuration. The orientation of the magnetic field can selectively stabilize or destabilize the domain wall structure, offering precise control over spin-wave nonreciprocity. Ultimately, we demonstrate a controllable SW transmission scheme via external magnetic field modulation, providing critical insights for the design of future magnonic devices.

Title: Time-hidden magnetic order in a multi-orbital Mott insulator
Authors: Xinwei Li, Iliya Esin, Youngjoon Han, Yincheng Liu, Hengdi Zhao, Honglie Ning, Cora Barrett, Jun-Yi Shan, Kyle Seyler, Gang Cao, Gil Refael, David Hsieh
Abstract: Photo-excited quantum materials can be driven into thermally inaccessible metastable states that exhibit structural, charge, spin, topological and superconducting orders. Metastable states typically emerge on timescales set by the intrinsic electronic and phononic energy scales, ranging from femtoseconds to picoseconds, and can persist for weeks. Therefore, studies have primarily focused on ultrafast or quasi-static limits, leaving the intermediate time window less explored. Here we reveal a metastable state with broken glide-plane symmetry in photo-doped Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ using time-resolved optical second-harmonic generation and birefringence measurements. We find that the metastable state appears long after intralayer antiferromagnetic order has melted and photo-carriers have recombined. Its properties are distinct from all known states in the equilibrium phase diagram and are consistent with intralayer ferromagnetic order. Furthermore, model Hamiltonian calculations reveal that a non-thermal trajectory to this state can be accessed via photo-doping. Our results expand the search space for out-of-equilibrium electronic matter to metastable states emerging at intermediate timescales.

Title: Altermagnetism and Weak Magnetism in the Insulating Distorted Perovskite Antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$
Authors: Hong-Suk Choi, M.-C. Jung, K.-H. Ahn, W. E. Pickett, K.-W. Lee
Abstract: The GdFeO$_3$-type perovskite antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$, calculated here to be altermagnetic for all three typical collinear antiferromagnetic orders, was suggested early on to be a Slater-type insulator, due in large part to its continuous metal-insulator transition and its small energy gap. Below the Néel temperature, the gap opens along with ``weak magnetism'', accompanied by a discontinuity in the magnetic susceptibility. Most other properties remain continuous. Without explicit correlation in the band structure calculation, and neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC), already a gap opens. Inclusion of a modest on-site Coulomb repulsion ($U\sim$ 1 eV) is sufficient to eliminate a SOC-induced small band overlap, reproducing the experimentally observed gap of several tens meV as reported earlier. This evidence supports the viewpoint that NaOsO$_3$ lies in an unusual crossover region between Slater and Mott insulator. The unreported altermagnetism in NaOsO$_3$ is demonstrated and its consequences are considered. The origin of the very weak magnetism has been investigated using a combination of {\it ab initio} calculations and symmetry analysis of the magnetic space group, confirming the origin lying in the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-orbit coupling buttressed by altermagnetic order. After determining the easy axis, our calculation leads to an Os spin canting angle of about 3$^{\circ}$, accounting for the observed weak magnetism and the resulting discontinuity in the susceptibility. The altermagnetism spin-split bands (up to $\sim$100 meV) result in a chiral-split magnon spectrum in both acoustic and optical modes in the THz range, and lead to significant anomalous Hall conductivity upon hole doping.

Authors: Daniel Sheinbaum, Omar Antolín Camarena
Abstract: We show how weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases on systems with a boundary are not in 1-to-1 correspondence with weak SPT phases on fully periodic systems, breaking the standard anomaly inflow interpretation of SPT phases. We further discuss the implications for the crystalline equivalence principle (CEP).

Title: Mott Criticality as the Confinement Transition of a Pseudogap-Mott Metal
Authors: Abhirup Mukherjee, S. R. Hassan, Anamitra Mukherjee, N. S. Vidhyadhiraja, A. Taraphder, Siddhartha Lal
Abstract: The phenomenon of Mott insulation involves the localization of itinerant electrons due to strong local repulsion. Upon doping, a pseudogap (PG) phase emerges - marked by selective gapping of the Fermi surface without conventional symmetry breaking in spin or charge channels. A key challenge is understanding how quasiparticle breakdown in the Fermi liquid gives rise to this enigmatic state, and how it connects to both the Mott insulating and superconducting phases. Here, we develop a renormalization-based construction of strongly correlated lattice models that captures the emergence of the pseudogap phase and its transition to a Mott insulator. Applying a many-body tiling scheme to the fixed-point impurity model uncovers a lattice model with electron interactions and Kondo physics. At half-filling, the interplay between Kondo screening and bath charge fluctuations in the impurity model leads to Fermi liquid breakdown. This reveals a pseudogap phase characterized by a non-Fermi liquid (the Mott metal) residing on nodal arcs, gapped antinodal regions of the Fermi surface, and an anomalous scaling of the electronic scattering rate with frequency. The eventual confinement of holon-doublon excitations of this exotic metal obtains a continuous transition into the Mott insulator. Our results identify the pseudogap as a distinct long-range entangled quantum phase, and offer a new route to Mott criticality beyond the paradigm of local quantum criticality.

Title: Phonon Dynamics of Topological Quantum Materials
Authors: Vivek Kumar
Abstract: The thesis presents a comprehensive Raman spectroscopic and first-principle density functional theory based investigation of V_(1-x)PS_(3) ; PbTaSe_(2) and 1T-TaS_(2). In V_(1-x)PS_(3),the detection of fractionalized excitations (Majorana fermions) suggests a potential Kitaev spin liquid phase, which becomes more pronounced as dimensionality decreases. Evidence of temperature-driven structural phase transition and topological surface phonons has been detected in PbTaSe_(2). TaS_(2) in 1T-phase reveals the presence of a hidden quantum state, a Mott-insulating phase, and a quantum spin liquid state. The observed phenomenon in these quantum systems makes them a promising candidate for advanced technologies such as quantum computing and communication.

Title: Group-I lead oxide X2PbO3 (X=Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) glass-like materials for energy applications: A hybrid-DFT study
Authors: R. Zosiamliana, Lalhriat Zuala, Lalrinthara Pachuau, Lalmuanpuia Vanchhawng, S. Gurung, A. Laref, D. P. Rai
Abstract: Pb-based compounds have garnered considerable theoretical and experimental attention due to their promising potential in energy-related applications. In this study, we explore the glass-like alkali metal lead oxides X2PbO3 (X=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and assess their suitability for piezoelectric and thermoelectric applications. First-principles calculations were performed using hybrid density functional theory (DFT), incorporating B3LYP, HSE06, and PBE0 functionals. Among these, PBE0 is identified as the most accurate, yielding lattice parameters in close agreement with experimental data. Structural stability was confirmed through evaluation of thermal, mechanical, and formation energies. For the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase Cmc21-X2PbO3 (X=K, Rb, Cs), piezoelectric constants were computed via both the numerical Berry phase (BP) method and the analytical Coupled Perturbed Hartree-Fock/Kohn-Sham (CPHF/KS) formalism. Notably, Cs2PbO3 exhibited a piezoelectric coefficient of e33 = 0.60 C m-2 (CPHF/KS), while K2PbO3 showed e32 = -0.51 Cm-2 (BP). Thermoelectric properties were investigated using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory within the rigid band approximation. The calculated thermoelectric performance reveals promising figures of merit (ZT), ranging from 0.3 to 0.63, suggesting these materials are applicable as future thermoelectric materials.

Title: Topological Zero Modes in Non-Hermitian Topolectrical Systems: Size and Impedance Control
Authors: S M Rafi-Ul-Islam, Zhuo Bin Siu, Md. Saddam Hossain Razo, Mansoor B.A. Jalil
Abstract: We investigate the size-dependent behavior of topological zero modes (TZMs) in finite non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains implemented on a topolectrical circuit platform. By deriving exact analytical solutions for the eigenenergies and band gaps of TZMs, we reveal their sensitivity to system size and non-Hermitian parameters, such as asymmetric coupling and onsite gain or loss. Our results show that non-Hermiticity enables the recovery of exactly zero-energy TZMs at a critical system size, unlike Hermitian systems where finite-size effects cause energy splitting. These zero-energy modes produce pronounced impedance peaks in the circuit's admittance spectrum, providing a measurable signature of topological states. Additionally, a tunable grounding capacitor enables precise control of TZM energies at a fixed resonance frequency, enhancing practical tunability. Our findings offer insights into finite-size effects in non-Hermitian topological systems and guide the design of robust, reconfigurable topolectrical circuits for sensing and energy transfer applications.

Title: Restricted Boltzmann machine as a probabilistic Enigma
Authors: Bin Chen, Weichao Yu
Abstract: We theoretically propose a symmetric encryption scheme based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines that functions as a probabilistic Enigma device, encoding information in the marginal distributions of visible states while utilizing bias permutations as cryptographic keys. Theoretical analysis reveals significant advantages including factorial key space growth through permutation matrices, excellent diffusion properties, and computational complexity rooted in sharp P-complete problems that resist quantum attacks. Compatible with emerging probabilistic computing hardware, the scheme establishes an asymmetric computational barrier where legitimate users decrypt efficiently while adversaries face exponential costs. This framework unlocks probabilistic computers' potential for cryptographic systems, offering an emerging encryption paradigm between classical and quantum regimes for post-quantum security.

Title: Coupling of magnetic and lattice collective excitations in the 2D van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS$_{3}$
Authors: Kartik Panda, Itzik Kapon, Dumitru Dumcenco, Dirk van der Marel, Alexey Kuzmenko, Nimrod Bachar
Abstract: We report a comprehensive magneto-optical investigation of FePS$_3$ single crystals using temperature-dependent polarized transmission spectroscopy and Faraday rotation measurements. Our data reveal pronounced in-plane anisotropy in both phonon and magnon excitations, emerging distinctly below the Néel temperature ($T_N \approx 118$ K). A prominent magnon mode at 122 cm$^{-1}$ exhibits characteristic redshifting with increasing temperature and field-induced splitting, confirming its magnetic origin. The optical conductivity, extracted via Drude-Lorentz modeling, shows polarization-sensitive spectral changes across the magnetic transition. The appearance of Raman-active modes in the infrared spectra, along with the observation of multiple phonons contributing to Faraday rotation, provides compelling evidence for spin-phonon coupling and inversion symmetry breaking in the magnetically ordered state. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between spin and lattice degrees of freedom in FePS$_3$, positioning it as a model system for exploring spin-lattice interactions in two-dimensional antiferromagnets.

Title: Mechanically and electrically switchable triferroic altermagnet in a pentagonal FeO2 monolayer
Authors: Deping Guo, Jiaqi Dai, Renhong Wang, Cong Wang, Wei Ji
Abstract: Two-dimensional multiferroics promise low-power, multifunctional devices, yet the intrinsic coexistence and mutual control of three coupled ferroic orders in a single layer remains elusive. Here, we identify pentagonal monolayer FeO$_2$ as an intrinsic triferroic altermagnet where ferroelectric (FE), ferroelastic (FA), and altermagnetic (AM) orders coexist and are tightly coupled, accompanied by a competing antiferroelectric (AFE) phase using first-principles calculations. The sole presence of glide mirror $M_x$ symmetry in a FeO$_2$ sublayer, with the breaking of four-fold rotation $C_{4z}$ symmetry, induces in-plane vector ferroelectricity and twin-related ferroelastic strains. Both FE and AFE phases break combined parity - time symmetry and display sizable altermagnetic spin splitting with Néel temperatures over 200~K. Electric-field-induced rotation of the FE polarization reverses the sign of the spin splitting, while in-plane uniaxial strain triggers ferroelastic switching that simultaneously rotates the FE polarization vector by $90^\circ$ and reverses the AM state. These electric-field- and strain-mediated pathways interlink six distinct polarization states that can be selected purely by electric fields and/or mechanical strain. This work extends intrinsic triferroicity to pentagonal monolayers and outlines a symmetry-based route toward mechanically and electrically configurable altermagnetic spintronics.

Title: Fingerprints of collective magnetic excitations in inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy
Authors: Finnian Rist, Henry L. Nourse, Ben J. Powell
Abstract: Spin-flip inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy allows magnetic materials to be probed at the single-atom level via scanning tunneling microscopy. Previously, the local spectral weight of spin excitations of small systems has been deduced from discrete steps in the differential conductance. However, this is not viable for large systems. We show that the local spin density of states can be measured via the double differential conductance. This contrasts with elastic measurements where the local density of electronic states is deduced from the differential conductance. We study the tunneling currents of the spin-1/2 and -1 Heisenberg chains and propose a method to probe zero-frequency modes.

Title: Role of temperature oscillation in growth of large-grain CdZnTe single crystal by traveling heater method
Authors: P. Vijayakumar, Subham Dhyani, K. Ganesan, R. Ramar, Edward Prabu Amaladass, R.M.Sarguna, S. Ganesamoorthy
Abstract: Self-nucleation in CdZnTe crystal growth remains a significant challenge, despite numerous attempts to achieve large-grain single crystals by restricting multi-nucleation during growth process using the traveling heater method. In this study, we present a novel approach to achieve large-grain CdZnTe single crystals by introducing temperature oscillations above the crystallization temperature during the growth process. This method effectively suppresses secondary nucleation and promotes the preferential selection of a single grain during early stage of growth as well as along the growth axis, by reducing multi-nucleation. By adjusting the amplitude and the number of temperature oscillations, we have successfully grown CdZnTe single crystals with dimensions of 20 mm in diameter and 60 mm in length. The resulting crystals exhibited excellent compositional homogeneity, with a nearly constant resistivity of ~ 10^9 Ohm-cm and Te inclusions smaller than 15 microns along the growth axis. Additionally, the crystal elements were of detector grade achieving an energy resolution of 4.5% for gamma radiation at 662 keV from a 137Cs source in a quasi-hemispherical geometry. This study highlights the critical role of temperature oscillations in controlling secondary nucleation and promoting the formation of large-grain single crystals.

Title: Beyond symmetry protection: Robust feedback-enforced edge states in non-Hermitian stacked quantum spin Hall systems
Authors: Mengjie Yang, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that strongly coupling two QSH layers yields a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase and no protected topological edge states. We demonstrate that, in a regime with intermediate inter-layer coupling (neither in the strong or weak coupling regimes) and competitive non-Hermitian directed amplification, bulk modes are suppressed while arbitrary bulk excitations inevitably accumulate into robust helical edge transport modes - without relying on any symmetry protection. Our feedback-enforced mechanism persists over broad parameter ranges and remains robust even on fractal or irregular boundaries. These findings challenge the traditional view of stacked QSH insulators as inevitably trivial, and open up new avenues for designing helical topological devices that exploit feedback-enforced non-Hermitian engineering, instead of symmetry-enforced robustness.

Title: Dissociation of one-dimensional excitons by static electric field
Authors: Adriana García, Alexander López, Jorge Quereda, Francisco Domínguez-Adame
Abstract: The quantum states of an electron-hole pair in one-dimensional semiconductors under a static electric field are theoretically analyzed using a two-band model with on-site Coulomb interaction. In the absence of static field, the electron and hole are always bound, forming an exciton regardless of the Coulomb interaction strength, in contrast to what occurs in higher-dimensional semiconductors. The static field modifies the wave function of the electron-hole pair, turning bound states into continuum states. However, at low static fields, the linear optical spectra resemble those of the unbiased semiconductor, exhibiting a quadratic redshift of the main exciton absorption line as the field increases. When the static field exceeds a critical threshold, the exciton dissociates and the linear optical spectra exhibit signatures of the Wannier-Stark ladder with squally spaced peaks, making them a valuable tool for experimentally probing exciton dissociation.

Title: pH-dependent interfacial rheology of polymer membranes assembled at liquid-liquid interfaces using hydrogen bonds

Abstract: Self-assembly of polymers at liquid interfaces using non-covalent interactions has emerged as a promising technique to reversibly produce self-healing membranes. Besides the assembly process, it is also crucial to control the mechanical properties of these membranes. Here, we measure the interfacial rheological properties of PMAA-PPO (polymethacrylic acidpolypropylene oxide) polymer membranes assembled using hydrogen bonds at liquid-oil interfaces. Varying the pH enables us to modify the degree of ionization of the PMAA chains, and hence their ability to establish hydrogen interactions with PPO. Frequency sweeps of the interfacial layers show a crossover between a viscous regime at low frequencies and an elastic regime at high frequencies. The crossover elastic modulus decreases by half after one hour of the experiment over the pH range investigated, which can be accounted for by a decrease of the layer thickness as pH increases. Furthermore we find that the crossover frequency varies exponentially with the degree of ionization of PMAA. To account for these observations, we propose a simple picture where the short PPO chains behave as non-covalent cross-linkers that bridge several PMAA chains. The dissociation rate and hence the crossover frequency are controlled by the number of PO units per PPO chain involved in the hydrogen bonds.

Title: Giant Damping-like Torque Efficiency via Synergistic Spin Hall and enhanced Orbital Hall Effects
Authors: Subhakanta Das, Sabpreet Bhatti, Ramu Maddu, Bilal Jamshed, Go Dong Wook, S.N. Piramanayagam
Abstract: Current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) has emerged as a promising method for achieving energy-efficient magnetisation switching in advanced spintronic devices. Over the past two decades, researchers have primarily focused on enhancing spin current generation through the spin Hall effect, relying predominantly on the spin degree of freedom (DoF) of the electron, while neglecting its orbital counterpart. Orbital Hall effect depends critically on the crystallinity and the interface between the orbital Hall layer and the orbital-to-spin conversion layer. However, most experimental works on orbital Hall effect relied on polycrystalline films with no special attention to improve the crystallographic texture. In this work, we have grown the Ru layer on a NiW seedlayer, which helped to improve the crystallographic texture, thereby enhancing the switching efficiency by over 44%. Such a huge increase in switching efficiency was achieved by (i) improving crystallographic texture and (ii) leveraging both spin and orbital DoFs. Our study underscores the potential for improving the spin-torque efficiency by combining interface engineering, orbital and spin Hall effects to drive next-generation spintronics.

Title: Symmetry re-breaking in an effective theory of quantum coarsening
Authors: Federico Balducci, Anushya Chandran, Roderich Moessner
Abstract: We present a simple theory accounting for two central observations in a recent experiment on quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable quantum simulator [T. Manovitz et al., Nature 638, 86 (2025)]: an apparent speeding up of the coarsening process as the phase transition is approached; and persistent oscillations of the order parameter after quenches within the ordered phase. Our theory, based on the Hamiltonian structure of the equations of motion in the classical limit of the quantum model, finds a speeding up already deep within the ordered phase, with subsequent slowing down as the domain wall tension vanishes upon approaching the critical line. Further, the oscillations are captured within a mean-field treatment of the order parameter field. For quenches within the ordered phase, small spatially-varying fluctuations in the initial mean-field lead to a remarkable long-time effect, wherein the system dynamically destroys its long-range order and has to coarsen to re-establish it. We term this phenomenon symmetry re-breaking, as the resulting late-time magnetization can have a sign opposite to the initial magnetization.

Title: Dynamic correlations in Calogero-Sutherland model
Authors: G. Lleopart Motis, D. M. Gangardt, M. Pustilnik, G. E. Astrakharchik
Abstract: The Calogero-Sutherland model represents a paradigmatic example of an integrable quantum system with applications ranging from cold atoms to random matrix theory. Combining sum rules with the Monte Carlo technique, we introduce a stochastic method that allows one to compute the dynamic structure factor and obtain an exact description of excitations beyond the conventional Luttinger liquid regime. We explore a broad range of interaction regimes, including weak interactions, where a Bogoliubov-type spectrum emerges, the Tonks-Girardeau regime, where excitations resemble those of an ideal Fermi gas, and strong interactions, where umklapp scattering leads to a Brillouin zone structure, typical of a crystal. Additionally, we discuss the connection between the hydrodynamic description of one-dimensional quantum gases, liquids, and solids with the Calogero-Sutherland wave function. The model's universality extends beyond atoms in waveguides, with implications for disordered systems and random matrix theory.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo simulation of light and superlight bipolarons in extended Hubbard-Holstein models on face- and body-centered-cubic lattices
Authors: G.D. Adebanjo, J.P. Hague, P.E. Kornilovitch
Abstract: Superlight pairing of bipolarons driven by electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) in face-center-cubic (FCC) and body-center-cubic (BCC) lattices is investigated using a continuous-time path-integral quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm. The EPIs are of the Holstein and extended Holstein types, and a Hubbard interaction is also included. The number of phonons associated with the bipolaron, inverse mass, and radius are calculated and used to construct a phase diagram for bipolaron pairing (identifying the regions of pairing into intersite bipolarons and onsite bipolarons). From the inverse mass it is determined that for the extended interaction, there is a region of light pairing associated with intersite bipolarons formed in both BCC and FCC lattices. Intersite bipolarons in the extended model at large phonon frequency and large Coulomb repulsion become superlight due to first order hopping effects. The transition temperature of Bose--Einstein condensates of these pairs is estimated. It is determined that intersite bipolarons are associated with regions of high transition temperatures.

Title: Revisiting the Impact of Single-Vacancy Defects on Electronic Properties of Graphene
Authors: Mohammadamir Bazrafshan, Thomas. D. Kühne
Abstract: While defects are generally considered to be unavoidable in experiments, engineering them is also a way of manipulating the physical properties of materials. In this study, the role of periodically arranged single vacancy defects in graphene is studied using the tight-binding method. Our numerical results show that single vacancy (SV) defects can exhibit predictable electronic behavior when they reside on the same sublattices (SS), following the armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) electronic band structure depending on the spacing between SVs. AGNRs are known to their tunable electronic band gap. However, when they are located on different sublattices (DS), the interaction between the defect-induced states becomes strong and can introduce anisotropy into the electronic band structure, demonstrating that the relative position of the SVs can also act as an additional degree of freedom for tuning the electronic properties. Interestingly, the behavior is independent of the density of SVs; for a system fully defected with SVs, the electronic properties depend heavily on the sublattices involved. The results provide a novel insight into sublattice-based defect engineering.

Title: From shallow to full wrapping: geometry and deformability dictate lipid vesicle internalization
Authors: Stijn van der Ham, Alexander Brown, Halim Kusumaatmaja, Hanumantha Rao Vutukuri
Abstract: The deformability of vesicles critically influences their engulfment by lipid membranes, a process central to endocytosis, viral entry, drug delivery, and intercellular transport. While theoretical models have long predicted this influence, direct experimental validation has remained elusive. Here, we combine experiments with continuum simulations to quantify how vesicle deformability affects the engulfment of small giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) by larger GUVs under depletion-induced adhesion. Using 3D confocal reconstructions, we extract vesicle shape, curvature, wrapping fraction, and the bendo-capillary length, a characteristic length scale that balances membrane bending and adhesion forces. We find that when vesicle size exceeds this length scale, engulfment is primarily governed by geometry. In contrast, when vesicle size is comparable to this scale, deformability strongly affects the transition between shallow, deep, and fully wrapped states, leading to suppression of full engulfment of vesicles. These findings connect theoretical predictions with direct measurements and offer a unified framework for understanding vesicle-mediated uptake across both synthetic and biological systems, including viral entry, synthetic cell design, drug delivery, and nanoparticle internalization.

Title: Pressure-tunable phase transitions in atomically thin Chern insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
Authors: Albin Marffy, Endre Tovari, Yu-Fei Liu, Anyuan Gao, Tianye Huang, Laszlo Oroszlany, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Su-Yang Xu, Peter Makk, Szabolcs Csonka
Abstract: Topological insulators lacking time-reversal symmetry can exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Odd-layer thick MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is a promising platform due to its intrinsic magnetic nature, however, quantization is rarely observed in it. Our magnetoresistance measurements in the anti-ferromagnetic phase indicate, instead of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator, the presence of a trivial insulator state likely due to disorder, while at high magnetic field a Chern insulator state appears. By applying hydrostatic pressure we are able to tune the magnetic interactions and the characteristic energy scales in the phase diagram. The trivial band gap is reduced, suggesting the role of disorder decreases with the compression of the layers.

Title: Chiral lone-pair helices with handedness coupling to electric-strain fields
Authors: C. R. Zeiger, R. S. Dragland, R. Sjökvist, R. Beanland, D. Meier, T. Grande, M. S. Senn, O. G. Grendal
Abstract: Ferrochiral materials with an achiral-to-chiral phase transition and switchable chirality have unique application opportunities, enabling control of the angular momentum of circularly polarized lattice vibrations (chiral phonons) and chirality-related electronic phenomena. Materials that fall into this class are, however, extremely rare, and often accompanied by other types of ferroic order that interfere with the ferrochiral responses. In this work, we demonstrate ferrochirality in two tetragonal tungsten bronzes, K4Bi2Nb10O30 and Rb4Bi2Nb10O30. Using high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with transmission electron microscopy, we solve the incommensurately modulated and chiral structures. Temperature dependent X-ray powder diffraction reveals that both materials undergo an achiral-to-chiral phase transition from P4/mbm to P4212(00{\gamma})q00. The chirality originates from a cooperative helical displacement of Bi3+ atoms perpendicular to the c direction and represents the primary order parameter. As a secondary effect of the ferrochiral order, a spatially varying piezoelectric response is observed, consistent with the polycrystalline nature of the investigated materials. Through invariant analysis, an external electric-strain-field coupling with the piezoelectricity is proposed as a conjugate field for switching chirality, establishing tetragonal tungsten bronzes as a versatile playground for the emergent field of ferrochirality.

Title: Spin-dependent Off-Axis Holography in Magnetic Environments
Authors: Nejc Blaznik, Dries van Oosten, Peter van der Straten
Abstract: Nondestructive spin-resolved imaging of ultracold atomic gases requires calculating the differences of the refractive indices seen by two circular probe polarizations. Perfect overlap of the two images, corresponding to two different polarizations, is required well below the feature size of interest. In this paper, we demonstrate that the birefringence of atoms in magnetic field gradients results in polarization-dependent aberrations in the image, which deteriorates the overlap. To that end, we develop a model that couples atomic tensor polarizability with position-dependent spin orientation and yields aberration predictions for accumulated phase shifts in arbitrary field geometries. Applied to data from an ultra-cold atomic cloud trapped in a Ioffe-Pritchard trap, the model quantitatively reproduces the observed distortion across a range of temperatures. A residual offset of $\sim1\;\mu\mathrm{m}$ remains even under uniform field conditions, likely due to optical asymmetries. For images obtained through off-axis holography, the full complex field of the probe enables post-processing removal of all magnetically induced aberrations through a single numerically calculated Fourier-space phase mask.

Title: Universality of Alpha-Relaxation in Glasses
Authors: Valeriy V. Ginzburg, Oleg Gendelman, Riccardo Casalini, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: In the vicinity of the glass transition, the characteristic relaxation time (e.g., the alpha-relaxation time in dielectric spectroscopy) of a glass-former exhibits a strongly super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, as compared to the classical Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures. A comprehensive description of both regions thus requires five parameters. Here, we demonstrate that many glass-formers exhibit a universal scaling, with only two material-specific parameters setting the timescale and the temperature scale; the other three being universal constants. Furthermore, we show that the master curve can be described by the recently developed two-state, two-(time) scale (TS2) theory (Soft Matter 2020, 16, 810) and regress the universal TS2 parameters. We also show the connection between the TS2 model and the Hall-Wolynes elastic relaxation theory.

Title: Magnetic-Field Tunable Möbius and Higher-Order Topological Insulators in Three-Dimensional Layered Octagonal Quasicrystals
Authors: Yuxiao Chen, Zhiming Xu, Citian Wang, Huaqing Huang
Abstract: We propose that three-dimensional layered octagonal quasicrystals can host magnetic-field-tunable Möbius insulators and various higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), enabled by the interplay of quasicrystalline symmetry and magnetic order. By constructing a minimal model based on stacked Ammann-Beenker tilings with magnetic exchange coupling and octagonal warping, we demonstrate that an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) configuration yields a topological phase protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry $\mathcal{S}=\mathcal{T}\tau_{1/2}$. Breaking $\mathcal{S}$ via an in-plane magnetic field induced canting of the AFM order while preserving a nonsymmorphic glide symmetry $\mathcal{G}_n=\tau_{1/2}\mathcal{M}_n$ leads to Möbius-twisted surface states, realizing a Möbius insulator in an aperiodic 3D system. Furthermore, we show that the quasicrystal with a general magnetic configuration supports multiple HOTI phases characterized by distinct hinge mode configurations that can be switched by rotating the magnetic field. A low-energy effective theory reveals that these transitions are driven by mass kinks between adjacent surfaces. Our work establishes a platform for realizing symmetry-protected topological phases unique to quasicrystals and highlights the tunability of hinge and surface states via magnetic control.

Title: The Influence of Electric Field on the Anisotropic Dispersion of the Flexocoupling Induced Phonons and Ferrons in Van der Waals Ferrielectrics
Authors: Anna N. Morozovska, Eugene A. Eliseev, Yujie Zhu, Yulian M. Vysochanskii, Venkatraman Gopalan, Long-Qing Chen, Jia-Mian Hu
Abstract: As has been shown recently, the influence of the flexoelectric coupling (shortly "flexocoupling") on the fluctuations of electric polarization and elastic strains can lead to the principal changes of the dispersion law of soft optical and acoustic phonons (shortly "flexophonons") and ferrons (shortly "flexoferrons") in van der Waals ferrielectrics. Analytical results, derived in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, revealed that the dispersion of flexophonons and flexoferrons is strongly anisotropic and should depend on the magnitude and direction of applied electric field. In this work we study the influence of applied electric field on the anisotropic dispersion of the flexophonons and flexophonons in a uniaxial van der Waals ferrielectric CuInP2S6. We reveal that the frequency of acoustic flexophonons and flexoferrons tends to zero at nonzero wavevectors under increase of applied electric field. We relate the changes with a possible appearance of a spatially modulated incommensurate polar phase induced by the flexocoupling in external field. The critical strength of flexocoupling is determined by the magnitude of electric field and direction of the wavevector. This allows us to propose a method for estimating the strength of flexocoupling in van der Waals ferrielectrics, providing that the frequency of the acoustic flexophonon is zeroing at the threshold value of the electric field. Since the flexoelectric coefficients are poorly known in van der Waals ferrielectrics, obtained analytical results can be useful for their flexo-engineering.

Title: Exact results for active particle models: from long-range interactions to first-passage properties
Authors: Léo Touzo
Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to obtain new exact results for models of active particles in one dimension, focusing on two different aspects: their behavior in the presence of long-range interactions and their first-passage properties. In the first part we give an overview of existing exact results both for active particle models and for Brownian particles with long-range interactions (Riesz gases). The next two parts focus on how methods from these two fields can be combined and extended to derive new results for models of active particles with long-range interactions. In part two, we study the density of particles in the stationary state, in the limit where the number of particles is very large, using an extension of the Dean-Kawasaki equation to run-and-tumble particles (RTPs). In the case of the 1D Coulomb interaction (attractive or repulsive), we obtain exact expressions for the stationary density for different types of confining potentials, which sheds lights on new non-equilibrium phase-transitions. Some results are also obtained for a repulsive 2D Coulomb interaction (log-gas), although the single-file constraint makes the study more difficult in this case. In part three, we focus on the fluctuations at the tagged particle level. In the limit of weak noise, we compute exactly and analyze in different regimes a variety of correlation functions of the particle positions and interparticle distances, both for the Brownian Riesz gas and for its active counterpart, and show that the activity plays an important role both at short times and at small distances. The last part of this thesis focuses on Siegmund duality, which connects the first-passage properties of a stochastic process with absorbing boundaries to its spatial distribution with hard walls. We extend this duality to a new class of stochastic processes, which includes active particles and diffusing diffusivity models.

Title: Graph Neural Network Approach to Predicting Magnetization in Quasi-One-Dimensional Ising Systems
Authors: V. Slavin, O. Kryvchikov, D. Laptev
Abstract: We present a graph-based deep learning framework for predicting the magnetic properties of quasi-one-dimensional Ising spin systems. The lattice geometry is encoded as a graph and processed by a graph neural network (GNN) followed by fully connected layers. The model is trained on Monte Carlo simulation data and accurately reproduces key features of the magnetization curve, including plateaus, critical transition points, and the effects of geometric frustration. It captures both local motifs and global symmetries, demonstrating that GNNs can infer magnetic behavior directly from structural connectivity. The proposed approach enables efficient prediction of magnetization without the need for additional Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Coincidence double-tip scanning tunneling spectroscopy
Authors: Yuehua Su, Guoya Zhang, Dezhong Cao, Chao Zhang
Abstract: The development of new experimental techniques for direct measurement of many-body correlations is crucial for unraveling the mysteries of strongly correlated electron systems. In this work, we propose a coincidence double-tip scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) that enables direct probing of spatially resolved dynamical two-body correlations of sample electrons. Unlike conventional single-tip scanning tunneling microscopy, the double-tip STS employs a double-tip scanning tunneling microscope (STM) equipped with two independently controlled tips, each biased at distinct voltages ($V_1$ and $V_2$). By simultaneously measuring the quantum tunneling currents $I_1(t)$ and $I_2(t)$ at locations $j_1$ and $j_2$, we obtain a coincidence tunneling current correlation $\overline{\langle I_1(t) I_2(t)\rangle}$. Differentiating this coincidence tunneling current correlation with respect to the two bias voltages yields a coincidence dynamical conductance. Through the development of a nonequilibrium theory, we demonstrate that this coincidence dynamical conductance is proportional to a contour-ordered second-order current correlation function. For the sample electrons in a nearly free Fermi liquid state, the coincidence dynamical conductance captures two correlated dynamical electron propagation processes: (i) from $j_1$ to $j_2$ (or vice versa) driven by $V_1$, and (ii) from $j_2$ to $j_1$ (or vice versa) driven by $V_2$. For the sample electrons in a superconducting state, additional propagation channels emerge from the superconducting condensate, coexisting with the above normal electron propagation processes. Thus, the coincidence double-tip STS provides direct access to spatially resolved dynamical two-body correlations, offering a powerful tool for investigating strongly correlated electron systems.

Title: Hydrogen modes in KDP under pressure from ab initio calculation and inelastic neutron scattering
Authors: V. A. Abalmasov, A. S. Ivanov, R. A. Sadykov, A. V. Belushkin
Abstract: The nature of the phonon triplet in the region of OH-stretching modes in hydrogen-bonded materials is often explained by the interplay of OH-stretching modes and combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes. In order to elucidate the both contributions in KDP, we compare the pressure dependence of the OH-bending and stretching modes from ab initio calculation and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. The ab initio calculation predicts a hardening of OH-bending modes and a softening of OH-stretching modes with pressure. At the same time, INS measurements in the region of OH-stretching modes indicate a hardening of the phonon triplet together with the bending modes. This means that this triplet in INS measurements is mainly due to combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes, while the intensity of OH-stretching modes appears to be relatively low. This conclusion may also apply to other hydrogen-bonded materials.

Title: Sliding multiferrocity in van der Waals layered CrI$_2$
Authors: Hui-Shi Yu, Xiao-Sheng Ni, Kun Cao
Abstract: Understanding magnetoelectric coupling in emerging van der Waals multiferroics is crucial for developing atomically thin spintronic devices. Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of magnetoelectric coupling in orthorhombic CrI$_2$. Monte Carlo simulations based on DFT-calculated magnetic exchange interactions suggest a proper-screw helimagnetic ground state with a Néel temperature consistent with experimental observations. A ferroelectric switching pathway driven by interlayer sliding is predicted, featuring a low switching energy barrier and out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization. To quantitatively characterize the magnetoelectric effect in orthorhombic CrI$_2$ and its microscopic origin, we evaluate the spin-driven polarization using the paramagnetic phase as a reference alongside the magnetoelectric tensor method. The extracted spin-driven polarization aligns along the $z$-axis, with its origin dominated by the exchange-striction mechanism. Although in-plane components of the total polarization in the bulk vanish due to global symmetry constraints, each CrI$_2$ single layer exhibits local electric polarization along the $x$ direction, arising from the generalized spin-current mechanism, which couples spin chirality to the electric polarization. As a result, we further predict that a proper-screw helimagnetic state may persist in monolayer CrI$_2$, with its charity reversable by switching the in-plane electric polarization through applying external electric field, providing another promising candidate for electrical control of two-dimensional multiferroics.

Title: Atomistic modeling of uranium monocarbide with a machine learning interatomic potential
Authors: Lorena Alzate-Vargas, Kashi N. Subedi, Roxanne M. Tutchton, Michael W.D. Cooper, Tammie Gibson, Richard A. Messerly
Abstract: Uranium monocarbide (UC) is an advanced ceramic fuel candidate due to its superior uranium density and thermal conductivity compared to traditional fuels. To accurately model UC at reactor operating conditions, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using an active learning procedure to generate a comprehensive training dataset capturing diverse atomic configurations. The resulting MLIP predicts structural, elastic, thermophysical properties, defect formation energies, and diffusion behaviors, aligning well with experimental and theoretical benchmarks. This work significantly advances computational methods to explore UC, enabling efficient large-scale and long-time molecular dynamics simulations essential for reactor fuel qualification.

Title: Using optical tweezers to simultaneously trap, charge and measure the charge of a microparticle in air

Abstract: Optical tweezers are widely used as a highly sensitive tool to measure forces on micron-scale particles. One such application is the measurement of the electric charge of a particle, which can be done with high precision in liquids, air, or vacuum. We experimentally investigate how the trapping laser itself can electrically charge such a particle, in our case a $\sim 1\,\mathrm{\mu m\;SiO_2}$ sphere in air. We model the charging mechanism as a two-photon process which reproduces the experimental data with high fidelity.

Title: Interaction between Rydberg Excitons in Cuprous Oxide Revealed through Second Harmonic Generation
Authors: Dirk Semkat, Heinrich Stolz, Peter Grünwald, Andreas Farenbruch, Nikita V. Siverin, Dietmar Fröhlich, Dmitri R. Yakovlev, Manfred Bayer
Abstract: We report experimental and theoretical investigations of interacting excitons of the yellow series in cuprous oxide (Cu$_2$O) with principal quantum numbers up to $n=7$ by means of second harmonic generation (SHG). Using picosecond pulsed laser excitation up to 10 GW/cm$^2$ peak intensity we observe a pronounced change of the spectra with increasing pump laser intensity: an energetic shift to lower absolute energies and a spectral broadening, while the absolute intensity for low powers scales with the square of the pump power, but saturates at higher powers. Concomitant with SHG we determined the density of the excitons excited by the ps pulse by measuring the two-photon absorption directly. This allows to derive quantitative values for the exciton-exciton interaction. Surprisingly, the results disagree both in magnitude and scaling with principal quantum number with those calculated by state-of-the art atomic-like van der Waals interaction theory. As a possible screening by an electron-hole plasma created by three-photon absorption into blue and violet band states could be ruled out, our results point toward fundamental differences between excitons and atoms.

Authors: I. V. Kozlov, Yu. A. Kolesnichenko
Abstract: Properties of the boundary of two conductors in a quantizing magnetic field are studied: with conventional Dirac charge carriers and so-called pseudospin-1 fermions, which are realized in graphene-like and Lieb lattices respectively. It is shown that edge states arise that relate the properties of conductors to the trivial and nontrivial Berry phase. These edge states lead to the appearance of a characteristic series of root features in the density of states.

Title: Quantum superposition in ultra-high mobility 2D photo-transport
Authors: Jesus Inarrea
Abstract: We investigate the striking properties that magnetoresistance of irradiated two-dimensional electron systems presents when their mobility is ultrahigh and temperature is low (T =0.5 K). Such as, an abrupt magnetoresistance collapse at low magnetic field and a resonance peak shift to the second harmonic (2wc = w), wc and w being the cyclotron and radiation frequencies respectively. We appeal to the principle of quantum superposition of coherent states and obtain that Schrodinger cat states (even and odd) are key to explain magnetoresistance at these extreme mobilities. On the one hand, the Schodinger cat states system oscillates with 2wc, thus being responsible of the resonance peak shift. On the other hand, we obtain that Schrodinger cat states-based scattering processes give rise to a destructive effect when the odd states are involved, leading to a magnetoresistance collapse. The Aharonov-Bohm effect plays a central role in the latter, turning even cat states into odd ones. We show that ultra-high mobility two-dimensional electron systems could make a promising bosonic mode-based platform for quantum computing.

Title: Design Principles and Identification of Birefringent Materials
Authors: Gwan Yeong Jung, Guodong Ren, Pravan Omprakash, Jayakanth Ravichandran, Rohan Mishra
Abstract: Birefringence ($\Delta n$) is the dependence of the refractive index of a material on the polarization of light travelling through it. Birefringent materials are used as polarizers, waveplates, and for novel light-matter coupling. While several birefringent materials exist, only a handful of them show large $\Delta n$ > 0.3, and are primarily limited to the infrared region. The variation of $\Delta n$ across diverse materials classes and strategies to achieve highly birefringent materials with transparency covering different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum are missing. We have calculated the $\Delta n$ of 967 non-cubic, formable crystals having vastly different structures, polyhedral connectivity and chemical compositions. From this set of compounds, we have screened highly birefringent crystals ($\Delta n$ greater than 0.3) having transparency in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The screened compounds belong to several families such as A3'MN3, AMO2, AN3, and A'N6 (A = Li, Na, K; A'= Ca, Sr, Ba; M = V, Nb, Ta). By analyzing the electronic structures of these compounds, we have distilled rules to enable the design of crystals with large $\Delta n$.

Title: Giant Spin-to-Charge Conversion by Tailoring Magnetically Proximitized Topological Dirac Semimetal
Authors: Masayuki Ishida, Soichiro Fukuoka, Takahiro Chiba, Yohei Kota, Masaaki Tanaka, Le Duc Anh
Abstract: While ferromagnet and topological material bilayers are widely studied to obtain efficient spin charge conversion via topological surface states (TSS), the influence of the magnetic proximity effect (MPE) on the TSS evolution and conversion efficiency remains poorly understood. In this study, we experimentally probe and reveal the behavior of spin momentum locked TSS through spin pumping measurements in heterostructures composed of ferromagnetic Fe and the topological Dirac semimetal alpha Sn. As the alpha Sn thickness (tSn) increases from 9 to 35 nm, the Gilbert damping constant of the Fe layer exhibits a pronounced peak at tSn = 25 nm, followed by a decrease at greater thicknesses. Our rigorous theoretical analysis, combining analytical modeling and first principles calculations, attributes this behavior to the TSS disappearance at the Fe and alpha Sn interface and exchange gap opening on the opposite surface, both induced by the long range MPE and its influence on the spin charge conversion efficiency. At tSn = 25 nm, we demonstrate highly efficient spin charge conversion with an inverse Edelstein length of 3.14 nm, the highest value reported at room temperature for ferromagnet and topological material bilayers. These findings underscore the critical role of tuning TSS properties under MPE for advancing topological materials in spintronic applications.

Title: Fragility of Topology under Electronic Correlations in Iron Chalcogenides
Authors: Younsik Kim, Junseo Yoo, Sehoon Kim, Kiyohisa Tanaka, Li Yu, Minjae Kim, Changyoung Kim
Abstract: The interplay between electronic correlations and topology is a central topic in the study of quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the impact of the orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP) on the topological properties of FeTe1-xSex (FTS), an iron chalcogenide superconductor known to host both non-trivial Z2 topology and strong electronic correlations. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we track the evolution of topological surface states across various doping levels and temperatures. We identify a topological phase transition between trivial and non-trivial topology as a function of selenium content, with critical behavior observed between x = 0.04 and x = 0.09. Additionally, we find that at elevated temperatures, the coherence of the topological surface state deteriorates due to the emergence of OSMP, despite the topological invariant remaining intact. Our results demonstrate that the non-trivial topology in iron chalcogenide is fragile under strong electronic correlations.

Title: Effect of Group-V Impurities on the Electronic Properties of Germanium Detectors: An Insight from First-Principles Calculations
Authors: Sandip Aryal, Enrique R. Batista, Gaoxue Wang
Abstract: The outstanding properties of high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors, such as excellent energy resolution, high energy sensitivity, and a low background-to-signal ratio, make them essential and ideal candidates for detecting particle signatures in nuclear processes such as neutrino-less double beta decay. However, the presence of defects and impurities in HPGe crystals can lead to charge trapping, which affects carrier mobility and results in significant energy resolution degradation. In this work, we employ density functional theory with a hybrid functional to study the energetics of possible point defects in Ge. Our findings indicate that n-type group-V impurities, such as phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), and antimony (Sb), form more readily in Ge compared to nitrogen (N), Ge vacancies, and Ge interstitials. Unlike N dopants, which yield deep trap states, P, As, and Sb create shallow traps close to the conduction band edge of Ge. Furthermore, we predict that n-type defects can condense into defect complexes with Ge vacancies. These vacancy-impurity complexes form deep traps in Ge, similar to Ge vacancies, suggesting that both vacancies and vacancy-impurity complexes contribute to charge trapping in these detectors, thereby diminishing their performance.

Title: Machine Learning-Assisted Nano-imaging and Spectroscopy of Phase Coexistence in a Wide-Bandgap Semiconductor
Authors: Alyssa Bragg, Fengdeng Liu, Zhifei Yang, Nitzan Hirshberg, Madison Garber, Brayden Lukaskawcez, Liam Thompson, Shane MacDonald, Hayden Binger, Devon Uram, Ashley Bucsek, Bharat Jalan, Alexander McLeod
Abstract: Wide bandgap semiconductors with high room temperature mobilities are promising materials for high-power electronics. Stannate films provide wide bandgaps and optical transparency, although electron-phonon scattering can limit mobilities. In SrSnO3, epitaxial strain engineering stabilizes a high-mobility tetragonal phase at room temperature, resulting in a threefold increase in electron mobility among doped films. However, strain relaxation in thicker films leads to nanotextured coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases with unclear implications for optoelectronic performance. The observed nanoscale phase coexistence demands nano-spectroscopy to supply spatial resolution beyond conventional, diffraction-limited microscopy. With nano-infrared spectroscopy, we provide a comprehensive analysis of phase coexistence in SrSnO3 over a broad energy range, distinguishing inhomogeneous phonon and plasma responses arising from structural and electronic domains. We establish Nanoscale Imaging and Spectroscopy with Machine-learning Assistance (NISMA) to map nanotextured phases and quantify their distinct optical responses through a robust quantitative analysis, which can be applied to a broad array of complex oxide materials.

Title: Wave propagation in a model artery
Authors: Pierre Chantelot, Alexandre Delory, Claire Prada, Fabrice Lemoult
Abstract: Fluid filled pipes are ubiquitous in both man-made constructions and living organisms. In the latter, biological pipes, such as arteries, have unique properties as their walls are made of soft, incompressible, highly deformable materials. In this article, we experimentally investigate wave propagation in a model artery: an elastomer strip coupled to a rigid water channel. We measure out-of-plane waves using synthetic Schlieren imaging, and evidence a single dispersive mode which resembles the pulse wave excited by the heartbeat. By imposing an hydrostatic pressure difference, we reveal the strong influence of pre-stress on the dispersion of this wave. Using a model based on the acoustoelastic theory accounting for the material rheology and for the large static deformation of the strip, we demonstrate that the imposed pressure affects wave propagation through an interplay between stretching, orthogonal to the propagation direction, and curvature-induced rigidity. We finally highlight the relevance of our results in the biological setting, by discussing the determination of the arterial wall's material properties from pulse wave velocity measurements in the presence of pre-stress.

Title: The Scaling of Triboelectric Charging Powder Drops for Industrial Applications
Authors: Tom F. O'Hara, Ellen Player, Graham Ackroyd, Peter J. Caine, Karen L. Aplin
Abstract: Triboelectrification of granular materials is a poorly understood phenomenon that alters particle behaviour, impacting industrial processes such as bulk powder handling and conveying. At small scales ($< 1 g$) net charging of powders has been shown to vary linearly with the total particle surface area and hence mass for a given size distribution. This work investigates the scaling relation of granular triboelectric charging, with small, medium ($< 200 g$), and large-scale ($\sim 400 kg$) laboratory testing of industrially relevant materials using a custom powder dropping apparatus and Faraday cup measurements. Our results demonstrate that this scaling is broken before industrially relevant scales are reached. Charge (Q) scaling with mass (m) was fitted with a function of the form $Q \propto m^b$ and $b$ exponents ranging from $0.68\ \pm\ 0.01$ to $0.86\ \pm\ 0.02$ were determined. These exponents lie between those that would be expected from the surface area of the bulk powder ($b = 2 / 3$) and the total particle surface area ($b = 1$). This scaling relation is found to hold across the powders tested and at varying humidities.

Title: Deep Generative Learning of Magnetic Frustration in Artificial Spin Ice from Magnetic Force Microscopy Images
Authors: Arnab Neogi, Suryakant Mishra, Prasad P Iyer, Tzu-Ming Lu, Ezra Bussmann, Sergei Tretiak, Andrew Crandall Jones, Jian-Xin Zhu
Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of microscopic images with atomic resolution facilitate the development of machine learning methods to identify and analyze subtle physical phenomena embedded within the images. In this work, microscopic images of honeycomb lattice spin-ice samples serve as datasets from which we automate the calculation of net magnetic moments and directional orientations of spin-ice configurations. In the first stage of our workflow, machine learning models are trained to accurately predict magnetic moments and directions within spin-ice structures. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an emergent unsupervised deep learning technique, are employed to generate high-quality synthetic magnetic force microscopy (MFM) images and extract latent feature representations, thereby reducing experimental and segmentation errors. The second stage of proposed methodology enables precise identification and prediction of frustrated vertices and nanomagnetic segments, effectively correlating structural and functional aspects of microscopic images. This facilitates the design of optimized spin-ice configurations with controlled frustration patterns, enabling potential on-demand synthesis.

Title: Scaling Properties of Current Fluctuations in Periodic TASEP
Authors: Anastasiia Trofimova, Lu Xu
Abstract: We investigate current fluctuations in the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on a ring of size $N$ with $p$ particles. By deforming the Markov generator with a parameter $\gamma$, we analyze the tilted operator governing current statistics using coordinate Bethe ansatz techniques. We derive implicit expressions for the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), i.e. the largest eigenvalue, and the spectral gap in terms of Bethe roots, exploiting the geometric structure of Cassini ovals. In the thermodynamic limit, at fixed particle density, a dynamical phase transition emerges between regimes distinguished by the sign of $\gamma$. For positive deformation $\gamma$, the SCGF exhibits ballistic scaling, growing linearly with system size $N$. For negative $\gamma$, the SCGF converges to a universal constant, highlighting distinct fluctuation regimes. Correspondingly, the spectral gap, controlling relaxation times, shows qualitatively different finite-size scaling: it closes as $O(N^{-1})$ for $\gamma>0$ reflecting slow relaxation, but it decreases exponentially for $\gamma<0$ indicating rapid convergence. These results provide insight into the metastability and relaxation dynamics in driven interacting particle systems.

Title: Perturbative renormalization group approach to magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene using topological heavy fermion model
Authors: Yi Huang, Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We develop a perturbative renormalization group (RG) theory for the topological heavy fermion (THF) model, describing magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) as an emergent Anderson lattice. The realistic parameters place MATBG near an intermediate regime where the Hubbard interaction $U$ and the hybridization energy $\gamma$ are comparable, motivating the need for RG analysis. Our approach analytically tracks the flow of single-particle parameters and Coulomb interactions within an energy window below $0.1$ eV, providing implications for distinguishing between Kondo-like ($U\gg \gamma$) and projected-limit/Mott-semimetal ($U\ll \gamma$) scenarios at low energies. We show that the RG flows generically lower the ratio $U/\gamma$ and drive MATBG toward the chiral limit, consistent with the previous numerical study based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald model. The framework presented here also applies to other moiré systems and stoichiometric materials that admit a THF description, including magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, twisted checkerboard model, and Lieb lattice, among others, providing a foundation for developing low-energy effective theories relevant to a broad class of topological flat-band materials.

Title: A Partially Massless Superconductor
Authors: Kurt Hinterbichler, Austin Joyce
Abstract: We describe a Higgs mechanism for the partially massless graviton. In order to do so, we first construct a covariant fracton-like effective field theory on de Sitter space that linearly realizes a dipolar shift symmetry. The global symmetry of this theory can be gauged by coupling it to a partially massless spin-2 gauge field. When the fractonic matter condenses, the dipole symmetry is spontaneously broken, the resulting Goldstone mode is a galileon and the partially massless graviton combines with this mode and becomes fully massive. At long distances, the phenomenology of this theory is captured by a quasi-topological field theory and displays many features analogous to those of the superconducting phase in electromagnetism, including gapless edge modes and persistent currents. We also describe the generalization to higher spins.

Title: Meta-learning of Gibbs states for many-body Hamiltonians with applications to Quantum Boltzmann Machines
Authors: Ruchira V Bhat, Rahul Bhowmick, Avinash Singh, Krishna Kumar Sabapathy
Abstract: The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing, essential for applications ranging from modeling open quantum systems to quantum machine learning. Building on the Meta-Variational Quantum Eigensolver framework proposed by Cervera-Lierta et al.(2021) and a problem driven ansatz design, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms: Meta-Variational Quantum Thermalizer (Meta-VQT) and Neural Network Meta-VQT (NN-Meta VQT) for efficient thermal state preparation of parametrized Hamiltonians on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Meta-VQT utilizes a fully quantum ansatz, while NN Meta-VQT integrates a quantum classical hybrid architecture. Both leverage collective optimization over training sets to generalize Gibbs state preparation to unseen parameters. We validate our methods on upto 8-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and the 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, demonstrating efficient thermal state generation beyond training data. For larger systems, we show that our meta-learned parameters when combined with appropriately designed ansatz serve as warm start initializations, significantly outperforming random initializations in the optimization tasks. Furthermore, a 3- qubit Kitaev ring example showcases our algorithm's effectiveness across finite-temperature crossover regimes. Finally, we apply our algorithms to train a Quantum Boltzmann Machine (QBM) on a 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, achieving enhanced training efficiency, improved Gibbs state accuracy, and a 30-fold runtime speedup over existing techniques such as variational quantum imaginary time (VarQITE)-based QBM highlighting the scalability and practicality of meta-algorithm-based QBMs.

Abstract: Quantum many-body systems with sufficiently strong disorder can exhibit a non-equilibrium phenomenon, known as the many-body localization (MBL), which is distinct from conventional thermalization. While the MBL regime has been extensively studied in one dimension, its existence in higher dimensions remains elusive, challenged by the avalanche instability. Here, using a 70-qubit two-dimensional (2D) superconducting quantum simulator, we experimentally explore the robustness of the MBL regime in controlled finite-size 2D systems. We observe that the decay of imbalance becomes more pronounced with increasing system sizes, scaling up from 21, 42 to 70 qubits, with a relatively large disorder strength, and for the first time, provide an evidence for the many-body delocalization in 2D disordered systems. Our experimental results are consistent with the avalanche theory that predicts the instability of MBL regime beyond one spatial dimension. This work establishes a scalable platform for probing high-dimensional non-equilibrium phases of matter and their finite-size effects using superconducting quantum circuits.

Title: The sphere free energy of the vector models to order $1/N$
Authors: Ludo Fraser-Taliente
Abstract: We calculate the large-$N$ expansion of the sphere free energy $F=-\log Z_{S^d}$ of the O(N) $\phi^4$ and the Gross-Neveu $(\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ CFTs to order $1/N$. Analytical regularization of these theories requires consistently shifting the UV scaling dimension of the auxiliary field: this can only be done by modifying its kinetic term. This modification combines with the counterterms to give the result that matches the $\epsilon$-expansion, resolving a puzzle raised by Tarnopolsky in arXiv:1609.09113. These $F$s can be written compactly in terms of the anomalous dimensions, for both the short-range and the long-range versions of these CFTs. We also provide various technical results including a computation of the counterterms on the sphere and a neat derivation of the sphere free energy of a free conformal field. Finally, we observe that the long-range CFT becomes the short-range CFT at exactly the point where its $\tilde{F} =-\sin \tfrac{\pi d}{2} F$ is maximized as a function of the vector's scaling dimension.

Title: Higher symmetries, anomalies, and crossed squares in lattice gauge theory
Authors: Anton Kapustin, Lev Spodyneiko
Abstract: We examine higher-form symmetries of quantum lattice gauge theories through the lens of homotopy theory and operator algebras. We show that in the operator-algebraic approach both higher-form symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies arise from considering restrictions of symmetry transformations to spatial regions. The data of these restrictions are naturally packaged into a higher group. For example, for gauge theories in two spatial dimensions, this information is encoded in a crossed square of groups, which is an algebraic model of a 3-group. In general, we propose that higher groups appear in lattice models and QFT as crossed n-cubes of groups via a nonabelian version of the Cech construction.

Title: A resource theoretical unification of Mpemba effects: classical and quantum
Authors: Alessandro Summer, Mattia Moroder, Laetitia P. Bettmann, Xhek Turkeshi, Iman Marvian, John Goold
Abstract: The Mpemba effect originally referred to the observation that, under certain thermalizing dynamics, initially hotter samples can cool faster than colder ones. This effect has since been generalized to other anomalous relaxation behaviors even beyond classical domains, such as symmetry restoration in quantum systems. This work demonstrates that resource theories, widely employed in information theory, provide a unified organizing principle to frame Mpemba physics. We show how the conventional thermal Mpemba effect arises naturally from the resource theory of athermality, while its symmetry-restoring counterpart is fully captured by the resource theories of asymmetry. Leveraging the framework of modes of asymmetry, we demonstrate that the Mpemba effect due to symmetry restoration is governed by the initial overlap with the slowest symmetry-restoring mode -- mirroring the role of the slowest Liouvillian eigenmode in thermal Mpemba dynamics. Through this resource-theoretical formalism, we uncover the connection between these seemingly disparate effects and show that the dynamics of thermalization naturally splits into a symmetry-respecting and a symmetry-breaking term.

Title: Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier with Inverse Kerr Phase Matching
Authors: M. T. Bell
Abstract: Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPA) have emerged as highly versatile devices, offering broadband amplification with quantum-limited noise performance. They hold significant potential for addressing the readout bottleneck in prototype quantum computers, enabling scalability. Key challenges with this technology include achieving sufficient gain with minimal gain ripple while maintaining low noise performance. Efficient phase matching between a weak signal and a strong pump over the entire length of the TWPA is critical to overcoming these challenges. We present an experimental demonstration of the inverse Kerr phase matching technique in a TWPA, first proposed in Ref. Phys. Rev. Appl. 4, 024014. This method addresses several limitations of conventional dispersion engineering approaches of phase matching in the four-wave mixing parametric process in TWPAs. Most notably the existence of an unusable region of gain near the pump frequency which typically corresponds to the region of most optimal phase matching and maximum gain. The inverse Kerr phase matching approach, allows for greater frequency separation between the region of optimal gain and pump, \textit{in situ} tunability of the pump, minimal gain ripple, and a compact footprint which reduces losses. A TWPA employing the inverse Kerr phase matching technique experimentally demonstrated 20 dB of gain over a 3 GHz instantaneous bandwidth, with a tunable bandwidth of 8 GHz, minimal gain ripple, and near quantum-limited noise performance, with 1.5 photons of added noise.

Title: How animal movement influences wildlife-vehicle collision risk: a mathematical framework for range-resident species
Authors: Benjamin Garcia de Figueiredo, Inês Silva, Michael J. Noonan, Christen H. Fleming, William F. Fagan, Justin M. Calabrese, Ricardo Martinez-Garcia
Abstract: Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) threaten both biodiversity and human safety worldwide. Despite empirical efforts to characterize the major determinants of WVC risk and optimize mitigation strategies, we still lack a theoretical framework linking traffic, landscape, and individual movement features to collision risk. Here, we introduce such a framework by leveraging recent advances in movement ecology and reaction-diffusion stochastic processes with partially absorbing boundaries. Focusing on range-resident terrestrial mammals -- responsible for most fatal WVCs -- we model interactions with a single linear road and derive exact expressions for key survival statistics, including mean collision time and road-induced lifespan reduction. These quantities are expressed in terms of measurable parameters, such as traffic intensity or road width, and movement parameters that can be robustly estimated from relocation data, such as home-range crossing times, home-range sizes, or distance between home-range center and road. Therefore, our work provides an effective theoretical framework integrating movement and road ecology, laying the foundation for data-driven, evidence-based strategies to mitigate WVCs and promote safer, more sustainable transportation networks.

Title: Dispersion of active particles in oscillatory Poiseuille flow
Authors: Vhaskar Chakraborty, Pankaj Mishra, Mingfeng Qiu, Zhiwei Peng
Abstract: Active particles exhibit complex transport dynamics in flows through confined geometries such as channels or pores. In this work, we employ a generalized Taylor dispersion (GTD) theory to study the long-time dispersion behavior of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in an oscillatory Poiseuille flow within a planar channel. We quantify the time-averaged longitudinal dispersion coefficient as a function of the flow speed, flow oscillation frequency, and particle activity. In the weak-activity limit, asymptotic analysis shows that activity can either enhance or hinder the dispersion compared to the passive case. For arbitrary activity levels, we numerically solve the GTD equations and validate the results with Brownian dynamics simulations. We show that the dispersion coefficient could vary non-monotonically with both the flow speed and particle activity. Furthermore, the dispersion coefficient shows an oscillatory behavior as a function of the flow oscillation frequency, exhibiting distinct minima and maxima at different frequencies. The observed oscillatory dispersion results from the interplay between self-propulsion and oscillatory flow advection -- a coupling absent in passive or steady systems. Our results show that time-dependent flows can be used to tune the dispersion of active particles in confinement.

Title: Quantum walks reveal topological flat bands, robust edge states and topological phase transitions in cyclic graphs
Authors: Dinesh Kumar Panda, Colin Benjamin
Abstract: Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.

Title: Instability of explicit time integration for strongly quenched dynamics with neural quantum states
Authors: Hrvoje Vrcan, Johan H. Mentink
Abstract: Neural quantum states have recently demonstrated significant potential for simulating quantum dynamics beyond the capabilities of existing variational ansätze. However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Using the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.

Title: Universal properties of the many-body Lanczos algorithm at finite size
Authors: Luca Capizzi, Leonardo Mazza, Sara Murciano
Abstract: We study the universal properties of the Lanczos algorithm applied to finite-size many-body quantum systems. Focusing on autocorrelation functions of local operators and on their infinite-time behaviour at finite size, we conjecture that in the large $n$ limit, the ratios between consecutive Lanczos coefficients should have specific scalings with the size of the lattice that we make precise and that depend on the hydrodynamic tail of the autocorrelation function. The scaling associated with strong or approximate zero-modes is also discussed. We support our conjecture with a numerical study of different models.

Title: Renormalization group for effective field theories: cutoff schemes and universality
Authors: Jose Gaite
Abstract: In effective field theories, the concept of renormalization of perturbative divergences is replaced by renormalization group concepts such as relevance and universality. Universality is related to cutoff scheme independence in renormalization. Three-dimensional scalar field theory with just the quartic coupling is universal but the less relevant sextic coupling introduces a cutoff scheme dependence, which we quantify by three independent parameters, in the two-loop order of perturbation theory. However, reasonable schemes only allow reduced ranges of those parameters, even contrasting the sharp cutoff with very smooth cutoffs. The sharp cutoff performs better. In any case, the effective field theory possesses some degree of universality even in the massive case (off criticality).

Title: Entanglement dynamics in minimal Kitaev chains
Authors: Vimalesh Kumar Vimal, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: Minimal Kitaev chains host Majorana quasiparticles, which, although not topologically protected, exhibit spatial nonlocality and hence expected to be useful for quantum information tasks. In this work, we consider two- and three-site Kitaev chains and investigate the dynamics of bipartite and multipartite entanglement by means of concurrence and geometric measure of entanglement. In two-site Kitaev chains, we find that maximally entangled states can robustly emerge, with their stability and periodicity highly controllable by the interplay between the superconducting pair potential and the onsite energies. At the finely tuned sweet spot, where Majorana quasiparticles appear, the system exhibits oscillations between separable and entangled states, whereas detuning introduces tunable valleys in the entanglement dynamics. Extending to the three-site Kitaev chain, we uncover rich bipartite and multipartite entanglement by generalizing the concepts of concurrence and geometric measure of entanglement. At the sweet spot, the Majorana quasiparticles emerging at the edges suppress concurrence between the edges, while a finite detuning is able to restore it. Depending on the initial state, the three-site Kitaev chain can dynamically generate either a maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state or an imperfect W-type state exhibiting multipartite entanglement, although a (maximally entangled) pure W state cannot be realised due to parity constraints. Our results provide a resource for generating and characterising highly entangled states in minimal Kitaev chains, with potential relevance for quantum applications.

Title: From Atoms to Dynamics: Learning the Committor Without Collective Variables
Authors: Sergio Contreras Arredondo, Chenyu Tang, Radu A. Talmazan, Alberto Megías, Cheng Giuseppe Chen, Christophe Chipot
Abstract: This Brief Communication introduces a graph-neural-network architecture built on geometric vector perceptrons to predict the committor function directly from atomic coordinates, bypassing the need for hand-crafted collective variables (CVs). The method offers atom-level interpretability, pinpointing the key atomic players in complex transitions without relying on prior assumptions. Applied across diverse molecular systems, the method accurately infers the committor function and highlights the importance of each heavy atom in the transition mechanism. It also yields precise estimates of the rate constants for the underlying processes. The proposed approach opens new avenues for understanding and modeling complex dynamics, by enabling CV-free learning and automated identification of physically meaningful reaction coordinates of complex molecular processes.

Title: Simulating the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions in NMR by spin dynamic mean-field theory
Authors: Timo Gräßer, Götz S. Uhrig
Abstract: The simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is a notoriously difficult task, if many spins participate in the dynamics. The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We highlight the relevance of local quantum effects by a comparison with the classical analogue system.

Title: Application of new conformal cooling layouts to the green injection molding of complex slender polymeric parts with high dimensional specifications
Authors: Abelardo Torres Alba, Jorge Manuel Mercado Colmenero, Juan de Dios Caballero Garcia, Cristina Martin Donate
Abstract: Eliminating warpage in injection molded polymeric parts is one of the most important problems in the injection molding industry today. This situation is critical in geometries that are particularly susceptible to warping due to their geometric features, and this occurs with topologies of great length and slenderness with high changes in thickness. These features are, in these special geometries, impossible to manufacture with traditional technologies to meet the dimensional and sustainable requirements of the industry. This paper presents an innovative green conformal cooling system that is specifically designed for parts with slender geometric shapes that are highly susceptible to warping. Additionally, the work presented by the authors investigates the importance of using highly conductive inserts made of steel alloys in combination with the use of additively manufactured conformal channels for reducing influential parameters, such as warpage, cooling time, and residual stresses in the complex manufacturing of long and slender parts. The results of this real industrial case study indicated that the use of conformal cooling layouts decreased the cycle time by 175.1 s 66% below the current cooling time; the temperature gradient by 78.5% specifically, 18.16 C; the residual stress by 39.78 MPa or 81.88%; and the warpage by 6.9 mm or 90.5%. In this way, it was possible to achieve a final warping in the complex geometry studied of 0.72 mm, which was under the maximum value required at the industrial level of 1 mm. The resulting values obtained by the researchers present a turning point from which the manufacturing and sustainability in the injection molding of said plastic geometries is possible, and they take into account that the geometric manufacturing features analyzed will present a great demand in the coming years in the auto parts manufacturing industry.

Title: Classical triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model as a free-fermion/superconductor system
Authors: Amir Nourhani, Vincent H. Crespi, Paul E. Lammert
Abstract: We present a treatment of the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model (TAFIM) based on a small number of elementary ideas common to statistical and solid-state physics. The TAFIM is represented as a reduced BCS model in one space, one (imaginary) time dimension. The representation is approximate for nonzero temperature, but allows quick derivation of asymptotically exact thermodynamic functions, and the divergence of the spin-spin correlation length. The fermionic representation is exact at zero temperature. We demonstrate the existence of a two-dimensional continuum of zero-temperature equilibrium macrostates characterized by satisfied bond fractions of the three different orientations, and calculate their entropy densities.

Title: Birth Quota of Non-Generic Degeneracy Points
Authors: Gergő Pintér, György Frank, Dániel Varjas, András Pályi
Abstract: Weyl points are generic and stable features in the energy spectrum of Hamiltonians that depend on a three-dimensional parameter space. Non-generic isolated two-fold degeneracy points, such as multi-Weyl points, split into Weyl points upon a generic perturbation that removes the fine-tuning or protecting symmetry. The number of the resulting Weyl points is at least $|Q|$, where $Q$ is the topological charge associated to the non-generic degeneracy point. Here, we show that such a non-generic degeneracy point also has a birth quota, i.e., a maximum number of Weyl points that can be born from it upon any perturbation. The birth quota is a local multiplicity associated to the non-generic degeneracy point, an invariant of map germs known from singularity theory. This holds not only for the case of a three-dimensional parameter space with a Hermitian Hamiltonian, but also for the case of a two-dimensional parameter space with a chiral-symmetric Hamiltonian. We illustrate the power of this result for band structures of two- and three-dimensional crystals. Our work establishes a strong and powerful connection between singularity theory and topological band structures, and more broadly, parameter-dependent quantum systems.

Title: Sequential Adiabatic Generation of Chiral Topological States
Authors: Xie Chen, Michael Hermele, David T. Stephen
Abstract: In previous work, it was shown that non-trivial gapped states can be generated from a product state using a sequential quantum circuit. Explicit circuit constructions were given for a variety of gapped states at exactly solvable fixed points. In this paper, we show that a similar generation procedure can be established for chiral topological states as well, despite the fact that they lack a zero-correlation-length exactly solvable form. Instead of sequentially applying local unitary gates, we sequentially evolve the Hamiltonian by changing local terms in one subregion and then the next. The Hamiltonian remains gapped throughout the process, giving rise to an adiabatic evolution mapping the ground state from a product state to a chiral topological state. We demonstrate such a sequential adiabatic generation process for free fermion chiral states like the Chern Insulator and the $p+ip$ superconductor. Moreover, we show that coupling a quantum state to a discrete gauge group can be achieved through a sequential quantum circuit, thereby generating interacting chiral topological states from the free fermion ones.

Title: Interaction of Magnetic Fields with Spinons in a Fractionalized State
Authors: Yu Zhang, Hengdi Zhao, Tristan R. Cao, Rahul Nandkishore, Pedro Schlottmann, Lance Delong, Gang Cao
Abstract: The 4d-electron trimer lattice exhibits either a quantum spin liquid (QSL) or a heavy-fermion strange metal (HFSM) phase, depending on Nb content. In the QSL state, itinerant spinons act as effective heat carriers, enhancing thermal conductivity. Strikingly, applying a magnetic field up to 14 T causes an abrupt increase in heat capacity by as much as 5000% below 150 mK, disrupting the linear temperature dependence characteristic of both phases. Meanwhile, AC magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity remain nearly unchanged, while thermal conductivity is suppressed by up to 40% below 4 K. These observations suggest that spinons, though charge-neutral, are highly sensitive to magnetic fields at low temperatures. We propose that the field induces Anderson localization of spinons, leading to emergent non-magnetic two-level systems that account for the rapid rise in heat capacity. These findings uncover a previously unexplored regime of spinon dynamics, governed by field-induced localization and distinct from conventional magnetic or transport signatures.

Title: Nematic correlations and nematic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in spin-1 kagome lattice antiferromagnets
Authors: Chun-Jiong Huang, Xu-Ping Yao, Gang v. Chen
Abstract: Nematicity plays an important role in strongly correlated electron systems. We explore the spin nematicity of a spin-1 kagome lattice antiferromagnet with the bilinear-biquadratic model and single-ion anisotropy using a generalized semiclassical approximation and Monte Carlo simulations. We reveal a rich ground state phase diagram, characterized by two main regions: a pure spin nematic phase and a region featuring the coexistence of a classical spin liquid and ferroicities for both dipolar and quadrupolar moments. The thermal fluctuation melts the spin nematic order into a critical phase with a quasi-long-range nematic order. Due to the fluctuating vortices of the spin nematic order, this critical phase further undergoes a nematic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to a paramagnetic phase, marked by an anomalous stiffness jump. Additionally, the single-ion anisotropy leads to weak ferromagnetism, resulting in spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at very low temperatures. Remarkably, both two types of ferroic ordering are accompanied by classical spin liquid behaviors. Our results provide an intriguing glimpse into the interplay between geometric frustration and intertwining spin orders with different ranks and are expected to stimulate further studies on spin-1 systems and relevant materials.

Title: Fluctuations of driven probes reveal nonequilibrium transitions in complex fluids
Authors: Danilo Forastiere, Emanuele Locatelli, Gianmaria Falasco, Enzo Orlandini, Marco Baiesi
Abstract: Complex fluids subjected to localized microscopic energy inputs, typical of active microrheology setups, exhibit poorly understood nonequilibrium behaviors because of the intricate self-organization of their mesoscopic constituents. In this work we show how to identify changes in the microstructural conformation of the fluid by monitoring the variance of the probe position, based on a general method grounded in the breakdown of the equipartition theorem. To illustrate our method, we perform large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of an effective model of micellar solution, and we link the different scaling regimes in the variance of the probe's position to the transitions from diffusive to jump dynamics, where the fluid intermittently relaxes the accumulated stress. This suggests stored elastic stress may be the physical mechanism behind the nonlinear friction curves recently measured in micellar solutions, pointing at a mechanism for the observed multi-step rheology. Our approach overcomes the limitations of continuum macroscopic descriptions and introduces an empirical method, applicable in experiments, to detect nonequilibrium transitions in the structure of complex fluids.

Title: Magnetic excitations and absence of charge order in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_{4.75}$GeTe$_2$
Authors: V. K. Bhartiya, T. Kim, J. Li, T. P. Darlington, D. J. Rizzo, Y. Gu., S. Fan, C. Nelson, J. W. Freeland, X. Xu, D. N. Basov, J. Pelliciari, A. F. May, C. Mazzoli, V. Bisogni
Abstract: Understanding the ground state of van der Waals (vdW) magnets is crucial for designing devices leveraging these platforms. Here, we investigate the magnetic excitations and charge order in Fe$_{4.75}$GeTe$_2$, a vdW ferromagnet with $\approx$ 315 K Curie temperature. Using Fe $L_3 - $edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we observe a dual nature of magnetic excitations, comprising a coherent magnon and a broad non-dispersive continuum extending up to 150 meV, 50$\%$ higher than in Fe$_{2.72}$GeTe$_2$. The continuum intensity is sinusoidally modulated along the stacking direction $L$, with a period matching the inter-slab distance. Our results indicate that while the dual character of the magnetic excitations is generic to Fe-Ge-Te vdW magnets, Fe$_{4.75}$GeTe$_2$ exhibits a longer out-of-plane magnetic correlation length, suggesting enhanced 3D magnetic character. Furthermore, resonant x-ray diffraction reveals that previously reported $\pm$(1/3, 1/3, $L$) peaks originate from crystal structure rather than from charge order.

Title: Tracer and current fluctuations in driven diffusive systems
Authors: Théotim Berlioz, Olivier Bénichou, Aurélien Grabsch
Abstract: Interacting particles diffusing in single-file is a fundamental model of transport in narrow channels where particles cannot bypass each other. An important result has been obtained by Kollmann [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 180602 (2003)] for the mean square displacement of a tracer for any single-file model. It applies to any diffusive system, in particular the notable classes of colloidal systems and diffusive stochastic lattice gases. Since then, no analog result has been obtained in the important case where the particles are driven by an external field. Here, we fill this gap and determine the fluctuations and the skewness of the tracer's position for any driven diffusive system. In addition, we also consider a variety of important observables such as the integrated current, the response of the system to the perturbation induced by the displacement of the tracer, and the correlations between several tracers. Furthermore, we also unveil fundamental relations underlying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of driven diffusive systems. This work constitutes a step toward the determination of the full distribution of all these observables in driven one-dimensional systems of interacting particles.

Title: Electrically-tunable graphene nanomechanical resonators
Authors: Yi-Bo Wang, Zhuo-Zhi Zhang, Chen-Xu Wu, Yu-Shi Zhang, Guo-Sheng Lei, Xiang-Xiang Song, Guo-Ping Guo
Abstract: The excellent mechanical properties make graphene promising for realizing nanomechanical resonators with high resonant frequencies, large quality factors, strong nonlinearities, and the capability to effectively interface with various physical systems. Equipped with gate electrodes, it has been demonstrated that these exceptional device properties can be electrically manipulated, leading to a variety of nanomechanical/acoustic applications. Here, we review the recent progress of graphene nanomechanical resonators with a focus on their electrical tunability. First, we provide an overview of different graphene nanomechanical resonators, including their device structures, fabrication methods, and measurement setups. Then, the key mechanical properties of these devices, for example, resonant frequencies, nonlinearities, dissipations, and mode coupling mechanisms, are discussed, with their behaviors upon electrical gating being highlighted. After that, various potential classical/quantum applications based on these graphene nanomechanical resonators are reviewed. Finally, we briefly discuss challenges and opportunities in this field to offer future prospects of the ongoing studies on graphene nanomechanical resonators.

Title: Interplay of $d$- and $p$-states in RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ flat-band kagome metals
Authors: M. Wenzel, E. Uykur, A. A. Tsirlin, A. N Capa Salinas, B. R. Ortiz, S. D. Wilson, M. Dressel
Abstract: Shifting the Fermi level of the celebrated $AM_3X_5$ (135) compounds into proximity of flat bands strongly enhances electronic correlations and severely affects the formation of density waves and superconductivity. Our broadband infrared spectroscopy measurements of RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ combined with density-functional band-structure calculations reveal that the correlated Ti $d$-states are intricately coupled with the Bi $p$-states that form a tilted Dirac crossing. Electron-phonon coupling manifests itself in the strong damping of itinerant carriers and in the anomalous shape of the phonon line in RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$. An anomaly in these spectral features around 150 K can be paralleled to the onset of nematicity detected by low-temperature probes. Our findings show that the materials with low band filling open unexplored directions in the physics of kagome metals and involve electronic states of different nature strongly coupled with lattice dynamics.

Title: Classical Information Exchange Between Particles
Authors: Miles Miller-Dickson, Christopher Rose
Abstract: The flow of information within many-body systems is a fundamental feature of physical interaction. Given an underlying classical physics model for the interaction between a particle and its environment, we give meaning to and quantify the information passed between them over time. We show that the maximum information exchange rate is proportional to the ratio of inter-particle energy flow and initial particle energy -- a sort of signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, a single time-point (as opposed to trajectory) observability relation emerges.

Title: Electrical probe of spin-spiral order in quantum spin Hall/spin-spiral magnet van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Fedor Nigmatulin, Jose L. Lado, Zhipei Sun
Abstract: Two-dimensional spin-spiral magnets provide promising building blocks for van der Waals heterostructures due to their tunable spin textures and potential for novel functionalities for quantum devices. However, due to its vanishing magnetization and two-dimensional nature, it is challenging to detect the existence of its noncollinear magnetization. Here, we show that a van der Waals junction based on a spin-spiral magnet and a quantum spin Hall insulator enables obtaining signatures of noncollinear magnetization directly from electrical measurements. Our strategy exploits the sensitivity of helical states to local breaking of time-reversal symmetry, potentially enabling the detection of local magnetic orders even in the absence of net magnetization. We show that the combination of spin-spiral order and nonmagnetic disorder gives rise to scattering in the helical channels that can be directly associated with the spiral exchange coupling and residual nonmagnetic disorder strength. Our results show how electrical transport measurement may offer a way to detect spin-spiral magnets by leveraging helical states in van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Mutual control of critical temperature, residual resistance ratio, stress, and roughness for sputtered Nb films

Abstract: Superconducting single quantum logic integrated circuits traditionally exploit magnetron sputtered niobium thin films on silicon oxide substrates. The sputtering depends on multiple process parameters, which dramatically affect mechanical, electrical, and cryogenic properties of Nb thin films. In this work, we focus on the comprehensive relationship study between 200-nm Nb film characteristics and their intrinsic stress. It is shown that there is a critical value of the working pressure pcritical at the fixed sputtering power above which stress in the film relaxes whereas the film properties degrade significantly. Below pcritical one can control intrinsic stress in the wide range from -400 MPa to +600 MPa maintaining perfect film surface with a 0.8 nm roughness (Rq), electrical resistivity less than 20 uOhm*cm, critical superconducting transition temperature above 8.9 K and residual resistance ratio over 6.4. We suggest a modified kinetic model to predict Nb films stress with the linear dependence of high-energy parameters on the working pressure replaced with an exponential one, which allowed reduction of the approximation error from 20 to 8%.

Title: Excitonic bound states in the continuum in van der Waals heterostructure metasurfaces
Authors: Polina Pantyukhina, Andrey Bogdanov, Kirill Koshelev
Abstract: We investigate the formation of excitonic bound states in the continuum in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of two-dimensional excitonic vdW layers and an optically resonant patterned vdW thin film. We show that the radiative losses of the exciton can be completely suppressed - not through conventional methods such as total internal reflection, Bragg mirrors, or metallic layers - but instead via destructive interference of exciton emission rates to distinct optical modes of the metasurface. We formulate the general conditions of excitonic BICs as a vanishing Purcell factor with non-vanishing vacuum local density of states at the exciton frequency. We propose a mechanism to achieve excitonic quasi-BICs with almost complete suppression of radiation via exciton coupling with a guided-mode resonance and multiple Fabry-Pérot modes. We show that in unpatterned vdW slabs, the Purcell factor suppression is defined exclusively by the slab's permittivity achieved via positioning the 2D exciton layer in the minimum of the mode electric field. We confirm through numerical simulations that, in periodically patterned heterostructure metasurfaces, the Purcell factor can be suppressed by more than five orders of magnitude, and this effect is not due to vanishing local electric fields. Our results demonstrate the formation of excitonic quasi-BICs and their potential for advancing quantum optics and information processing.

Title: Altermagnetic splitting of magnons in hematite ($α$-Fe$_2$O$_3$)
Authors: Rhea Hoyer, P. Peter Stavropoulos, Aleksandar Razpopov, Roser Valentí, Libor Šmejkal, Alexander Mook
Abstract: We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field.

Title: Graphene-hBN interlayer interactions from quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: Kittithat Krongchon, Tawfiqur Rakib, Daniel Palmer, Elif Ertekin, Harley T. Johnson, Lucas K. Wagner
Abstract: The interaction between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic and structural properties of graphene-based devices. In this work, we employ quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to study the interlayer interactions and stacking-fault energy (SFE) between graphene and hBN. We generated QMC energies for several rigid bilayer stacking configurations and fitted these data to the Kolmogorov-Crespi type interlayer potential (ILP) model. Our QMC-derived potential offers a more reliable alternative to conventional density functional theory methods, which are prone to errors in predicting properties in van der Waals materials. This study enables highly accurate predictions of structural and electronic properties in graphene hBN heterostructures. The resulting ILP-QMC potential is made available for further use in simulating complex systems, such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) on hBN.

Title: Mutual friction and vortex Hall angle in a strongly interacting Fermi superfluid
Authors: Nicola Grani, Diego Hernández-Rajkov, Cyprien Daix, Pierbiagio Pieri, Michele Pini, Piotr Magierski, Gabriel Wlazłowski, Marcia Frómeta Fernández, Francesco Scazza, Giulia Del Pace, Giacomo Roati
Abstract: The motion of a quantized vortex is intimately connected with its microscopic structure and the elementary excitations of the surrounding fluid. In this work, we investigate the two-dimensional motion of a single vortex orbiting a pinned anti-vortex in a unitary Fermi superfluid at varying temperature. By analyzing its trajectory, we measure the yet-unknown longitudinal and transverse mutual friction coefficients, which quantify the vortex-mediated coupling between the normal and superfluid components. Both coefficients increase while approaching the superfluid transition. They provide access to the vortex Hall angle, which is linked to the relaxation time of the localized quasiparticles occupying Andreev bound states within the vortex core, as well as the intrinsic superfluid parameter associated with the transition from laminar to quantum turbulent flows. We compare our results with numerical simulations and an analytic model originally formulated for superfluid $^3$He in the low-temperature limit, finding good agreement. Our work highlights the interplay between vortex-bound quasiparticles and delocalized thermal excitations in shaping vortex dynamics in unitary Fermi superfluids. Further, it provides a novel testbed for studying out-of-equilibrium vortex matter at finite temperatures.

Title: Dislocation saturation in slip rate driven processes and initial microstructure effects for large plastic deformation of crystals
Authors: Jalal Smiri, Oguz Umut Salman, Ioan R. Ionescu
Abstract: Dislocation-density-based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructural changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip-rate-driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. We point out the existence of saturation dislocation densities and the essential role of initial dislocation density in distinguishing between hardening and softening responses. Since the initial microstructure, modeled through the dislocation density, could be related to the size or the sample preparation process, implicit size-dependent effects can also be inferred. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.

Title: Transport through Nodal Surface Semimetal-Superconductor junction in absence/presence of light irradiation
Authors: Bhaskar Pandit, Satyaki Kar
Abstract: We study quantum tunnelling via s-wave superconductor (SC) junction with a topologically charged nodal surface semimetal (NSSM) where a nonsymmorphic symmetry forces the nodal surfaces to stick to the Brillouin Zone boundary. Due to their unique dispersions close to the two dimensional band crossing, the charge carriers in the NSSM display many unorthodox behavior in the nature of Andreev as well as normal reflections at the SC junction interface. We investigate such behaviors for different incident orientations for both subgap and supergap energies where monotonic decays/rises of reflectance with incident energy or angle of incidences are often not followed. We also consider irradiation via light with circular and linear polarization on such systems following a Floquet approach in the limit of high frequency irradiation and probe the stroboscopic temporal evolution of the transport parameters. Our results indicate many nontrivial Andreev transport features including near-depletion of the subgap conductivities. All these nontrivialities can be tested in a cold atom set-up on optical lattices and well experimented for quantum information processing purpose.

Title: SLIDE: Automated Identification and Quantification of Grain Boundary Sliding and Opening in 3D
Authors: C.J.A. Mornout, G. Slokker, T. Vermeij, D. König, J.P.M. Hoefnagels
Abstract: Grain Boundary (GB) deformation mechanisms such as Sliding (GBS) and Opening (GBO) are prevalent in alloys at high homologous temperatures but are hard to capture quantitatively. We propose an automated procedure to quantify 3D GB deformations at the nanoscale, using a combination of precisely aligned Digital Image Correlation (DIC), electron backscatter diffraction, optical profilometry, and in-beam secondary electron maps. The framework, named Sliding identification by Local Integration of Displacements across Edges (SLIDE), (i) distinguishes GBS from GBO, (ii) computes the datapoint-wise measured in-plane displacement gradient tensor (from DIC), (iii) projects this data onto the theoretical GBS tensor to reject near-GB plasticity/elasticity/noise, and (iv) adds the out-of-plane step from optical profilometry to yield the local 3D GBS/GBO vector; automatically repeated for each $\sim$50nm-long GB segment. SLIDE is validated on a virtual experiment of discrete 3D sliding, and successfully applied to Zn-coated steel experiments, yielding quantitative GBS/GBO activity maps.

Title: Unravelling the Flow of Information in a Nonequilibrium Process in the Presence of Hydrodynamic Interactions
Authors: Biswajit Das, Sreekanth K Manikandan, Ayan Banerjee
Abstract: Identifying the origin of nonequilibrium characteristics in a generic interacting system having multiple degrees of freedom is a challenging task. In this context, information theoretic measures such as mutual information and related polymorphs offer valuable insights. Here, we explore these measures in a minimal experimental model consisting of two hydrodynamically coupled colloidal particles, where a nonequilibrium drive is introduced via an exponentially correlated noise acting on one of the particles. We show that the information-theoretic tools considered enable a systematic, data-driven dissection of information flow within the system. These measures allow us to identify the driving node and reconstruct the directional dependencies between particles. Notably, they help explain a recently observed, counterintuitive trend in the dependence of irreversibility on interaction strength under coarse-graining (B. Das this http URL., arXiv:2405.00800 (2024)). Finally, our results demonstrate how directional information measures can uncover the hidden structure of nonequilibrium dynamics and provide a framework for studying similar effects in more complex systems.

Title: Permeation and thermal desorption model of hydrogen in steel: a sensitivity analysis
Authors: Paolo Emilio Di Nunzio
Abstract: This work presents a fully physical model of the hydrogen diffusion and trapping kinetics in metals, integrating permeation and thermal desorption within a unified framework. Based on the McNabb and Foster approach, it requires only binding energy and number density of trap sites. It correctly reproduces the physics of the system and the results of the analytical solutions of the permeation kinetics. It is also capable of reproducing thermal desorption spectra with considerable accuracy. The sensitivity analysis has elucidated the relationships among the processing conditions and the parameters commonly used to characterize permeation and thermal desorption experiments. An equation empirically derived from the simulation results, expressing the dependence of time lag in desorption on specimen thickness, number density of occupied trap sites, and cathodic concentration, is proposed. In summary, the model represents a valuable tool in supporting the interpretation and rationalization of experiments also from a quantitative viewpoint.

Title: Charge density waves and soft phonon evolution in the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$
Authors: Tom Lacmann, Sofia-Michaela Souliou, Fabian Henssler, Mehdi Frachet, Philippa Helen McGuinness, Michael Merz, Björn Wehinger, Daniel A. Chaney, Amir-Abbas Haghighirad, Rolf Heid, Matthieu Le Tacon
Abstract: The superconductor BaNi$_2$As$_2$ exhibits a soft-phonon-driven, incommensurate charge density wave (I-CDW) which is accompanied by a small orthorhombic structural phase transition. Upon further cooling, BaNi$_2$As$_2$ undergoes a first-order structural transition to a triclinic phase in which a commensurate CDW (C-CDW) appears. The relationship and interplay between the I-CDW, C-CDW and structural phase transitions has remained elusive. To investigate this issue, we present a complementary study of thermal diffuse X-Ray scattering and inelastic X-Ray scattering for phosphorus substituted BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ $(x\lessapprox0.12)$ and down to 2.2 K. We show that most of the diffuse scattering signal can be well described by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. Furthermore, we find that although phosphorus substitution rapidly suppresses the structural transition temperatures, the temperature dependence of the correlation length of the I-CDW fluctuations and the formation of Bragg-like superstructure peaks associated with long-range ordering of this order depends only weakly on the substitution level. Finally, we present the absence of signatures of the I-CDW to C-CDW or triclinic transition in the lattice dynamics, indicating that these instabilities are not (soft) phonon driven.

Title: Advancing excited-state properties of two-dimensional materials using a dielectric-dependent hybrid functional
Authors: Arghya Ghosh, Subrata Jana, Manoar Hossain, Dimple Rani, Szymon Śmiga, Prasanjit Samal
Abstract: Predicting accurate band gaps and optical properties of lower-dimensional materials, including two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials and their heterostructures, remains a challenge within density functional theory (DFT) due to their unique screening compared to their bulk counterparts. Additionally, accurate treatment of the dielectric response is crucial for developing and applying screened-exchange dielectric-dependent range-separated hybrid functionals (SE-DD-RSH) for vdW materials. In this work, we introduce a SE-DD-RSH functional to the 2D vdW materials like MoS2, WS2, hBN, black phosphorus (BP), and \b{eta}-InSe. By accounting for in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric responses, our method achieves accuracy comparable to advanced many-body techniques like G0 W0 and BSE@G0 W0 at a lower computational cost. We demonstrate improved band gap predictions and optical absorption spectra for both bulk and layered structures, including some heterostructures like MoS2/WS2 . This approach offers a practical and precise tool for exploring electronic and optical phenomena in 2D materials, paving the way for efficient computational studies of layered systems.

Title: Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals
Authors: Doried Ghader, Bilal Jabakhanji
Abstract: Magnons have been intensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on Bravais lattices, particularly triangular and square lattices, where the first two magnon gaps are topologically trivial and do not support topological edge states (TESs). Meanwhile, the third gap can host TESs, which may be trivialized through field-induced topological phase transitions (TPTs), enabling controlled magnonic edge transport. However, the magnon topology in non-Bravais spin lattices remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate the influence of the honeycomb lattice structure on magnon band topology and associated TESs in FM SkXs, employing realistic parameters for monolayer CrI$_3$ and CrBr$_3$. We reveal unique magnonic topological features arising specifically from the honeycomb lattice. Characteristic magnon modes, such as elliptical and triangular distortion modes, acquire nontrivial Chern numbers, contrasting their trivial counterparts in triangular-based SkXs. Moreover, the second magnon gap in honeycomb-based SkXs consistently hosts TESs at low magnetic fields, unlike triangular SkXs. These TESs can be trivialized above a critical magnetic field. Conversely, the third gap is generally trivial at higher magnetic fields but becomes topological at low fields only when the SkX periodicity falls below a critical threshold dependent on Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) strength and magnetic anisotropy. Our study further demonstrates a rich magnonic topological phase diagram accessible by magnetic fields, potentially enabling selective control of low-energy chiral edge modes. These findings underscore the pivotal role of lattice geometry in shaping the topology of magnons in noncollinear spin textures.

By symmetry analysis of CBED patterns along different zone axis, the space group of $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ at room-temperature has been identified as $P6_3mc$ (No.186), which derives from the high-symmetry parent system $\text{Fe}_{\text{3}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ ($P6_3/mmc$) by breaking the mirror symmetry along the six-fold rotation axis. The $P3m1$ (No.156) space group previously reported for $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ is a subgroup of $P6_3mc$ suggesting further possible symmetry breaks in this non-stochiometric system.

Title: Moiré-Induced Magnetoelectricity in Twisted Bilayer NiI2
Authors: Haiyan Zhu, Hongyu Yu, Weiqin Zhu, Guoliang Yu, Changsong Xu, Hongjun Xiang
Abstract: Twisted magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a promising route for multiferroic engineering, yet modeling large-scale moiré superlattices remains challenging. Leveraging a newly developed SpinGNN++ framework that effectively handles spin-lattice coupled systems, we develop a comprehensive interatomic machine learning (ML) potential and apply it to twisted bilayer NiI2 (TBN). Structural relaxation introduces moiré-periodic "bumps" that modulate the interlayer spacing by about 0.55~Å and in-plane ionic shifts up to 0.48~Å. Concurrently, our ML potential, which faithfully captures all key spin interactions, produces reliable magnetic configurations; combined with the generalized KNB mechanism, it yields accurate spin-driven polarization. For twist angles 1.89^{\circ} \leq \theta \leq 2.45^{\circ}, both mechanisms become prominent, yielding rich polarization textures that combine ionic out-of-plane dipoles with purely electronic in-plane domains. In the rigid (unrelaxed) bilayer, skyrmions are absent; lattice relaxation is essential for generating polar-magnetic topologies. In contrast, near {\theta} \approx 60^{\circ}, stacking-dependent ferroelectric displacements dominate, giving rise to polar meron-antimeron networks. These results reveal cooperative ionic and spin-driven ferroelectricity in TBN, positioning twisted vdW magnets as adaptable platforms for tunable multiferroic devices.

Title: High-$T_{\rm c}$ Ag$_x$BC and Cu$_x$BC superconductors accessible via topochemical reactions
Authors: Daviti Gochitashvili, Charlsey R. Tomassetti, Elena R. Margine, Aleksey N. Kolmogorov
Abstract: Hole-doping of covalent materials has long served as a blueprint for designing conventional high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors, but thermodynamic constraints severely limit the space of realizable compounds. Our ab initio results indicate that metastable Ag$_x$BC and Cu$_x$BC phases can be accessed via standard topochemical ion exchange reactions starting from Li$_x$BC precursors. Unlike all known stoichiometric layered metal borocarbides, the predicted AgBC and CuBC derivatives, comprising honeycomb layers bridged by dumbbells, are metallic rather than semiconducting. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg analysis reveals that the intrinsically hole-doped AgBC possesses a unique combination of electronic and vibrational features to exhibit two-gap superconductivity above 50 K.

Title: Spin orientation -- a subtle interplay between strain and multipole Coulomb interactions
Authors: Subhra Sen Gupta, Shinjini Paul, Suman Mandal, D. D. Sarma, Priya Mahadevan
Abstract: We address the technologically important issue of the spin orientation on a correlated magnetic surface and how to manipulate it. We consider a prototypical strongly correlated system, NiO, and show that a single particle approach with anisotropic hoppings, or even a many-electron model with a scalar Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$ fails to explain the strain driven spin reorientation transition (SRT). We set up a model treating both anisotropic single particle effects and orbital-dependent, full multipole electron-electron interaction effects at the same footing. Within this model, predictive power to explain the observed SRT is regained and the results indicate the novel possibility of using an electric field to control SRT in magnetic films grown on piezoelectric substrates.

Title: False signatures of non-ergodic behavior in disordered quantum many-body systems
Authors: Adith Sai Aramthottil, Ali Emami Kopaei, Piotr Sierant, Lev Vidmar, Jakub Zakrzewski
Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.

Title: Gears in Chemical Reaction Networks: Optimizing Energy Transduction Efficiency
Authors: Massimo Bilancioni, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: Similarly to gear systems in vehicles, most chemical reaction networks (CRNs) involved in energy transduction have at their disposal multiple transduction pathways, each characterized by distinct efficiencies. We conceptualize these pathways as `chemical gears' and demonstrate their role in refining the second law of thermodynamics. This allows us to determine the optimal efficiency of a CRN, and the gear enabling it, solely based on its topology and operating conditions, defined by the chemical potentials of its input and output species. By suitably tuning reaction kinetics, a CRN can be engineered to self-regulate its gear settings, maintaining optimal efficiency under varying external conditions. We demonstrate this principle in a biological context with a CRN where enzymes function as gear shifters, autonomously adapting the system to achieve near-optimal efficiency across changing environments. Additionally, we examine artificial molecular motors and reveal that their gearing mechanisms are far from optimally regulated.

Title: Many-body enhancement of energy storage in a waveguide-QED quantum battery
Authors: Salvatore Tirone, Gian Marcello Andolina, Giuseppe Calajò, Vittorio Giovannetti, Davide Rossini
Abstract: Quantum batteries have demonstrated remarkable charging properties, showing that a quantum advantage is possible in the realm of quantum thermodynamics. However, finding an effective strategy to store energy for long periods remains crucial in these systems. Here, we investigate different configurations of a waveguide-QED system acting as a quantum battery and show that, in this context, collective effects can slow down the self-discharging time of the battery, thus improving the storage time. Specifically, when the artificial atoms of the array are arranged randomly, the energy and ergotropy of the optical system are shown to decay at a subexponential rate over long periods, in contrast to the energy decay of a single atom in a waveguide. In the case of atoms arranged in an ordered lattice, collective effects slow down dissipative discharging only for a specific lattice spacing. Thus, in both configurations, collective effects can be used to boost the energy-protection properties of optical systems.

Title: Pseudochaotic Many-Body Dynamics as a Pseudorandom State Generator
Authors: Wonjun Lee, Hyukjoon Kwon, Gil Young Cho
Abstract: Quantum chaos is central to understanding quantum dynamics and is crucial for generating random quantum states, a key resource for quantum information tasks. In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum many-body dynamics, termed pseudochaotic dynamics. Although distinct from chaotic dynamics, out-of-time-ordered correlators, the key indicators of quantum chaos, fail to distinguish them. Moreover, pseudochaotic dynamics generates pseudorandom states that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random states. We construct pseudochaotic dynamics by embedding a smaller $k$-qubit subsystem into a larger $n$-qubit system. We demonstrate that a subsystem of size $k=\omega(\log n)$ is sufficient to induce pseudochaotic behavior in the entire $n$-qubit system. Furthermore, we construct a quantum circuit exhibiting pseudochaotic dynamics and demonstrate that it generates pseudorandom states within $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ depth. In summary, our results constitute the discovery of new quantum dynamics that are computationally indistinguishable from genuine quantum chaos, which provides efficient routes to generate useful pseudorandom states.

Title: Single-atom resolved collective spectroscopy of a one-dimensional atomic array
Authors: Britton Hofer, Damien Bloch, Giulio Biagioni, Nathan Bonvalet, Antoine Browaeys, Igor Ferrier-Barbut
Abstract: Ordered atomic arrays feature an enhanced collective optical response compared to random atomic ensembles due to constructive interference in resonant dipole-dipole interactions. One consequence is the existence of a large shift of the transition with respect to the bare atomic frequency. In the linear optics regime (low light intensity), one observes a spectroscopic shift of the Lorentzian atomic line often called the collective Lamb shift. For stronger driving, many excitations are present in the system rendering the calculation of this shift theoretically challenging, but its understanding is important for instance when performing Ramsey spectroscopy in optical clocks. Here we report on the study of the collective optical response of a one-dimensional array of 30 dysprosium atoms. We drive the atoms on the narrow intercombination transition isolating a 2-level system, and measure the atomic state with single-shot state readout using a broad transition. In the linear optics regime, we measure the shift of the resonance in steady state due to dipole interactions, and measure how this shift depends on the interatomic distance. We further resolve at the single atom level how the excitation is distributed over the array. Then, on the same transition we perform Ramsey spectroscopy \emph{i.\,e.}~away from the linear regime. We observe a time-dependent shift, that allows us to draw the connection between the collective Lamb shift observed in the linear optics regime and in the large-excitation case.

Title: Theory of enhanced-by-coincidence neural information transmission
Authors: Miguel Ibáñez-Berganza, Giulio Bondanelli, Stefano Panzeri
Abstract: The activity of neurons within brain circuits has been ubiquitously reported to be correlated. The impact of these correlations on brain function has been extensively investigated. Correlations can in principle increase or decrease the information that neural populations carry about sensory stimuli, but experiments in cortical areas have mostly reported information-limiting correlations, which decrease the information encoded in the population. However, a second stream of evidence suggests that temporal correlations between the spiking activity of different neurons may increase the impact of neural activity downstream, implying that temporal correlations affect both the encoding of information and its downstream readout. The principle of how encoding and readout combine are still unclear. Here, we consider a model of transmission of stimulus information encoded in pre-synaptic input spike trains with information-limiting time-correlations to the output firing of a post-synaptic biologicaly-plausible leaky integrate and fire (LIF) readout neuron. We derive an analytical solution of the model in the diffusion approximation, in which the encoding spiking activity is treated as a continuous-time stochastic variable. An ansatz based on a separation of timescales allows us compute the stimulus information transmitted to the readout over a broad range of parameters. Our analytical results reveal that, for sufficiently low input firing rates, large enough difference in input stimulus-specific activity, and moderately large input temporal correlations, the stimulus discriminability of the firing of the LIF readout neuron can be enhanced by the presence of input time correlations, despite they decrease the stimulus information encoded in its inputs.

Title: Extremal monomial property of q-characters and polynomiality of the X-series
Authors: Edward Frenkel, David Hernandez
Abstract: The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.

Title: Dynamics of localized states in the stochastic discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation
Authors: Mahdieh Ebrahimi, Barbara Drossel, Wolfram Just
Abstract: We revisit aspects of dynamics and stability of localized states in the deterministic and stochastic discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation. By a combination of analytic and numerical techniques, we show that localized initial conditions disperse if the strength of the nonlinear part drops below a threshold and that localized states are unstable in a noisy environment. As expected, the constants of motion in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation play a crucial role. An infinite temperature state emerges when multiplicative noise is applied, while additive noise yields unbounded dynamics since conservation of normalization is violated.

Title: Energy Transduction in Complex Networks with Multiple Resources: The Chemistry Paradigm
Authors: Massimo Bilancioni, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: We extend the traditional framework of steady state energy transduction -- typically characterized by a single input and output -- to multi-resource transduction in open chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Transduction occurs when stoichiometrically balanced processes are driven against their spontaneous directions by coupling them with thermodynamically favorable ones. However, when multiple processes (resources) interact through a shared CRN, identifying the relevant set of processes for analyzing transduction becomes a critical and complex challenge. To address this, we introduce a systematic procedure based on elementary processes, which cannot be further decomposed into subprocesses. Our theory generalizes the methodology used to define transduction efficiency in thermal engines operating between multiple heat baths. By selecting a reference equilibrium environment, it explicitly reveals the inherently relative nature of transduction efficiency and ties its definition to exergy. This framework also allows one to exclude unusable outputs from efficiency calculations. We further extend the concept of chemical gears to multi-process transduction, demonstrating their versatility as an analytical tool in complex settings. Finally, we apply our framework to central metabolic pathways, uncovering deep insights into their operation and highlighting the crucial difference between thermodynamic efficiencies and stoichiometric yields.

Title: Maximum entropy principle for quantum processes
Authors: Siddhartha Das, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: The maximum entropy principle, as applied to quantum systems, is a fundamental prescript positing that for a quantum system for which we only have partial knowledge, the maximum entropy state consistent with the partial knowledge is a valuable choice as the system's state. An intriguing result is that in case the only prior knowledge is of a fixed mean energy, the maximum entropy state turns out to be the thermal state, a ubiquitous state in several arenas, especially in statistical mechanics. We extend the consequences of this principle from static quantum states to dynamic quantum processes. We establish that a quantum channel attains maximal entropy under a fixed mean energy constraint if and only if it is an absolutely thermalizing channel whose fixed output is the thermal state of the same mean energy. This provides an alternative approach for understanding the emergence of absolute thermalization processes within the observable part of the universe under physically natural energy constraints. Our results have potential implications for understanding the informational and thermodynamic utility of quantum channels under physical constraints. As an application, we examine the consequences for private randomness distillation from energy-constrained quantum processes.

Title: Optimal Calibration of Qubit Detuning and Crosstalk
Authors: David Shnaiderov, Matan Ben Dov, Yoav Woldiger, Assaf Hamo, Eugene Demler, Emanuele G. Dalla Torre
Abstract: Characterizing and calibrating physical qubits is essential for maintaining the performance of quantum processors. A key challenge in this process is the presence of crosstalk that complicates the estimation of individual qubit detunings. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for estimating detuning and crosstalk parameters by optimizing Ramsey interference experiments using Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. We compare several calibration protocols, including measurements of a single quadrature at multiple times and of two quadratures at a single time, for a fixed number of total measurements. Our results predict that the latter approach yields the highest precision and robustness in both cases of isolated and coupled qubits. We validate experimentally our approach using a single NV center as well as superconducting transmons. Our approach enables accurate parameter extraction with significantly fewer measurements, resulting in up to a 50% reduction in calibration time while maintaining estimation accuracy.

Title: Hybrid quantum lattice model: Polaritons, photons, and spin waves propagation
Authors: Maritza Ahumada, Natalia Valderrama-Quinteros, Diego Tancara, Guillermo Romero
Abstract: Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional systems is pivotal for quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model, where each lattice unit integrates a single-mode resonator that interacts with a two-level system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLSs. This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and qubit-qubit interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insights into designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in low-dimensional quantum systems.
