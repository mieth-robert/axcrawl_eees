Title: Non-degenerate Ground State of the Spin-Boson Model under Abelian Diagonalization
Authors: Tao Liu, Juhao Wu, Mark Ying
Abstract: By utilizing a unitary transformation, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the degeneracy between the even- and odd-parity energy states of the spin-boson model (SBM). Employing the Rayleigh quotient of matrix algebra, we rigorously prove that the ground state energy of the SBM is lower than the systems lowest possible degenerate energy and possesses a definite parity. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for parity breaking, we provide an analytical expression for the parity-breaking critical value, which is closely related to the expansion order and computational accuracy. This expression reproduces the SBM phase diagram obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and logarithmic discretization numerical renormalization group (NRG) methods. However, this phase diagram does not characterize the ground state of the system.

Title: Time-domain decoding of unconventional charge order mechanisms in nonmagnetic and magnetic kagome metals
Authors: Seongyong Lee, Byungjune Lee, Hoyoung Jang, Xueliang Wu, Jimin Kim, Gyeongbo Kang, Choongjae Won, Hyeongi Choi, Sang-Youn Park, Kyle M. Shen, Federico Cilento, Aifeng Wang, Jae-Hoon Park, Mingu Kang
Abstract: In kagome lattice materials, quantum interplay between charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom gives rise to a remarkably rich set of emergent phenomena, ranging from unconventional charge order and superconductivity to topological magnetism. While the exact nature of these exotic orders is often challenging to comprehend in static experiments, time-resolved techniques can offer critical insights by disentangling coupled degrees of freedom on the time-axis. In this work, we demonstrate that the nature of charge orders in two representative kagome metals - nonmagnetic ScV6Sn6 and magnetic FeGe - which has been highly controversial in static studies, can be directly deciphered in the time-domain through their fundamentally distinct order parameter dynamics measured via time-resolved X-ray scattering at an X-ray free electron laser. In nonmagnetic ScV6Sn6, the dynamics are characterized by ultrafast melting and coherent amplitudon oscillations, typical of a phonon-coupled charge order. In stark contrast, magnetic FeGe exhibits resilient metastable charge order dynamics, hitherto unobserved in any other charge-ordered system - this unique time-domain behavior directly signifies an unconventional magnetism-interlocked charge order state realized in this kagome magnet. Our results not only provide a model case where unconventional nature of electronic order, hidden in equilibrium, is directly unraveled in the time-domain, but also pave the way for future out-of-equilibrium engineering of novel quantum orders in kagome lattice platforms.

Title: Non-linear in-plane spin current in spin-orbit coupled 2D hole gases
Authors: Srijan Chatterjee, Tarun Kanti Ghosh
Abstract: The non-linear transport of charge and spin due to the emergence of band geometric effects has garnered much interest in recent years. In this work, we show that a linear in-plane spin current vanishes, whereas a non-linear (second-order) in-plane spin current exists for a generic two-dimensional system having time-reversal symmetry. The intrinsic second-order spin current originates from the spin Berry curvature polarizability. The formulation when applied to 2D hole gases with the $k^3$ Rashba spin-orbit interaction reveals the existence of both transverse and longitudinal second-order in-plane spin currents normal to the spin orientation. Further, the effects of band anisotropy due to additional Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction or an electromagnetic radiation are explored, which allows the generation of additional in-plane spin currents parallel to the spin orientation in the same system. The time-reversal symmetry also prevents any out-of-plane spin current in the second-order. The generation and control over the multiple in-plane spin currents may have important applications in spintronic devices.

Title: Inverse method for determining general molecular weight distribution from polymer rheology
Authors: Nihal Pushkar, Xin C. Yee, Jena McCollum, Brandon Runnels
Abstract: Determination of polymer molecular weight distribution (MWD) from rheological measurements is desirable due to the ease and low cost of rheometry compared to other methods such as gel permeation chromatography. However, relating MWD to rheology requires the inversion of rheological models, for which there is no analytic solution. Prior approaches assume a functional form for the MWD (such as a lognormal or generalized exponential distribution), minimizing the error with respect to the functional form's degrees of freedom. While this is a powerful and robust technique for determining general polymer properties, such as average MWD or polydispersity, it requires former knowledge of the shape of the MWD. This work presents a generalized approach to solving the inverse problem directly, with no former knowledge of the MWD or assumptions regarding its functional form. To close the inverse problem and establish uniqueness, Lagrange multipliers constraints on the MWD are included. The method is applied with reptation-based models to a variety of polycarbonate, polyethylene and polystyrene polymers. For samples whose rheology are well-described by reptation, the predicted MWD is shown to match experimental measurements very well. For samples that are not well-described by reptation, the predicted MWD naturally differs from experiment. Nevertheless, the results still offer insight into how reptation-described polymers differ from their counterparts. This establishes the proposed inverse method as a viable practical tool for rheology-based characterization.

Title: Quantum and Semi-Classical Signatures of Dissipative Chaos in the Steady State
Authors: Griffith Rufo, Sabrina Rufo, Pedro Ribeiro, Stefano Chesi
Abstract: We investigate the quantum-classical correspondence in open quantum many-body systems using the SU(3) Bose-Hubbard trimer as a minimal model. Combining exact diagonalization with semiclassical Langevin dynamics, we establish a direct connection between classical trajectories characterized by fixed-point attractors, limit cycles, or chaos and the spectral and structural properties of the quantum steady state. We show that classical dynamical behavior, as quantified by the sign of the Lyapunov exponent, governs the level statistics of the steady-state density matrix: non-positive exponents associated with regular dynamics yield Poissonian statistics, while positive exponents arising from chaotic dynamics lead to Wigner-Dyson statistics. Strong symmetries constrain the system to lower-dimensional manifolds, suppressing chaos and enforcing localization, while weak symmetries preserve the global structure of the phase space and allow chaotic behavior to persist. To characterize phase-space localization, we introduce the phase-space inverse participation ratio IPR, which defines an effective dimension D of the Husimi distribution's support. We find that the entropy scales as $S \propto \ln N^D$, consistently capturing the classical nature of the underlying dynamics. This semiclassical framework, based on stochastic mixtures of coherent states, successfully reproduces not only observable averages but also finer features such as spectral correlations and localization properties. Our results demonstrate that dissipative quantum chaos is imprinted in the steady-state density matrix, much like in closed systems, and that the interplay between dynamical regimes and symmetry constraints can be systematically probed using spectral and phase-space diagnostics. These tools offer a robust foundation for studying ergodicity, localization, and non-equilibrium phases of open quantum systems.

Title: Quasi-1D Coulomb drag between spin-polarized quantum wires
Authors: Mingyang Zheng, Rebika Makaju, Rasul Gazizulin, Alex Levchenko, Sadhvikas J. Addamane, Dominique Laroche
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) quantum wires provide a versatile platform for studying strong electron-electron interactions and collective excitations under confinement. Coulomb drag between 1D systems offers a powerful probe of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) physics, with theoretical predictions suggesting distinct power-law in temperature dependencies between the spin-full and the spin-polarized regimes. However, experimental verification has thus far remained limited. Here, we report measurements of reciprocal and nonreciprocal Coulomb drag between vertically coupled quasi-1D quantum wires in the spin-polarized regime. Clear signatures of spin splitting are observed in both the wires conductance and the drag signal. We observed a connection between electron-hole asymmetry and negative drag, and demonstrated different power-law behaviors in spin-full and spin-polarized regimes, yielding consistent TLL interaction parameters. These results validate the theoretical predictions for backscattering induced drag in the reciprocal regime and extend them to the nonreciprocal and the multiple subband regimes. Furthermore, the nonmonotonic density dependence of the reciprocal interaction parameter correlates with the subband occupation of the drag wire, revealing the complexity of the scattering mechanisms in multichannel systems.

Title: Graphene Nanoribbons as a Majorana Platform
Authors: Ruize Ma, Michele Pizzochero, Gaurav Chaudhary
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons support a range of electronic phases that can be controlled via external stimuli. Zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs), in particular, exhibit an antiferromagnetic insulating ground state that transitions to a half-metallic phase under a transverse electric field or when embedded inside hexagonal Boron Nitride. Here, we consider a simple model of a heterostructure of a ZGNR with an Ising superconductor and show that, the Ising superconductor with a parent s-wave spin-singlet pairing can induce spin-triplet odd-parity pairing in the half-metallic phase of the ZGNR. The resulting superconducting phase is topologically nontrivial, with gate-tunable transitions that enable the emergence of Majorana zero modes.

Title: Electronic properties of multilayered Lieb, transition, and Kagome lattices
Authors: T. F. O. Lara, E. B. Barros, W. P. Lima, J. P. G. Nascimento, J. Milton Pereira Jr., T. A. S. Pereira, D. R. da Costa
Abstract: Based on the interconvertibility feature shared between monolayer Lieb and Kagome lattices, which allows mapping transition lattice's stages between these two limits ($\pi/2 \leq\theta \leq 2\pi/3$), in this work we extend the recently proposed one-control ($\theta$) parameter tight-binding model for the case of a multilayer Lieb-Kagome system, by considering the two most-common stacks: AA and AB (Bernal). We systematically study the band transformations between the two lattices by adjusting the interlayer hopping and distance, with or without considering the influence of the nearest interlayer neighbors, for different numbers of stacked layers, and under the application of an external perpendicular electric field. The energetic changes are understood from the perspective of the layer dependence of the pseudospin components and the total probability density distributions. The present framework provides an appropriate and straightforward theoretical approach to continuously investigate the evolution of electronic properties in the multilayer Lieb-Kagome system under various external effects.

Title: Interplay of Zeeman field, Rashba spin-orbit interaction, and superconductivity: spin susceptibility
Authors: Chen Pang, Yi Zhou
Abstract: We present a self-consistent theory to calculate the static and uniform spin susceptibility in superconductors under simultaneous Zeeman magnetic fields and Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Employing a single-band Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian, we solve the gap equation for both conventional $s$-wave spin-singlet and six representative $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing states, categorized into opposite-spin-pairing (OSP) and equal-spin-pairing (ESP) classes. The Kubo formula, decomposed into intra- and interband particle-hole and particle-particle channels, provides two key constraints: at zero temperature, only particle-particle terms contribute, while at the critical temperature $T_c$, only particle-hole terms remain, ensuring $\chi(T_c^{-}) = \chi_N$ for continuous phase transitions. For $s$-wave pairing, a Zeeman field reduces $T_c$, whereas Rashba SOC preserves $T_c$ but yields a residual zero temperature spin susceptibility $\chi(0)$ which approaches $2\chi_N/3$ in the strong SOC limit; combined fields create a Bogoliubov Fermi surface, resulting in a kink in $\chi(0)$. In contrast, $p$-wave states exhibit strong anisotropy: OSP states mimic spin-singlet pairing behavior for parallel Zeeman fields and ESP for transverse ones, while ESP states show the opposite, with Rashba SOC potentially changing the quasiparticle nodal structure, lowering $T_c$, or causing $\chi_{zz}(0)$ divergences. This framework offers quantitative benchmarks for Knight-shift experiments in non-centrosymmetric superconductors like A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = Na, K, Rb, and Cs), enabling diagnostics to disentangle pairing symmetry, SOC strength, and Zeeman effects.

Title: Strongly coupled interface ferroelectricity and interface superconductivity in LAO/KTO
Authors: M.D. Dong, X.B. Cheng, M. Zhang, J. Wu
Abstract: Interfaces can differ from their parent compounds in terms of charge, spin, and orbital orders and are fertile ground for emergent phenomena, strongly correlated physics, and device applications. Here, we discover that ferroelectric order resides at the interface of two oxides, LaAlO3/KTaO3(111) (LAO/KTO), where two seemingly mutually exclusive orders-ferroelectricity and superconductivity-coexist. Moreover, manipulating ferroelectricity can change the interfacial conductivity by more than 1000 times, simultaneously causing superconductivity to diminish and reappear due to the coupling between these phenomena. The ferroelectricity is confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy, and piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM). STEM reveals K ions are displaced relative to Ta ions, with the help of oxygen vacancies at the LAO/KTO interface. The resultant electric polarization is locally switchable by applying a voltage between the PFM tip and the LAO film. The ferroelectric hysteresis correlates with hysteresis change in interfacial conductivity and the superconducting transition temperature (Tc). The loss and reentrance of superconductivity are accounted for by orders of magnitude change in the Hall mobility induced by the polarization switching. These findings open the door to ferroelectric superconductivity with broken inversion symmetry and non-volatile modulation of superconductivity.

Title: Moiré-Polaritons in a Dark Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Moroni Santiago-García, Shunashi G. Castillo-López, David A. Ruiz-Tijerina, Arturo Camacho-Guardian
Abstract: Quantum mixtures of moiré excitons have arisen as a platform for realizing novel phases of light and matter. Here, we study moiré polaritons coupled to a Bose-Einstein condensate of dark-state excitons confined to a moiré superlattice. We develop a variational approach to analyze the optical response of the system and demonstrate that strong exciton-exciton interactions significantly modify the character of moiré polaritons, leading to sizable energy shifts of the avoided crossing between the principal polariton branches, and the emergence of an additional, stable repulsive-polariton bound state.

Title: Tuning spin-density separation via finite-range interactions: Dimensionality-driven signatures in dynamic structure factors
Authors: Xiaoran Ye, Yi Zhang, Ziheng Zhou, Zhaoxin Liang
Abstract: Spin-density separation, marked by distinct propagation velocities of spin and density excitations, epitomizes strong correlations, historically confined to one-dimensional (1D) systems. Recent ultracold quantum gas experiments, however, demonstrate its emergence in higher dimensions through precise tuning of intra- to interspecies interaction ratios, inspiring exploration of how dimensionality and interatomic interactions govern quantum correlations. We investigate this in two-component bosonic mixtures with finite-range interactions, probing 1D and three-dimensional (3D) dynamics. Using effective field theory within the one-loop approximation, we derive analytical expressions for zero-temperature ground-state energy and quantum depletion, seamlessly recovering contact interaction results in the contact limit. By crafting an effective action for decoupled density and spin modes, we compute dynamic structure factors (DSFs), revealing how finite-range interactions sculpt spin-density separation. A pivotal finding is the dimensionality-driven divergence in DSF peak dynamics: in 1D, peaks ascend to higher frequencies with increasing interaction strength, yielding sharp responses; in 3D, peaks descend to lower frequencies, with broader density wave profiles. These insights highlight dimensionality's critical role in collective excitations and provide a robust theoretical blueprint for probing interaction-driven quantum phenomena via Bragg spectroscopy, paving new pathways for exploring dimensionally tuned quantum correlations in ultracold quantum gases.

Title: Coherent tunneling of collective excitation of Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential
Authors: Yaojun Ying, Haoyu Wang, Ming Zhang, Haibin Li
Abstract: The Josephson effect can be observed in a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential, which is attributed to the tunneling of bosons between two wells. We propose a multi-mode theory to investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a one-dimensional condensate in a double-well potential. We show that the system can be described by two independent two-mode models. The Josephson oscillation and the self-trapping of local collective excitations are predicted analytically and confirmed by numerical simulation.

Title: High-Throughput Computation of Anharmonic Low-Frequency Protein Vibrations
Authors: Michael A. Sauer, Souvik Mondal, Madeline Cano, Matthias Heyden
Abstract: At room temperature, low frequency vibrations at far-infrared frequencies are thermally excited ($k_B T > h \nu$) and not restricted to harmonic fluctuations around a single potential energy minimum. For folded proteins, these intrinsically anharmonic vibrations can contain information on slow conformational transitions. Recently, we have developed FREquency-SElective ANharmonic (FRESEAN) mode analysis, a method based on time correlation functions that isolates low-frequency vibrational motions from molecular dynamics simulation trajectories without relying on harmonic approximations. We recently showed that low-frequency vibrations obtained from FRESEAN mode analysis are effective collective variables in enhanced sampling simulations of conformational ensembles. However, FRESEAN mode analysis is based on velocity time correlations between all degrees of freedom, which creates computational challenges for large biomolecules. To facilitate future applications, we demonstrate here how coarse-graining of all-atom simulation trajectories can be combined with FRESEAN mode analysis to extract information on low-frequency vibrations at minimal computational cost.

Title: Generative thermodynamic computing
Authors: Stephen Whitelam
Abstract: We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected noise or active control of denoising.

Authors: Stephen Whitelam, Corneel Casert, Megan Engel, Isaac Tamblyn
Abstract: We present a set of computer codes designed to test methods for optimizing time-dependent control protocols in fluctuating nonequilibrium systems. Each problem consists of a stochastic model, an optimization objective, and C++ and Python implementations that can be run on Unix-like systems. These benchmark systems are simple enough to run on a laptop, but challenging enough to test the capabilities of modern optimization methods. This release includes five problems and a worked example. The problem set is called NESTbench25, for NonEquilibrium STatistical mechanics benchmarks (2025).

Title: A Coordination-Based Model for the Prediction of Surface Energies and the Shape of Metal Particles
Authors: Shyama Charan Mandal, Frank Abild-Pedersen
Abstract: Surface energies of metal-based systems are important for determining the Wulff-constructed shapes of metal nanoparticles and understanding the stability. We have developed a coordination number-based model to predict the total energy of metal-based systems across a wide range of configurations. Our model has been tested against Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for late transition metals. This method enables on-the-fly surface energy predictions and allows for the Wulff construction of metal particles for a random number of elemental atoms and without the need for DFT calculations. By making a division between atoms in the different layers of the model system we can considerably improve the accuracy of the model, suggesting a dissimilarity between the electronic structure due to an alternating compression and expansion of atomic layers in the near-surface region. We find that our model accurately and effectively provides valuable insights into the distribution and stability of nanoparticle surfaces.

Title: Random walk with multiple memory channels: a new paradigm
Authors: Surajit Saha
Abstract: A new class of one-dimensional, discrete time random walk model with memory, termed "Random walk with $n$ memory channels" (RW$n$MC) is proposed. In this model the information of $n$ ($n\in \mathbb{Z}$) previous steps from the walker's entire history are needed to decide future step. Exact calculation of the mean and variance of position of the RW2MC ($n=2$) has been done which shows that it can lead to asymptotic diffusive and superdiffusive behavior in different parameter regimes. A connection between RW$n$MC and Pólya type urn model evolving by $n$ drawings has also been reported. This connection for the RW2MC is discussed in detail which suggests the applicability of RW$2$MC in many population dynamics model with multiple competing species.

Title: Fundamentals of the metal contact to p-type GaN: new multilayer design
Authors: Konrad Sakowski, Paweł Strak, Stanislaw Krukowski
Abstract: Electrical properties of contact to p-type nitride semiconductor devices, based on gallium nitride were simulated by ab initio and by drift-diffusion calculations. The contact electric properties are shown to be dominated by electron transfer form metal to GaN related to Fermi level difference both by ab initio and model calculation. The results indicate on high potential barrier for holes leading to nonohmic character of the contact. The electrical nature of the Ni-Au contact formed by annealing in oxygen atmosphere is elucidated. The doping influence on the potential profile in p-type GaN was calculated by in drift-diffusion model. The energy barrier height and width for hole transport is determined. Based on these results, new type of the contact, is proposed. The contact is created employing multiple layer implantation of the deep acceptors. The implementation of such design promise to attain superior characteristics (resistance) as compared to other contacts used in bipolar nitride semiconductor devices. The development of such contact will remove one of the main obstacles in the development of highly efficient nitride optoelectronic devices both LEDs and LDs: energy loss and the excessive heat production close to the multiple quantum wells system

Title: Effect of Rashba spin-orbit coupling on topological phases in monolayer ZnIn2Te4
Authors: Jun-Jie Zhang, Shuai Dong
Abstract: The interplay of Rashba and quantum spin Hall effects in non-centrosymmetric systems presents both challenges and opportunities for spintronic applications. While Rashba spin-orbit coupling can disrupt the quantum spin Hall phase, their coexistence may enable additional spintronic functionalities by coupling spin-momentum locking in the bulk with topologically protected edge states. Using the ZnIn$_2$Te$_4$ monolayer as a case study-a predicted polar two-dimensional topological insulator-we investigate how intrinsic and Rashba spin-orbit coupling compete within a single material. Our results identify key conditions under which sizable Rashba spin splitting can coexist with a stable quantum spin Hall phase, offering guidance for engineering quantum spin Hall insulators with enhanced spintronic capabilities.

Title: Segregation and cooperation in active colloidal binary mixtures
Authors: Laura Alvarez, Elena Sesé-Sansa, Demian Levis, Ignacio Pagonabarraga, Lucio Isa
Abstract: The complex interactions underlying collective motion in biological systems give rise to emergent behaviours such as flocking, sorting, and cooperative transport. These dynamics often involve species with different motilities coordinating movement to optimize navigation and survival. Synthetic analogues based on active colloids offer a controlled platform to explore such behaviours, yet most experimental realizations remain limited to monodisperse systems or mixtures of passive and active particles. Here, we investigate dense binary mixtures of active Janus colloids with distinct motilities and independently tunable alignment, actuated by AC electric fields. We demonstrate experimentally and numerically that both species form highly dynamic polar clusters, with alignment emerging independently of propulsion speed. In mixed populations, interspecies interactions lead to effective segregation and cooperative motion, including transient enhancement of slower particle motility. Our results reveal how motility contrast and alignment combine to drive self-organization in active mixtures, offering strategies for designing reconfigurable materials with collective functionalities.

Title: Impact of Mechanical Stress on IGZO TFTs: Enhancing PBTI Degradation
Authors: K. Vishwakarma, K. Lee, A. Kruv, A. Chasin, M. J. van Setten, C. Pashartis, O. O. Okudur, M. Gonzalez, N. Rassoul, A. Belmonte, B. Kaczer
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of out-of-plane compressive mechanical stress (MS) on the performance and reliability of n-channel IGZO thin film transistors (TFTs). It is demonstrated that MS induces a positive Vth shift in the device transfer characteristics and enhances electron trapping during Positive Bias Temperature Instability (PBTI) tests. These effects are attributed to the widening of the IGZO bandgap (EG) and increased accessibility of carriers to AlOX gate oxide trap levels. As substantial residual MS is generated in 3D device processing, understanding its impact on IGZO TFTs is crucial for enabling future 3D DRAM technology.

Title: Autonomous life-like behavior emerging in active and flexible microstructures
Authors: Mengshi Wei, Daniela J. Kraft
Abstract: Many organisms leverage an interplay between shape and activity to generate motion and adapt to their environment. Embedding such feedback into synthetic microrobots could eliminate the need for sensors, software, and actuators, yet current realizations are either active but rigid, or flexible but passive. Here, we introduce micrometer-scale structures that integrate both activity and flexibility by 3D microprinting concatenated units and actuating them with an AC electric field. This minimal yet versatile design gives rise to a rich array of life-like modes of motion - including railway and undulatory locomotion, rotation, and beating - as well as emergent sense-response abilities, which enable autonomous reorientation, navigation, and collision avoidance. Our approach offers a versatile platform for designing biomimetic model systems and autonomously operating microrobots with embodied intelligence.

Title: Algal Optics
Authors: Ming Yang, Sumit Kumar Birwa, Raymond E. Goldstein
Abstract: Nearly a decade ago it was discovered that the spherical cell body of the alga $Chlamydomonas~reinhardtii$ can act as a lens to concentrate incoming light onto the cell's membrane-bound photoreceptor and thereby affect phototaxis. Since many nearly transparent cells in marine environments have complex, often non-axisymmetric shapes, this observation raises fundamental, yet little-explored questions in biological optics about light refraction by the bodies of microorganisms. There are two distinct contexts for such questions: the $absorption$ problem for $incoming$ light, typified by photosynthetic activity taking place in the chloroplasts of green algae, and the $emission$ problem for $outgoing$ light, where the paradigm is bioluminescence emitted from scintillons within dinoflagellates. Here we examine both of these aspects of ``algal optics" in the special case where the absorption or emission is localized in structures that are small relative to the overall organism size, taking into account both refraction and reflections at the cell-water boundary. Analytical and numerical results are developed for the distribution of light intensities inside and outside the body, and we establish certain duality relationships that connect the incoming and outgoing problems. For strongly non-spherical shapes we find lensing effects that may have implications for photosynthetic activity and for the angular distribution of light emitted during bioluminescent flashes.

Title: Dynamic buckling of Si tetramers on the Si(111)-7x7
Authors: R. Zhachuk, J. Coutinho, D. Sheglov
Abstract: The atomic structure of Si tetramers that form on the Si$(111)\textrm{-}7\times7$ surface during homoepitaxy, is investigated by means of first principles calculations with the currently available atomistic model as starting point. It is demonstrated that the rectangular shape of the Si tetramer is unstable against buckling. Comparison of calculated results with available scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) data provides a new understanding of the problem, indicating that the recorded STM images are influenced by dynamic buckling.

Title: An efficient forgetting-aware fine-tuning framework for pretrained universal machine-learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Jisu Kim, Jiho Lee, Sangmin Oh, Yutack Park, Seungwoo Hwang, Seungwu Han, Sungwoo Kang, Youngho Kang
Abstract: Pretrained universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized computational materials science by enabling rapid atomistic simulations as efficient alternatives to ab initio methods. Fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs offers a practical approach to improving accuracy for materials and properties where predictive performance is insufficient. However, this approach often induces catastrophic forgetting, undermining the generalizability that is a key advantage of pretrained MLIPs. Herein, we propose reEWC, an advanced fine-tuning strategy that integrates Experience Replay and Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to effectively balance forgetting prevention with fine-tuning efficiency. Using Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl (LPSC), a sulfide-based Li solid-state electrolyte, as a fine-tuning target, we show that reEWC significantly improves the accuracy of a pretrained MLIP, resolving well-known issues of potential energy surface softening and overestimated Li diffusivities. Moreover, reEWC preserves the generalizability of the pretrained MLIP and enables knowledge transfer to chemically distinct systems, including other sulfide, oxide, nitride, and halide electrolytes. Compared to Experience Replay and EWC used individually, reEWC delivers clear synergistic benefits, mitigating their respective limitations while maintaining computational efficiency. These results establish reEWC as a robust and effective solution for continual learning in MLIPs, enabling universal models that can advance materials research through large-scale, high-throughput simulations across diverse chemistries.

Title: Subthreshold Swing Behavior in Amorphous Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide Transistors from Room to Cryogenic Temperatures
Authors: Hongwei Tang, Attilio Belmonte, Dennis Lin, Ying Zhao, Arnout Beckers, Patrick Verdonck, Harold Dekkers, Subhali Subhechha, Michiel van Setten, Zhuo Chen, Gouri Sankar Kar, Jan Van Houdt, Valeri Afanas'ev
Abstract: While cryogenic-temperature subthreshold swing (SS) in crystalline semiconductors has been widely studied, a careful study on the temperature-dependent SS in amorphous oxide semiconductors remains lacking. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of the SS in thin-film transistors with an amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) channel at temperatures from 300 K down to 4 K is presented. Main observations include: 1) At room temperature (300 K), the devices exhibit a SS of 61 mV/dec, and a low interface trap density (<1011 cm-2), among the best reported values for IGZO devices. 2) A SS saturation around 40 mV/dec is observed between 200 K and 100 K. It is well explained by the electron transport via band tail states with exponential decay (Wt) of 13 meV. 3) At deep-cryogenic temperature, SS increase significantly exceeding 200 mV/dec at 4 K. Such high SS values are actually limited by the measurement current range, confirmed by Id-Vg simulations based on the variable range hopping (VRH) model. This work not only elucidates the SS behavior in amorphous IGZO devices but also provides a deep understanding of the physical mechanisms of electron transport in amorphous semiconductors.

Title: Ferroelectric switching control of spin current in graphene proximitized by In$_2$Se$_3$
Authors: Marko Milivojević, Juraj Mnich, Paulina Jureczko, Marcin Kurpas, Martin Gmitra
Abstract: By utilizing the proximity effect, we introduce a platform that exploits ferroelectric switching to modulate spin currents in graphene proximitized by ferroelectric In$_2$Se$_3$ monolayer. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling, we studied the electronic structure of graphene/In$_2$Se$_3$ heterostructure for twist angles of 0$^{\circ}$ and 17.5$^{\circ}$, considering both ferroelectric polarizations. We discover that switching the ferroelectric polarization reverses the sign of the charge-to-spin conversion coefficients, acting as a chirality switch of the in-plane spin texture in graphene. For the twisted heterostructure, we observed emergence of unconventional radial Rashba field for one ferroelectric polarization direction. Additionally, we demonstrated that the Rashba phase can be directly extracted from the ratio of conversion efficiency coefficients, providing a straightforward approach to characterize the in-plane spin texture in graphene. All the unique features of the studied graphene/In$_2$Se$_3$ heterostructure can be experimentally detected, offering a promising approach for developing advanced spintronic devices with enhanced performance and efficiency.

Title: Ultra-low-resistivity nitrogen-doped p-type Cu2O thin films fabricated by reactive HiPIMS
Authors: Jiří Rezek, Jan Koloros, Jiří Houška, Radomír Čerstvý, Stanislav Haviar, Jemal Yimer Damte, David Kolenatý, Pavel Baroch
Abstract: We have successfully fabricated the nitrogen-doped cuprous oxide thin films on the amorphous standard soda-lime glass by reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering. The energy of film-forming particles was controlled by the value of pulse-averaged target power density, which has a significant impact on the elemental composition, structure and optoelectrical properties of the films. We have shown that the high-energy regime is more suitable for preserving Cu2O structure and leads to continuous substitution of oxygen by nitrogen compared with the low-energy regime. Moreover, in the high-energy regime, it is possible, to some extent, to independently control the electrical resistivity and optical properties. The electrical resistivity decreases down to 5 x10-2 this http URL at the optical band gap 2.0-2.3 eV. Special attention is paid to the formation of nitrogen molecules and their ability to form shallow acceptor states. Experimental results supported by our DFT calculations indicate that N2 replacing Cu in the Cu2O lattice is one possible (but not the only possible) acceptor. We have also found that the formation of nitrogen molecules is preferred in a high-energy regime.

Title: Anomalous energy correlations and spectral form factor in the nonergodic phase of the $β$-ensemble
Authors: Basudha Roy, Adway Kumar Das, Anandamohan Ghosh, Ivan M. Khaymovich
Abstract: The $\beta$-ensemble is a prototypical model of a single particle system on a one-dimensional disordered lattice with inhomogeneous nearest neighbor hopping. Corresponding nonergodic phase has an anomalous critical energy scale, $E_c$: correlations are present above and absent below $E_c$ as reflected in the number variance. We study the dynamical properties of the $\beta$-ensemble where the critical energy controls the characteristic timescales. In particular, the spectral form factor equilibrates at a relaxation time, $t_\mathrm{R} \equiv E_c^{-1}$, which is parametrically smaller than the Heisenberg time, $t_\mathrm{H}$, given by the inverse of the mean level spacing. Incidentally, the dimensionless relaxation time, $\tau_\mathrm{R} \equiv t_\mathrm{R}/t_\mathrm{H} \ll 1$ is equal to the Dyson index, $\beta$. We show that the energy correlations are absent within a temporal window $t_\mathrm{R} < t < t_\mathrm{H}$, which we term as the correlation void. This is in contrast to the mechanism of equilibration in a typical many-body system. We analytically explain the qualitative behavior of the number variance and the spectral form factor of the $\beta$-ensemble by a spatially local mapping to the Anderson model.

Title: Highly anisotropic magnetic phase diagram of the ferromagnetic rare-earth diboride HoB$_{2}$
Authors: Takafumi D. Yamamoto, Hiroyuki Takeya, Kensei Terashima, Akiko T. Saito, Yoshihiko Takano
Abstract: Rare-earth (RE) compounds have been of enormous interest in condensed matter physics as a platform for the exploration of interesting physical phenomena. Here, we report the successful single crystal growth of HoB$_{2}$, which exhibits a paramagnetic (PM)-ferromagnetic (FM) phase transition at 15 K and another phase transition at 11 K, and the discovery of a highly anisotropic magnetic phase diagram of this FM diboride. Magnetization measurements suggest that the ferromagnetically ordered moments of Ho$^{3+}$ ions are oriented at a direction tilted by 50 degrees from the ab-plane at 2K, which rotate largely toward the ab-plane direction upon application of a magnetic field, but hardly toward the c-axis direction. Heat capacity and electrical resistivity measurements clearly demonstrate that the low-temperature phase transition at 11 K occurs even under high magnetic fields along the ab-plane direction, whereas it disappears immediately by magnetic fields along the c-axis direction. Moreover, the field-induced crossover phenomenon between FM and PM phases near 15 K is found to be more promoted when applying a magnetic field along the ab-plane direction. The resulting magnetic phase diagram reveals that in-plane magnetic anisotropy is predominant in the present system, which contradicts the previous report of a spin reorientation phenomenon toward the c-axis direction between 11 K and 15 K. Taken together, the present findings suggest the presence of strong competition between in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic anisotropies in HoB$_{2}$, giving rise to the unique FM spin arrangement.

Title: Strain-tuning for superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films
Authors: Motoki Osada, Chieko Terakura, Akiko Kikkawa, Masamichi Nakajima, Hsiao-Yi Chen, Yusuke Nomura, Yoshinori Tokura, Atsushi Tsukazaki
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-transition temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) superconductivity in pressurized La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ bulk crystals has attracted keen attention due to its characteristic energy diagram of $e_{g}$ orbitals, containing nearly half-filled $d_{3z^2 - r^2}$ and quarter-filled $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ orbitals. This finding provides valuable insights into the orbital contributions and interlayer interactions in double NiO$_{6}$ octahedra, offering opportunities to control the electronic structure via ligand field variations. Here, we demonstrate strain-tuning of $T_\mathrm{c}$ over a range of 50 K in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ films grown on different oxide substrates under 20 GPa. As the $c/a$ ratio increases, the onset $T_\mathrm{c}$ systematically rises from 10 K in the tensile-strained film on SrTiO$_{3}$ to a maximum of about 60 K in the compressively strained film on LaAlO$_{3}$. These systematic variations suggest that strain engineering is a promising strategy for expanding superconductivity in bilayer nickelates by tuning the orbital energy landscape toward high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity.

Title: SOT Enabled 3D Magnetic Field Sensor with Low Offset and High Sensitivity
Authors: Sebastian Zeilinger, Johannes Güttinger, Klemens Prügl, Michael Kirsch, Joshua M. Salazar-Mejía, Sabri Koraltan, Philip Heinrich, Sophie Zeilinger, Bernd Aichner, Florian Bruckner, Hubert Brückl, Armin Satz, Dieter Suess
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate a spin-orbit torque (SOT) magnetic field sensor, designed as a Ta/CoFeB/MgO structure, with high sensitivity and capable of active offset compensation in all three spatial directions. This is described and verified in both experiment and simulation. The measurements of magnetic fields showed an offset of 36, 50, and 37$\mathrm{\mu T}$ for x-, y-, and z-fields. Furthermore, the sensitivities of these measurements had values of 590, 580, and 490$\mathrm{V\,A^{-1}\,T^{-1}}$ in the x-, y-, and z-direction. In addition, the robustness to bias fields is demonstrated via experiments and single spin simulations by applying bias fields in y-direction. Cross sensitivities were further analyzed via single spin simulations performing a parameter sweep of different bias fields in the y- and z-direction up to $\pm$1mT. Finally, the extraction of the SOT parameters $\eta_\mathrm{DL}$ and $\eta_\mathrm{FL}$ is shown via optimization of a single-spin curve to the experimental measurements.

Title: High-Entropy Skutterudites as Thermoelectrics: Synthesizability and Band Convergence via the Cocktail Effect
Authors: Jose J. Plata, Antonio Morales-Altarejos, Elena R. Remesal, Victor Posligua, Antonio M. Márquez
Abstract: High entropy materials offer a promising avenue for thermoelectric materials discovery, design, and optimization. However, the large chemical spaces that need to be explored hamper their development. In this work, a large family of high-entropy skutterudites is explored as promising thermoelectric materials. Their synthesizability is screened and rationalized using the disordered enthalpy-entropy descriptor through high-throughput density functional theory calculations. In the case of high-entropy skutterudites, the thermodynamic density of states and the entropy gain parameter appear to be key factors for their stabilization. Electronic band structure analyses not only show a reduction in the band gap, which enhances carrier concentration and electrical conductivity, but also a band convergence phenomenon for some specific compositions, which is related to the "cocktail effect". Analyzing atom-projected band structures shows how band convergence is due to the simultaneous presence of Fe, Ni, and Co in the compound. The presence of Rh or Ir, while not contributing to this band convergence effect, can be directly linked to an increase in system's entropy, which enhances the thermodynamic stability of these materials.

Title: Supercurrent modulation in InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions by scanning gate microscopy
Authors: Antonio Lombardi, Gaurav Shukla, Giada Bucci, Sedighe Salimian, Valentina Zannier, Simone Traverso, Samuele Fracassi, Niccolo Traverso Ziani, Maura Sassetti, Matteo Carrega, Fabio Beltram, Lucia Sorba, Stefan Heun
Abstract: InSb nanoflags represent an interesting platform for quantum transport and have recently been exploited in the study of hybrid planar Josephson junctions. Due to the uncovered semiconductor surface, they are also good candidates for surface probe techniques. Here, we report the first Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) experiments on Nb-contacted InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions. In the normal state, sizable conductance modulation via the charged tip of the SGM is recorded. In the superconducting state, we report the first application of Scanning Gate Microscopy to superconducting weak links, demonstrating the possibility of manipulating the supercurrent flow across a semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure at a local level. The experimental findings are consistent with theoretical predictions and establish a new way of investigating the behavior of superconducting weak links, towards the local imaging of supercurrent flow.

Title: Microgravity-assisted off-axis spin vortex in a $^{87}$Rb dipolar spinor Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Hui Tang, Wenxian Zhang
Abstract: The generation of the ground state of a spin vortex in a $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein condensate with the assistance of an optical plug has been studied. However, gravity is everywhere, and this potential linear dependence on the spatial position will destroy the axisymmetric structure of the system with the optical plug. In this case, the question of whether the spin vortex ground state still exists remains unresolved. The present study aims to explore the impact of microgravity on the formation of the spin vortex state with the assistance of an optical plug. To this end, a simple model has been employed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. The Gross-Pitaevskii equations are solved by setting the optical plug intensity, adjusting the optical plug width, and adjusting the microgravity strength. This process results in the phase diagram for the single-mode state and spin vortex state. Under microgravity situations, we observe an off-axis structure of the spin vortex state. Our calculations offer a reliable approach to generating spin vortex states in a microgravity environment.

Title: Successive Phase Transitions in the Quasi-Kagome Lattice System URhSn Studied by Resonant X-ray Scattering
Authors: Chihiro Tabata, Fusako Kon, Ruo Hibino, Yusei Shimizu, Hiroshi Amitsuka, Koji Kaneko, Yoshiya Homma, Dai Aoki, Hironori Nakao
Abstract: Successive phase transitions in the quasi-kagome compound URhSn were investigated by resonant X-ray scattering (RXS) at the uranium $M_4$ edge. In the high-temperature phase between 16 K and 54 K, an additional RXS signal was detected superposed onto fundamental reflections in both $\pi$-$\sigma'$ and $\pi$-$\pi'$ polarization channels. Upon cooling below 16 K, reported as a ferromagnetic phase along $c$, substantial enhancements were observed again in the both polarization channels at the 300 reflection, demonstrating a simultaneous emergence of in-plane spin alongside the $c$-axis ferromagnetic components. The observed behavior can be interpreted by an antiferro-quadrupole (AFQ) order of $O_{yz}$ or $O_{zx}$ characterized by a propagation vector $q = 0$ in the intermediate phase, which then coexists with a ferromagnetic component below 16 K. The resulting ground state structure breaks the mirror symmetry perpendicular to the kagome plane, identifying the formation of a unique AFQ order with either chirality or polarity in URhSn.

Title: The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties
Authors: Vittorio Erba, Nathan Malo Kupferschmid, Rodrigo Pérez Ortiz, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.

Title: Towards High-Efficiency Solar Cells: Insights into AsNCa 3 Antiperovskite as Active Layer
Authors: M. Irfan, B. D. Aparicio-Huacarpuma, C. M. de Oliveira Bastos, M. J. Piotrowski, C. R. C. Rêgo, D. Guedes-Sobrinho, R. Besse, A. M. Almeida Silva, Alexandre C. Dias, L. A. Ribeiro Jr
Abstract: Advances in photovoltaic technology are a viable route to contribute to cleaner and more sustainable energy solutions, placing perovskite-based materials among the best candidates for solar energy conversion. However, some challenges must be addressed to enhance their performance and stability. Herein, we report an investigation of the AsNCa3 antiperovskite system for its potential in photovoltaic devices. We consider eight distinct crystalline phases, their structural parameters, dynamical stability, and electronic and optical properties. Furthermore, we consider each structural phase's contributions to solar harvesting efficiency by calculating the power conversion efficiency (PCE) using the spectroscopiclimited maximum efficiency (SLME) formalism, which in this case reaches a maximum of 31.2%. All dynamically stable phases exhibit a band gap around 1.3 eV, which lies within the optimal range for single-junction solar cells and yields PCE values comparable to the theoretical maximum PCE for silicon. These results place AsNCa3 antiperovskites as promising candidates for high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Notably, the PCE is only slightly changed by structural phase modification, suggesting that phase transitions induced by environmental conditions during device operation might not compromise device performance.

Title: Devitrification and Melting Dynamics in Vapor Deposited Water Ice
Authors: Fabio Leoni, Fausto Martelli, John Russo
Abstract: The equilibration dynamics of ultrastable glasses subjected to heating protocols has attracted recent experimental and theoretical interest. With simulations of the mW water model, we investigate the devitrification and melting dynamics of both conventional quenched (QG) and vapor deposited (DG) amorphous ices under controlled heating ramps. By developing an algorithm to reconstruct hydrogen-bond networks, we show that bond ring statistics correlates with the structural stability of the glasses and allows tracking crystalline and liquid clusters during devitrification and melting. We find that QG melts in the bulk, whereas melting in DG preferentially begins near the free surface. During devitrification, the DG shows an excess of 5-membered rings near the free surface, which is consistent with its tendency to nucleate the crystal phase in this region. Additionally, the DG shows an Avrami exponent exceeding the standard 1+d behavior, while both glasses display the same sub-3d growth of liquid clusters across heating rates, indicating that the DG enhanced exponent stems from its higher kinetic stability.

Title: Generalized Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport
Authors: Guan-Hua Huang, Hui Tang, Shizhong Zhang, Zhongbo Yan, Zhigang Wu
Abstract: In spin-orbit-coupled systems the charge and spin transport are generally coupled to each other, namely a charge current will induce a spin current and vice versa. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry $\mathcal{T}$, the cross-coupling transport coefficients describing how one process affects the other are constrained by the famous Onsager reciprocal relations. In this paper, we generalize the Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport to systems that break the time-reversal symmetry but preserve a combined symmetry of $\mathcal{T}$ and some other symmetry operation $\mathcal{O}$. We show that the symmetry or antisymmetry of the cross-coupling transport coefficients remains in place provided that the operator $\mathcal{O}$ meets certain conditions. Among many candidate systems where our generalized Onsager relations apply, we focus on a conceptually simple and experimentally realized model in cold atomic systems for explicit demonstration and use these relations to predict highly non-trivial transport phenomena that can be readily verified experimentally.

Title: Solitonic Andreev Spin Qubit
Authors: Pablo San-Jose, Elsa Prada
Abstract: We propose a novel type of superconducting spin qubit, dubbed solitonic Andreev spin qubit (SASQ), that combines features of Andreev spin qubits and geometric spin qubits. The two SASQ states are the degenerate spin orientations of an Andreev bound state trapped in a circular Josephson junction with a Corbino disk geometry, created on a 2DEG. The junction is subjected to a weak magnetic flux that induces a fluxoid mismatch between the inner disk and outer ring superconductors. The fluxoid mismatch produces a cancellation of the induced pairing that traps unconventional spin-degenerate Andreev bound states analogous to Jackiw-Rebbi solitons. They are localized at a position around the junction that can be controlled by changing the superconducting phase difference. Moving a soliton with a phase bias induces a holonomic rotation of its spin, by virtue of the spin-orbit coupling in the 2DEG. The holonomic qubit trajectories can densely cover the full Bloch sphere as the soliton revolves around the junction. Effects of non-holonomic (dynamic) qubit drift are also analyzed.

Title: A new angle on stacking faults: Breaking the edge-on limit in high-resolution defect analysis
Authors: Nicolas Karpstein, Lukas Müller, Andreas Bezold, Steffen Neumeier, Erdmann Spiecker
Abstract: The nature of stacking faults - whether intrinsic or extrinsic - plays a pivotal role in defect-mediated processes in crystalline materials. Yet, current electron microscopy techniques for their reliable analysis remain limited to either conventional fringe-contrast imaging of inclined faults or atomic-resolution imaging of edge-on configurations. Here, we overcome this dichotomy by introducing a high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) method that enables full structural discrimination of inclined stacking faults in fcc and $L1_2$ crystals. This approach eliminates a long-standing geometric constraint on high-resolution analysis, providing comprehensive access to stacking faults on all glide planes along the widely used [001] and [110] zone axes. We demonstrate the robustness of the method in a CoNi-based superalloy, achieving clear discrimination of fault types even in overlapping configurations and foil thicknesses exceeding 100 nm. Simulations reveal that fault-induced de-channeling is key to contrast formation and is strongly governed by the fault's depth within the sample. Leveraging this effect, we further establish a route to artificially generate ultrathin TEM lamellae - bounded by the stacking fault itself - thereby enhancing contrast for atomic-scale studies of long-range ordering, compositional fluctuations, and nanoclustering.

Title: Unconventional Spin Dynamics and Supersolid Excitations in the Triangular-Lattice XXZ Model
Authors: Rafael Flores-Calderón, Roderich Moessner, Frank Pollmann
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\Gamma$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\Gamma$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $\Gamma$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.

Title: Intertwined magnetic phase driven exchange bias and its impact on the anomalous Hall effect in MnBi$_4$Te$_7$
Authors: Nazma Firdosh, Shreyashi Sinha, Indraneel Sinha, Mainpal Singh, Satyabrata Patnaik, Sujit Manna
Abstract: We report on the interplay between atomic scale inhomogeneity and competing magnetic phases and its effect on the anomalous Hall effect in the layered antiferromagnet MnBi$_4$Te$_7$, a natural superlattice hosting coexisting ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. Using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), DC and AC magnetization, and magneto-transport measurements, we reveal that intrinsic Mn Bi antisite defects induce strong interlayer exchange coupling, giving rise to a robust exchange bias observed in both magnetic and Hall responses. The exchange bias undergoes a transition from asymmetric to symmetric behavior between 2 K and 6 K, indicating a temperature driven dynamical reconfiguration of interfacial spin structures. The training effect analysis revealed a stronger contribution of frozen spins at 2 K compared to 6 K, with relaxation amplitude shift from -264 Oe to 306 Oe. This sign reversal indicates a field-induced change in interfacial coupling. The temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity and magnetization reveals complementary behavior, indicating the coexistence of two distinct spin states near the magnetic transition temperature. The phase fraction based resistivity model captures the distinct scattering mechanisms that govern electronic transport across different magnetic regimes. Our findings offer a direct link between microscopic disorder, interfacial magnetism and macroscopic topological phenomena in magnetic topological insulators.

Title: Theory of universal Planckian metal in t-J model: application for high-Tc cuprate superconductors
Authors: Yung-Yeh Chang, Khoe Van Nguyen, Kimberly Remund, Chung-Hou Chung
Abstract: The mysterious quantum-critical Planckian bad metal phase with perfect T-linear resistivity persisting beyond the quasi-particle limit and universal T-linear scattering rate has been observed in various high-Tc cuprate superconductors. Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.

Abstract: In this work, we have performed a comprehensive study of dielectric materials NbOX2 (X=Cl, Br, and I) within the framework of density functional theory, incorporating both conventional and hybrid this http URL studies focus on the structure, electronic, elastic, and piezoelectric properties. Piezoelectricity is an innovative avenue to extract energy by manipulating the material's structures via mechanical stress. The use of non-lead-based material for piezoelectricity added an advantage of a greener approach. Among the investigated materials, bulk NbOI2 exhibits the highest piezoelectric response of 6.32 C/m$^2$, which is around 31% higher than NbOCl2, NbOBr2 and even lead zirconate titanate.

Title: Quantum metric and localization in a quasicrystal
Authors: Quentin Marsal, Patric Holmvall, Annica M. Black-Schaffer
Abstract: We use the quantum metric to understand the properties of quasicrystals, represented by the one-dimensional (1D) Fibonacci chain. We show that the quantum metric can relate the localization properties of the eigenstates to the scale-invariance of both the chain and its energy spectrum. In particular, the quantum metric incorporates information about distances between the local symmetry centers of each eigenstate, making it much more sensitive to the localization properties of quasicrystals than other measures of localization, such as the inverse participation ratio. We further find that a full description of localization requires us to introduce a new phasonic component to the quantum metric, and a mixed phason-position Chern number. Finally, we show that the sum of both position and phasonic components of the quantum metric is lower-bounded by the gap labels associated with each energy gap of the Fibonacci chain. This establishes a direct link between the spatial localization and fractal energy spectrum of quasicrystals. Taken together, the quantum metric provides a unifying, yet accessible, understanding of quasicrystals, rooted in their scale-invariance and with intriguing consequences also for many-body physics.

Title: Advanced Langevin thermostats: Properties, extensions to rheology, and a lean momentum-conserving approach
Authors: Shubham Agarwal, Sergey V. Sukhomlinov, Marc Honecker, Martin H. Müser
Abstract: The Langevin equation accounts for unresolved bath degrees of freedom driving the system toward the bath temperature. Because of this, numerical solutions of the Langevin equation have a long history. Here, we recapitulate, combine, and extend existing Langevin-equation based thermostats, scrutinize their properties and demonstrate their superiority over global kinetic-energy controls. Our work includes compact, asymptotic-analysis based derivations of stochastic thermostats, including the highly accurate Grønbech-Jensen scheme. Proposed extensions include a precise, colored and a lean, momentum-conserving thermostat.

Title: Learning to flock in open space by avoiding collisions and staying together
Authors: Martino Brambati, Antonio Celani, Marco Gherardi, Francesco Ginelli
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of cohesive flocking in open, boundless space using a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. Agents integrate positional and orientational information from their closest topological neighbours and learn to balance alignment and attractive interactions by optimizing a local cost function that penalizes both excessive separation and close-range crowding. The resulting Vicsek-like dynamics is robust to algorithmic implementation details and yields cohesive collective motion with high polar order. The optimal policy is dominated by strong aligning interactions when agents are sufficiently close to their neighbours, and a flexible combination of alignment and attraction at larger separations. We further characterize the internal structure and dynamics of the resulting groups using liquid-state metrics and neighbour exchange rates, finding qualitative agreement with empirical observations in starling flocks. These results suggest that flocking may emerge in groups of moving agents as an adaptive response to the biological imperatives of staying together while avoiding collisions.

Title: Revealing the Breakdown Mechanism and Heat Dissipation in Few-Layered semimetallic PtSe2
Authors: Bubunu Biswal, Abinash Tripathy, Renu Yadav, Abhishek Misra
Abstract: Platinum diselenide (PtSe2) is an emerging two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide known for its excellent electrical and optical properties, along with remarkable air stability. For PtSe2-based electronic devices, understanding high-field breakdown and heat dissipation is crucial for designing high-performance and energy-efficient systems operating under extreme conditions. In this work, we investigate the breakdown mechanisms of semimetallic PtSe2 at both low and room temperatures. Heat dissipation is quantified via interfacial thermal conductivity (ITC) of PtSe2/SiO2 and PtSe2/h-BN interfaces using Raman thermometry. Our findings indicate that at room temperature, device breakdown is predominantly governed by self-heating effects. Conversely, at low temperatures, the breakdown is mainly driven by carrier multiplication under high electric fields, as further confirmed by Hall measurements.

Title: Maximizing solubility in rock salt high-entropy oxides
Authors: Matthew Furst, Joseph Petruska, Dhiya Srikanth, Jacob T. Sivak, Susan B. Sinnott, Christina M. Rost, Jon-Paul Maria, Saeed S. I. Almishal
Abstract: To explore and quantitatively map the cation-size mismatch solubility limits in high-entropy oxides (HEOs), we report on Ca$^{2+}$ substitution in prototypical MgCoNiCuZnO, because, while isovalent, Ca$^{2+}$ is 38% larger than its partners' average ionic radii. Using the thermodynamics-grounded bond-length distribution descriptor, we identify Ca$^{2+}$-Cu$^{2+}$ interactions as the primary prospective lattice destabilizer. Bulk synthesis confirms only 4% Ca solubility with Cu at 950$^o$C, modestly rising to 5% after Cu removal at 1150$^o$C. We then employ far-from-equilibrium pulsed-laser deposition to investigate metastable solubility: epitaxial films incorporate 10% Ca with Cu and a full 20% Ca without, doubling and quadrupling the respective bulk limits. This Ca uptake additionally enables deterministic lattice-parameter control via Ca concentration. Overall, our results demonstrate both the extended solubility possible in HEO systems, particularly when accessing metastable states through quenching from high-energy plasma, and that the specific constellation of solid-solvent cations can be rationally engineered to minimize bond-length distributions when largely misfit cations are added, thus expanding the accessible compositional space.

Title: Determining the chemical potential via universal density functional learning
Authors: Florian Sammüller, Matthias Schmidt
Abstract: We demonstrate that the machine learning of density functionals allows one to determine simultaneously the equilibrium chemical potential across simulation datasets of inhomogeneous classical fluids. Minimization of an implicit loss function based on an Euler-Lagrange equation yields both the universal one-body direct correlation functional, which is represented locally by a neural network, as well as the system-specific unknown chemical potential values. The method can serve as an efficient alternative to conventional computational techniques of measuring the chemical potential. It also facilitates using canonical training data from Brownian dynamics, molecular dynamics, or Monte Carlo simulations as a basis for constructing neural density functionals, which are fit for accurate multiscale prediction of soft matter systems in equilibrium.

Title: Duplication-divergence growing graph models
Authors: Dario Borrelli
Abstract: In recent decades, it has been emphasized that the evolving structure of networks may be shaped by interaction principles that yield sparse graphs with a vertex degree distribution exhibiting an algebraic tail, and other structural traits that are not featured in traditional random graphs. In this respect, through a mean-field approach, this review tackles the statistical physics of graph models based on the interaction principle of duplication-divergence. Additional sophistications extending the duplication-divergence model are also reviewed as well as generalizations of other known models. Possible research gaps and related prior results are then discussed.

Title: Flips Reveal the Universal Impact of Memory on Random Explorations
Authors: Julien Brémont, Léo Régnier, Alex Barbier--Chebbah, Olivier Bénichou, Raphaël Voituriez
Abstract: Quantifying space exploration is a central question in random walk theory, with direct applications ranging from animal foraging, diffusion-limited reactions, and intracellular transport to stock markets. In particular, the explored domain by one or many simple memoryless (or Markovian) random walks has received considerable attention . However, the physical systems mentioned above typically involve significant memory effects, and so far, no general framework exists to analyze such systems. We introduce the concept of a \emph{flip}, defined most naturally in one dimension, where the visited territory is $[x_{\rm min}, x_{\rm max}]$: a flip occurs when, after discovering a new site at $x_{\rm max}$, the walker next discovers $x_{\rm min} - 1$ instead of $x_{\rm max} + 1$ (and vice-versa). While it reduces to the classical splitting probability in Markovian systems, we show that the flip probability serves as a key observable for quantifying the impact of memory effects on space exploration. Here, we demonstrate that the flip probability follows a strikingly simple and universal law: it decays inversely with the number of sites visited, as \(1/n\), independently of the underlying stochastic process. We confirm this behavior through simulations across paradigmatic non-Markovian models and observe it in real-world systems, without relying on model assumptions, including biological tracer motion, DNA sequences, and financial market dynamics. Finally, we reveal the physical mechanism behind this universality and show how it extends to higher-dimensional and fractal domains. Our determination of universal flip statistics lay the groundwork for understanding how memory effects govern random explorations.

Title: A Machine Learning Framework for Modeling Ensemble Properties of Atomically Disordered Materials
Authors: Zhenyao Fang, Ting-Wei Hsu, Qimin Yan
Abstract: Disorder, though naturally present in experimental samples and strongly influencing a wide range of material phenomena, remains underexplored in first-principles studies due to the computational cost of sampling the large supercell and configurational space. The recent development of machine learning techniques, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), has enabled the efficient and accurate predictions of complex material properties, offering promising tools for studying disordered systems. In this work, we introduce a computational framework that integrates GNNs with Monte Carlo simulations for efficient calculations of thermodynamic properties and ensemble-averaged functional properties of disordered materials. Using the surface-termination-disordered MXene monolayer \ch{Ti3C2T}$_{2-x}$ as a representative system, we investigate the effect of surface termination disorder involving \ch{-F}, \ch{-O}, and termination vacancies on the electrical and optical conductivity spectra. We find that surface termination disorder affects the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity, inducing a peak close to the order-disorder phase transition temperature that reflects the competition between scattering and electron filling effects of the surface termination groups across the phase transition. In contrast, optical conductivity remains robust to local disorder across a wide temperature range and is governed primarily by the global chemical composition of surface terminations. These results demonstrate the utility of our machine-learning-assisted framework for statistically modeling disorder effects and ensemble properties in complex materials, opening new avenues for future studies of disorder-driven phenomena in systems such as high-entropy alloys and disordered magnetic compounds.

Title: Fokker-Planck Score Learning: Efficient Free-Energy Estimation under Periodic Boundary Conditions
Authors: Daniel Nagel, Tristan Bereau
Abstract: Accurate free-energy estimation is essential in molecular simulation, yet the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) commonly used in computer simulations have rarely been explicitly exploited. Equilibrium methods such as umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and adaptive biasing force require extensive sampling, while non-equilibrium pulling with Jarzynski's equality suffers from poor convergence due to exponential averaging. Here, we introduce a physics-informed, score-based diffusion framework: by mapping PBC simulations onto a Brownian particle in a periodic potential, we derive the Fokker-Planck steady-state score that directly encodes free-energy gradients. A neural network is trained on non-equilibrium trajectories to learn this score, providing a principled scheme to efficiently reconstruct the potential of mean force (PMF). On benchmark periodic potentials and small-molecule membrane permeation, our method is up to one order of magnitude more efficient than umbrella sampling.

Title: Machine learning based prediction of dynamical clustering in granular gases
Authors: Sai Preetham Sata, Ralf Stannarius, Benjamin Noack, Dmitry Puzyrev
Abstract: When dense granular gases are continuously excited under microgravity conditions, spatial inhomogeneities of the particle number density can emerge. A significant share of particles may collect in strongly overpopulated regions, called clusters. This dynamical clustering, or gas-cluster transition, is caused by a complex interplay and balance between the energy influx and dissipation in particle collisions. Particle number density, container geometry, and excitation strength influence this transition. We perform Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations for ensembles of frictional spheres in a cuboid container and apply the Kolmogorov Smirnov test and a caging criterion to the local packing fraction profiles to detect clusters. Machine learning can be used to study the gas-cluster transition, and can be a promising alternative to identify the state of the system for a given set of system parameters without time-consuming complex DEM simulations. We test various machine learning models and identify the best models to predict dynamical clustering of frictional spheres in a specific experimental geometry.

Title: Anisotropic Josephson coupling of d-vectors arising from interplay with frustrated spin textures
Authors: Grayson R. Frazier, Junyi Zhang, Yi Li
Abstract: We propose a Cooper pair analogue of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya's anisotropic coupling for $d$-vectors in an inhomogeneous unconventional superconductor, which can arise when itinerant electrons couple to a local exchange field of frustrated spin moments. Using perturbative Green's function methods, we examine an $s$-$d$ model on a geometrically frustrated lattice with noncollinear spin texture that breaks time-reversal and parity symmetries, leading to spin-triplet pairing correlations. The effective Josephson tunneling in the presence of such an exchange field leads to an anisotropic Josephson coupling between $d$-vectors, which prefers a spatially inhomogeneous pairing order. Furthermore, we discuss anomalous vortices arising from the spatially inhomogeneous $d$-vector in the absence of a magnetic field for nonunitary triplet pairing order. We also propose a Josephson diode effect in which the diode efficiency is proportional to the spin chirality of the local exchange field. Our results can help understand the experiments in superconducting proximitized Mn$_3$Ge and in 4Hb-TaS$_2$.

Title: Enhanced two-dimensional ferromagnetism in van der Waals $β$-UTe$_3$ monolayers
Authors: S. M. Thomas, A. E. Llacsahuanga, W. Simeth, C. S. Kengle, F. Orlandi, D. Khalyavin, P. Manuel, F. Ronning, E. D. Bauer, J. D. Thompson, Jian-Xin Zhu, A. O. Scheie, Yong P. Chen, P. F. S. Rosa
Abstract: The discovery of local-moment magnetism in van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors down to the single-layer limit has led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of two-dimensional (2D) magnets and unleashed their potential for applications in microelectronic and optoelectronic devices. The incorporation of strong electronic and magnetic correlations in 2D vdW metals remains a sought-after platform not only to enable control of emergent quantum phases, such as superconductivity, but also to achieve more theoretically tractable microscopic models of complex materials. To date, however, there is limited success in the discovery of such metallic vdW platforms, and $f$-electron monolayers remain out of reach. Here we demonstrate that the actinide $\beta$-UTe$_3$ can be exfoliated to the monolayer limit. A sizable electronic specific heat coefficient provides the hallmark of strong correlations. Remarkably, $\beta$-UTe$_3$ remains ferromagnetic in the half-unit-cell limit with an enhanced ordering temperature of 35 K, a factor of two larger than its bulk counterpart. Our work establishes $\beta$-UTe$_3$ as a novel materials platform for investigating and modeling correlated behavior in the monolayer limit and opens numerous avenues for quantum control with, e.g., strain engineering.

Title: Kinetic magnetism in the crossover between the square and triangular lattice Fermi-Hubbard models
Authors: Darren Pereira, Erich J. Mueller
Abstract: We calculate the spin correlations that result from the motion of a single dopant in the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model, as the geometry evolves from a square to a triangular lattice. In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.

Title: Two-dimensional Parallel Tempering for Constrained Optimization
Authors: Corentin Delacour, M Mahmudul Hasan Sajeeb, Joao P. Hespanha, Kerem Y. Camsari
Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.

Title: Mixed platinum and zirconia powder as electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reaction
Authors: Simone Minelli, Manuel Iozzia, Claudio Piazzoni, Alberto Vertova, Cristina Lenardi, Alessandro Minguzzi
Abstract: The development of efficient and cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen-related technologies is crucial for the transition to sustainable energy. In this work, we present Pt@ZrO2 as a high-performance ceramic-based electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), demonstrating superior activity and stability in alkaline conditions. Compared to Pd@ZrO2, previously investigated in our earlier work, Pt@ZrO2 exhibits significantly lower charge transfer resistance and enhanced HER/HOR kinetics, as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The synergistic interaction between platinum and ZrO2 stabilizes Pt in a partially oxidized state, facilitating the Volmer step and improving charge transfer kinetics. Cyclic voltammetry further confirms the remarkable electrochemical stability of Pt@ZrO2 under stress conditions. Importantly, Pt@ZrO2 offers a cost-effective alternative to pure platinum by reducing noble metal loading while maintaining excellent catalytic performance. These findings establish Pt@ZrO2 as a better alternative to Pd@ZrO2 and a promising candidate for next-generation hydrogen energy applications.

Title: Accurate and Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Task Prediction of HEA Properties Using Prior-Guided Deep Gaussian Processes
Authors: Sk Md Ahnaf Akif Alvi, Mrinalini Mulukutla, Nicolas Flores, Danial Khatamsaz, Jan Janssen, Danny Perez, Douglas Allaire, Vahid Attari, Raymundo Arroyave
Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations. This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic, heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics. Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and data-efficient materials design.

Title: MXene triggers high toughness, high strength and low hysteresis hydrogels for printed artificial tissue
Authors: Chendong Zhao, Yaxing Li, Qinglong He, Shangpeng Qin, Huiqi Xie, Chuanfang Zhang
Abstract: Substituting load-bearing tissues requires hydrogels with rapid processability, excellent mechanical strength and fatigue resistance. Conventional homogeneously polymerized hydrogels with short-chains/excessive branching exhibit low strength/toughness, being inadequate for artificial tissues. Here we introduce the heterogeneous polymerization-accelerated reaction kinetics on the Ti3C2Tx MXene microreactor and sluggish kinetics beyond-to rapidly produce hydrogels within minutes. This allows the hyperbranched domains embedded within a highly entangled matrix, leading to excellent strength (2.4 MPa)/toughness (75.2 kJ m-2) and low hysteresis (2.9%) in hydrogels superior to the rest ones. The rapid liquid-to-solid transition triggered by MXene suggests the great possibility of 3D printed robust hydrogels toward artificial tissue. Importantly, these printed hydrogels-based artificial ligaments have demonstrated impressive load-bearing capacity, wear resistance, and suturability compared to commercial analogs.

Title: MOFClassifier: A Machine Learning Approach for Validating Computation-Ready Metal-Organic Frameworks
Authors: Guobin Zhao, Pengyu Zhao, Yongchul G. Chung
Abstract: The computational discovery and design of new crystalline materials, particularly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), heavily relies on high-quality, computation-ready structural data. However, recent studies have revealed significant error rates within existing MOF databases, posing a critical data problem that hinders efficient high-throughput computational screening. While rule-based algorithms like MOSAEC, MOFChecker, and the Chen and Manz method (Chen-Manz) have been developed to address this, they often suffer from inherent limitations and misclassification of structures. To overcome this challenge, we introduce MOFClassifier, a novel machine learning approach built upon a positive-unlabeled crystal graph convolutional neural network (PU-CGCNN) model. MOFClassifier learns intricate patterns from perfect crys-tal structures to predict a crystal-likeness score (CLscore), effectively classifying MOFs as computation-ready. Our model achieves a ROC value of 0.979 (previous best 0.912) and, importantly, can identify subtle structural and chemical errors that are fundamentally undetectable by current rule-based methods. By accurately recovering previously misclassified false-negative structures, MOFClassifier reduces the risk of overlooking promising material candidates in large-scale computational screening efforts. This user-friendly tool is freely available and has been integrated into the preparation workflow for the updated CoRE MOF DB 2025 v1, contributing to accelerated computational discovery of MOF materials.

Title: The Cosmological Constant from a Quantum Gravitational $θ$-Vacua and the Gravitational Hall Effect
Authors: Stephon Alexander, Heliudson Bernardo, Aaron Hui
Abstract: We provide a new perspective on the cosmological constant by exploring the background-independent Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of general relativity. The Chern-Simons-Kodama state of quantum gravity, a generalization of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin states, has a striking structural similarity to the topological field theory of the quantum Hall effect. As a result, we study the gravitational topological $\theta$-sectors in analogy to Yang-Mills theory. We find that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is intimately linked to the $\theta$-parameter by $\theta=12\pi^2/(\Lambda \ell^2_{\rm Pl}) \mod 2\pi$ due to the fact that Chern-Simons-Kodama state must live in a particular $\theta$-sector. This result is shown in the canonical, non-perturbative formalism. Furthermore, we explain how the physics of the Hamiltonian constraint is analogous to the quantum Hall effect, with the cosmological constant playing the role of a quantum gravitational Hall resistivity. These relations suggest that $\Lambda$ is topologically protected against perturbative graviton loop corrections, analogous to the robustness of quantized Hall conductance against disorder in a metal.

Title: Free real scalar CFT on fuzzy sphere: spectrum, algebra and wavefunction ansatz
Authors: Yin-Chen He
Abstract: We introduce a simple model to realize the free real scalar CFT on the fuzzy sphere. The model is structurally similar to the original model that realizes the 3D Ising CFT on the fuzzy sphere. Owing to the shift symmetry of the free scalar, the free scalar CFT fixed point in our model can be accessed with only a single tuning parameter-the conformal coupling. We numerically demonstrate that our model correctly reproduces the operator spectrum, correlation functions, and, crucially, the harmonic oscillator algebra of the real scalar CFT. We also examine the fuzzy sphere algebra, a generalization of the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, and discuss its potential implications for defining quantum field theories on non-commutative geometries. Finally, we propose wavefunction ansatz for the ground states of both the free scalar and Ising CFTs, which exhibit remarkable agreement with the CFT ground state wavefunctions of the fuzzy sphere model. For instance, the wavefunction overlap between our Ising ansatz and the Ising CFT ground state exceeds $0.99$ for $N=28$ fermions, suggesting a promising direction for tackling the 3D Ising CFT.

Title: Revised identification of strain gradient elastic parameters
Authors: Luca Placidi, Anil Misra, Gabriele La Valle, Casey Rodriguez
Abstract: The work reported in ``Granular micromechanics-based identification of isotropic strain gradient parameters for elastic geometrically nonlinear deformations" misidentified key terms in the grain-pair objective relative displacement when accounting for the second gradient of placement. In this paper, we correct that oversight by deriving a revised expression for the grain-pair objective relative displacement within the granular micromechanics framework. The amended terms, which resemble Christoffel symbols expressed in terms of strain gradients, modify the contributions of both the normal and tangential components to the strain energy and, consequently, alter the identified strain gradient elastic parameters. Importantly, the identification of the standard (first gradient) elastic tensor remains unchanged. This brief paper presents the corrected derivation, the resulting stiffness tensors for anisotropic strain gradient elasticity, and updated analytical expressions for the material parameters in both 2D and 3D isotropic settings.

Title: Recent solution to the Casimir puzzle awaits its experimental confirmation
Authors: V.M.Mostepanenko, G.L.Klimchitskaya
Abstract: The plausible resolution of the Casimir puzzle implying that the dissipative Drude model is not applicable in the area of transverse electric evanescent waves is discussed. Calculations show that for the propagating waves, as well for the evanescent waves with transverse magnetic polarization, the Drude model can beused in calculations of the Casimir force by the Lifshitz theory with no contradictions with the measurement data. The lateral component of magnetic field of the magnetic dipole oscillating near a metallic surface is computed for the parameters of experiment in preparation which is aimed to directly check the validity of the Drude model in the area of transverse electric evanescent waves. By comparing with the case of graphene, whose dielectric response is spatially nonlocal and possesses the double pole at zero frequency, it is hypothesized that the success of the dissipationless plasma model in this area is also caused by the presence of a double pole.

Title: Path Integral Monte Carlo in the Angular Momentum Basis for a Chain of Planar Rotors
Authors: Estêvão de Oliveira, Muhammad Shaeer Moeed, Pierre-Nicholas Roy
Abstract: We introduce a Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach that uses the angular momentum representation for the description of interacting rotor systems. Such a choice of representation allows the calculation of momentum properties without having to break the paths. The discrete nature of the momentum basis also allows the use of rejection-free Gibbs sampling techniques. To illustrate the method, we study the collective behavior of $N$ confined planar rotors with dipole-dipole interactions, a system known to exhibit a quantum phase transition from a disordered to an ordered state at zero temperature. Ground state properties are obtained using the Path Integral Ground State (PIGS) method. We propose a Bond-Hamiltonian decomposition for the high temperature density matrix factorization of the imaginary time propagator. We show that \textit{cluster-loop} type moves are necessary to overcome ergodicity issues and to achieve efficient Markov Chain updates. Ground state energies and angular momentum properties are computed and compared with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) benchmark results. In particular, the derivative of the kinetic energy with respect to the interaction strength estimator is presented as a successful order parameter for the detection of the quantum phase transition.

Title: Response of Comagnetometer to Exotic Spin-Dependent Couplings
Authors: Yixin Zhao, Xiang Peng, Teng Wu, Hong Guo
Abstract: Comagnetometers offer unique advantages in measuring exotic spin-dependent interactions by suppressing magnetic noise. Understanding the frequency response to exotic interactions is essential for evaluating and improving the sensitivity of comagnetometers, as the signals often exhibit distinct spectral features. We conduct theoretical and experimental studies on the frequency response of a differential comagnetometer. We derive analytical expressions for the frequency response of the differential comagnetometer to both magnetic field and exotic couplings, along with the conversion relationship between them. Based on this, we revise the method for determining the axion-nucleon coupling strength with comagnetometers. Furthermore, we introduce a light-shift-based calibration protocol to verify the response to exotic interactions. This work helps predict the sensitivity of comagnetometers in detecting exotic fields and advances the exploration of dark matter.

Title: An Atomic Cluster Expansion Potential for Twisted Multilayer Graphene
Authors: Yangshuai Wang, Drake Clark, Sambit Das, Ziyan Zhu, Daniel Massatt, Vikram Gavini, Mitchell Luskin, Christoph Ortner
Abstract: Twisted multilayer graphene, characterized by its moire patterns arising from inter-layer rotational misalignment, serves as a rich platform for exploring quantum phenomena. While first-principles calculations are computationally prohibitive and empirical interatomic potentials often lack accuracy, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) present a promising alternative, offering (near-)DFT accuracy at a significantly reduced computational cost. Despite their success in two-dimensional monolayer materials, MLIPs remain under-explored in twisted multilayer graphene systems. In this work, we develop an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential for simulating twisted multilayer graphene and test it on a range of simulation tasks. We propose an approach to construct training and test datasets that incorporate all possible twist angles and local stacking, including incommensurate ones. To achieve this, we generate configurations with periodic boundary conditions suitable for DFT calculations, and then introduce an internal twist and shift within those supercell structures. We further refine the dataset through active learning filtering, guided by Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our model is validated for accuracy and robustness through a wide range of numerical tests.

Title: Aperiodic Dissipation as a Mechanism for Steady-State Localization
Authors: Shilpi Roy, Jiangbin Gong
Abstract: Dissipation is traditionally regarded as a disruptive factor in quantum systems because it often leads to decoherence and delocalization. However, recent insights into engineered dissipation reveal that it can be tuned to facilitate various quantum effects, from state stabilization to phase transitions. In this work, we identify aperiodic dissipation as a mechanism for inducing steady-state localization, independent of disorder or a quasiperiodic potential in the Hamiltonian. This localization arises from long-range phase correlations introduced by a spatially varying dissipation phase parameter, which enables nontrivial interference in the steady-state. By systematically comparing two classes of aperiodic dissipation (defined as commensurate and incommensurate cases), we find that incommensurate modulation plays the most efficient role in stabilizing a localized steady-state. Our analysis, based on coherence measures, purity, and participation ratio, reveals a direct link between eigenstate coherence and real-space localization, showing that dissipation can actively shape localization rather than simply causing decoherence. These findings highlight aperiodic dissipation as a viable approach to controlling localization in open quantum systems, potentially enabling new ways to manipulate quantum states and design dissipation-driven phases.

Title: Optical spin-orbit interaction induced by magnetic textures
Authors: Martin Luttmann, Mauro Fanciulli, Pietro Carrara, Maurizio Sacchi, Thierry Ruchon
Abstract: Contrary to the optical spin angular momentum (SAM), the role played by the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light in magneto-optics remains largely unexplored. However, the SAM and OAM are known to be coupled when light interacts with non-homogeneous and non-isotropic materials. Here we predict that the OAM carried by each photon in a light beam is modified upon reflection on magnetic textures like skyrmions, and that the sign of this variation is governed by the SAM of the incident field. Our predictions can be readily tested by performing circular dichroism measurements, and may provide new routes to shape light's angular momentum with magnetism.

Title: Slip flows of a Bingham fluid in curved channels
Authors: S.J. Cox, S.M. Taghavi
Abstract: Motivated by the treatment of varicose veins with aqueous foams, we determine the velocity profiles and yield surface positions for pressure-driven flows of a Bingham fluid in curved channels, incorporating Navier wall slip to capture the slip behavior of aqueous foams. Assuming a constant pressure gradient -- consistent with syringe-driven injection in sclerotherapy -- we reproduce a closed-form analytic solution for the flow in a straight channel, and extend this to a uniformly curved channel consisting of a section of an annulus. We find that increasing the slip length in the curved channel moves the unyielded fluid, or plug, towards the inside of the channel and slightly decreases the plug width. Channels with a change in curvature are tackled numerically, with a procedure that is validated against the analytic results. We solve for the flow of a Bingham fluid in the transition region between a straight and a uniformly curved channel and in a non-uniform sinusoidal channel where the wall curvature changes continuously. We find that there is greater yielding of the fluid in curved channels, caused by an increase in the shear stresses. As the slip length increases, there is a reduction in the area of unyielded fluid in regions of high wall curvature. In the context of varicose vein sclerotherapy, our results suggest that slip has both positive and negative consequences: it reduces the possibility of static regions of foam developing in areas of high curvature in the vein, but also reduces the plug width in general, reducing the efficacy with which the foam displaces blood from the vein.

Title: Knowledge Distillation Framework for Accelerating High-Accuracy Neural Network-Based Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Naoki Matsumura, Yuta Yoshimoto, Yuto Iwasaki, Meguru Yamazaki, Yasufumi Sakai
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy.

Title: Dynamical Phase Diagram of the REM under independent spin-flips
Authors: Chokri Manai, Simone Warzel
Abstract: We study the energy landscape of the Random Energy model (REM) integrated along trajectories of the simple random walk on the hypercube. We show that the quenched cumulant generating function of the time integral of the REM energy undergoes phase transitions in the large $N$ limit for trajectories of any time extent, and identify phases distinguished by the activity and value of the time integral. This is achieved by relating the dynamical behavior to the spectral properties of Hamiltonians associated with the Quantum Random Energy Model (QREM). Of independent interest are deterministic $ \ell^p $-properties of the resolvents of such Hamiltonians, which we establish.

Title: Excitation Amplitude Sampling for Low Variance Electronic Structure on Quantum Computers
Authors: Connor Lenihan, Oliver J. Backhouse, Tom W. A. Montgomery, Phalgun Lolur, M. J. Bhaseen, George H. Booth
Abstract: We combine classical heuristics with partial shadow tomography to enable efficient protocols for extracting information from correlated ab initio electronic systems encoded on quantum devices. By proposing the use of a correlation energy functional and sampling of a polynomial set of excitation amplitudes of the quantum state, we can demonstrate an almost two order of magnitude reduction in required number of shots for a given statistical error in the energy estimate, as well as observing a linear scaling to accessible system sizes. Furthermore, we find a high-degree of noise resilience of these estimators on real quantum devices, with up to an order of magnitude increase in the tolerated noise compared to traditional techniques. While these approaches are expected to break down asymptotically, we find strong evidence that these large system arguments do not prevent algorithmic advantage from these simple protocols in many systems of interest. We further extend this to consider the extraction of beyond-energetic properties by mapping to a coupled cluster surrogate model, as well as a natural combination within a quantum embedding framework. This embedding framework avoids the unstable self-consistent requirements of previous approaches, enabling application of quantum solvers to realistic correlated materials science, where we demonstrate the volume-dependence of the spin gap of Nickel Oxide.

Title: Time-bin encoded quantum key distribution over 120 km with a telecom quantum dot source

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology

Authors: Matej Bajec, Alexander Soloviev
Abstract: Correlators at finite density and temperature encode important information about a physical system, such as transport and causality. For a massive gas of particles in the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory, we provide complete analytic results for all first order transport coefficients, including thermoelectric coefficients. We demonstrate the first complete picture of the complex structure of the correlators as a function of mass, providing an interpretation in terms of the causal structure of lightcones. We provide a simple criterion to extract the effective lightcone velocity from the cut of the retarded correlator.

Title: Fast, continuous and coherent atom replacement in a neutral atom qubit array
Authors: Yiyi Li, Yicheng Bao, Michael Peper, Chenyuan Li, Jeff D. Thompson
Abstract: Neutral atom quantum processors are a promising platform for scalable quantum computing. An obstacle to implementing deep quantum circuits is managing atom loss, which constitutes a significant fraction of all errors. Current approaches are either not capable of replacing lost atoms in the middle of a circuit -- and therefore restricted to fixed, short circuit depths -- or require more than an order of magnitude longer time than gate and measurement operations to do so. In this work, we demonstrate fast, continuous atom replacement leveraging the metastable $^{171}$Yb qubit. A continuously loaded reservoir near the computation zone enables on-demand atom extraction with tweezers up to 500 times per second. New qubit arrays can be prepared 30 times per second when including single-atom preparation, non-destructive imaging and initialization. Importantly, existing qubits are completely undisturbed by the reloading process, owing to the extreme isolation of the metastable qubit from cooling and imaging light. This work establishes a complete foundation for implementing fast quantum circuits with unlimited depth, removing a final roadblock for fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms.

Title: The interplay of phase fluctuations and nodal quasiparticles: ubiquitous Fermi arcs in two-dimensional d-wave superconductors
Authors: Xu-Cheng Wang, Xiao Yan Xu, Yang Qi
Abstract: We propose that the pseudogap and Fermi arcs can universally emerge due to thermal (static) phase fluctuations in the normal state of 2D nodal superconductors. By considering a minimal phenomenological model with spatially fluctuating superconducting pairings, we theoretically investigate the role of superconducting phase fluctuations in generic 2D superconductors with disorder-average technique. It is shown for nodal d-wave superconductors that phase fluctuations mediate the scattering of d-wave quasiparticles, smearing out the nodal quasiparticle gap and further leading to pseudogap and Fermi arcs. Moreover, the evolution of Fermi arcs is quantitatively described by two emergent characteristic length scales of the system: one is the finite superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)$, and another the nodal BCS coherence length $\xi_\text{BCS}(k)$. To support our theoretical findings, we numerically report the observation of Fermi arcs in a Hubbard-like model, proposed originally by X. Y. Xu and T. Grover in Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{126}$, 217002 (2021), with sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculations. As far as we noticed, it is the first time in a correlated model that Fermi arcs are identified with unbiased simulations. The numerical results for the scattering rate $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ of Cooper pairs exhibit excellent agreements with our theoretical predictions, where $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ is expected to scale linearly with the inverse superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)^{-1}$. This convergence of theory and numerics thereby strongly validates the universal connection between phase fluctuations and Fermi arcs in 2D nodal superconductors.

Title: All product eigenstates in Heisenberg models from a graphical construction
Authors: Felix Gerken, Ingo Runkel, Christoph Schweigert, Thore Posske
Abstract: Recently, large degeneracy based on product eigenstates has been found in spin ladders, kagome-like lattices, and motif magnetism, connected to spin liquids, anyonic phases, and quantum scars. We unify these systems by a complete classification of product eigenstates of Heisenberg XXZ Hamiltonians with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on general graphs in the form of Kirchhoff rules for spin supercurrent. By this, we construct spin systems with extensive degree of degeneracy linked to exotic condensates which could be studied in atomic gases and quantum spin lattices.

Title: Non-invertible symmetry-protected topological order in a group-based cluster state
Authors: Christopher Fechisin, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Victor V. Albert
Abstract: Despite growing interest in beyond-group symmetries in quantum condensed matter systems, there are relatively few microscopic lattice models explicitly realizing these symmetries, and many phenomena have yet to be studied at the microscopic level. We introduce a one-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian composed of group-based Pauli operators whose ground state is a $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$-symmetric state: the $G \textit{ cluster state}$ introduced in Brell, New Journal of Physics 17, 023029 (2015) [at this http URL]. We show that this state lies in a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase protected by $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, distinct from the symmetric product state by a duality argument. We identify several signatures of SPT order, namely protected edge modes, string order parameters, and topological response. We discuss how $G$ cluster states may be used as a universal resource for measurement-based quantum computation, explicitly working out the case where $G$ is a semidirect product of abelian groups.

Title: Transition from edge- to bulk-currents in the quantum Hall regime
Authors: Serkan Sirt, Vladimir Y. Umansky, Afif Siddiki, Stefan Ludwig
Abstract: The integer quantum Hall effect can be observed in a two-dimensional conductor penetrated by a perpendicular magnetic field and with edges connecting the current carrying contacts. Its signature is a state of quantized Hall and simultaneously vanishing longitudinal resistances. A widely accepted model is the Landauer-Büttiker picture, which assumes an incompressible, i.e., electrically insulating bulk state surrounded by current carrying one-dimensional edge channels. This single-particle model is challenged by the screening theory. It derives, that electron-electron interaction leads to a fragmentation of the Hall bar into compressible and incompressible strips, where the current flows inside the incompressible strips. Because the latter gradually shift from the sample edges into the bulk as the magnetic field is increased, it suggests a transition from edge- to bulk-current. We present a direct experimental proof of this transition. Our results support the screening theory.

Title: Quantum Magnetic Skyrmions on Kondo-type Lattices
Authors: Zhen Zhao, Emil Östberg, Ferdi Aryasetiawan, Claudio Verdozzi
Abstract: A quantum description is given of nanoskyrmions in 2D textures with localised spins and itinerant electrons, isolated or coupled to leads, in or out-of-equilibrium. The spin-electron exchange is treated at the mean-field level, while Tensor Networks and exact diagonalization or nonequilibrium Green's functions are used for localised spins and itinerant electrons. We motivate our scheme via exact and mean-field benchmarks, then show by several examples that itinerant electrons distinctly affect the properties of quantum nanoskyrmions. Finally, we mention lines of future work and improvement of the approach.

Title: Stability and decay of subradiant patterns in a quantum gas with photon-mediated interactions
Authors: Alexander Baumgärtner, Simon Hertlein, Tom Schmit, Davide Dreon, Carlos Máximo, Xiangliang Li, Giovanna Morigi, Tobias Donner
Abstract: Metastability and its relaxation mechanisms challenge our understanding of the stability of quantum many-body systems, revealing a gap between the microscopic dynamics of the individual components and the effective descriptions used for macroscopic observables. We observe excited self-ordered subradiant patterns in a quantum gas coupled to two optical cavities and report lifetimes far beyond the system's typical timescales. These patterns eventually decay through an abrupt transition reordering the atoms into a superradiant phase. Ab-initio theory fully captures this macroscopic behavior, revealing that the subradiant patterns are stabilized by photon-mediated long-range interactions, thereby manifesting universal features of metastability characteristic of long-range interacting systems, as in astrophysics and plasma physics. Our work sheds light on the microscopic mechanisms stabilizing quantum states of matter and highlights the potential of photon-mediated forces for engineering correlations in many-body quantum systems.

Title: Fermionic logarithmic negativity in the Krawtchouk chain
Authors: Gabrielle Blanchet, Gilles Parez, Luc Vinet
Abstract: The entanglement of non-complementary regions is investigated in an inhomogeneous free-fermion chain through the lens of the fermionic logarithmic negativity. Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous orthogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical calculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the negativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in the Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime where each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to extract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity decays as $d^{-4 \Delta_f}$ with $\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation between the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free Dirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the boundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site $m=0,1,2,\dots$, with $\Delta_f^{\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and $\Delta_f^{\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and analytical calculations.

Title: Dynamic neuron approach to deep neural networks: Decoupling neurons for renormalization group analysis
Authors: Donghee Lee, Hye-Sung Lee, Jaeok Yi
Abstract: Deep neural network architectures often consist of repetitive structural elements. We introduce an approach that reveals these patterns and can be broadly applied to the study of deep learning. Similarly to how a power strip helps untangle and organize complex cable connections, this approach treats neurons as additional degrees of freedom in interactions, simplifying the structure and enhancing the intuitive understanding of interactions within deep neural networks. Furthermore, it reveals the translational symmetry of deep neural networks, which simplifies the application of the renormalization group transformation-a method that effectively analyzes the scaling behavior of the system. By utilizing translational symmetry and renormalization group transformations, we can analyze critical phenomena. This approach may open new avenues for studying deep neural networks using statistical physics.

Title: Bridging the Gap between Koopmanism and Response Theory: Using Natural Variability to Predict Forced Response
Authors: Niccolò Zagli, Matthew Colbrook, Valerio Lucarini, Igor Mezić, John Moroney
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is a cornerstone result in statistical mechanics that can be used to translate the statistics of the free natural variability of a system into information on its forced response to perturbations. By combining this viewpoint on response theory with the key ingredients of Koopmanism, it is possible to deconstruct virtually any response operator into a sum of terms, each associated with a specific mode of natural variability of the system. This dramatically improves the interpretability of the resulting response formulas. We show here on three simple yet mathematically meaningful examples how to use the Extended Dynamical Mode Decomposition (EDMD) algorithm on an individual trajectory of the system to compute with high accuracy correlation functions as well as Green functions associated with acting forcings. This demonstrates the great potential of using Koopman analysis for the key problem of evaluating and testing the sensitivity of a complex system.

Title: Octupolar Weyl Superconductivity from Electron-electron Interaction
Authors: Zhiming Pan, Chen Lu, Fan Yang, Congjun Wu
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity arising from electron-electron interaction can manifest exotic symmetry and topological properties. We investigate the superconducting pairing symmetry problem based on the 3D cubic $O_h$ symmetry with both weak- and strong-coupling approaches. The dominant pairing symmetries belong to the two-dimensional $E_g$ representation at low and intermediate doping levels, and the complex mixing gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}+id_{x^2-y^2}$-type is energetically favored in the ground state. Cooper pairs with such a symmetry do not possess orbital angular momentum (OAM) moments, which is different from other time-reversal symmetry breaking pairings such as $p_x+ip_y$ (e.g $^3$He-A) and $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ under the planar hexagonal symmetry. Instead, they develop the octupolar $O_{xyz}$ component of OAM, which results in 8 nodal points along the body diagonal directions exhibiting an alternating distribution of monopole charges $\pm 1$. This leads to an intriguing 3D Weyl topological SC, which accommodates nontrivial surface states of Majorana arcs. Our results appeal for material realizations and experimental tests in optical lattices.

Title: Random-Flux-Induced Transition Sequence between Weak and Strong Topological Phases with Anisotropic Localization Properties
Authors: Chang-An Li, Bo Fu, Jian Li, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: We demonstrate that random flux is able to drive nontrivial topological phase transitions, in particular between weak topological insulators (WTIs) and Chern insulators (CIs), illustrated on an anisotropic Wilson-Dirac model in two dimensions. Remarkably, an intriguing topological transition sequence WTIs$\rightarrow$CIs$\rightarrow$WTIs occurs with the reentrance to a WTI but of different weak topology, which is unattainable with chemical potential disorder. The involvement of anisotropy and weak topology in such a transition gives rise to emergent quasi-critical points, where eigen states are extended in one spatial direction but localized in the other one. This new quantum criticality lies outside the conventional quantum Hall universality class. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the random-flux-induced phase transitions and quantum criticality from both bulk and boundary perspectives. Our results describe a qualitatively new disorder effect based on the interplay of random flux with topological phases of matter.

Title: Designing Flat Bands and Pseudo-Landau Levels in GaAs with Patterned Gates
Authors: Pierre A. Pantaleon, Zhen Zhan, Siddhartha E. Morales, Gerardo G. Naumis
Abstract: We investigate the electronic properties of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a periodic patterned gate. By incorporating the superlattice (SL) potential induced by patterning into the Schrodinger equation, we develop a methodology for obtaining exact analytical solutions. These solutions enable us to construct a comprehensive phase diagram illustrating the emergence of narrow bands and pseudo-Landau levels driven by the SL potential. To complement the analytical approach, we employ a standard plane-wave formalism to track the evolution of the band structure as the SL strength increases. By breaking the inversion symmetry of the SL potential, we found a nontrivial Berry curvature. Furthermore, we introduce a self-consistent Hartree screening to account for the interplay between the SL potential and electronic interactions. Our findings not only reveal the emergence of a non-trivial quantum geometry and a competition between SL strength and electron-electron interactions, but also highlight the value of exact analytical solutions for understanding and engineering electronic phases in patterned 2DEG systems.

Title: Effective Lagrangian for the macroscopic motion of Weyl fermions in $^3$He-A
Authors: M. Selch, M. A. Zubkov
Abstract: We consider macroscopic motion of the normal component of superfluid $^3$He - A in global thermodynamic equilibrium within the context of the Zubarev statistical operator method. We formulate the corresponding effective theory in the language of the functional integral. The effective Lagrangian comprising macroscopic motion of fermionic excitations is calculated explicitly for the emergent relativistic fermions of the superfluid $^3$He - A phase immersed in a non-trivial bosonic background due to a space and time dependent matrix-valued vierbein featuring nonzero torsion as well as the Nieh-Yan anomaly. We do not consider the dynamics of the superfluid component itself and thereby its backreaction effects due to normal component macroscopic flow. It is being treated as an external background within which the emergent relativistic fermions of the normal component move. The matrix-valued vierbein formulation comprises an additional two dimensional internal spin space for the two axially charged Weyl fermions living at the Fermi points which may be replaced by one featuring a Dirac fermion doublet with a real valued vierbein, an axial Abelian gauge field and a spin connection gauge field mixing the Dirac and internal spin spaces. We carry out this change of description in detail and determine the constraints on the superfluid background as well as the the normal component motion as determined from the Zubarev statistical operator formalism in global thermodynamic equilibrium. As an application of the developed theory we consider macroscopic rotation around the axis of pure integer mass vortices. The corresponding thermodynamic quantities of the normal component are analyzed. Our formulation incorporates both superfluid background flow and macroscopic motion flow of the normal component and thereby enables an analysis of their interrelation.

Title: Strong Disorder Renormalization Group Method for Bond Disordered Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains with Long Range Interactions: Ground State Properties
Authors: Stefan Kettemann
Abstract: We introduce and implement a reformulation of the strong disorder renormalization group method in real space, well suited to study bond disordered antiferromagnetic power law coupled quantum spin chains. We derive the Master equations for the distribution function of pair distances $\tilde{r}$. First, we apply it to a short range coupled spin chain, keeping only interactions for adjacent spins. We confirm that it is solved by the infinite randomness fixed point distribution. Then, we solve the Master equation for the power law long range interaction between all spins for any anisotropy ranging from the XX-limit to the isotropic Heisenberg limit, corresponding to a tight binding chain of disordered long range interacting Fermions with long range hopping. We thereby show that the distribution function of couplings $J$ at renormalization scale $\Omega$ flows to the strong disorder fixed point distribution with small corrections at $\tilde{r} > \rho,$ which depend on power exponent $\alpha$ and coupling anisotropy $\gamma.$ As a consequence, the low temperature magnetic susceptibility diverges with an anomalous power law. The distribution of singlet lengths $l$ is found to decay as $l^{-2}$. The entanglement entropy of a subsystem of length $n$ increases in the ground state logarithmically for all $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. After a global quantum quench the entanglement entropy increases with time logarithmically as $S(t) \sim \ln(t)/(2\alpha)$.

Title: Active particle in a very thin interfacial droplet
Authors: Airi N. Kato, Kaili Xie, Benjamin Gorin, Jean-Michel Rampnoux, Hamid Kellay
Abstract: A single light-driven Janus particle confined in a very thin oil droplet at an air--water interface displays intriguing dynamics. While laser activation induces rapid horizontal motion (1mm/s--1cm/s) by thermal Marangoni flow, the particle exhibits unexpected periodic circular motions or intermittent irregular motions. We show that the periodic trajectories are the result of a coupling between the self-propulsion of the particle and the spatiotemporal droplet thickness changes. We propose a simple model where the properties of the active particle trajectories are governed by capillary forces and torques due to the confinement of the particle in the thin droplet.

Title: Thermal conductivity of 3C-SiC from configuration space sampling
Authors: Paweł T. Jochym, Jan Łażewski
Abstract: Cubic silicon carbide phonon thermal conductivity has been calculated using anharmonic phonon analysis. The atomic interaction model was built using displacement-force data obtained with the High Efficiency Configuration Space Sampling (HECSS) technique and density functional theory calculated forces. In the new version of HECSS we replaced the Markov chain scheme of Metropolis-Hastings Monte-Carlo with weighting of the final sampling according to the target distribution. This increased the efficiency of the method and allowed to use -- with appropriate weight -- all generated and ab-initio evaluated samples. The quality of the proposed method is confirmed by the accuracy with which the experimental results taken from the literature were reproduced.

Title: Nuclear spin coherence in superconducting Nb$_3$Sn
Authors: Gan Zhai, William P. Halperin, Arneil P. Reyes, Sam Posen, Chiara Tarantini, Manish Mandal, David C. Larbalestier
Abstract: We have investigated the normal and superconducting states of the technologically important compound Nb$_3$Sn using $^{93}$Nb nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation we find strong suppression of the zero-temperature superconducting order parameter by magnetic field. Additionally we have identified an anomalously large electron-nuclear exchange interaction from spin-spin relaxation measurements, an order of magnitude beyond that of the nuclear dipolar coupling. This RKKY interaction evolves from normal to superconducting states, becoming essentially Lorentzian in the low temperature limit.

Title: Circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection from chiral superconductors
Authors: Junyeong Ahn, Ashvin Vishwanath
Abstract: Integrating mirrors with magnetic components is crucial for constructing chiral optical cavities, which provide tunable platforms for time-reversal-asymmetric light-matter interactions. Here, we introduce single-crystal circular-polarization-selective mirrors based on chiral superconductors, which break time-reversal symmetry themselves, eliminating the need for additional components. We show that a circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection (CSPR) occurs for strong-coupling superconductors in the BCS-BEC crossover regime or beyond if the optical Hall conductivity is significant in the unit of conductivity quantum per unit layer, $e^2/ha_z$, where $a_z$ is the lattice constant along the surface normal. While the optical Hall conductivity in chiral superconductors is typically tiny, we classify three routes to obtain a large value. We demonstrate the significant optical Hall conductivity and the resulting CSPR with two examples: (1) superconductivity in doped quantum Hall insulators and (2) chiral pairing that preserves the Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in the weak-pairing limit. We also discuss the application of our theory to the recently discovered chiral superconducting phase in rhombohedral graphene. Our theory reveals the potential of these classes of chiral superconductors as promising elements for building high-quality-factor terahertz chiral cavities.

Title: Magnetic texture control in ion-implanted metamaterials
Authors: Christina Vantaraki, Kristina Ignatova, Dmitrii Moldarev, Matías P. Grassi, Michael Foerster, Daniel Primetzhofer, Unnar B. Arnalds, Vassilios Kapaklis
Abstract: We study experimentally the impact of the additive fabrication method on the magnetic properties of Fe$^+$-implanted Pd square artificial spin ice lattices. Our findings show that the lattices exhibit a higher ordering temperature than their continuous film counterparts. This behavior is attributed to the additive fabrication process, which induces an inhomogeneous Fe concentration within the lattice building blocks. Moreover, the implantation process creates a magnetic depth profile, enabling temperature-dependent tunability of the magnetic thickness. These additional internal degrees of freedom broaden the design possibilities for magnetic metamaterials, allowing precise fine-tuning of their static and dynamic properties to achieve complex and customizable behaviors.

Title: Information-optimal mixing at low Reynolds number
Authors: Luca Cocconi, Yihong Shi, Andrej Vilfan
Abstract: Mutual information between particle positions before and after mixing provides a universal assumption-free measure of mixing efficiency at low Reynolds number which accounts for the kinematic reversibility of the Stokes equation. For a generic planar shear flow with time-dependent shear rate, we derive a compact expression for the mutual information as a nonlinear functional of the shearing protocol and solve the associated extremisation problem exactly to determine the optimal control under both linear and non-linear constraints, specifically total shear and total dissipation per unit volume. Remarkably, optimal protocols turn out to be universal and time-reversal symmetric in both cases. Our results establish a minimum energetic cost of erasing information in a broad class of non-equilibrium drift-diffusive systems.

Title: Nonmagnetic ground state of marcasite FeTe$_{2}$: The competition between crystal field splitting and on-site Coulomb repulsion
Authors: Yue-Fei Hou, Zhibin Shao, Minghu Pan, Shiyang Wu, Fawei Zheng, Zhen-Guo Fu, Ping Zhang
Abstract: The magnetic ground states in crystalline systems are significant for both fundamental condensed matter physics and practical materials engineering. Marcasite FeTe$_{2}$, characterized as a small-gap semiconductor, exhibits anomalous magnetic behaviors in low-temperature experiments. In this study, first-principles density functional theory calculations combined with scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy are employed to investigate the magnetic ground state of marcasite FeTe$_{2}$. It is revealed that the competition between crystal field splitting and on-site Coulomb repulsion plays the key role in the formation of localized magnetic moments in FeTe$_{2}$. The ground state of FeTe$_{2}$ bulk is confirmed to be nonmagnetic, while the magnetic responses of FeTe$_{2}$ observed at low temperature are suggested to be related to the magnetic Fe atoms on the crystal surfaces. Our work proposes a straightforward competing mechanism for determining ground-state magnetism of various localized-moment crystalline systems.

Title: IsoME: Streamlining High-Precision Eliashberg Calculations
Authors: Eva Kogler, Dominik Spath, Roman Lucrezi, Hitoshi Mori, Zien Zhu, Zhenglu Li, Elena R. Margine, Christoph Heil
Abstract: This paper introduces the Julia package IsoME, an easy-to-use yet accurate and robust computational tool designed to calculate superconducting properties. Multiple levels of approximation are supported, ranging from the basic McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula and its machine learning-enhanced variant to Eliashberg theory including static Coulomb interactions derived from $GW$ calculations, offering a fully ab initio approach to determine superconducting properties, such as the critical superconducting temperature ($T_\text{c}$) and the superconducting gap function ($\Delta$). We validate IsoME by benchmarking it against various materials, demonstrating its versatility and performance across different theoretical levels. The findings indicate that the previously held assumption that Eliashberg theory overestimates $T_\text{c}$ is no longer valid when $\mu^*$ is appropriately adjusted to account for the finite Matsubara frequency cutoff. Furthermore, we conclude that the constant density of states (DOS) approximation remains accurate in most cases. By unifying multiple approximation schemes within a single framework, IsoME combines first-principles precision with computational efficiency, enabling seamless integration into high-throughput workflows through its $T_\text{c}$ search mode. This makes IsoME a powerful and reliable tool for advancing superconductivity research.

Title: BCS-like formula for $T_c$ does not necessarily imply BCS pairing mechanism: the case of magnetically-mediated quantum-critical pairing
Authors: Yuxuan Wang, Andrey V. Chubukov
Abstract: In the BCS theory of superconductivity, an instability towards pairing develops at arbitrary weak dimensionless coupling $\lambda$ due to a divergence of logarithmic perturbative series for the pairing susceptibility (Cooper logarithms) at $T_c \sim \omega_0 e^{-1/\lambda}$, where $\omega_0$ is an energy cutoff. On the contrary, in many models of superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, Cooper logarithm is absent and superconductivity emerges only when $\lambda$ exceeds a certain threshold. We argue that there are situations when there is no threshold and at weak coupling the formula for $T_c$ is BCS-like, yet the origin of the pairing instability is fundamentally different from that in the BCS scenario. As an example, we revisit superconductivity in a metal at the onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ spin-density-wave order. Earlier studies of this problem found no threshold and a BCS-like expression for $T_c$ at weak coupling. We argue that, despite this, the pairing is not caused by the Cooper logarithm and in many respects is qualitatively similar to that in non-Fermi liquids.

Title: Thermodynamic bounds on energy use in Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Alexei V. Tkachenko
Abstract: While Landauer's principle sets a fundamental energy limit for irreversible digital computation, we show that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) implemented on analog physical substrates can operate under markedly different thermodynamic constraints. We distinguish between two classes of analog systems: dynamic and quasi-static. In dynamic systems, energy dissipation arises from neuron resets, with a lower bound governed by Landauer's principle. To analyse a quasi-static analog platform, we construct an explicit mapping of a generic feedforward DNN onto a physical system described by a model Hamiltonian. In this framework, inference can proceed reversibly, with no minimum free energy cost imposed by thermodynamics. We further analyze the training process in quasi-static analog networks and derive a fundamental lower bound on its energy cost, rooted in the interplay between thermal and statistical noise. Our results suggest that while analog implementations can outperform digital ones during inference, the thermodynamic cost of training scales similarly in both paradigms.

Title: A Fluctuation Theory of Liquid-Phase Solutions: Shear Viscosity
Authors: Yury A. Budkov, Nikolai N. Kalikin, Petr E. Brandyshev
Abstract: Accurately describing liquids and their mixtures beyond equilibrium remains a significant challenge in modern chemical physics and physical chemistry, especially regarding the calculation of transport properties in liquid-phase systems. This paper introduces a phenomenological nonequilibrium theory specifically designed for multicomponent liquid-phase solutions. Our field-theoretical framework, rooted in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, incorporates quasi-stationary concentration fluctuations that align with equilibrium liquid theory as described by classical density functional theory. This method serves as a phenomenological extension of the established Dean-Kawasaki stochastic density functional theory, enabling the computation of shear viscosity. We apply our approach to derive general formula for the shear viscosity in single-solute solutions. Our findings yield new results and successfully reproduce previously established results for such systems as solutions containing soft-core particles, hard spheres, one-component plasma, and near-critical solutions.

Title: First-principles predictions of the diversity in atomic structures and electronic properties of the reconstructed Si(111)-7x7 surface
Authors: Yuke Song, ShiFang Li, PeiZe Lin, Jin Li, Tao Ouyang, Chao Tang, Chaoyu He
Abstract: The 7x7 reconstruction of Si(111) surface is widely understood by the dimer-adatom-stacking-fault model (DAS), but the predicted metallicity of DAS contradicts experimental signs of insulation. It is still challenge to predict DAS-like reconstructions by traditional method to solve such a puzzle. Here, we show that low-energy reconstructions of Si(111)-7x7 surface with (DAS-d8-T12, DAS-d8-T9H3-A, DAS-d8-T9H3-B and DAS-d8-T6H6) and without (AB-d10-T12, AB-d10-T9H3, AA-d10-T12 and AA-d10-T9H3) stacking-fault can be quickly discovered by graph theory as implemented in RG2 code for crystal structure prediction. They exhibit comparable stability to the DAS (DAS-d8-T12) model and similar STM patterns, offering a plausible explanation for the observed Si(111)-7x7 reconstruction. All these reconstructions exhibit metallic behavior in the nonmagnetic (NM) state with isolated narrow bands crossing the Fermi level in varying occupancy. And they are further confirmed as ferromagnetic (FM) metals (DAS-d8-T9H3-B), half-metals (DAS-d8-T12, AB-d10-T9H3, AA-d10-T12 and AA-d10-T9H3), half-semimetals (DAS-d8-T9H3-A and DAS-d8-T6H6) and even insulators (AB-d10-T12), depending their occupancies of the NM band structures. These findings not only demonstrate the rich electromagnetic phases of reconstructed Si(111) surfaces and their potential for spintronic applications, but also provide a plausible physical explanation for the metal-insulator transition observed on the Si(111) surface.

Title: Fluctuations and Correlations of Local Topological Order Parameters in Disordered Two-dimensional Topological Insulators
Authors: Roberta Favata, Nicolas Baù, Antimo Marrazzo
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators are characterized by an insulating bulk and conductive edge states protected by the nontrivial topology of the bulk electronic structure. They remain robust against moderate disorder until Anderson localization occurs and destroys the topological phase. Interestingly, disorder can also induce a topological phase - known as a topological Anderson insulator - starting from an otherwise pristine trivial phase. While topological invariants are generally regarded as global quantities, we argue that space-resolved topological markers can act as local order parameters, revealing the role of fluctuations and correlations in the local topology under Anderson disorder and vacancies. With this perspective, we perform numerical simulations of disorder-driven topological phase transitions in the Haldane and Kane-Mele models, using supercells with both open and periodic boundary conditions. We find that short-scale fluctuations of topological markers vanish upon coarse-graining, except at the topological phase transition, where their correlation length peaks and large-scale fluctuations remain. Notably, such a topological correlation function is characterized by critical exponents that appear universal across disorder types, yet they can resolve different topological phase transitions.

Title: An all-electrical scheme for valley polarization in graphene
Authors: Sachchidanand Das, Abhiram Soori
Abstract: We propose an all-electrical setup to generate valley polarization in graphene. A finite graphene sheet is connected to two normal metal electrodes each with two terminals along its zigzag edges, while the armchair edges remain free. When a bias is applied to one terminal and the others are grounded, valley polarization emerges due to transverse momentum matching between the graphene and the metal electrodes. Significant valley polarization is achieved when the Fermi wavevector in the metal exceeds half the separation between the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys in graphene. We analyze how conductance and valley polarization depend on geometric and electronic parameters. While increasing the width enhances both conductance and polarization, increasing the length introduces Fabry--Pérot oscillations and suppresses valley polarization due to enhanced intervalley mixing. We also examine the effects of disorder: on-site disorder in graphene near the Dirac point increases conductance but reduces valley polarization. Finally, we study the impact of imperfect armchair edges and interface roughness, finding that moderate deviations from ideal conditions still yield substantial valley polarization. Our results demonstrate a viable route to electrically controlling valley degrees of freedom in graphene-based devices.

Title: Rectification and bolometric terahertz radiation detectors based on perforated graphene structures exhibiting plasmonic resonant response
Authors: V. Ryzhii, C. Tang, M. Ryzhii, T. Otsuji, M. S. Shur
Abstract: We propose and evaluate the characteristics of the terahertz (THz) detectors based on perforated graphene layers (PGLs). The PGL structures constitute the interdigital in-plane arrays of the graphene microribbons (GMRs) connected by the sets of narrow constrictions, which form the graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. The PGL detector operation is associated with the rectification and hot-carrier bolometric mechanisms. The excitation of plasmonic oscillations in the GMR-GNR arrays can reinforce these mechanisms. The room temperature PGL detector responsivity and detectivity are calculated as function of the radiation frequency and device structure parameters. The effects of the rectification and hot-carrier mechanisms are compared. The PGL THz detectors under consideration can exhibit highly competitive values of responsivity and detectivity.

Title: Dynamic scaling of vorticity in phase-separating superfluid mixtures
Authors: Ryuta Ito, Hiromitsu Takeuchi
Abstract: Recently, it has been experimentally confirmed that non-equilibrium dynamics of phase separation in strongly ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensates of $^7$Li atoms obey the dynamic scaling law belonging to the binary-fluid universality class in the inertial hydrodynamic stage. The current work theoretically and numerically studies the dynamic scaling law of structure factor of vorticity in a phase-separating binary superfluid mixture, equivalent to the $^7$Li condensates in a strong limit of quadratic Zeeman shift. We found a dynamic scaling law for the structure factor based on our numerical observation that the peak of the energy spectrum from turbulence theory does not vary in time in the stage. Similarly to freely decaying turbulence, a power-law hierarchy exists in the energy spectrum in our system, and we proposed a decay law of the energy based on the dynamic scaling law by introducing the microscopic, high-wavenumber cutoff.

Title: Superconducting Dome and Quantum Criticality in Two-Dimensional NbO2 Triangular Lattice
Authors: Takuto Soma, Kohei Yoshimatsu, Akira Ohtomo
Abstract: The emergence of superconductivity with strong correlation is one of the most attracted issues in condensed-matter physics, as seen in various unconventional superconductors. Here we show a new strongly correlated superconductor Li1-xNbO2 with rich characteristics such as two-dimensional, geometrically frustrated, and triangular NbO2 lattice and correlated flat-band-like electronic states. We revealed the electronic phase diagram by implementing Li-ion electrochemical cells with LiNbO2 epitaxial films. The Li-ion deintercalation increased the hole-doping level in NbO2 layer, along which a band insulator LiNbO2 underwent to a Fermi-liquid (FL) metal and superconductor associated with non-Fermi liquid (NFL) characters. The evolution of the NFL state coincided with the suppression of the Kondo-singlet formation near the superconducting dome, which linked superconductivity with quantum criticality. The obtained phase diagram involves general aspects of strongly correlated superconductors and bridges the gap between various systems.

Title: Beyond Diamond: Interpretable Machine Learning Discovery of Coherent Quantum Defect Hosts in Semiconductors
Authors: Mohammed Mahshook, Rudra Banerjee
Abstract: Quantum point defects in wide bandgap semiconductors-such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond are leading candidates for solid-state spin qubits due to their long coherence times and optically addressable spin states. Yet, identifying host materials capable of supporting such deep-level defects remains a significant challenge, owing to the complex interplay between chemical composition, crystal structure, and electronic environment. Here, we present a scalable, interpretable machine learning framework that combines density functional theory (DFT)-informed descriptors with a structure-agnostic ensemble model to predict quantum-compatible defect-host materials. Trained on a curated dataset from the Materials Project and ICSD, our model achieves a high Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC > 0.95) and assigns confidence scores to guide prioritization of candidates. First-principles calculations of coherence-relevant properties, including static dielectric constants and defect formation energetics, validate key predictions. While high dielectric response is a necessary but not sufficient condition for spin coherence, our model successfully recovers known hosts such as diamond and SiC, and reveals previously overlooked candidates such as WS2 , MgO, CaS and TiO2 . This approach establishes a robust path for discovering next-generation quantum materials, bridging data-driven screening with physically interpretable design principles.

Title: Molecular dynamics of $cis$-polybutadiene across the glass transition revealed by muonated-radical spin relaxation
Authors: S. Takeshita, H. Okabe, M. Hiraishi, K. M. Kojima, A. Koda, H. Seto, T. Masui, N. Wakabayashi, F. L. Pratt, R. Kadono
Abstract: The local molecular motion of $cis$-polybutadiene, a typical polymeric material exhibiting a glass transition ($T_{\rm g}=168$ K), is investigated by the spin relaxation of muonated radicals, where the relaxation is induced by the fluctuation of hyperfine (HF) fields exerted from an unpaired electron to a nearby muon and surrounding protons. The relaxation rate $1/T_\mu$ measured under various longitudinal magnetic fields is analyzed using the recently developed theory of spin relaxation to consider the coexistence of quasistatic and fluctuating HF fields, where the fluctuation frequency for the latter $\nu$ is evaluated over a temperature $T$ range of 5-320 K. The obtained $\nu(T)$ is found to be well reproduced by the Arrhenius relation, and the activation energy and preexponential factor are in good agreement with those for the "elemental process" revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering and attributed to a fluctuation across three carbon-carbon bonds. This result demonstrates that muonated-radical spin relaxation is a promising approach for direct access to local molecular motions in the sub-nanosecond range and for their detailed modeling at the atomic scale.

Title: Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity
Authors: Mohit Sharma, Srikanth Sastry, Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility (the rate at which relaxation time grow with decreasing temperature) is central to unraveling the glass transition. Fragility is often linked to dynamic heterogeneity, and thus it is commonly assumed that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using three model systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks--Chandler--Andersen, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q, p) system, where potential softness is changed to vary fragility. We employ a structural order parameter derived from the mean field caging potential and analyze energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic slope of the energy barrier, suitably defined, correlates with fragility, no consistent correlation is found for the microscopic energy barriers. Instead, the latter shows a strong correlation with an independently computed structure dynamics measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble. Surprisingly, the two systems with the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8, 5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, bimodal displacement profiles, and high non-Gaussian parameters, all indicative of dynamic heterogeneity. However, their dynamic susceptibilities remain low, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation and temporal heterogeneity. Both systems lie in the enthalpy-dominated regime and are near the spinodal, suggesting mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. These findings challenge the conventional linkage among fragility, heterogeneity, and structure-dynamics correlation.

Title: Extracting topological orders of generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two dimensions
Authors: Zijian Liang, Yijia Xu, Joseph T. Iosue, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.

Title: Revisiting Shooting Point Monte Carlo Methods for Transition Path Sampling
Authors: Sebastian Falkner, Alessandro Coretti, Baron Peters, Peter G. Bolhuis, Christoph Dellago
Abstract: Rare event sampling algorithms are essential for understanding processes that occur infrequently on the molecular scale, yet they are important for the long-time dynamics of complex molecular systems. One of these algorithms, transition path sampling (TPS), has become a standard technique to study such rare processes since no prior knowledge on the transition region is required. Most TPS methods generate new trajectories from old trajectories by selecting a point along the old trajectory, modifying its momentum in some way, and then ``shooting'' a new trajectory by integrating forward and backward in time. In some procedures, the shooting point is selected independently for each trial move, but in others, the shooting point evolves from one path to the next so that successive shooting points are related to each other. To account for this memory effect, we introduce a theoretical framework based on an extended ensemble that includes both paths and shooting indices. We derive appropriate acceptance rules for various path sampling algorithms in this extended formalism, ensuring the correct sampling of the transition path ensemble. Our framework reveals the need for amended acceptance criteria in the flexible-length aimless shooting and spring shooting methods.

Title: Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model
Authors: Vishnu Muraleedharan Sajitha, Bodhaditya Santra, Matthew J. Davis, L. A. Williamson
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.

Title: Universal solution to the Schrieffer-Wolff Transformation Generator
Authors: Leander Reascos, Giovanni Francesco Diotallevi, Mónica Benito
Abstract: The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT) is an important perturbative method in quantum mechanics used to simplify Hamiltonians by decoupling low- and high-energy subspaces. Existing methods for implementing the SWT often lack general applicability to arbitrary perturbative systems or fail to provide a closed-form solution for the SWT generator. In this article, we present a systematic and unified framework for the SWT that addresses these shortcomings. Specifically, we derive a closed-form solution for the SWT generator that is universally applicable to any system that satisfies the conditions required for perturbative treatment. Furthermore, we extend this solution to time-dependent systems with periodic perturbations, covering all frequency regimes. The effectiveness of this approach is then demonstrated by applying it to analyze the dispersive shift of an anharmonic resonator coupled to a two-level system with time-dependent coupling.

Title: Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons
Authors: Valery Shchesnovich
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.

Title: Flat Bands and Compact Localised States: A Carrollian roadmap
Authors: Nisa Ara, Aritra Banerjee, Rudranil Basu, Bhagya Krishnan
Abstract: We show how Carrollian symmetries become important in the construction of one-dimensional fermionic systems with all flat-band spectra from first principles. The key ingredient of this construction is the identification of Compact Localised States (CLSs), which appear naturally by demanding $\textit{supertranslation}$ invariance of the system. We use CLS basis states, with inherent $\textit{ultra-local}$ correlations, to write down an interacting theory which shows a non-trivial phase structure and an emergent Carroll conformal symmetry at the gapless points. We analyze this theory in detail for both zero and finite chemical potential.

Title: Symmetry Fingerprints Unlocked: Room-Temperature Single-Particle Polarized Spectroscopy Reveals Complete Symmetry Landscape in Rare-Earth Crystals
Authors: Peng Li, Yaxin Guo, Yaoxu Yan, Bingzhu Zheng, Wenchao Zhang, Fu Liu, Yanpeng Zhang, Feng Yun, Rongqian Wu, Yi Lyu, Renren Deng, Feng Li
Abstract: The point group symmetry of luminescent centers-such as defects, impurities, and dopant ions-fundamentally determines optical transition characteristics, underpinning advances in materials science and optoelectronics. Conventional low-temperature spectroscopy assesses such symmetry through the splitting of optical transitions, yet lacks sensitivity to key vectorial features such as symmetry axis orientations. Here, we introduce a single-particle approach that integrates computational electromagnetism with polarization-resolved microspectroscopy at room temperature, enabling unambiguous mapping of transition dipole orientations from a single magnetic optical transition and thus direct determination of point group symmetry in rare-earth-doped microcrystals. This technique also reveals spontaneous symmetry breaking in chiral space groups during crystallization, giving rise to intrinsic single-particle optical chirality. Leveraging these symmetry insights, we establish a practical protocol for optically polarized sensing of the three-dimensional orientation (3D) of rare-earth-doped single particles in cellular environments. Our method uncovers both the vectorial point group symmetry of rare-earth ions and the chiral nature of the crystal-a level of structural information unattainable by conventional spectroscopic or crystallographic techniques. By bridging microscopic symmetry with macroscopic functionality, this work enables quantitative evaluation of the Forster dipole orientation factor (k2) for rational donor-acceptor design, and lays the foundation for next-generation energy transfer systems, ultra-bright rare-earth nanocrystals, nanophotonic materials, and real-time single-particle sensing in biological contexts.

Title: Generalized toric codes on twisted tori for quantum error correction
Authors: Zijian Liang, Ke Liu, Hao Song, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gröbner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \leq 400$, yielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$, $[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, \leq 22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the $[[360, 12, \leq 24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.

Title: Benchmarking direct and indirect dipolar spin-exchange interactions between two Rydberg atoms
Authors: Gabriel Emperauger, Mu Qiao, Guillaume Bornet, Cheng Chen, Romain Martin, Yuki Torii Chew, Bastien Gély, Lukas Klein, Daniel Barredo, Antoine Browaeys, Thierry Lahaye
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced Förster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.

Title: Analytical Prediction of the Superradiant Emission Peak and Timing in Fully Excited Quantum Emitter Ensembles
Authors: Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.

Title: Cell size heterogeneity controls crystallization of the developing fruit fly wing
Authors: Kartik Chhajed, Franz S. Gruber, Raphaël Etournay, Natalie A. Dye, Frank Jülicher, Marko Popović
Abstract: A fundamental question in Biology is to understand how patterns and shapes emerge from the collective interplay of large numbers of cells. Cells forming two-dimensional epithelial tissues behave as active materials that undergo remodeling and spontaneous shape changes. Focussing on the fly wing as a model system, we find that the cellular packing in the wing epithelium transitions from a disordered packing to an ordered, crystalline packing. We investigate biophysical mechanisms controlling this crystallization process. While previous studies propose a role of tissue shear flow in establishing the ordered cell packing in the fly wing, we reveal a role of cell size heterogeneity. Indeed, we find that even if tissue shear have been inhibited, cell packings in the fruit fly wing epithelium transition from disordered to an ordered packing. We propose that the transition is controlled by the cell size heterogeneity, which is quantified by the cell size polydispersity. We use the vertex model of epithelial tissues to show that there is a critical value of cell size polydispersity above which cellular packings are disordered and below which they form a crystalline packing. By analyzing experimental data we find that cell size polydispersity decreases during fly wing development. The observed dynamics of tissue crystallisation is consistent with the slow ordering kinetics we observe in the vertex model. Therefore, although tissue shear does not control the transition, it significantly enhances the rate of tissue scale ordering by facilitating alingment of locally ordered crystallites.

Title: Spins extracted from fermionic states and their entanglement properties
Authors: Filippo Troiani, Andrea Secchi, Stefano Pittalis
Abstract: We investigate the spin states obtained by extracting $n$ electrons from closed-shell fermionic states. A partition of the system is defined through the introduction of the extraction modes. We derive the expression of the $n$-body reduced density matrices, which represent the extracted spin states. We show that these states exhibit different forms of spin entanglement, whose detection is discussed in terms of the spin squeezing inequalities.

Title: Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States
Authors: Mahmud Ashraf Shamim, Eric A F Reinhardt, Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Sergei Gleyzer, Paulo T Araujo
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ansätze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.

Title: Fast offline decoding with local message-passing automata
Authors: Ethan Lake
Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.

Title: Interpretable representation learning of quantum data enabled by probabilistic variational autoencoders
Authors: Paulin de Schoulepnikoff, Gorka Muñoz-Gil, Hendrik Poulsen Nautrup, Hans J. Briegel
Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.
