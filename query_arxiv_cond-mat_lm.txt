Title: Andreev spin qubits based on the helical edge states of magnetically doped two-dimensional topological insulators
Authors: Edoardo Latini, Fausto Rossi, Fabrizio Dolcini
Abstract: We show that Andreev spin qubits can be realized in a Josephson junction based on the helical edge states of a two-dimensional topological insulator (quantum spin Hall system) proximized by superconducting films, in the presence of magnetic doping. We demonstrate that the electrical dipole transitions between the Andreev spin states induced by the magnetic doping can be harnessed to optically manipulate the Andreev spin qubit by microwave radiation pulses. We numerically simulate the realization of NOT and Hadamard quantum logic gates, and discuss implementations in realistic setups.

Title: Smart Walkers in Discrete Space
Authors: Gianluca Peri, Lorenzo Buffoni, Giacomo Chiti, Duccio Fanelli, Raffaele Marino, Andrea Nocentini, Pier Paolo Panti
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of trainable agents moving in discrete space. After introducing the mathematical framework, we first analyze the dynamics of two completely random walkers, mutually competing in a chaser-target interaction scheme. The statistics of the encounters is analytically obtained and the predictions tested versus numerical simulations. We then move forward to extend the baseline case to agents capable of learning and adapting to an external reward signal, using reinforcement learning. Smart walkers morph the statistics of the encounter, to maximize their cumulated reward, as confirmed by combined numerical and analytical insights. More interestingly, configuration entropy proves a reliable proxy to gauge the acquired ability of the agents to cope with the assigned task when no other information about them (i.e. reward signal, policy, etc) is present. We further test the proposed measure of learned skills by operating the Stockfish chess engine against a quasi-random untrained opponent. The obtained conclusions corroborate our claim.

Title: Interfacial Coupling Controls Molecular Epitaxy of HMTP on Graphene/SiC
Authors: Devanshu Varshney, Pavel Procházka, Veronika Stará, Mykhailo Shestopalov, Jan Kunc, Jiří Novák, Jan Čechal
Abstract: Epitaxial growth critically influences structural and electronic properties of organic semiconductors. Graphene serves as a prominent van der Waals template for molecular self-assembly; however, graphene on SiC is intrinsically heterogeneous, with decoupled monolayer graphene coexisting with residuals of a covalently bound buffer layer, which may affect molecular ordering. Here, we track the ordering of the molecular donor, 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexamethoxytriphenylene (HMTP), from the first layer to thin films, combining low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction with X-ray diffraction. HMTP forms highly ordered epitaxial layers on single-layer graphene, whereas growth on the buffer layer initiates as amorphous and evolves into polycrystalline films with weak orientation with respect to the substrate. Crucially, hydrogen intercalation decouples the buffer layer, converting it into quasi-freestanding monolayer graphene and restoring epitaxial growth. These findings demonstrate that interfacial coupling governs molecular epitaxy on graphene/SiC, and interface engineering via hydrogen intercalation provides a scalable route to control organic thin-film crystallinity on graphene.

Title: Magnon Kerr effect in a magnetic thin film strongly coupled to a microwave resonator
Authors: Davit Petrosyan, Hiroki Matsumoto, Hanchen Wang, Jamal Ben Youssef, Richard Schlitz, William Legrand, Pietro Gambardella
Abstract: Cavity magnonics investigates hybrid systems where magnons interact coherently with photons, providing a platform to harness light-matter interaction in magnetic materials. Progress in this field hinges on achieving stronger and tunable nonlinear effects, which are essential for controlling magnon dynamics and frequency conversion. Here, we demonstrate the magnon Kerr effect in an anisotropic magnonic system comprising a 200~nm-thick yttrium iron garnet film strongly coupled to a three-dimensional microwave resonator. The strong shape anisotropy significantly enhances the magnon Kerr effect compared to a sphere of equivalent volume, while the cavity enables sensitive probing of magnetization dynamics. We demonstrate continuous tunability of the magnitude and sign of the Kerr shift by controlling the static orientation of the magnetization. Input-output modeling of the magnon-photon interaction provides a consistent description of our system and Kerr coefficients matching the experimental results. Our findings demonstrate a scalable approach to enhancing Kerr anharmonicity in hybrid magnon-photon systems while preserving strong coupling.

Title: Analysis of some solid amorphous inorganic structures and the boson peak phenomenon with a computational random graph approach
Authors: A. Berezner, M. Rybakov, M. Sidlyar, V. Fedorov
Abstract: In this study, a new alternative model algorithm has been proposed for assembling amorphous structures, unifying the bosonic paradigm applicable at low temperatures with crystalline models relevant at room and higher temperatures. Physical meaning of main model parameters is determined together with an explanation for the appearing bosonic peak using the random graph theory. Numerically, statistical atomic distribution in a multiphase amorphous system is provided without the melting simulation of base crystals, and the mean energy function has been determined analytically. The calculated table data are in good agreement with neutronography measurements of the actual amorphous alloy in its solid state. Programme optimisations were also implemented, and we outlined several effective steps to achieve the higher processing speed. The proposed programme code can be used for potential test assembling and simulations of amorphous systems with sorting by the optimal atomic content or proportion (i.e. glass forming ability).

Title: Anisotropic Kitaev Spin Glass in Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$
Authors: Mayia A. Vranas, Alejandro Ruiz, Vikram Nagarajan, Erik Lamb, Gerald D. Morris, Zahir Islam, Christie Nelson, Benjamin A. Frandsen, James G. Analytis, Alex Frano
Abstract: Kitaev iridates have been proposed as candidates for realizing an elusive quantum spin liquid (QSL) state, in which strong spin-orbit coupling and bond-directional exchange generate a highly frustrated and entangled ground state. However, all physical systems proposed to host this ground state, including Li$_2$IrO$_3$, Na$_2$IrO$_3$, and RuCl$_3$, develop magnetic order at low temperatures due to competing interactions. Nonetheless, theoretical modeling of experimental data has shown that Kitaev interactions are still present, motivating the application of perturbations such as pressure, magnetic field, and chemical doping to drive the system into the QSL phase. Here we study $\beta$-Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$ with dilute levels of Ru, $x \lesssim 10\%$. Through a combination of magnetometry, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, ac-heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation/resonance, we show that weak magnetic disorder suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and stabilizes an anisotropic spin glass that retains key signatures of Kitaev exchange. This Kitaev spin glass shows pronounced directional anisotropy in its magnetic susceptibility and thermoremenant magnetization. These results demonstrate that dilute magnetic disorder can access an anisotropic Kitaev spin glass: a proximate phase that freezes the Kitaev frustration landscape. This could provide a new window into the degeneracy, anisotropy, and competing interactions underlying the Kitaev QSL.

Title: Moire folded helical states at the interfaces of heterostructures
Authors: Paula Mellado
Abstract: A minimal model of a graphene topological insulator heterostructure is considered, where a moire superlattice modulates the Rashba spin orbit interaction. In the spin degenerate, spin orbit free limit, the reduced Brillouin zone contains flat, spin degenerate moire minibands, with periodicity determined by superlattice folding. The inclusion of spin orbit interaction lifts the spin degeneracy and reduces the effective spectral periodicity by a factor of two. Through spin orbit interaction, the moire potential entangles spin, sublattice, and leg degrees of freedom, reshaping the miniband structure in momentum space and generating emergent helicity spectral functions. As the Rashba coupling is renormalized by the moire pattern, it induces helicity fragmentation, in which the helicity weight is distributed across a dense manifold of moire minibands, forming an extended network of helicity carrying states and significantly enhancing helicity fluctuations at the bare response level. The emergence of Dirac like miniband crossings at finite spin orbit interaction demonstrates that moire heterostructures can support relativistic quasiparticles through band reconstruction. This model provides a microscopic mechanism by which proximity induced spin orbit coupling can be amplified via moire engineering.

Title: Chirality and Clock transitions in Twisted Dipolar Clusters
Authors: Paula Mellado, Xavier Cazor, Andres Concha
Abstract: We study samples and a dipolar model of magnetic rods arranged on twisted polygonal clusters in terms of the twist angle. We find that the relative twist between polygons induces noncollinear chiral phases, ranging from flux vortex closure to hedgehog like radial configurations. Chirality, quantified in terms of a bond order parameter, is an emergent property that behaves here as an Ising variable. The chiral configurations of the systems can be understood in terms of chirality and clock index order parameters, whose evolution with twist occurs through two types of first order phase transitions. Within a fixed Ising chiral sector, the clock index, rooted in the $C_N$ invariance of the polygons, characterizes chiral textures that share chirality. As the twist increases, it continuously shifts the preferred relative clock phase, but the Nfold anisotropy only allows discrete orientations; the competition produces a tilted Nfold energy landscape whose global minimum hops discontinuously between clock sectors. As the number of sites in the polygon grows, the resulting response displays a nonlinear crossover from rigid, Ising like behavior to an almost $\rm U(1)$ invariant regime, governed by a twist induced suppression of the emergent $Z_N$ clock anisotropy. A Landau phenomenology captures these trends and naturally extends to bilayer lattices, where we show that twisted honeycomb systems realize an effective sine-Gordon theory with twist-controlled transitions between isolated domain walls and domain wall lattices.

Title: Field-induced transitions from incommensurate to commensurate phases in helical antiferromagnets
Authors: P. T. Bolokhova, A. V. Syromyatnikov
Abstract: Heisenberg antiferromagnet with an easy-plane anisotropy is discussed in which a magnetic spiral is induced by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and/or frustration of the exchange coupling. The distortion of the spiral by small in-plane magnetic field is described analytically. It is found that the field can gradually change the vector of the magnetic structure ${\bf k}_0$ and can produce transitions between phases with incommensurate and commensurate magnetic orderings when ${\bf k}_0$ is close to ${\bf g}/n$, where ${\bf g}$ is a reciprocal lattice vector and $n$ is integer. Analytical expressions for critical fields are derived for $n=2$, 3, and 4. Application of the theory to the triangular-lattice compound $\rm RbFe(MoO_4)_2$ is discussed alongside its potential applicability to other materials. As a by-product of the main consideration, model parameters are found which describe more accurately the full set of available experimental data suggested before for $\rm RbFe(MoO_4)_2$.

Title: Hydrogen in Brownmillerite Perovskites: First-Principles Insights into Energetics and Induced Electronic-Magnetic Changes
Authors: Vladislav Korostelev, Pjotrs Žguns, Konstantin Klyukin
Abstract: Hydrogen uptake in brownmillerite perovskites A2B2O5 offers an (electro)chemically accessible route to tune functional properties, but mechanistic understanding and design rules for hydrogen-responsive oxides remain limited. Here we employ density functional theory (DFT) to quantify how H absorption affects electronic structure, magnetic exchange, and anisotropy in representative Sr2Fe2O5 and Sr2Co2O5 oxides. We find that hydrogenation introduces a localized electron that stabilizes near the proton, with B-site-dependent preference. The resulting lattice distortions and redistribution of charge density modify exchange coupling and cant the Neel vector, giving rise to weak ferromagnetism. We also show that absorption energies are highly sensitive to proton-electron arrangements and magnetic order, varying by up to 1 eV across different settings. This sensitivity demands consistent treatment of charge localization and spin states, together with careful choice of computational parameters. Extending to a variety of experimentally reported A2B2O5 compositions, we identify candidates with favorable H uptake and uncover a trend linking more favorable absorption to a higher B-site d-electron count. We also demonstrate that the preferred proton absorption site in these materials is governed by local O-O separations and lattice flexibility, which describe the ability of the framework to accommodate proton-induced distortions. Finally, benchmarks of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials reveal uncertainties of about 1 eV for site-resolved absorption energies, motivating descriptor-based surrogate models and targeted DFT validation. Together, these results establish practical design rules for hydrogen-responsive oxides relevant to iono-electronic devices, sensors, and electrically tunable spin functionality.

Title: Non-Equilibrium Quantum Many-Body Physics with Quantum Circuits
Authors: Bruno Bertini
Abstract: These are the notes for the 4.5-hour course with the same title that I delivered in August 2025 at the Les Houches summer school ``Exact Solvability and Quantum Information''. In these notes I pedagogically introduce the setting of brickwork quantum circuits and show that it provides a useful framework to study non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics in the presence of local interactions. I first show that brickwork quantum circuits evolve quantum correlations in a way that is fundamentally similar to local Hamiltonians, and then present examples of brickwork quantum circuits where, surprisingly, one can compute exactly several relevant dynamical and spectral properties in the presence of non-trivial interactions.

Title: Nanoscale mapping of phase-transformation pathways in medium-Mn TRIP steel by multimodal STEM
Authors: Marc Raventós-Tato, S. Leila Panahi, Núria Bagués, David Frómeta, Oleg Usoltsev, Núria Cuadrado, Joaquín Otón
Abstract: The mechanical response of third-generation advanced high-strength steels is governed by phase transformations at the nanoscale, yet the coupled evolution of chemistry and crystallography remains poorly resolved. Here we apply a correlative scanning transmission electron microscopy approach that enables simultaneous mapping of lattice structure, crystallographic orientation, and phase distribution at 10 nanometre resolution in a medium-manganese TRIP steel. We combine nano-beam electron diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps to characterize an industrial medium-manganese steel containing 7.15 weight percent Mn. Tensile testing of a rolled steel sample was performed, and lamellae were extracted from deformed and undeformed regions. Manganese-resolved energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy provides a chemical fingerprint that, when combined with nano-beam electron diffraction based phase segmentation, enables robust ferrite-martensite separation and phase-resolved lattice-parameter refinement. The phase fractions of ferrite, austenite, and martensite are quantified together with their corresponding lattice parameters, accompanied by measurable shifts in grain-size distributions and crystallographic texture in the deformed regions. Kernel average misorientation maps reveal systematically lower local misorientation in ferrite than in martensite. This multimodal workflow provides a transferable framework for quantitative, phase-resolved analysis of complex multiphase alloys at the nanoscale.

Title: Synthesis of Monolayer Ice on a Hydrophobic Metal Surface
Authors: Qiaoxiao Zhao, Meiling Xu, Dong Li, Zhicheng Gao, Yudian Zhou, Wenbo Liu, Jingyan Chen, Peng Cheng, Sheng Meng, Kehui Wu, Yanchao Wang, Lan Chen, Baojie Feng
Abstract: Understanding water-metal interactions is central to disciplines spanning catalysis, electrochemistry, and atmospheric science. Monolayer ice phases are well established on hydrophilic surfaces, where strong water-substrate interactions stabilize ordered hydrogen-bond networks. In contrast, their formation on hydrophobic metals has been deemed ther-modynamically unfavourable, with water typically assembling into amorphous films, three-dimensional crystallites, or interlocked bilayer ice. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a monolayer ice phase on the hydrophobic Au(111) surface using a low-energy-electron-assisted growth method. Combined experimental characterizations including low-energy electron diffraction, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, complemented by first-principles calculations, prove that the monolayer ice phase composes of intact water molecules. This approach provides a generalizable strategy for stabilizing ordered two-dimensional ice on inert substrates and offers new insight into the interplay between water and low-energy electrons at hydrophobic interfaces.

Title: Electronic band structure, phonon dispersion, and magnetic triple-q state in GdGaI
Authors: Tatsuya Kaneko, Ryota Mizuno, Shu Kamiyama, Hideo Miyamoto, Masayuki Ochi
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the physical properties of the magnetic van der Waals material GdGaI. Using first-principles calculations, we compute the phonon dispersion of GdGaI and show no imaginary phonons, suggesting that phonon-driven phase transitions are unlikely to occur in GdGaI. Our band calculation reveals that the electronic bands near the Fermi energy are composed of Gd 5d and Ga 4p orbitals. We construct a tight-binding model that incorporates the Gd 5d and Ga 4p orbitals to investigate the magnetic structure. We introduce Kondo coupling between electrons in Gd 5d orbitals and localized spins in Gd 4f orbitals and present the modified band structure when localized spins form a magnetic order characterized by three q vectors that connect the valence and conduction bands. We discuss the origin of the spin order based on the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida mechanism and suggest that Coulomb interactions acting on electrons near the Fermi level can contribute to the ordering of localized spins.

Title: Thermal and Microstructural Simulations of Photonic Sintering of Oxide Ceramics: A Two-Scale Scheme
Authors: Junlong Ma, Yangyiwei Yang, Julian N. Ebert, Wolfgang Rheinheimer, Bai-Xiang Xu
Abstract: Photonic sintering (PS) offers an ultra-fast, contact-free alternative to conventional sintering and has demonstrated its potential for enhancing the sinterability of acceptor-doped barium zirconate (BZY) ceramics. However, a central challenge in the PS process lies in achieving precise control over thermal self-stabilization in the presence of complex microstructural effects arising from photonic-ray--induced thermal profiles. To elucidate the interplay among thermal fields, microstructural evolution, and PS process parameters, this study establishes a two-scale, non-isothermal simulation framework. The framework integrates macroscopic heat-transfer simulations, incorporating effective heat conduction and photonic-ray--induced volumetric heating in the porous media, with microscopic non-isothermal phase-field sintering simulations that resolve microstructure evolution under local thermal profile. Scale bridging is achieved through a temperature field transferring and mapping that satisfies Hill-Mandel condition between the macroscopic and microscopic simulations, while maintaining synchronization between their asynchronous time-stepping schemes. After calibrating model parameters against experimental measurements, the framework successfully reproduces the experimentally observed porosity inhomogeneity along the sample depth. The influence of enhanced localized mass transport is further examined through a parametric investigation of surface and grain boundary diffusivities. Overall, the proposed framework demonstrates its feasibility and physical interpretability in establishing process-microstructure relationships for the scalable fabrication of high-performance protonic ceramics.

Title: Understanding the sign problem from an exact Path Integral Monte Carlo model of interacting harmonic fermions
Authors: Siu A. Chin
Abstract: This work shows that the recently discovered operator contraction identity for solving the discreet Path Integral of the harmonic oscillator can be applied equally to fermions in any dimension. This then yields an exactly solvable model for studying the sign problem where the Path Integral Monte Carlo energy at any time step for any number of fermions is known analytically, or can be computed numerically. It is found that repulsive/attractive pairwise interaction shifts the sign problem to larger/smaller imaginary time, but does not make it more severe than the non-interacting case. More surprisingly, for closed-shell number of fermions, the sign problem goes away at large imaginary time. Fourth-order and newly found variable-bead algorithms are used to compute ground state energies of quantum dots with up to 110 electrons and compared to results obtained by modern neural networks.

Title: Interaction induced topological magnon in electron-magnon coupled systems
Authors: Kosuke Fujiwara, Takahiro Morimoto
Abstract: We theoretically study the emergence of topological magnons in electron-magnon coupled systems. The magnon dispersion in a ferromagnet usually possesses an effective time reversal symmetry in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, preventing the appearance of topological magnons. When a spin system is coupled to itinerant electrons, we find that the magnon band structure of the spin system experiences time-reversal symmetry breaking with the electron-magnon interaction via the exchange coupling, where topological magnons arise without requiring strong DM. Specifically, we consider a heterostructure consisting of a ferromagnetic insulator and a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer and investigate topological gap opening in magnon bands. Our findings reveal that even trivial ferromagnets can host topological magnons via coupling to itinerant electronic systems.

Title: Electronic Origin of Density Wave Orders in a Trilayer Nickelate

J. Zhou
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates has established a new frontier in the study of high-temperature superconductors. However, the underlying pairing mechanism and its relationship to the material's electronic and magnetic ground states remain elusive. Since unconventional superconductivity often emerges from a complex interplay of magnetic correlations, elucidating the magnetic ground state of the nickelates at ambient pressure is crucial for understanding the emergence of superconductivity under high pressure. Here, we combine high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with tight-binding model simulation to investigate the electronic structure of the representative trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. We provide the first experimental evidence of band splitting induced by interlayer coupling and further resolve the momentum-dependent density wave gap structures along all the Fermi surfaces. Our findings identify the mirror-selective Fermi surface nesting as the origin of the interlayer antiferromagnetic spin density wave and demonstrate the dominant role of Ni-3d$_{z^2}$ orbitals in the low-energy physics of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. These results provide a fundamental framework for understanding the magnetic interactions and high-temperature superconductivity mechanism in the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate family.

Title: Turning Insulators into Accelerators: Deciphering the Interfacial Conductivity Boost in ZrO2-Li2ZrCl6 Composites through Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Boyuan Xu, Chen Qian, Liyi Bai, Chenlu Wang, Feng Ding, Qisheng Wu
Abstract: Halide solid-state electrolytes have emerged as promising candidates for all-solid-state lithium batteries due to their high oxidative stability and deformability, yet their moderate ionic conductivity remains a bottleneck. While incorporating ionically insulating ZrO2 nanoparticles (Nat. Commun. 2023, 14, 2459) has been experimentally shown to enhance the ionic conductivity of Li2ZrCl6, the atomistic origin governing this interfacial phenomenon remains unclear. Here, we bridge the spatiotemporal gap in modeling complex heterostructures by developing an accurate machine-learned force fields based on neuroevolution potential, enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of ZrO2/Li2ZrCl6 heterostructures. By systematically investigating four representative low-lattice-mismatch ZrO2/Li2ZrCl6 interfaces, we identify spontaneous interfacial amorphization driven by space-charge effects upon surface cleavage, trapping Li+ and leading to under-coordinated Li+ polyhedrons with pronounced geometric distortion. These distorted amorphous interfacial regions exhibit markedly enhanced Li+ hopping activity, significantly outperforming the bulk lattice, provided that local mobile Li+ inventory is not depleted by surface charge redistribution. This work establishes a computational framework for training validated machine-learned force fields for interfaces and provides mechanistic understandings of the interfacial conductivity boost in the insulator-conductor composites, guiding the rational design of electrolytes toward next-generation solid-state batteries.

Title: Small equatorial deformation of homogeneous spherical fluid vesicles
Authors: Andrés Solís-Cuevas, Pablo Vázquez-Montejo
Abstract: We examine the reaction of a homogeneous spherical fluid vesicle to the force exerted by a rigid circular ring located at its equator in the linear regime. We solve analytically the linearized first integral of the Euler-Lagrange equation subject to the global constraints of fixed area and volume, as well as to the local constraint imposed by the ring. We determine the first-order perturbations to the generating curve of the spherical membrane, which are characterized by the difference of the radii of the membrane and the ring, and by a parameter depending on the physical quantities of the membrane. We determine the total force that is required to begin the deformation of the membrane, which gives rise to a discontinuity in the curvature of the membrane across the ring.

Title: Noise-Assisted Metastability: From Lévy Flights to Memristors, Quantum Escape, and Josephson-based Axion Searches
Authors: Claudio Guarcello, Alexander A. Dubkov, Davide Valenti, Bernardo Spagnolo
Abstract: Many-body and complex systems, both classical and quantum, often exhibit slow, nonlinear relaxation toward stationary states due to the presence of metastable configurations and environmental fluctuations. Nonlinear relaxation in a wide variety of natural systems proceeds through metastable states, which arise in condensed-matter physics as well as in fields ranging from cosmology and biology to high-energy physics. Moreover, noise-induced phenomena play a central role in shaping the dynamics of such systems far from equilibrium. This review develops a unifying perspective centered on noise-assisted stabilization and the statistical properties of metastable dynamics. We first discuss escape processes driven by Lévy flights in smooth metastable potentials, emphasizing the emergence of nonmonotonic residence-time behavior. We then connect these concepts to stochastic resistive switching in memristive devices, where noise-induced effects can enhance stability and reproducibility. We further examine driven dissipative quantum bistability, showing how the interplay between external driving and system-environment coupling reshapes escape pathways and lifetimes. Finally, we outline how switching-time statistics in current-biased Josephson junctions can provide an experimentally accessible strategy for axion detection, based on an axion-induced resonant-activation signature.

Title: Spin quantum Hall transition on random networks: exact critical exponents via quantum gravity
Authors: Esteban Macías, Ilya Gruzberg, Eldad Bettelheim
Abstract: We solve the problem of the spin quantum Hall transition on random networks using a mapping to classical percolation that focuses on the boundary of percolating clusters. Using tools of two-dimensional quantum gravity, we compute critical exponents that characterize this transition and confirm that these are related to the exponents for the regular (square) network through the KPZ relation. Our results demonstrate the relevance of the geometric randomness of the networks and support conclusions of numerical simulations of random networks for the integer quantum Hall transition.

Title: A Toy Model for the Cycle Rank Dependence of Stretch at Break in Phantom Chain Network Simulations
Authors: Yuichi Masubuchi
Abstract: The relationship between the topological architecture of polymer networks and their macroscopic rupture remains a fundamental challenge in polymer physics. Recent coarse-grained simulations have revealed that the dependence of stretch at break (\lambda_b) on node functionality and reaction conversion can be unified into a universal master curve when plotted against the cycle rank density (\xi). However, a theoretical derivation explaining this universality has been lacking. This study proposes a simple mechanical model to describe the \xi-dependence of fracture strain. The polymer network is modeled as a mechanical system consisting of a sequence of springs representing localized highly stretched strands and the surrounding unstretched network. By relating the stiffness contrast between these regions to the network connectivity defined by \xi, an analytical expression for the stretch at break is derived: \lambda_b\propto\sfrac{\left(2\xi+5\right)}{\left(2\xi+1\right)}. The proposed model is validated against phantom chain simulations using both Gaussian and finite extensibility (FENE) springs. The theoretical prediction shows excellent agreement with simulation data, providing a physical basis for the phenomenological universality observed in polymer network rupture.

Title: Incorporating Gibbs free energy into interatomic potential fitting
Authors: Liangrui Wei, Yang Sun
Abstract: We develop a method to fit high-temperature Gibbs free energy data for the development of interatomic potentials for atomic systems. The approach is based on Hamiltonian thermodynamic integration, enabling the identification of suitable potential parameters such that the system's free energy matches a specified target. The method can be readily combined with conventional fitting techniques for properties such as elastic tensors and liquid pair distribution functions. We validate the effectiveness of the approach using the Uhlenbeck-Ford model and embedded-atom method potentials for pure Ni phases and binary Fe1-xOx liquids under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. Our framework provides an efficient strategy for incorporating free energy into interatomic potential fitting.

Title: Single-Shot Flow Spectroscopy of a Polariton Condensate: Kibble-Zurek and Kolmogorov-Like Scaling
Authors: Ivan Krasionov, Anton Putintsev, Maksim Kolker, Tamsin Cookson, Sergey Alyatkin, Pavlos G. Lagoudakis
Abstract: Quantized vortices are fundamental topological excitations of quantum fluids. We report single-shot interferometric measurements of spontaneous vortex nucleation in a room-temperature organic exciton-polariton condensate. From hundreds of independent realizations we find random vortex-core positions and unbiased circulation, consistent with intrinsically stochastic, unpinned defect formation. The mean vortex number scales with pump power above threshold with an exponent consistent with Kibble-Zurek freeze-out in a driven-dissipative condensate. Using reconstructed phase maps we obtain single-shot flow fields, compute the incompressible component, and extract kinetic-energy spectra. Vortex-containing realizations develop a robust Kolmogorov-like segment with Einc(k) proportional to k^(-5/3) over a finite k range, indicating the onset of turbulent spectral scaling in a quantum fluid of light. These results establish single-shot access to phase and flow as a direct route to quantifying stochastic defect formation and emerging turbulence in polariton condensates.

Title: Spectral insights into active matter: Exceptional Points and the Mathieu equation
Authors: Horst-Holger Boltz, Thomas Ihle
Abstract: We show that recent numerical findings of universal scaling relations in systems of noisy, aligning self-propelled particles by Kürsten [Kürsten, arXiv:2402.18711v2 [cond-mat.soft] (2025)] can robustly be explained by perturbation theory and known results for the Mathieu equation with purely imaginary parameter. In particular, we highlight the significance of a cascade of exceptional points that leads to non-trivial fractional scaling exponents in the singular-perturbation limit of high activity. Crucially, these features are rooted in the Fokker-Planck operator corresponding to free self-propulsion. This can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition in the dynamics of noisy active matter.

Title: Electrical conductivity of a random nanowire network: comparison of two-dimensional and quasi-three-dimensional models
Authors: Yuri Yu. Tarasevich
Abstract: It is shown that the widely used two-dimensional model of random networks of metallic nanowires or carbon nanotubes significantly overestimates the number of contacts between elements compared to real systems, which, within the mean-field approach, leads to overestimated estimates of electrical conductivity, especially when the contact resistances between conductors make the main contribution to the electrical conductivity of the system. In the case of a two-dimensional model, the electrical conductivity of the system depends quadratically on the number density of conductors, whereas in the case of a three-dimensional model this dependence is linear.

Title: Optimizing spin-based terahertz emission from magnetic heterostructures
Authors: Francesco Foggetti, Francesco Cosco, Peter M. Oppeneer, Henri Jaffrés, Niloufar Nilforoushan, Juliette Mangeney, Sukhdeep Dhillon
Abstract: Terahertz radiation pulses can be generated efficiently through femtosecond laser excitation of a ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic heterostructure, wherein an ultrafast laser-induced spin current results in an electromagnetic THz pulse due to spin-charge conversion. It is, however, still poorly understood how the THz emission amplitude and its bandwidth can be optimized. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the THz emission from various magnetic heterostructures. The dynamics of the spin current is described by the semiclassical, superdiffusive spin-transport model and the energy dependence of the spin Hall effect of hot electrons is taken into account, leading to emission profiles for Co(2 nm)/Pt(4 nm) bilayer in good agreement with experiment. To identify the optimal {conditions} for THz emission, {we study} the properties of the emitted THz wave profile by systematically varying the layer thicknesses of metallic bilayers, their interfacial spin-current transmission properties, their materials' dependence, and influence of the pump laser-pulse width, allowing us to give optimization guidelines. We find that thin nonmagnetic layer thicknesses of 5-6 nm provide the largest bandwidth in the case of Co/Pt and that the peak frequency of the THz emission depends only on the geometry of the emitter and not on the laser pulse width. The THz bandwidth {is conversely found to} depend on several factors such as exciting laser pulse width, layers' thicknesses, and interface transmission-reflection properties, with the limitation that an increase in the bandwidth by tuning the interface properties comes with a trade-off in the energy efficiency of the emitter. Lastly, we propose a double pulse excitation protocol of a trilayer system that could provide broadband THz emission with a large bandwidth. {Our results contribute to establishing guidelines for optimizing spintronic THz generation.

Title: Long-distance spin transport in frustrated hyperkagome magnet Gd3Ga5O12

Abstract: Transport of spin angular momentum over large distance has been a long sought-after goal in the field of spintronics. While the majority of the research effort has been devoted to the spin transport properties of magnetically ordered materials, spin transport in magnetically frustrated materials has received little attention. Here, we report an anomalous state in frustrated hyperkagome magnetic insulator Gd3Ga5O12, where spin angular momenta can be transported over a long distance of 480 {\mu}m, far exceeding the transport distance of any diffusive spin current in magnetically ordered materials, to the best of our knowledge. Monte Carlo simulations reveal significant spin fluctuations, spin-spin correlations and an absence of conventional magnons in such anomalous state; while the response of the anomalous state to perturbation is found to be akin to an overdamped forced oscillator. We find close relation of such state to the correlated ``director'' state in the material. Our result provides an effective electrical technique to characterize spin-spin correlations and frustrations; it also unveils the potential of frustrated magnets as powerful channel materials for spin transport.

Title: Ferroelectric switching at edge dislocations in BaTiO$_3$ modelled at the atomic scale
Authors: Himal Wijekoon, Pierre Hirel, Anna Grünebohm
Abstract: Ferroelectric switching governs the functional properties of ferroelectric perovskites. It is widely accepted that this switching depends on domain nucleation and pinning and that these processes can be controlled by the defect structure. However, an atomistic picture of the influence of one important class of defects - dislocations on ferroelectric switching is missing. This is an important gap in knowledge as dislocations cannot be avoided at interfaces and can also be engineered by plastic deformation at high temperatures. Using atomistic simulations, we show how the cores of $\langle100\rangle$ edge dislocations in BaTiO$_3$ can either act as nucleation centers for ferroelectric switching or pin walls depending on the direction of the applied field. The coupling between electric field and polarization is strongest when the field is applied parallel to the Burgers vector of the dislocation.

Title: Magnetization reversal and anisotropies in buffered transition-metal alloys thin films
Authors: Agostina Lo Giudice, Augusto Román, Laura Beatriz Steren
Abstract: Interest in planar Hall effect (PHE) sensors has re-emerged in recent years due to their promising potential for a wide range of applications, particularly in biotechnology. Sensor sensitivity can be enhanced by lowering the effective anisotropy field; however, this favors magnetic domain formation during magnetization reversal, leading to hysteretic responses. Therefore, precise control of magnetic anisotropy and magnetization reversal is essential to balance sensitivity and stability in PHE sensors. In this work, we investigate the magnetic anisotropy and magnetization reversal mechanisms of Ni-Fe- and Co-Fe-based multilayers grown on various metallic buffer layers and deposited with and without an external magnetic field, in order to evaluate the effects of the buffer layers and field-assisted deposition on the resulting magnetic anisotropy. NiFe films exhibit a dominant uniaxial anisotropy mainly determined by the applied field during growth, with an anisotropy constant of approximately $3,\mathrm{kerg,cm^{-3}}$, largely independent of the buffer layer. In contrast, the magnetic anisotropy of CoFe films is dominated by the buffer layer, resulting in a biaxial magnetic response. In particular, Ag-buffered films deposited under an external magnetic field exhibit a biaxial anisotropy with values up to $14.88,\mathrm{kerg,cm^{-3}}$. The magnetization reversal mechanism of each system was deduced from the analysis of the angular dependence of the coercive field.

Title: Synchronization and phase transition of two-dimensional self-rotating clock models
Authors: Xin Wu, Mingcheng Yang
Abstract: We explore possible synchronization in two-dimensional (2D) locally coupled discrete-state oscillators under thermal fluctuations, using the self-rotating $q$-state clock model as a prototype. Large-scale Monte Carlo simulations reveal that for $q \ge q_c$ (with $q_c = 5$), the system undergoes two-step Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions: first from a disordered phase to a critical synchronized phase, and then to a spatiotemporal pattern phase. The latter includes oscillatory droplet states that survive in finite systems and a thermodynamically stable spiral wave state. Notably, the synchronized phase features algebraically decaying spatial correlations, alongside divergent coherence time, thus realizing a continuous time crystal; while it vanishes when $q < q_c$. Mean-field theory supports the existence of the synchronized phase, but predicts a lower critical value $q_c^{MF} = 4$.

Title: Altermagnetic-Like Behavior and Enhanced Coercivity in Ferrimagnets at a Critical Point of an Extended Néel-Diagram
Authors: Qais Ali, Anna Grünebohm, Halil Ibrahim Sözen, Tilmann Hickel, Jörg Neugebauer, Eduardo Mendive-Tapia
Abstract: We generalize the classic Néel diagram for ferrimagnets within a mean-field framework and reveal a critical point at which full magnetic compensation is maintained below the Curie temperature and extends past the nominal compensation point. Ferrimagnets tuned to this critical point display altermagnetic-like features and markedly enhanced coercive fields. We show that proximity to this regime requires minimizing the net local moment while balancing exchange interactions with respect to the number of equivalent atoms in each sublattice. The resulting extended Néel diagram provides practical design principles for engineering ferrimagnets near the critical point via targeted chemical substitution that combines atoms with robust and weak local moments, as demonstrated through density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations for GdCo$_5$-type ferrimagnets.

Title: Gate-tuneable single-photon emitters in WSe2 monolayer created via AFM nanoindentation on rigid SiO2/Si substrates

Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) hosted by two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials are envisioned for next-generation quantum applications. However, SPE creation in 2D semiconductors on rigid substrates like SiO2/Si via nanoindentation is a technological gap, critical for interfacing SPEs with photonic circuits and cavities. Here, we report a protocol for deterministically creating SPEs in monolayer WSe2 on SiO2/Si substrates using a sharp diamond AFM (atomic force microscope) tip. A displacement-controlled indentation process is developed, allowing indent depths > 150 nm necessary for creating SPEs. Sharp defect peaks (~200 {\mu}eV) are observed in cryogenic (4K) photoluminescence (PL) spectrum at nanoindented sites and are stable upto ~ 120K. 76% of sites exhibit sharp defect-bound peaks confirmed by power-dependent, temperature-dependent, and time-resolved PL (TRPL). AFM and PL mapping link these peaks to indent periphery. The peaks show sub-linewidth spectral jitter, no blinking, and single-photon nature in second-order autocorrelation measurements. SPEs can be switched on/off, and background emissions suppressed using electrical gating. Gate-voltage dependent TRPL indicate that SPE dynamics can be tuned, depending on nature of SPE, pointing the way to higher-purity SPEs. Our work is directly applicable to other 2D materials and photonic circuit/cavity compatible rigid substrates and is a significant step for scalable SPE technologies.

Title: Leveraging Interactions for Efficient Swarm-Based Brownian Computing
Authors: Alessandro Pignedoli, Atreya Majumdar, Karin Everschor-Sitte
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from swarm intelligence, we show that short-range attractive interactions between thermally driven Brownian quasiparticles enable energy-efficient optimization. As quasiparticles can be generated directly within a material, the swarm size can be adjusted with minimal energy overhead. Using an optimization task defined by a spatially varying temperature landscape, we quantitatively show that interacting swarms reliably identify global optima and significantly outperform non-interacting searchers within a well-defined regime of interaction strength and swarm size. This improvement arises from emergent cooperative behavior, where local interactions guide the swarm toward high-quality solutions without central coordination. To link our physical model to experimental realizations, we coarse-grain the quasiparticle dynamics onto a sensor lattice and generate trajectories emulating particle-tracking measurements. We further show that the interacting swarm adapts robustly to landscapes that evolve over time. These findings establish interacting Brownian quasiparticles as a physical platform for scalable and energy-efficient unconventional computing.

Title: N-state Potts ices as generalizations of classical and quantum spin ice
Authors: Mark Potts, Roderich Moessner, S.A. Parameswaran
Abstract: Classical and quantum spin ice models are amongst the most popular settings for the study of spin liquid physics. $N-$state Potts ice models have been constructed that generalize spin ice, hosting multiple emergent $\text{U}(1)$ gauge fields and excitations charged under non-trivial combinations of these fields. We present a general treatment of classical $N-$state Potts ices relating their properties to the $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ Lie algebras, and demonstrate how the properties of charged excitations in the classical model can be related to this symmetry group. We also introduce quantum generalizations of the Potts Ice models, and demonstrate how charge flavor changing interactions unique to $N>2$ models dominate their low energy physics. We further show how symmetries inherited from the $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ can lead to flux vacuum frustration, greatly modifying the dynamical properties of charged excitations.

Title: Spiral Phase and Phase Diagram of the $S$=1/2 XXZ Model on the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice
Authors: Zhengpeng Yuan, Muwei Wu, Dao-Xin Yao, Han-Qing Wu
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the $S$=1/2 XXZ model on the two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland lattice using exact diagonalization (ED), density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and cluster mean-field theory (CMFT) with DMRG as a solver. In the isotropic case ($\Delta=1$), CMFT results reveal an intermediate empty plaquette (EP) phase that has a lower energy than the full plaquette (FP) phase. However, due to mean-field artifacts, CMFT alone is not suitable for accurately determining phase boundaries. Therefore, we combined three methods to map out the reliable phase diagram. Our calculations show that the EP phase narrows as $\Delta$ deviates from unity and eventually vanishes. More importantly, we identify a spiral phase at small $\Delta$, which has not been reported in previous studies. This phase is clearly captured by DMRG simulations on long cylindrical geometries. The competition between the EP, spiral, and $xy$-AFM phases near their boundaries provides a plausible explanation for the emergent spin-liquid-like behavior in RE$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_2$, while shedding new light on the role of XXZ anisotropy in the Shastry-Sutherland XXZ model.

Title: Resolving Structural Avalanches in Amorphous Carbon with Arclength Continuation
Authors: Fraser Birks, Ibrahim Ghanem, Lars Pastewka, James Kermode, Maciej Buze
Abstract: Plastic deformation in amorphous solids is carried by localized shear transformations that self-organize into avalanches. In amorphous carbon modeled with a machine-learned interatomic potential, we find that the energetics and organization of these avalanches can be resolved by systematically following the underlying energy landscape. With a pseudo-arclength numerical continuation framework, we decompose avalanches into constituent shear transformations and determine their strain-dependent energetics. Our analysis shows that, prior to onset, avalanches have a latent structure that consists of well-separated local minima. We further demonstrate that arclength continuation yields an event driven framework for following avalanche dynamics, eliminating time-step effects on statistical avalanche properties such as distributions of stress drops.

Title: Soliton-to-droplet crossover in a dipolar Bose gas in one and two dimensions
Authors: Malte Schubert, Thomas Bland, Manfred J. Mark, Francesca Ferlaino, Stephanie Reimann
Abstract: We analyze a system of dipolar atoms confined in geometries of quasi-low-dimensionality. Due to the long-range and anisotropic nature of dipolar interactions, the system supports both stable solitons and quantum droplets. In quasi-one-dimensional geometries, the transition between these states is known to manifest either as a first-order phase transition, associated with bistability, or as a smooth crossover. We investigate this transition by calculating the structure factor and showing that the response of the breathing mode provides an experimentally accessible probe. In addition, we identify regions of both bistability and smooth crossover in quasi-two-dimensional geometries. Finally, we connect our findings to previous experimental results and delineate the conditions under which two-dimensional dipolar bright solitons can be realized.

Title: Dynamics of antiskyrmion shrinking
Authors: Frederik Austrup, Wolfgang Häusler, Michael Lau, Michael Thorwart
Abstract: Antiskyrmions are unstable in ferromagnetic systems with isotropic bulk or interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). We develop a continuum model for the shrinking dynamics of antiskyrmions in bulk DMI systems, using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for the time derivative of the magnetization field. Owing to the structure of their azimuthal angle, or helicity, elliptic antiskyrmions are energetically favored over circular ones. To capture this feature, we parametrize the magnetization field with a triangular radial profile and an elliptic in-plane shape. This ansatz yields four coupled dynamical equations governing time evolution of the semi-axes, helicities, and rotation angles. In the absence of the DMI, circular antiskyrmions shrink isotropically, exhibiting a crossover from exponential decay to square-root collapse. Initially elliptic antiskyrmions are driven towards circularity. For finite DMI, the semi-axes dynamics couples to the helicity and rotation, where the theory predicts a rotation angle following by half of the slope of the helicity evolution which is linear in time. Only at small semi-axes a cross-over to a logarithmic divergence occurs. The shrinking dynamics of the antiskyrmion size is found to be accompanied by quadrupole-like oscillations. Numerical simulations on the lattice support the predictions from the continuum model.

Title: Gradient dynamics model for chemically driven running drops
Authors: Justus Niehoff, Florian Voss, Uwe Thiele
Abstract: We present a thermodynamically consistent model for chemically driven running drops on a solid substrate with reversible substrate adsorption of a wettability-changing chemical species. We consider drops confined to a vertical gap, thereby allowing us to first obtain a gradient dynamics description of the closed system, corresponding to a set of coupled dynamical equations for the drop profile and the chemical concentration profiles of species on the substrate and in both fluids (drop, ambient medium). Chemostatting the species in the drop and the ambient medium, we then derive a reduced model for the dynamics of the drop and the adsorbate on the substrate. When the externally imposed chemical potentials are distinct, the system is driven away from thermodynamic equilibrium, allowing for sustained drop self-propulsion across the substrate due to a wettability contrast maintained by chemical reactions. We numerically study the resulting running drops and show how they emerge from drift-pitchfork bifurcations.

Title: Role of quasi-Fermi levels in Si- and Mg-related optical absorption in nitride laser diodes (LDs): material context
Authors: Konrad Sakowski, Cyprian Sobczak, Pawel Strak, Izabella Grzegory, Robert Czernecki, Jacek Piechota, Agata Kaminska, Stanislaw Krukowski
Abstract: Optical absorption and reabsorption of light emitted from active regions in nitride laser diodes (LDs) have been shown to reduce the light extraction efficiency of these devices. It was proven that the presence of Si and Mg may considerably increase the optical absorption. This effect is much stronger in the high-energy (short-wavelength) range of the spectrum. The absorption increase is directly related to the ionization of the Si donor and Mg acceptor levels, which are controlled by the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels. It is shown that the absorption may be increased because of the higher ionization of Mg caused by the compensation in the p-type region and the high ionization of Si in the n-type region. It was explained theoretically why optical efficiency is increased by removal of doping in waveguides. It was also shown that good material quality leads to a low absorption level, especially in the Mg-doped p-type part of the device.

Title: Probing Interfacial Spin Dynamics and Temperature Dependent Asymmetry in Spin Pumping Across Ni80Fe20/Cu/Cr1.12Te2 Interfaces
Authors: Mahammad Tahir, Swati Pandey, Sourabh Manna, Rajdeep Singh Rawat, Rohit Medwal, Soumik Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: Spin transfers in magnetic multilayers offers a promising pathway toward ultrafast, energy-efficient spintronic devices. In this study, we investigate the interfacial spin pumping and temperature-dependent spin current exchange in a Cr1.12Te2/Cu/Ni80Fe20 (Py)(FM1/NM/FM2) trilayer structure. Using broadband and cryogenic ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements, we investigate key magnetization dynamical parameters, including the effective Gilbert damping factor, effective magnetic fields, interfacial spin mixing conductance, and spin current density. Efficient spin angular momentum transfers from Py to Cr1.12Te2 are observed at room temperature. At lower temperatures, the enhanced linewidth reflects temperature dependent spin pumping effects occurring at distinct precession frequencies of the ferromagnetic layers. Notably, the absence of interfacial Damping indicates that spin pumping can be modulated by controlling the net spin current flow. These findings offer critical insight into temperature-dependent tunable spin transport mechanisms in magnetic multilayers, highlighting their potential for next-generation spintronic applications.

Title: Hydrogen at GaN(0001) surface control of Fermi level pinning: Mg activation of p-type conductivity -- Nakamura process deciphered
Authors: Konrad Sakowski, Pawel Strak, Pawel Kempisty, Izabella Grzegory, Stanislaw Krukowski
Abstract: Ab initio calculations were used to disentangle the mystery of Nakamura activation of p-type in Mg doped MOVPE grown gallium nitride, the key process leading to the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics. Calculations were used to obtain the equilibrium state of the hydrogen atom deep in the GaN bulk and at the GaN(0001) surface. It was shown that the H position within bulk GaN depends on the Fermi level: in n-type GaN, it is located in the channel, whereas in p-type GaN, it is attached to the N atom, breaking one of the GaN bonds. In contrast, at the GaN(0001) surface, H is attached in the on-top position for any hydrogen coverage; for low and high H-coverage, the Fermi level is pinned at the Ga - broken bond state and at the valence band maximum (VBM), respectively. The diffusion path from the bulk to the surface was obtained when the Fermi level was high and low, the barrier was zero, and $\Delta E_{bar} \approx 1.717 eV$, which effectively blocked hydrogen escape into the vapor. Thus, high H coverage, that is, high hydrogen pressure in the vapor, prevents H from escaping from the bulk to the surface, whereas at low coverage (low hydrogen pressure), the process is barrierless. It is therefore proven that the hydrogen escape control step in the Nakamura process is the transition of hydrogen from the bulk to the surface, which is controlled by the position of the Fermi level at the surface. Molecular hydrogen desorption from the surface is easy for high H coverage and difficult for low, thus opposite to observed experimentally thus this process is not the determining step in activation. A full thermodynamic estimate of the maximal partial pressure of hydrogen in the vapor, corresponding to the transition of the Fermi level from the Ga-broken bond state to the VBM, was used to establish the maximal hydrogen pressure limit for the p-type Mg activation process.

Title: Unlocking the Power of Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory to Explore the Electronic Structure Under Extreme Conditions
Authors: Cheng Ma, Qiang Xu, Zhenhao Zhang, Ke Wang, Ying Sun, Wenhui Mi, Zhandos A. Moldabekov, Tobias Dornheim, Jan Vorberger, Sebastian Schwalbe, Xuecheng Shao
Abstract: Recent advances in X-ray free-electron laser diagnostics have enabled direct probing of the electronic structure under extreme pressures and temperatures, such as those encountered in stellar interiors and inertial confinement fusion experiments, challenging theoretical models for interpreting experimental data. Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) has been successfully applied to analyze experimental X-ray scattering measurements, but its high computational cost renders routine application impractical. Orbital-free DFT (OFDFT) is a substantially more efficient alternative, with computational cost scaling linearly with system size and a weak temperature dependence, yet it often lacks the accuracy required for electronic structure description. Overcoming this limitation, we present a non-empirical Kohn-Sham-assisted orbital-free density functional framework for calculations at extreme conditions, which enables efficient OFDFT simulations with KSDFT-level accuracy for electron densities, electron-ion structure factors, and equations of state across a broad range of conditions. Benchmark comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo data for dense hydrogen and validation against Rayleigh weight measurements of hot dense beryllium demonstrate the reliability of the framework and speedups of up to several hundred times compared with KSDFT. We further show that even at temperatures on the order of 100 eV, quantum non-locality remains essential for correctly describing the electronic structure of dense hydrogen.

Title: Quasiperiodic Skin Criticality in an Exactly Solvable Non-Hermitian Quasicrystal
Authors: Zhangyuan Chen, Muhammad Idrees, Ying Yang, Xianqi Tong, Xiaosen Yang
Abstract: Critical states in quasiperiodic systems defy the conventional dichotomy between extended and localized states. In this work, we demonstrate that non-Hermiticity fundamentally reshapes this paradigm by giving rise to an exactly solvable quasiperiodic critical phase with no energy selectivity. We introduce a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice based on a modulated Hatano-Nelson model and uncover a new universality class of quasiperiodic skin criticality, in which all eigenstates share an identical multifractal spatial structure. Through a nonunitary gauge transformation, the system is mapped onto a disorder-free lattice, enabling exact analytical solutions for the full spectrum and eigenstates. As a consequence, the inverse participation ratio is strictly energy-independent and controlled solely by a global phase. We further show that this criticality persists in multiband lattices, establishing a general and analytically controlled framework for non-Hermitian quasiperiodic critical phenomena.

Title: Atomic-scale Imaging of Iodide-Gold Interactions in Nanoconfined Liquid-Solid Interfaces
Authors: Oliver R. Waszkiewicz, Yuxiang Zhou, Baptiste Gault, Finn Giuliani, Mary P. Ryan, Ayman A. El-Zoka
Abstract: Functionalization of nanoporous metallic materials enables the tailoring of surface chemistry and morphology in nanostructured materials, optimising their performance for electrocatalytic and sensor applications. Liquid phase chemical functionalization is governed by liquid solid interfaces. Yet, these interfaces remain poorly understood due to the challenges of characterising the liquid phase at high spatial and chemical resolutions. To elucidate pathways for functionalizing nanoscale metals, it is crucial to measure the distribution of species, including light elements, across the liquid solid interface, capturing both reactants and products. Here, we employ cryogenic atom probe tomography to directly analyse frozen liquid solid reaction interfaces at near atomic resolution. Focusing on the interaction of iodide and sodium ions with nanoporous gold, we observe the formation of iodine containing complexes on gold nanoligament surfaces and subsurfaces. These findings reveal aspects of the gold iodide system that were previously hidden, including the reaction mechanism between iodide and gold atoms on the surface, and the multiple gold iodide complexes forming. Our work demonstrates that cryogenic atom probe tomography can provide unprecedented visualisation and characterisation of nanoscale interfaces during chemical and electrochemical reactions, with potential implications for modern manufacturing, energy technologies, and sustainable materials development.

Title: Infinite Magnetoresistance and Vortex Coupling in the Pb/BSCCO Heterostructure
Authors: Weifan Zhu, Jiamin Yao, Shuntianjiao Ling, Shanyin Fu, Yifu Xu, Pengyue Xiong, Jiawen Zhang, Mengwei Xie, Yanan Zhang, Ye Chen, Huiqiu Yuan, Xin Lu, Qing-Hu Chen, Yang Liu
Abstract: Combining superconductivity with spintronics provides exciting opportunities to realize low-dissipation quantum devices. Here we report the synthesis, characterization and magnetotransport measurements of the Pb/Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO) superconducting heterostructures, where an insulating PbO$_{x}$ layer spontaneously forms at the interface. Non-volatile switching between superconducting (logical "0") and normal ("1") states in Pb films by an external field, i.e., infinite magnetoresistance (IMR), can be realized and are attributed to the strong trapping and pinning of vortices in BSCCO. Furthermore, butterfly-shaped hysteresis loops in magnetoresistance, pronounced resistance dips/jumps and thermal reset to superconducting states can be observed and are direct manifestations of the peculiar vortex dynamics in BSCCO and vortex coupling across the Pb/BSCCO interface. Our work demonstrates a simple and effective way to realize IMR through superconducting vortices and opens up new opportunities to study the vortex interactions across the superconducting interfaces.

Title: Conical Magnetic Structure and Atomic Displacements in Chiral Helimagnet Yb(Ni,Cu)$_3$Al$_9$ in Magnetic Fields along the Helical $c$ Axis
Authors: Takeshi Matsumura, Mitsuru Tsukagoshi, Shota Nakamura, Shigeo Ohara
Abstract: We investigated the conical magnetic state of a uniaxial chiral helimagnet Yb(Ni$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$)$_3$Al$_9$ induced in magnetic fields applied along the $c$ axis, which coincides with the helical axis at zero field. Using resonant X-ray diffraction, we clearly observed the disappearance of magnetic satellite peaks, corresponding to the transition from the conical to the field-induced ferromagnetic state. The critical fields were determined to be 4 T for $x=0$ and 7 T for $x= 0.05$, which were hardly discernible in the magnetization curves. We also found that atomic displacements with the same propagation vector emerge simultaneously with the onset of the conical order. The transition temperature $T_{\text{N}}$ and the critical fields for $H \parallel c$ ($H_{\text{c}}^{z}$) and $H\perp c$ ($H_{\text{c}}^{x}$) are discussed on the basis of a mean-field calculation for a simple $q=1$ model of the magnetic structure. We propose that $T_{\text{N}}$ and $H_{\text{c}}^{z}$ primarily reflect the dominant intralayer exchange interactions within the honeycomb Yb-layer, whereas $H_{\text{c}}^{x}$ is governed by the much weaker interlayer coupling.

Title: Charging energy effects on a single-edge anyon braiding detector
Authors: Noé Demazure, Flavio Ronetti, Benoît Grémaud, Laurent Raymond, Masayuki Hashisaka, Takeo Kato, Thierry Martin
Abstract: We investigate the influence of capacitive coupling on the detection of anyon braiding in a single-edge interferometer realized in the fractional quantum Hall regime. In this setup, a quantum point contact bends a single edge into a loop, where tunneling occurs at the open end and is controlled by the QPC voltage. In contrast with previously studied two-edge geometries, the weak backscattering regime is dominated by the first-order perturbative term, allowing quantum transport quantities to factorize into a non-universal prefactor and a braiding-induced contribution that provides direct access to the universal statistical angle $\pi\lambda$. While previous analyses neglected edge-to-edge capacitance, we show that capacitive effects, which are known to play a crucial role in mesoscopic capacitors, modify both the current and the current cross-correlations. Using a two-point Green's function formalism augmented by Dyson's equation to include the charging energy, we quantify how the fluctuations of the cross-correlations depend simultaneously on $\lambda$ and on the capacitance of the loop. Our results indicate that a reliable extraction of the statistical angle requires a parallel measurement of the loop capacitance, which can be implemented via a charged gate coupled to the junction.

Title: Theory of Little-Parks oscillations by vortices in two-dimensional superconductors
Authors: Ying-Ming Xie, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: The Little-Parks (LP) effect is a quantum phenomenon in which the superconducting transition temperature of a superconducting cylinder (or ring) oscillates periodically as a function of the magnetic flux threading the loop. Recently, multiple experiments have observed half-quantum flux shifts in measurements of LP oscillations, where the oscillations are globally shifted by half a flux quantum compared to conventional cases, a behavior referred to as a $\pi$-ring. Such observations are commonly linked to unconventional pairing symmetries. In this work, we demonstrate that half-quantum flux shifts can arise in two-dimensional (2D) superconducting rings without invoking unconventional pairing symmetry, provided that vortices near the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition are taken into account. Specifically, based on the vortex-charge duality theory near the BKT transition, we map the problem onto a Coulomb gas model, in which the magnetic flux is represented as a pair of opposite boundary charges (or vortices) at the two edges. The screening of these boundary charges by thermally excited vortex-antivortex pairs is investigated through explicit Monte Carlo simulations. Importantly, we demonstrate that the oscillation of the free-vortex density as a function of magnetic flux can exhibit an anomalous half-quantum flux shift, depending on the geometry of the sample. Our work thus predicts the LP oscillations induced by vortices in 2D superconducting rings near the BKT transition, which provides a new mechanism for generating $\pi$-rings.

Title: Rotating Magnetocaloric Effect in Sintered La(Fe,Mn,Si)$_{13}$H$_z$ Plates
Authors: Rafael Almeida, Tomás Ventura, Ricardo Moura Costa Pinto, João Oliveira Silva, Konrad Loewe, Rodrigo Kiefe, João Sequeira Amaral, João Pedro Araújo, João Horta Belo
Abstract: La-Fe-Si-based alloys are among the most application-ready magnetocaloric materials for room-temperature magnetic refrigeration. Powder metallurgy methods have been previously demonstrated to successfully produce structures with sub-mm features for magnetic refrigerators in a scalable method. In this work, we explore the rotating magnetocaloric effect (RMCE) present in a 0.27 mm thin plate of sintered and hydrogenated La(Fe,Mn,Si)$_{13}$. The high aspect ratio ($\sim$50) of the thin plate leads to an anisotropic magnetocaloric effect (MCE), dependent on the relative orientation of the external magnetic field, and an RMCE when the external field is rotated. We find a maximum rotating adiabatic temperature change ($\Delta T_{ad}^{rot}$) of 1.17 K with the rotation of a 1 T magnetic field and 1.12 K when rotating a 0.6 T magnetic field, a reduction of only 4% for a 40% reduction in applied field strength. Magnetostatic computations revealed a considerable rotating isothermal entropy change ($\Delta S_{iso}^{rot}$), comparable to the conventional MCE of Gd for similar fields, reaching 3.97 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ for 1 T and 3.68 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ for 0.6 T (7% reduction), highlighting La-Fe-Mn-Si alloys as high potential candidates for a magnetic refrigerator based on the RMCE utilizing relatively low external magnetic field amplitudes, such as 0.6 T.

Title: Spatial self-organization driven by temporal noise
Authors: Satyam Anand, Guanming Zhang, Stefano Martiniani
Abstract: The counterintuitive emergence of order from noise is a central phenomenon in science, ranging from pattern formation and synchronization to order-by-disorder in frustrated systems. While large-scale spatial self-organization induced by local spatial noise is well studied, whether temporal noise can also drive such organization remains an open question. Here, by studying interacting particle systems, we show that temporally correlated noise can lead to a self-organized state with suppressed long-range density fluctuations, or hyperuniformity. Further, we develop a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that quantitatively explains the origin of this phenomenon. Finally, by casting the dynamics as a stochastic optimization problem, we show that temporal correlations lead to better solutions, akin to perturbed gradient descent in neural networks -- where noise is injected during training to escape poor minima. This reveals a striking correspondence between perturbed gradient descent dynamics on the energy landscapes of particle systems and the loss landscapes of neural networks. Our study establishes temporal correlations as a novel mechanism for noise-driven self-organization, with broad implications for self-assembling materials, biological systems, and optimization algorithms that leverage temporal noise for applications like differentially private learning.

Title: Andreev bound states in a superconducting qubit at odd parity
Authors: Manuel Houzet, Julia S. Meyer, Yuli V. Nazarov
Abstract: The quantum mechanics of the Josephson effect is the core ingredient for quantum technologies with superconducting circuits. A new avenue was recently opened in this field by predicting that the Josephson quantum mechanics in the odd parity sector, when a quasiparticle in trapped in an Andreev bound state, is fundamentally different from the conventional one in the even sector. The focus was then on a Josephson junction surrounded by an electromagnetic environment formed of a collection of bosonic modes, including the case of an ohmic environment. Here we consider the distinct case of a superconducting qubit made of a single Josephson junction whose environment reduces to a capacitance. We find a novel structure for the low-lying discrete states in the odd sector, which is altogether different from the one that appears in the even sector. Our study of the bound-state spectrum ranges from the Coulomb-dominated (Cooper pair box) to the Josephson-dominated (transmon) regime. Our prediction could be tested in forthcoming experiments with superconductor/semiconductor/superconductor junctions, which have been studied intensively in recent years, both using nanowires as well as two-dimensional electron gases.

Title: Loop-gap resonators achieving strong magnon-photon coupling in magnetic insulator thin films
Authors: Francesca Zanichelli, Davit Petrosyan, Hanchen Wang, Patrick Helbingk, Richard Schlitz, Pietro Gambardella, William Legrand
Abstract: Magnon-photon hybrid systems consisting of a three-dimensional electromagnetic resonator and a bulk magnetic insulator constitute the standard experimental platform in cavity magnonics. Here, we demonstrate a modular loop-gap resonator design optimized to couple with thin films of magnetic insulators. We achieve the strong-coupling regime using this loop-gap resonator coupled to a 75~nm-thick epitaxial film of yttrium iron garnet at room temperature. We further show how to perform field-differential spectroscopy of the hybrid magnon-photon system, which eliminates the unwanted signal from other loop-gap modes uncoupled to the magnetic film. In addition to the uniform ferromagnetic resonance mode, the loop-gap resonator enables an hybridization with the standing spin-wave modes forming across the thickness of the film. Our approach unlocks the use of epitaxial films and multilayers of magnetic insulators to tune the magnon band structure in cavity magnonics experiments.

Title: Magnetic field control of the excitonic transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$
Authors: Giacomo Mazza
Abstract: The formation of excitonic insulator phases in quantum materials is often masked by structural distortions caused by the coupling between electronic and phononic order parameters. Here we show that the candidate material Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is characterized by a metastable excitonic insulating phase that is decoupled from the lattice, and that can be stabilized for sufficiently high applied magnetic fields. By considering the interplay between the excitonic and structural instabilities, we predict a magnetic field induced transition from the low-temperature structurally distorted semiconducting phase to an undistorted excitonic insulator phase with ground state loop currents. Before the transition, the existence of a latent excitonic phase can be detected by the magnetic field softening of the phonon mode associated with the structural distortion. These results highlight an unbiased route towards the disentanglement of the coupled excitonic-structural transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, and uncover a general mechanism for magnetic field control of competing phases in quantum materials.

Authors: Simone Finizio, Tim A. Butcher, Maria Cocconcelli, Elisabeth Müller, Lauren J. Riddiford, Jeffrey A. Brock, Chia-Chun Wei, Li-Shu Wang, Jan-Chi Yang, Shih-Wen Huang, Federico Maspero, Riccardo Bertacco, Jörg Raabe
Abstract: Mechanical strain can be used to control physical properties in materials. The experimental investigation of strain-induced effects at the nanoscale is of importance not only for its fundamental aspect, but also for the development of device applications. Transmission X-ray microscopy is a particularly well-suited technique for the nanoscale imaging of magnetic materials, but its compatibility with in-situ mechanical straining of samples is limited. In this work, we present a setup for applying tailored in-situ mechanical strains to freestanding thin films by means of a micro electromechanical system (MEMS) actuator. We then present a proof-of-concept experiment where a freestanding 80 nm thick (001) BiFeO$_3$ multiferroic thin film is strained with the MEMS device, allowing us to control the coupled ferroelectric/spin cycloidal configuration.

Title: SpinWaveToolkit: Python package for (semi-)analytical calculations in the field of spin-wave physics
Authors: Jan Klíma, Ondřej Wojewoda, Jakub Krčma, Martin Hrtoň, Dominik Pavelka, Jakub Holobrádek, Michal Urbánek
Abstract: We present an open-source Python package, SpinWaveToolkit (SWT), for (semi-)analytical modeling of spin-wave dynamics in thin ferromagnetic films and exchange-coupled magnetic bilayers. SWT combines analytical models based on the Kalinikos-Slavin theory with a semi-analytical dynamic-matrix approach, enabling the calculation of dispersion relations, group velocities, decay lengths, mode profiles, and static equilibrium magnetization states. In addition, SWT implements a quantitative model of micro-focused Brillouin light scattering (BLS) that incorporates vectorial optical focusing, spin-wave Bloch functions, magneto-optical coupling, and Green-function propagation to simulate experimentally measured BLS spectra. The package is validated against finite-element dynamic-matrix simulations performed with TetraX for Damon-Eshbach, backward-volume, forward-volume, and oblique-field geometries, showing excellent agreement while reducing computation times by nearly two orders of magnitude in comparison to the numerical simulations. Thanks to the easiness of the use and fast calculation times, SWT can be used not only for exploratory mapping of the parameter space, but also for the fitting of the measured dispersion relations and related parameters. Thus, it provides a versatile and efficient framework for experiment design, interpretation, and parameter optimization for magnonics research.

Title: Entanglement Hamiltonians in dissipative free fermions and the time-dependent GGE
Authors: Riccardo Travaglino, Federico Rottoli, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of Entanglement Hamiltonians (EHs) in dissipative free-fermionic systems using a recent operator-based formulation of the quasiparticle picture. Focusing on gain and loss dissipation, we study the post-quench evolution and derive explicit expressions for the EH at the ballistic scale. In the long-time and weak-dissipation regime, the EH is shown to take the form of a time-dependent Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (t-GGE), with a structure that is universal across different initial states of the quench protocol. Within this framework, the emergence of the t-GGE is fully accounted for by the quasiparticle picture, and we argue that this description remains valid whenever the Lindbladian admits an appropriate coarse-grained representation.

Title: When low-loss paths make a binary neuron trainable: detecting algorithmic transitions with the connected ensemble
Authors: Damien Barbier
Abstract: We study the connected ensemble, a statistical-mechanics framework that characterizes the formation of low-loss paths in rugged landscapes. First introduced in a previous paper, this ensemble allows one to identify when a network can be trained on a simple task and which minima should be targeted during training. We apply this new framework to the symmetric binary perceptron model (SBP), and study how its typical {connected} minima behave. We show that {connected} minima exist only above a critical threshold $\kappa_{\rm connected}$, or equivalently below a critical constraint density $\alpha_{\rm connected}$. This defines a parameter range in which training the network is easy, as local algorithms can efficiently access this connected manifold. We also highlight that these minima become increasingly robust and closer to one another as the task on which the network is trained becomes more difficult.

Title: Weight-four parity checks with silicon spin qubits

Abstract: Recent advances in coherent spin shuttling have made sparse semiconductor spin qubit arrays an appealing solid-state platform to realize quantum processors. The dynamic and long-range connectivity enabled by shuttling is also essential for many quantum error-correction (QEC) schemes. Here, we demonstrate a silicon spin-qubit device that comprises a shuttling bus for coherently transporting qubits that can interact at four isolated locations we call bus stops. We dynamically populate the array and tune all single- and two-qubit operations using shuttling and quantum non-demolition (QND) spin measurements, without access to charge sensing in most of the device. We achieve universal control of the effective five-qubit processor and select the connectivity required to form a surface-code stabilizer plaquette that supports X- and Z-type parity checks up to weight-four. We use the parity checks to generate multi-qubit entanglement between all qubit combinations in the array and report the genuine entanglement of a five-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, constituting the largest such state ever constructed with gate-defined semiconductor spins. This work opens immediate opportunities to pursue QEC experiments with spin qubits, and the protocols developed here lay the groundwork for the modular calibration and operation of sparse spin qubit arrays.

Title: Analytical topological invariants for 2D non-Hermitian phases using Morse theory
Authors: Cameron Gibson, Evelyn Tang
Abstract: As energy dissipation and gain are ubiquitous in the real world, such phenomena demand the generalization of Hermitian methods such as the analysis of topological properties for non-Hermitian systems. However, as non-Hermitian systems typically contain more degrees of freedom, this poses a challenge for analytical approaches to understand their topology and invariants. In this work, we analytically calculate the 2D Zak phase for a 2D non-Hermitian SSH-type Hamiltonian that supports a rich structure and edge currents. Closed-form expressions for eigenstates and divisions of the phase diagram are obtained, including for regions in the phase diagram where different types of exceptional points exist. We use Morse theory to determine the topology of exceptional points in momentum space. Although the band structure breaks down at exceptional points, we show that a specific phase-based topological invariant remains well-defined. Furthermore, our work yields an analytic derivation for counting edge states in the Hermitian limit. These results provide new conceptual and analytical tools for the study of complex topological systems.

Title: Dynamical density functional theory for dense odd-diffusive fluids
Authors: Iman Abdoli, René Wittmann, Hartmut Löwen
Abstract: Odd diffusion breaks time-reversal symmetry in overdamped systems through transverse probability currents while preserving equilibrium steady states. In this work, we develop a dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) for dense interacting odd-diffusive fluids and apply it to ultrasoft particles in two dimensions. In bulk, odd diffusion qualitatively reshapes collective relaxation by generating transient circulating current patterns which do not exist in normal fluids. Under harmonic ring confinement, the circulation of probability current induces an angular redistribution of density along the ring during relaxation. This unique footprint of odd diffusion opens up a shorter pathway to equilibrium. Repulsive interactions significantly enhance these effects. Excellent agreement with Brownian dynamics simulations confirms that our odd-DDFT framework quantitatively captures all essential nonequilibrium aspects of the nontrivial odd transport and collective redistribution for dense fluids in both bulk and confined geometries.

Title: Resilient-to-Fragile Transition and Excess Volatility in Supply Chain Networks
Authors: David Martin, José Moran, Debabrata Panja, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud
Abstract: We study the disequilibrium dynamics of a stylised model of production networks in which firms use perishable and non-substitutable intermediate inputs, so that adverse idiosyncratic productivity shocks can trigger downstream shortages and output losses. To protect against such disruptions, firms hold precautionary inventories that act as buffer stocks. We show that, for a given dispersion of firm-level productivity shocks, there exists a critical level of inventories above which the economy remains in a stable stochastic steady state. Below this critical level, the system becomes fragile, i.e., it becomes prone to system-wide crises. As this resilience-fragility boundary is approached from above, aggregate output volatility rises sharply and diverges, even though shocks are purely idiosyncratic. Because inventories are costly, competitive pressures induce firms to economize on buffers. Although we do not explicitly model such costs, we argue that the resulting behaviour of individual firms drives the system close to criticality, generating persistent excess macroeconomic volatility -- in other words, ``small shocks, large cycles'' -- in line with other settings where efficiency and resilience are in tension with each other. In the language of phase transitions, the resilient-to-fragile transition is continuous (supercritical): the economy exhibits a well-defined stochastic equilibrium with finite volatility on one side of the boundary, while beyond it the probability of a collapse in finite time tends to one. We characterize this transition primarily through numerical simulations and derive an analytical description in a high-perishability, high-connectivity limit.

Title: A combined criterion of surface free energy and roughness to predict the wettability of non-ideal low-energy surfaces
Authors: Majid Shaker, Erfan Salahinejad
Abstract: The significance of wettability between solid and liquid substances in different fields encourages scientists to develop accurate models to estimate the resultant apparent contact angles. Surface free energy (SFE), which is principally defined for ideal (flat) surfaces, is not applicable to predict the wettability of real (rough) surfaces. This paper introduces a new parameter, namely normalized surface free energy (NSFE) as a combination of SFE and roughness, to predict the contact angle of liquids on non-ideal low-energy surfaces. The remarkable consistency of the predicted and measured contact angles of liquids on some rough surfaces also confirm the validity of the approach.

Title: Universal rapid machine learning models for predicting unconvoluted and convoluted X-ray Absorption Spectra
Authors: Fei Zhan, Zhi Geng, Lirong Zheng, Haifeng Zhao
Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) is an essential tool for elucidating the atomic-scale, local three-dimensional (3D) structure of given materials and molecules. The rapid computation of XANES based on molecular 3D structures constitutes a vital element of quantitative XANES analysis. Here, we present an XANES prediction model. It takes 3D structures as input and generates either unconvoluted XANES or convoluted spectra as output, demonstrating excellent generalizability across diverse instrumental broadening. This model has validated its predictive capability for both hard X-ray XAS (exemplified by K-edges of 3d 4d metals and lanthanides) and soft X-ray XAS (using S K-edge as examples). Adopting the model, XANES spectra of multiple elements can be predicted using a single unified model. A highly efficient 3D structure fitting algorithm based on this unconvoluted XANES prediction model, aiming to serve as an online data analysis method suitable for XAS beamlines.

Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.

Title: Probing Entanglement and Symmetries in Random States Using a Superconducting Quantum Processor
Authors: Jia-Nan Yang, Lata Kh Joshi, Filiberto Ares, Yihang Han, Pengfei Zhang, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems display an extraordinary degree of complexity, yet many of their features are universal: they depend not on microscopic details, but on a few fundamental physical aspects such as symmetries. A central challenge is to distill these universal characteristics from model-specific ones. Random quantum states sampled from a uniform distribution, the Haar measure, provide a powerful framework for capturing this typicality. Here, we experimentally study the entanglement and symmetries of random many-body quantum states generated by evolving simple product states under ergodic Floquet models. We find excellent agreement with the predictions from the Haar-random state ensemble. First, we measure the Rényi-2 entanglement entropy as a function of the subsystem size, observing the Page curve. Second, we probe the subsystem symmetries using entanglement asymmetry. Finally, we measure the moments of partially transposed reduced density matrices obtained by tracing out part of the system in the generated ensembles, thereby revealing distinct entanglement phases. Our results offer an experimental perspective on the typical entanglement and symmetries of many-body quantum systems.

Title: The Photonic Foundation of Temperature: Mechanisms of Thermal Equilibrium and Entropy Production
Authors: David Vaknin
Abstract: I examine the physical foundations of temperature and thermal equilibrium by identifying photons as the fundamental agents that establish and maintain the characteristic energy scale $E_c = k_B T$ in ordinary matter. While classical thermodynamics successfully describes equilibrium phenomenologically, the realization of thermal distributions requires concrete microscopic mechanisms provided by quantum electrodynamics. We derive the Boltzmann distribution from a minimal differential scaling postulate and show that sustaining thermal equilibrium demands continuous photon exchange with average energy $\langle h\nu \rangle = 2.701\,E_c$, quantifying the energetic throughput necessary to counter radiative losses. Entropy production is shown to arise naturally from inelastic photon scattering that converts high-energy photons into many lower-energy quanta, thereby increasing accessible microstates and driving irreversible evolution toward equilibrium. We establish physical criteria distinguishing genuine thermal equilibrium from purely formal temperature assignments and demonstrate that the classical notion of an infinite thermal reservoir emerges as an effective idealization within a hierarchy of dynamically maintained photon baths. This photonic framework complements phenomenological thermodynamics by providing its microscopic foundation and clarifies the physical meaning of temperature as an emergent collective property of photon-mediated energy exchange.

Title: Online unsupervised Hebbian learning in deep photonic neuromorphic networks
Authors: Xi Li, Disha Biswas, Peng Zhou, Wesley H. Brigner, Anna Capuano, Joseph S. Friedman, Qing Gu
Abstract: While software implementations of neural networks have driven significant advances in computation, the von Neumann architecture imposes fundamental limitations on speed and energy efficiency. Neuromorphic networks, with structures inspired by the brain's architecture, offer a compelling solution with the potential to approach the extreme energy efficiency of neurobiological systems. Photonic neuromorphic networks (PNNs) are particularly attractive because they leverage the inherent advantages of light, namely high parallelism, low latency, and exceptional energy efficiency. Previous PNN demonstrations have largely focused on device-level functionalities or system-level implementations reliant on supervised learning and inefficient optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions. Here, we introduce a purely photonic deep PNN architecture that enables online, unsupervised learning. We propose a local feedback mechanism operating entirely in the optical domain that implements a Hebbian learning rule using non-volatile phase-change material synapses. We experimentally demonstrate this approach on a non-trivial letter recognition task using a commercially available fiber-optic platform and achieve a 100 percent recognition rate, showcasing an all-optical solution for efficient, real-time information processing. This work unlocks the potential of photonic computing for complex artificial intelligence applications by enabling direct, high-throughput processing of optical information without intermediate OEO signal conversions.

Title: SCALAR: Quantifying Structural Hallucination, Consistency, and Reasoning Gaps in Materials Foundation Models
Authors: Can Polat, Erchin Serpedin, Mustafa Kurban, Hasan Kurban
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to materials science reasoning, yet their behavior under physically structured distribution shifts remains poorly understood. We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone. Supplementary materials are available at this https URL.

Title: Quantum bootstrap product codes
Authors: Meng-Yuan Li
Abstract: Product constructions constitute a powerful method for generating quantum CSS codes, yielding celebrated examples such as toric codes and asymptotically good low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. Since a CSS code is fully described by a chain complex, existing product formalisms are predominantly homological, defined via the tensor product of the underlying chain complexes of input codes, thereby establishing a natural connection between quantum codes and topology. In this Letter, we introduce the \textit{quantum bootstrap product} (QBP), an approach that extends beyond this standard homological paradigm. Specifically, a QBP code is determined by solving a consistency condition termed the ``bootstrap equation''. We find that the QBP paradigm unifies a wide range of important codes, including general hypergraph product (HGP) codes of arbitrary dimensions and fracton codes typically represented by the X-cube code. Crucially, the solutions to the bootstrap equation yield chain complexes where the chain groups and associated boundary maps consist of multiple components. We term such structures \textit{fork complexes}. This structure elucidates the underlying topological structures of fracton codes, akin to foliated fracton order theories. Beyond conceptual insights, we demonstrate that the QBP paradigm can generate self-correcting quantum codes from input codes with constant energy barriers and surpass the code-rate upper bounds inherent to HGP codes. Our work thus substantially extends the scope of quantum product codes and provides a versatile framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum memories.

Title: Convergent Discovery of Critical Phenomena Mathematics Across Disciplines: A Cross-Domain Analysis
Authors: Bruce Stephenson, Robin Macomber
Abstract: Techniques for detecting critical phenomena -- phase transitions where correlation length diverges and small perturbations have large effects -- have been developed across at least eight fields of application over nine decades. We document this convergence pattern. The physicist's correlation length $\xi$, the cardiologist's DFA scaling exponent $\alpha$, the financial analyst's Hurst exponent $H$, and the machine learning engineer's spectral radius $\chi$ all measure correlation decay rate, detecting the same critical signatures under different notation. Citation analysis reveals minimal cross-domain awareness during the formative period (1987--2010): researchers in biomedicine, finance, machine learning, power systems, and traffic flow developed equivalent techniques independently, each with distinct notation and terminology. We present Metatron Dynamics, a framework derived from distributed systems engineering, as a candidate ninth independent discovery -- strengthening the convergence pattern while acknowledging that as authors of both the framework and this analysis, external validation would strengthen this claim. Correspondence testing on the 2D Ising model confirms that measures from multiple frameworks correctly identify the critical regime at $T_c = 2.269$. We argue that repeated independent discovery establishes criticality mathematics as fundamental public knowledge, with implications for cross-disciplinary education and research accessibility. Because these findings affect fields beyond mathematics and physics, we include a plain-language summary in Appendix B for non-specialist readers.

Title: Strong Coupling Between RF Photons and Plasmons of Electrons on Liquid Helium
Authors: Asher Jennings, Ivan Grytsenko, Thomas Giovansili, Itay Josef Barabash, Oleksiy Rybalko, Yiran Tian, Jun Wang, Hiroki Ikegami, Erika Kawakami
Abstract: Plasmons, arising from the collective motion of electrons, can interact strongly with electromagnetic fields or photons; this capability has been exploited across a broad range of applications, from chemical reactivity to biosensing. Recently, there has been growing interest in plasmons for applications in quantum information processing. Electrons floating on liquid helium provide an exceptionally clean, disorder-free system and have emerged as a promising platform for this purpose. In this work, we establish this system as a tunable plasmon-photon hybrid platform. We demonstrate strong coupling between floating-electron plasmons and radio-frequency (RF) photons confined in an LC resonator. Time-resolved measurements reveal coherent oscillatory energy exchange between the plasmonic and photonic modes, providing direct evidence of their coherent coupling. These results represent a step towards cavity quantum electrodynamics with a floating-electron plasmon coupled to a resonator. Furthermore, the LC resonator serves as a sensitive probe of electron-on-helium physics, enabling the observation of the Wigner crystal transition and a quantitative study of the temperature-dependent plasmon decay arising from ripplon-induced scattering.

Title: Combining quasi-static and high frequency experiments for the viscoelastic characterization of brain tissue
Authors: Laura Ruhland, Nina Reiter, Silvia Budday, Kai Willner
Abstract: Mechanical models of brain tissue are a beneficial tool to simulate neurosurgical interventions, disease progression, or brain development. However, the accuracy and predictive capacity of such a model relies on a precise experimental characterization of the tissue's mechanical behavior. Such a characterization is yet limited by inconsistent or contradictory experimental responses reported in the literature, particularly when measurements are performed in different time or length scales. Although brain tissue has been extensively investigated in previous studies, the combination of experimental findings from different scales has received limited attention. In this study, we combine ex vivo mechanical responses of porcine brain tissue obtained at different time scales in a mechanical model. We investigated the mechanical behavior of three different brain regions in the quasi-static domain with multi-modal large strain rheometer measurements and at high frequencies with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). A comparative analysis of the mechanical parameters obtained from both experimental techniques demonstrated consistent regional variations in the viscoelastic behavior across the two domains. However, the mechanical behavior changes from a higher elasticity in the quasi-static and low frequency domain to a dominating viscosity at high frequencies. Based on the quasi-static and the high frequency behavior, we calibrated a fractional Kelvin-Voigt model and consequently unified the two responses in a single mechanical model to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the tissue's mechanical behavior.

Title: A Framework for the Bayesian Calibration of Complex and Data-Scarce Models in Applied Sciences
Authors: Christina Schenk, Ignacio Romero
Abstract: In this work, we review the theory involved in the Bayesian calibration of complex computer models, with particular emphasis on their use for applications involving computationally expensive simulations and scarce experimental data. In the article, we present a unified framework that incorporates various Bayesian calibration methods, including well-established approaches. Furthermore, we describe their implementation and use with a new, open-source Python library, ACBICI (A Configurable BayesIan Calibration and Inference Package). All algorithms are implemented with an object-oriented structure designed to be both easy to use and readily extensible. In particular, single-output and multiple-output calibration are addressed in a consistent manner. The article completes the theory and its implementation with practical recommendations for calibrating the problems of interest. These guidelines -- currently unavailable in a unified form elsewhere -- together with the open-source Python library, are intended to support the reliable calibration of computational codes and models commonly used in engineering and related fields. Overall, this work aims to serve both as a comprehensive review of the statistical foundations and (computational) tools required to perform such calculations, and as a practical guide to Bayesian calibration with modern software tools.

Title: How adaptation to food resources and death rates shape oscillatory dynamics in a microbial population
Authors: Benedetta Ciarmoli, Sophie Marbach
Abstract: Microbes constantly interact with their environment by depleting and transforming food sources. Theoretical studies have mainly focused on Lotka-Volterra models, which do not account for food source dynamics. In contrast, consumer-resource models, which consider food source dynamics, are less explored. In particular, it is still unclear what physical mechanisms control oscillatory dynamics at a single population level, a phenomenon which can only be captured by a consumer-resource model. Here, we present a minimalistic consumer-resource model of a single microbial population with growth and death dynamics, consuming a continuously replenishing substrate. Our model reveals that decaying oscillations can occur around steady state if and only if the timescale of microbial adaptation to food supply changes exceeds the death timescale. This interplay of timescales allows us to rationalize the emergence of oscillatory dynamics when adding various biophysical ingredients to the model. We find that microbial necromass recycling or complementary use of multiple food sources reduces the parameter range for oscillations and increases the decay rate of oscillations. Requiring multiple simultaneous food sources has the opposite effect. Essentially, facilitating growth reduces the likelihood of oscillations around a fixed point. We further demonstrate that such damped oscillatory behavior is correlated with persistent oscillatory behavior in a noisy environment. We hope our work will motivate further investigations of consumer-resource models to improve descriptions of environments where food source distributions vary in space and time.

Title: Compact U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory in Superconducting Circuits with Infinite-Dimensional Local Hilbert Spaces
Authors: J. M. Alcaine-Cuervo, S. Pradhan, E. Rico, Z. Shi, C. M. Wilson
Abstract: We propose a superconducting-circuit architecture that realizes a compact U(1) lattice gauge theory using the intrinsic infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of phase and charge variables. The gauge and matter fields are encoded directly in the degrees of freedom of the rotor variables associated with the circuit nodes, and Gauss's law emerges exactly from the conservation of local charge, without auxiliary stabilizers, penalty terms, or Hilbert-space truncation. A minimal gauge-matter coupling arises microscopically from Josephson nonlinearities, whereas the magnetic plaquette interaction is generated perturbatively via virtual matter excitations. Numerical diagonalization confirms the emergence of compact electrodynamics and coherent vortex excitations, underscoring the need for large local Hilbert spaces in the continuum regime. The required circuit parameters are within the current experimental capabilities. Our results establish superconducting circuits as a scalable, continuous-variable platform for analog quantum simulation of non-perturbative gauge dynamics.

Title: Inhibiting Conduction by He Mixing in Interiors of Jupiter and Saturn
Authors: Valentin V. Karasiev, S. X. Hu, Joshua P. Hinz, R. M. N. Goshadze, Shuai Zhang, Armin Bergermann, Ronald Redmer
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the electrical and thermal conductivities and structural properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures under thermodynamic conditions within and beyond the immiscibility range is very important to predict the thermal evolution and internal structure of gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn. Here, we propose a novel method to determine the immiscibility boundary accurately without the need for free energy calculations, while providing consistent insights into structural and transport properties of mixtures. We show with direct large-scale ab initio simulations that the insulator-metal transition (IMT) of the hydrogen subsystem is strongly affected by an admixture with a small fraction of helium and occurs at temperatures significantly higher than those of pure hydrogen. At pressures below 150 GPa, the IMT boundary is not related anymore to the H2 subsystem dissociation, the system remains insulating even after the full dissociation of H2 molecules and its transition to an H-He mixture. The offset of the IMT in the H-He mixture relative to the dissociation region in the hydrogen subsystem and the significant reduction of static electrical and thermal conductivity by a factor between two and a few thousand relative to pure hydrogen found in mixtures have consequences for Jupiter and Saturn's thermal evolution, internal structure, and dynamo action, affecting a large fraction of the interior of both planets.

Title: Entanglement dynamics from universal low-lying modes
Authors: Shreya Vardhan, Sanjay Moudgalya
Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities such as Renyi entropies show a remarkable universality in their late-time behaviour across a variety of chaotic many-body systems. Understanding how such common features emerge from very different microscopic dynamics remains an important challenge. In this work, we address this question in a class of Brownian models with random time-dependent Hamiltonians and a variety of different microscopic couplings. In any such model, the Lorentzian time-evolution of the $n$-th Renyi entropy can be mapped to evolution by a Euclidean Hamiltonian on 2$n$ copies of the system. We provide evidence that in systems with no symmetries, the low-energy excitations of the Euclidean Hamiltonian are universally given by a gapped quasiparticle-like band. The eigenstates in this band are plane waves of locally dressed domain walls between ferromagnetic ground states associated with two permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. These excitations give rise to the membrane picture of entanglement growth, with the membrane tension determined by their dispersion relation. We establish this structure in a variety of cases using analytical perturbative methods and numerical variational techniques, and extract the associated dispersion relations and membrane tensions for the second and third Renyi entropies. For the third Renyi entropy, we argue that phase transitions in the membrane tension as a function of velocity are needed to ensure that physical constraints on the membrane tension are satisfied. Overall, this structure provides an understanding of entanglement dynamics in terms of a universal set of gapped low-lying modes, which may also apply to systems with time-independent Hamiltonians.

Title: Clever algorithms for glasses work by time reparametrization
Authors: Federico Ghimenti, Ludovic Berthier, Jorge Kurchan, Frédéric van Wijland
Abstract: The ultraslow dynamics of glass-formers has been explained by two views considered as mutually exclusive: one invokes locally hindered mobility, the other rests on the complexity of the configuration space. Here we demonstrate that the evolution responds strongly to the details of the dynamics by changing the speed of time-flow: it has time-reparametrization softness. This finding reconciles both views: while local constraints reparametrize the flow of time, the global landscape determines relationships between different correlations at the same times. We show that modern algorithms developed to accelerate the relaxation to equilibrium act by changing the time reparametrization. Their success thus relies on their ability to exploit reparametrization softness. We conjecture that these results extend beyond the realm of glasses to the optimization of more general constraint satisfaction problems and to broader classes of algorithms.

Title: The effect of priors on Learning with Restricted Boltzmann Machines
Authors: Gianluca Manzan, Daniele Tantari
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are generative models designed to learn from data with a rich underlying structure. In this work, we explore a teacher-student setting where a student RBM learns from examples generated by a teacher RBM, with a focus on the effect of the unit priors on learning efficiency. We consider a parametric class of priors that interpolate between continuous (Gaussian) and binary variables. This approach models various possible choices of visible units, hidden units, and weights for both the teacher and student RBMs. By analyzing the phase diagram of the posterior distribution in both the Bayes optimal and mismatched regimes, we demonstrate the existence of a triple point that defines the critical dataset size necessary for learning through generalization. The critical size is strongly influenced by the properties of the teacher, and thus the data, but is unaffected by the properties of the student RBM. Nevertheless, a prudent choice of student priors can facilitate training by expanding the so-called signal retrieval region, where the machine generalizes effectively.

Title: Measurement-Induced Crossover of Quantum Jump Statistics in Postselection-Free Many-Body Dynamics
Authors: Kazuki Yamamoto, Ryusuke Hamazaki
Abstract: We reveal a nontrivial crossover of subsystem fluctuations of quantum jumps in continuously monitored many-body systems, which have a trivial maximally mixed state as a steady-state density matrix. While the fluctuations exhibit the standard volume law $\propto L$ following Poissonian statistics for sufficiently weak measurement strength, anomalous yet universal scaling law $\propto L^\alpha \:(\alpha\sim 2.7$ up to $L=20)$ indicating super-Poissonian statistics appears for strong measurement strength. This drastically affects the precision of estimating the rate of quantum jumps: for strong (weak) measurement, the estimation uncertainty is enhanced (suppressed) as the system size increases. We demonstrate that the anomalous scaling of the subsystem fluctuation originates from an integrated many-body autocorrelation function and that the transient dynamics contributes to the scaling law rather than the Liouvillian gap. The measurement-induced crossover is accessed only from the postselection-free information obtained from the time and the position of quantum jumps and can be tested in ultracold atom experiments.

Title: Ferroelectrically Switchable Chirality in Topological Superconductivity
Authors: Kai-Zhi Bai, Bo Fu, Shun-Qing Shen
Abstract: The interplay between ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity provides a rich platform for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we develop an effective theory and propose a heterostructure composed of an antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ coupled with the s-wave superconductor Fe(Se,Te), enabling the realization of chiral topological superconductivity (CTSC) with switchable chirality. The chirality of the CTSC is controlled by the direction of spontaneous polarization, which arises from interlayer sliding-induced ferroelectricity or charge transfer in the bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$. This sliding mechanism breaks the $\mathcal{M}_{z}\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetries, leading to the anomalous Hall effect in the spin polarized metallic Dirac band and drives the emergence of CTSC when the s-wave superconductivity appears. Our work not only provides a new pathway to achieve and control topological superconductivity but also opens avenues for experimental exploration of Majorana physics and topological quantum computation.

Title: Singular flat bands in three dimensions: Landau level spreading, quantum geometry, and Weyl reconstruction
Authors: Takuto Kawakami, Yuji Igarashi, Mikito Koshino
Abstract: We theoretically investigate three-dimensional singular flat band systems, focusing on their quantum geometric properties and response to external magnetic fields. As a representative example, we study the pyrochlore lattice, which hosts a pair of degenerate flat bands touching a dispersive band. We derive a three-orbital effective continuum model that captures the essential features near the band-touching point. Within this framework, we identify the point-like topological singularity on a planar manifold defined by the degenerate flat band eigenvectors. This singularity strongly influences the quantum geometry and results in a characteristic Landau level structure, where the levels spread over a finite energy range. We show that this structure reflects the underlying band reconstruction due to the orbital Zeeman effect, which lifts the flat band degeneracy and induces the Weyl-semimetal-like dispersion near the singularity. Our analysis reveals that the range of Landau level spreading is proportional to the quantum metric of each Zeeman-split band. We further demonstrate that adding a small dispersion via longer-range . Finally, we show that our approach extends naturally to systems with higher orbital angular momentum, indicating the robustness of these features in a broad class of three-dimensional flat band models.

Title: Learning to flock in open space by avoiding collisions and staying together
Authors: Martino Brambati, Antonio Celani, Marco Gherardi, Francesco Ginelli
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of cohesive flocking in open, boundless space using a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. Agents integrate positional and orientational information from their closest topological neighbours and learn to balance alignment and attractive interactions by optimizing a local cost function that penalizes both excessive separation and close-range crowding. The resulting Vicsek-like dynamics is robust to algorithmic implementation details and yields cohesive collective motion with high polar order. The optimal policy is dominated by strong aligning interactions when agents are sufficiently close to their neighbours, and a flexible combination of alignment and attraction at larger separations. We further characterize the internal structure and dynamics of the resulting groups using liquid-state metrics and neighbour exchange rates, finding qualitative agreement with empirical observations in starling flocks. These results suggest that flocking may emerge in groups of moving agents as an adaptive response to the biological imperatives of staying together while avoiding collisions.

Title: Spin Current Generation Controlled by the Néel State in a Compensated Ferrimagnet
Authors: Xin Theng Lee, Takahiro Misawa, Mamoru Matsuo, Takeo Kato
Abstract: Compensated ferrimagnets, which break sublattice and time-reversal symmetries in the ground state, exhibit an isotropic ferromagnet-like spin splitting despite a vanishing net magnetization, in contrast to altermagnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting. We investigate how isotropic spin splitting manifests in spin transport by analyzing the spin Seebeck effect and spin pumping in a junction between a compensated ferrimagnet and a normal metal. We show that compensated ferrimagnets generate a sizable spin Seebeck signal, with a sign that can be reversed by switching between the two Néel states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that spin pumping exhibits a Néel-state-dependent resonance splitting, which is absent in conventional antiferromagnets. These results identify spin pumping as a natural readout mechanism for compensated ferrimagnets and establish them as promising magnetization-free building blocks for spintronic memory devices.

Title: Alignment behavior of 2D diopsides (d-silicates) under the influence of an AC electric field
Authors: Himakshi Mishra, Bruno Ipaves, Raphael Benjamim de Oliveira, Marcelo Lopes Pereira Junior, Raphael Matozo Tromer, Douglas Soares Galvao, Chandra Shekar Tiwary
Abstract: Controlling the alignment of two dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for optimizing their electronic and mechanical properties in next generation devices. This study explores how electric fields can manipulate the orientation of 2D diopside (CaMgSi2O6) flakes, a flexible silicate material, through a phenomenon called flexoelectricity, where applied voltage generates mechanical strain. We exfoliated diopside crystals into ultrathin flakes, placed them on microelectrodes, and used AC electric fields to induce alignment via acoustic strain. Raman spectroscopy showed that the flakes reoriented/realigned under the field, with vibrational peaks weakening most at high frequencies (10 MHz). Electrical tests revealed this alignment improves conductivity by 20-30%, as straightened flakes create better pathways for current flow. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations further explained how these flakes naturally align on surfaces within picoseconds, matching our experimental observations. Together, these findings demonstrate a practical way to tune diopside properties using electric fields, opening doors for its use in flexible electronics, sensors, and energy devices.

Title: Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps
Authors: Molly Brennan, Edwina F. Yeo, Philip Pearce, Mohit P. Dalwadi
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.

Title: Dirac quantum criticality in twisted double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Jan Biedermann, Lukas Janssen
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of moiré double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides with ABBA stacking as a function of twist angle and applied pressure. At hole filling $\nu = 2$ per moiré unit cell, the noninteracting system hosts a Dirac semimetal with graphene-like low-energy bands in the moiré Brillouin zone. At small twist angles, the Fermi velocity is reduced and interactions dominate the low-temperature behavior. A strong-coupling analysis identifies insulating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground-state candidates, characterized by spin-density modulations set by the moiré scale. Using a realistic continuum model with long-range Coulomb interactions, we perform self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations to study the competition between these states. Varying the twist angle or pressure drives a transition from a Dirac semimetal to an antiferromagnetic insulator, which breaks SU(2) spin rotation and two-fold lattice rotation symmetries. Within a renormalization group analysis of the most general symmetry-allowed low-energy field theory, we show that this semimetal-to-insulator transition is continuous and belongs to the (2+1)D relativistic Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class with $N = 2$ four-component Dirac fermions. Finite heterostrain, relevant in realistic samples, induces a crossover from Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality at intermediate temperatures to conventional (2+1)D Heisenberg criticality at the lowest temperatures. Further decreasing the twist angle can cause a level crossing from the antiferromagnetic insulator into a ferromagnetic insulator with spin-split bands. Our results provide a comprehensive theoretical framework that complements and elucidates recent experiments in twisted double bilayer WSe$_2$.

Title: The Three-Body Limit Cycle: Universal Form for General Regulators
Authors: Langxuan Chen, Feng Wu, Xincheng Lin, Sebastian König, Ubirajara van Kolck, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: The Efimov effect, a remarkable realization of discrete scale invariance, emerges in the three-body problem with short-range interactions and is understood as a renormalization group (RG) limit cycle within Short-Range Effective Field Theory (SREFT). While the analytic form of the three-body renormalization relation has been established for a sharp cutoff regulator, its universality for other regulators remains underexplored. In this work, we derive the universal functional form of the three-body renormalization relation for general separable regulators through a detailed analysis of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian and Faddeev equations. We find that the relation follows from a real Möbius transformation characterized by three parameters. This universality is verified numerically for various regulators. Although the functional form remains the same, the parameters characterizing the limit cycle exhibit regulator dependence. These findings broaden the class of RG limit cycles in SREFT and offer a more complete understanding of three-body renormalization.

Title: Magnetic Field Dependence of the Spin Fluctuations in CeCu$_{5.8}$Ag$_{0.2}$
Authors: X. Boraley, A. D. Christianson, J. Lass, C. Balz, M. Bartkowiak, Ch. Niedermayer, J. M. Lawrence, L. Poudel, D. G. Mandrus, F. Ronning, M. Janoschek, D. G. Mazzone
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are among the most intriguing phenomena that can occur when the electronic ground state of correlated metals are tuned by external parameters such as pressure, magnetic field or chemical substitution. Such transitions between distinct states of matter are driven by quantum fluctuations, and can give rise to macroscopically coherent phases that are at the forefront of condensed matter research. However, the nature of the critical fluctuations, and thus the fundamental physics controlling many quantum phase transitions, remain poorly understood in numerous strongly correlated metals. Here we study the model material CeCu$_{5.8}$Ag$_{0.2}$ to gain insight into the implications of critical fluctuations originating from different regions in reciprocal space. By employing an external magnetic field along the crystallographic $a$- and $c$-axis as auxiliary tuning parameter we observe a pronounced anisotropy in the suppression of the quantum critical fluctuations, reflecting the spin anisotropy of the long-range ordered ground state at larger silver concentration. Coupled with the temperature dependence of the quantum critical fluctuations, these results suggest that the quantum phase transition in CeCu$_{5.8}$Ag$_{0.2}$ is driven by three-dimensional spin-density wave fluctuations.

Title: First passage of a run-and-tumble particle with exponentially-distributed tumble duration in the presence of a drift
Authors: Pascal Grange, Linglong Yuan
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a finite interval $[a,b]$ with two absorbing end points. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between three values $v,0,-v$ at exponential times, thus incorporating positive tumble times. Moreover, a constant drift is added to the run-and-tumble motion at all times. The combination of these two features constitutes the main novelty of our model. The densities of the first-passage time through $a$ (given the initial position and velocity states) satisfy certain forward Fokker--Planck equations, whose Laplace transforms induce evolution equations for the exit probabilities and mean first-passage times of the particle. We solve these equations explicitly for all possible initial states. We consider the limiting regimes of instantaneous tumble and/or the limit of large $b$ to confirm consistency with existing results in the literature. In particular, in the limit of a half-line (large $b$), the mean first-passage time conditioned on the exit through $a$ is an affine function of the initial position if the drift is positive, as in the case of instantaneous tumble.

Title: Spin currents in crystals with spin-orbit coupling: multi-band effects in an effective Hamiltonian formalism
Authors: K. V. Samokhin, M. Sigrist, M. H. Fischer
Abstract: When focusing on a few essential bands in an effective description of a material to calculate observable quantities, the respective operators have to be adjusted accordingly. Ignoring contributions arising from integrating out remote bands can lead to qualitatively wrong results. We present a detailed analysis of the interband mixing effects on spin currents. Specifically, we calculate the intrinsic spin current in a time-reversal invariant noncentrosymmetric crystal in the presence of electron-lattice spin-orbit coupling. Starting from formally exact microscopic expressions, we derive the spin current operator restricted to one or more essential bands by iterative elimination of the contributions from distant bands. We show that the standard definition of the spin current operator in terms of the group velocity obtained from an effective band Hamiltonian cannot be justified using a microscopic theory. The modified expression for the spin current operator contains additional terms, which dominate the equilibrium spin current in a uniform crystal. We show that the magnitude of these additional terms can considerably exceed the spin current obtained using the standard definition.

Title: Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride as two-dimensional strain sensors
Authors: Z. Mu, Z. Zhang, J. Fraunié, C. Robert, G. Seine, B. Gil, G. Cassabois, V. Jacques
Abstract: Lattice deformation is a powerful way to engineer the properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, making their precise measurement an important challenge for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that boron-vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) enable quantitative strain sensing with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. Using this approach, we precisely quantify the strain-induced shift of the E$_{\rm 2g}$ Raman mode in a multilayer hBN flake under uniaxial stress, establishing V$_\text{B}^-$ centers as a new tool for strain metrology in van der Waals heterostructures. Beyond strain sensing, our work also highlights the unique multimodal sensing functionalities offered by V$_\text{B}^-$ centers, which will be valuable for future studies of strain-engineered 2D materials.

Title: Antiferromagnetic domain walls under spin-orbit torque
Authors: George Theodorou, Stavros Komineas
Abstract: Domain walls in antiferromagnets under a spin-polarized current present dynamical behavior that is not observed in ferromagnets, and it is tunable by the current polarization. Precessional dynamics is obtained for perpendicular spin polarization. In-plane polarization gives propagating walls. We obtain the velocity as a function of current by a perturbation method for low velocities, and the wall profile is found to lack a definite parity. For high velocities, a power-law decay develops in the trailing tail of the wall. The main features of the wall profile are manifest in a direct solution of an equation that is valid in a limiting case. Oscillatory motion of domain walls is obtained for a spin polarization that has both perpendicular and in-plane components, and an analytical description is given. We discuss the modifications of the dynamics when a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is present. Finally, we give the magnetization of the dynamical walls and find that this can become large, providing a potential method for observations.

Title: Dipolar Interfacial Excitons in Lateral Semiconductor Heterostructures
Authors: Elie Vandoolaeghe, Francesco Fortuna, Suman Kumar Chakraborty, Biswajeet Nayak, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Prasana K. Sahoo, Thibault Chervy, Puneet A. Murthy
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) quantum systems are a cornerstone of many-body physics. However, their realization in solids has traditionally relied on top-down methods, which are limited by structural disorder and coarse confinement. Here, we demonstrate a fundamentally distinct route: the emergence of 1D quantum matter at the atomically sharp interface between monolayer semiconductors. Using lateral MoSe2-WSe2 heterostructures, we identify interfacial excitonic quasiparticles that are bound to the crystal junction. Photoluminescence spectroscopy resolves these excitons into a ladder of discrete states, establishing nanoscopic 1D confinement at length scales of 3 nm. These excitons possess exceptional large permanent in-plane electric dipole moments exceeding e x 2 nm, and exhibit micron-scale, highly anisotropic diffusion confined to the interface. Crucially, the lateral geometry enables dynamic, in-situ reconfiguration of the exciton's internal structure. By introducing electrostatic doping, we demonstrate a collapse of the dipole moment and a 20-fold reduction in radiative lifetime. This structural tunability establishes lateral interfaces as a uniquely powerful platform for the 'bottom-up' engineering of 1D quantum matter. By enabling the dynamic tuning of wavefunctions within a single atomic monolayer, this work opens a scalable route toward 1D excitonic circuits and strongly correlated 1D bosonic phases.

Title: Platform for zero-field isolated skyrmions: 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers on Re(0001)
Authors: Moinak Ghosh, Stefan Heinze, Souvik Paul
Abstract: Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) combined with atomistic spin simulations, we explore the possibility of realizing zero-field isolated skyrmions in three 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers -- Rh/Co, Pd/Co, and Ru/Co -- grown on the Re(0001) surface. Our investigation employs an extended atomistic spin model, which goes beyond the standard model by including the multi-spin higher-order exchange interactions (HOI) in addition to the Heisenberg pairwise exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). All magnetic interactions of the extended spin model are calculated using DFT. The phase diagram obtained from atomistic spin simulations based on this spin model for Rh/Co and Pd/Co on Re(0001) reveals that isolated skyrmions emerge spontaneously on the ferromagnetic background even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The radius of zero-field isolated skyrmions in Rh/Co/Re(0001) is around 6 nm, whereas the radius of those skyrmions in Pd/Co/Re(0001) is about 12 nm. Transition-state theory calculations show that the skyrmions are protected by substantial energy barriers, approximately 150 meV, which predominantly arise from DMI, with a small contribution from the HOI interactions. The height of the barriers suggests that skyrmions could be observed in low-temperature experiments. Based on this work, we propose 4$d$/Co bilayers on Re(0001) as a new platform to realize nanoscale zero-field isolated skyrmions.

Title: Spin-orbit coupled spin-boson model : A variational analysis
Authors: Sudip Sinha, Subhasis Sinha, Sushanta Dattagupta
Abstract: The spin-boson (SB) model is a standard prototype for quantum dissipation, which we generalize in this work, to explore the dissipative effects on a one-dimensional spin-orbit (SO) coupled particle in the presence of a sub-ohmic bath. We analyze this model by extending the well-known variational polaron approach, revealing a localization transition accompanied by an intriguing change in the spectrum, for which the doubly degenerate minima evolves to a single minimum at zero momentum as the system-bath coupling increases. For translational invariant system with conserved momentum, a continuous magnetization transition occurs, whereas the ground state changes discontinuously. We further investigate the transition of the ground state in the presence of harmonic confinement, which effectively models a quantum dot-like nanostructure under the influence of the environment. In both the scenarios, the entanglement entropy of the spin-sector can serve as a marker for these transitions. Interestingly, for the trapped system, a cat-like superposition state corresponds to maximum entanglement entropy below the transition, highlighting the relevance of the present model for studying the effect of decoherence on intra-particle entanglement in the context of quantum information processing.

Title: Ordering in statistical systems on the way to the thermodynamic limit
Authors: V.I. Yukalov, E.P. Yukalova
Abstract: It is well known that the mathematically accurate description of ordering and related symmetry breaking in statistical systems requires to consider the thermodynamic limit. But the order does not appear from nowhere, and yet before the thermodynamic limit is reached, there should exist some kind of preordering that appears and grows in the process of increasing the system size. The quantitative description of growing order, under the growing system size, is developed by introducing the notion of {\it order indices}. The rigorous proof of the phase transition existence is a separate difficult problem that is not the topic of the present paper. We illustrate the approach resorting to several models in the mean-field approximation, which makes it possible to demonstrate the notion of order indices for finite systems in a clear way. We show how the order grows on the way to the thermodynamic limit for Bose-Einstein condensation, arising superconductivity, magnetization, and crystallization phenomena.

Title: Discovering topological phases in gray-Tin
Authors: Gaurav Harsha, Selina Dirnböck, Emanuel Gull, Vojtěch Vlček, Dominika Zgid
Abstract: Non-trivial topological phases often emerge in narrow-gap semiconductors with a delicate blend of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation. The diamond-lattice allotrope of Sn ($\alpha$-Sn) exemplifies this behavior, hosting multiple topological phases that can be tuned by small distortions in the lattice. Despite rapid experimental progress, theoretical descriptions of $\alpha$-Sn lack predictive power and rely mainly on tight-binding models and density functional theory with uncontrolled approximations. We employ first-principles fully self-consistent, relativistic GW (scGW) to overcome these limitations. The scGW recovers the experimentally observed zero-gap semiconductor and the strain-induced topological insulator and Dirac semimetal phases, while also predicting new trivial and topological insulators and a Dirac semimetal phase, further demonstrating the versatility of $\alpha$-Sn for band engineering. Additionally, we propose a robust diagnostic of topological behavior based on a combined analysis of band and orbital-occupation dispersions, tailored for correlated methods where standard mean-field-based topological invariants fall short. Our findings pave the way for studying a broad class of topological materials using accurate first-principles methods beyond density functional theory.

Title: Structural changes in the Lennard-Jones supercooled liquid and ideal glass: an improved integral equation for the replica method
Authors: Bomont Jean-Marc, Bretonnet Jean-Louis, Costa Dino, Pastore Giorgio
Abstract: Framing the glass formation within standard statistical mechanics is an outstanding problem of condensed matter theory. To provide new insight, we investigate the structural properties of the Lennard-Jones fluid in the very-low temperature regime, by using a replicated version of the refined HMSA theory of the liquid state, combined with an appropriate split of the pair potential [Bomont and Bretonnet, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 4141 (2001)]. Our scheme allows one to reach an unprecedented low-temperature domain within both the supercooled liquid and the ideal-glass phase. Therein, a density-dependent temperature is identified, whereupon the radial distribution function experiences clear-cut structural changes, insofar as an additional peak develops in between the main and the second peaks. Such a structural feature points to a local structure of the Lennard-Jones ideal glass with an fcc-like short-range order, in the absence of any long-range order.

Title: A finite viscoelastic constitutive model for low to high strain rate response of elastomers with application of strain rate-induced glass transition
Authors: Bibekananda Datta, Sushan Nakarmi, Nitin P. Daphalapurkar
Abstract: Amorphous elastomers exhibit significant rate-stiffening and unique viscous flow characteristics across a wide range of strain rates, often undergoing glass transition above a strain rate threshold. We have developed a thermodynamically-consistent and micromechanically-inspired constitutive model for soft elastomeric materials to capture the rate-dependent stress-strain behavior and hysteresis when subjected to low to high strain rates. Our proposed constitutive model encapsulates the viscous flow of materials through molecular motion at low strain rates and local rearrangement and alignment at high strain rates, essentially covering the glass transition. We applied our constitutive model to uniaxial compression experiments performed at low and high strain rates for polyborosiloxane (PBS) to identify the material parameters, and subsequently, performed numerical simulations of single and multi-cycle compression, stress relaxation, and small amplitude oscillatory tension-compression. Our analyses indicate that the model predicts higher total energy dissipation with increasing strain rate; however, dissipation associated with molecular relaxation decreases (forming a cusp) because, beyond a crossover strain rate, molecular rearrangement and alignment become dominant, which is consistent with the onset of the glass transition. For cyclic loading-unloading, we observed that dissipation over a cycle remains constant at low strain rate but decreases non-monotonically at high strain rates before becoming constant with peak stress over the cycle becoming higher, which can be interpreted as more loading being carried elastically by the polymer network as the molecular rearrangement process occurs. Additionally, our model was able to predict the qualitative nature of the storage modulus and loss modulus in the limit of small strain over a wide range of frequency sweeps.

Title: Anomalous pressure dependence of the bulk modulus and Yb valence in cubic YbPd
Authors: B. Tegomo Chiogo, V. Balédent, J.-P. Rueff, E. Saïman, V. Poree, T. Schweitzer, D. Wong, C. Schulz, T. Mazet, A. Chainani, D. Malterre, K. Habicht
Abstract: We investigate the Yb valence instabilities in the strongly correlated YbPd compound using resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy as a function of pressure across the charge-order (CO) transition. At a low temperature (T = 30 K) in the CO phase, the Yb $4f$ valence remains nearly constant up to a pressure P$_L$ = 1.5 $\pm {0.2}$ GPa, and then increases gradually at higher pressures. In contrast, at room temperature in the normal phase, an anomalous decrease of the Yb $4f$ valence is observed, without any accompanying structural phase transition. This behavior is corroborated by a systematic pressure-dependent decrease of the unit-cell volume. Based on a Birch-Murnaghan analysis, the compressibility indicates hardening of the lattice with applied pressure up to a distinct kink seen at P$_K$ = 1.6 $\pm {0.2}$ GPa. In contrast, for P $>$ P$_K$, the Yb $4f$ valence saturates and the compressibility reveals a counterintuitive pressure-induced softening. The results show a minimum in the compressibility of YbPd (with $f^{0}$-$f^{1}$ hole-type mixed-valence), reminiscent of the maximum in compressibility seen in the $\gamma$-$\alpha$ first-order isostructural phase transition in cerium (with $f^{0}$-$f^{1}$ electron-type mixed-valence).

Title: Interface effects and dielectric mismatch in ultrathin silicon on insulator films
Authors: Andrea Pulici, Gabriele Seguini, Fabiana Taglietti, Roman Gumeniuk, Riccardo Chiarcos, Michele Laus, Johannes Heitmann, Marco Fanciulli, Michele Perego
Abstract: The role of interface states and dielectric mismatch is studied in ultrathin P-doped silicon-on-insulator (SOI) films with thickness of the device layer ($H_{SOI}$) varying from 30 to 8 nm and dopant concentration ($n_{D}$) ranging from 10$^{18}$ to nearly 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. P concentration is determined by Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Sample resistivity ($\rho$), carrier concentration ($n_e$), and mobility ($\mu_e$) are extracted by combining sheet resistance and Hall measurements in van der Pauw configuration. When $H_{SOI}$ = 30 nm, transport properties at room temperature are fully compatible with those of a similarly doped bulk Si. Progressive 2D confinement by reduction of $H_{SOI}$ below 30 nm results in a reduction of the carrier concentration and a concomitant degradation of $\mu_e$. These effects, which are steadily enhanced decreasing $n_D$, are attributed to non-passivated interface states at the SiO$_2$/Si interface and can be significantly mitigated by high temperature rapid thermal oxidation (RTO). The effectiveness of this approach was verified by electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements, which allowed the assessment of the quality of the RTO-SiO$_2$/Si interface and the correlation with observed electrical properties. After effective interface engineering, low temperature electrical characterization revealed a significant increase in P ionization energy in samples with $H_{SOI}$ <= 15 nm, a result directly related to the dielectric mismatch.

Title: Accurate and efficient simulation of photoemission spectroscopy via Kohn-Sham scattering states
Authors: Gian Parusa, Sotirios Fragkos, Samuel Beaulieu, Michael Schüler
Abstract: We introduce an efficient first-principles framework for simulating angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) based on the direct computation of photoelectron states as solutions of the Kohn-Sham equation with scattering boundary conditions. While the one-step theory of photoemission has a long and successful history, existing implementations are often tied to specialized electronic-structure formalisms. Our approach is formally equivalent to the Lippmann-Schwinger formulation, and it is directly compatible with standard plane-wave and real-space density functional theory codes, enabling seamless integration with advanced exchange-correlation functionals and modern electronic-structure workflows. By providing explicit photoelectron wave functions, the method allows for a transparent analysis of matrix-element effects, multiple scattering, and experimental geometry. We demonstrate the accuracy and predictive power of the framework through circular-dichroism ARPES simulations for monolayer graphene and bulk $2H$-WSe$_2$, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data over a wide photon-energy range. Our results establish a robust and accessible route toward quantitative ARPES modeling, opening the door to systematic studies of orbital textures, many-body effects, and nonequilibrium phenomena within widely used ab initio platforms.

Title: Learning and extrapolating scale-invariant processes
Authors: Anaclara Alvez-Canepa, Cyril Furtlehner, François Landes
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has deeply changed some fields recently, like Language and Vision and we may expect it to be relevant also to the analysis of of complex systems. Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.

Title: Diffusive and hydrodynamic magnetotransport around a density perturbation in a two-dimensional electron gas
Authors: P. S. Parashar, M. M. Fogler
Abstract: We study current flow around a density inhomogeneity in a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The inhomogeneity is parametrized by a power-law tail with an exponent $\beta > 2$. We show that current and electrochemical potential are exponentially suppressed inside a surrounding area much larger than the geometric size of the perturbation. The corresponding ``no-go'' radius grows as a certain power of the magnetic field. Residual current and potential exhibit spiraling patterns inside the no-go region. Outside of it, they acquire corrections inversely proportional to the distance, which is known as the Landauer resistivity dipole. The Landauer dipole is rotated by the angle $\pi (1 - 1 / \beta)$ with respect to the average electric field. The rotation direction depends on whether the local density is raised or lowered. We also consider the effect of electron viscosity and show that the variation of the no-go radius with magnetic field becomes more rapid if viscosity is large enough. The Landauer dipole size is set by the Gurzhi length, which is much larger than the no-go radius, which is in turn much larger than the geometric size of the perturbation. Our results may be useful for interpreting nanoimaging of current distribution in graphene and other two-dimensional systems.

Title: Crystal Representation in the Reciprocal Space
Authors: Osman Goni Ridwan, Hongfei Xue, Youxing Chen, Harish Cherukuri, Qiang Zhu
Abstract: In crystallography, a structure is typically represented by the arrangement of atoms in the direct space. Furthermore, space group symmetry and Wyckoff site notations are applied to characterize crystal structures with only a few variables. While this representation is effective for data records and human learning, it lacks one-to-one correspondence between the crystal structure and its representation. This is problematic for many applications, such as crystal structure determination, comparison, and more recently, generative model learning. To address this issue, we propose to represent crystals in a four-dimensional (4D) reciprocal space featured by their Cartesian coordinates and scattering factors, which can naturally handle translation invariance and space group symmetry with the help of structure factors. In order to achieve rotational invariance, the 4D coordinates are then transformed into a power spectrum representation under the orthogonal spherical harmonic and radial basis. Hence, this representation captures both periodicity and symmetry of the crystal structure while also providing a continuous representation of the atomic positions and cell parameters in the direct space. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by applying it to several crystal structure matching and reconstruction tasks.

Title: Floquet-Thermalization via Instantons near Dynamical Freezing
Authors: Rohit Mukherjee, Haoyu Guo, Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: Periodically driven Floquet quantum many-body systems have revealed new insights into the rich interplay of thermalization, and growth of entanglement. The phenomenology of dynamical freezing, whereby a translationally invariant many-body system exhibits emergent conservation laws and a slow growth of entanglement entropy at certain fixed ratios of a drive amplitude and frequency, presents a novel paradigm for retaining memory of an initial state upto late times. Previous studies of dynamical freezing have largely been restricted to a high-frequency Floquet-Magnus expansion, and numerical exact diagonalization, which are unable to capture the slow approach to thermalization (or lack thereof) in a systematic fashion. By employing Floquet flow-renormalization, where the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is gradually decoupled from the effective Hamiltonian using a sequence of unitary transformations, we unveil the universal approach to dynamical freezing and beyond, at asymptotically late times. We analyze the fixed-point behavior associated with the flow-renormalization at and near freezing using both exact-diagonalization and tensor-network based methods, and contrast the results with conventional prethermal phenomenon. For a generic non-integrable spin Hamiltonian with a periodic cosine wave drive, the flow approaches an unstable fixed point with an approximate emergent symmetry. We observe that at freezing the thermalization timescales are delayed compared to away from freezing, and the flow trajectory undergoes a series of instanton events. Our numerical results are supported by analytical solutions to the flow equations.

Title: Digital Quantum Simulation of the Lindblad Master Equation and Its Nonlinear Extensions via Quantum Trajectory Averaging
Authors: Yu-Guo Liu, Heng Fan, Shu Chen
Abstract: Since precisely controlling dissipation in realistic environments is challenging, digital simulation of the Lindblad master equation (LME) is of great significance for understanding nonequilibrium dynamics in open quantum systems. However, achieving long-time simulations for complex systems with multiple dissipation channels remains a major challenge, both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we propose a 1-dilation digital scheme for simulating the LME based on quantum trajectory averaging without postselection. By rigorously matching the stochasticity inherent in quantum trajectories with the probabilistic outcomes of quantum measurements, our method effectively translates the classically established quantum jump algorithm into executable quantum circuits. A key advantage of our method is that it overcomes the exponential suppression of success probability seen in some existing postselection-dependent schemes, especially for long-time evolution or systems with numerous jump operators. Moreover, the scheme can be extended to a 2-dilation framework for the nonlinear LME with postselection, bridging the full LME and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian dynamics. This extended scheme provides a digital approach for exploring the interplay between non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and dissipative terms within a monitored quantum dynamics framework.

Title: Generalization Dynamics of Linear Diffusion Models
Authors: Claudia Merger, Sebastian Goldt
Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models that produce high-quality samples from complex data. While their infinite-data behavior is well understood, their generalization with finite data remains less clear. Classical learning theory predicts that generalization occurs at a sample complexity that is exponential in the dimension, far exceeding practical needs. We address this gap by analyzing diffusion models through the lens of data covariance spectra, which often follow power-law decays, reflecting the hierarchical structure of real data. To understand whether such a hierarchical structure can benefit learning in diffusion models, we develop a theoretical framework based on linear neural networks, congruent with a Gaussian hypothesis on the data. We quantify how the hierarchical organization of variance in the data and regularization impacts generalization. We find two regimes: When $N <d$, not all directions of variation are present in the training data, which results in a large gap between training and test loss. In this regime, we demonstrate how a strongly hierarchical data structure, as well as regularization and early stopping help to prevent overfitting. For $N > d$, we find that the sampling distributions of linear diffusion models approach their optimum (measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence) linearly with $d/N$, independent of the specifics of the data distribution. Our work clarifies how sample complexity governs generalization in a simple model of diffusion-based generative models.

Title: Quantum Circuits for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
Authors: Baptiste Claudon, Pablo Rodenas-Ruiz, Jean-Philip Piquemal, Pierre Monmarché
Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose spectral gap is quadratically larger than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the transition probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a Szegedy quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, and does not require further reversible computing methods. We also compare this construction with an alternative to Szegedy's approach which also provides a quadratic gap amplification. Since each step of the quantum walks uses a constant number of proposal and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations.

Title: Quantum Simulation of Fermions in $AdS_2$ Black Hole: Chirality, Entanglement, and Spectral Crossovers
Authors: Kazuki Ikeda, Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider free Dirac fermions on a discretized $AdS_2$ black hole background, and analyze how curved space redshift, horizons, and the spin connection induced chiral gravitational effect shape spectral, transport, and scrambling phenomena. The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom, whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition.

Title: On the Separability of Information in Diffusion Models
Authors: Akhil Premkumar
Abstract: Diffusion models transform noise into data by injecting information that was captured in their neural network during the training phase. In this paper, we ask: \textit{what} is this information? We find that, in pixel-space diffusion models, (1) a large fraction of the total information in the neural network is committed to reconstructing small-scale perceptual details of the image, and (2) the correlations between images and their class labels are informed by the semantic content of the images, and are largely agnostic to the low-level details. We argue that these properties are intrinsically tied to the manifold structure of the data itself. Finally, we show that these facts explain the efficacy of classifier-free guidance: the guidance vector amplifies the mutual information between images and conditioning signals early in the generative process, influencing semantic structure, but tapers out as perceptual details are filled in.

Title: Consequences of symmetry-breaking on conformal defect data
Authors: Bastien Girault, Miguel F. Paulos, Philine van Vliet
Abstract: Conformal defects spontaneously break part of the symmetry algebra of a bulk CFT. We show that the broken Ward identities imply very general sum rules on the defect CFT data as well as on the DOE data of bulk operators, which we call defect soft theorems. Our derivation is elementary, allowing us to easily reproduce and generalize constraints on displacement and tilt operators previously obtained in the literature as well as a plethora of new ones, including constraints on bulk-defect correlation functions. For line defects we rewrite constraints in dispersive sum rule form, showing they lead to exact, optimal bounds on the OPE data of the defect. We test these sum rules in concrete perturbative examples, finding perfect agreement with existing calculations and making new predictions for various dCFT data.

Title: Temporal Entanglement Transitions in the Periodically Driven Ising Chain
Authors: Karun Gadge, Abhinav Prem, Rishabh Jha
Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems can host non-equilibrium phenomena without static analogs, including in their entanglement dynamics. Here, we discover $temporal$ $entanglement$ $transitions$ (TET) in a Floquet spin chain, which correspond to a quantum phase transition in the spectrum of the entanglement Hamiltonian and are signaled by dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking. We identify the symmetry principles underlying these transitions: they appear when the driven Hamiltonian preserves global symmetry (here, $\mathbb{Z}_2$), the initial state respects this symmetry, and the reduced density matrix carries weight in both subsystem-parity sectors, with TET occurring precisely when the sector weights become equal (given the previous two conditions are also satisfied). Intriguingly, we find these transitions across a broad range of driving frequencies (from adiabatic to high-frequency regime) and independently of drive details, where they manifest as periodic, sharp entanglement spectrum reorganizations marked by the Schmidt-gap closure, a vanishing entanglement echo, and symmetry-quantum-number flips, while remaining invisible to conventional local observables. At high frequencies, the entanglement Hamiltonian acquires an intrinsic timescale decoupled from the drive period, rendering the transitions genuine steady-state features. Finite-size scaling reveals universal critical behavior with correlation-length exponent $\nu=1$, matching equilibrium Ising universality despite its emergence from purely dynamical mechanisms decoupled from static criticality. Our work establishes TET as novel features in Floquet quantum matter.

Title: PYVALE: A Fast, Scalable, Open-Source 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) Engine Capable of Handling Gigapixel Images
Authors: Joel Hirst, Lorna Sibson, Adel Tayeb, Ben Poole, Megan Sampson, Wiera Bielajewa, Michael Atkinson, Alex Marsh, Rory Spencer, Rob Hamill, Cory Hamelin, Allan Harte, Lloyd Fletcher
Abstract: Background: Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a widely used full-field measurement technique, but both open-source and commercial packages often have limitations such as operating-system restrictions, lack of support for deployment on computing clusters, and poor scalability to gigapixel-scale images common in Scanning Electron Microscopy DIC (SEM-DIC). Objective: Pyvale is an open-source software package designed for sensor simulation, uncertainty quantification, placement optimization, and calibration/validation. A key component of this is the development of a dedicated 2D DIC module intended for standalone use and integration within broader workflows. Methods: Pyvale provides a user-friendly Python interface with performant compiled routines underneath. At its core is a multithreaded, reliability-guided DIC algorithm. Its open-source MIT license enables wide deployment, including on computing clusters and in automated pipelines. Results: Benchmarking with the publicly available 2D DIC challenge 2.0 dataset shows that Pyvale achieves metrological performance comparable to existing commercial and open-source DIC codes. It can correlate gigapixel-scale image pairs in under 5 minutes on high-specification desktop workstations, with memory peaking at approximately 50 GB. Conclusions: Pyvale's strong metrological foundation, coupled with its scalability for SEM-DIC, positions it as a platform for sustained, community-driven development. Its design and licensing provide a foundation for future improvements in open-source DIC and integration into experimental design and validation workflows.
