Title: A model of thermophoresis of colloidal proteins in water using non-Fickian diffusion currents
Authors: Mayank Sharma, Angad Singh, A. Bhattacharyay
Abstract: In 1928, Chapman generalised Einstein's theory of diffusion for non-uniform fluids to show the presence of a non-Fickian diffusion current, which he considered important in thermodiffusion (Ludwig-Soret effect). In 1941, Kiyosi Itô proposed the formal methods of stochastic calculus in the presence of spatially dependent diffusion, yielding the same non-Fickian diffusion current as shown by Chapman. The phenomenon of thermodiffusion and thermophoresis happens in the presence of a temperature gradient, which makes diffusion space-dependent. The role of solvation forces in thermophoresis will only be clearer once that of diffusion is understood properly. In this paper, we investigate the importance of Chapman's non-Fickian diffusion current on the thermophoretic motion of colloidal particles in water (with weak salt concentration). We show that all the general features of variations of the Soret coefficient $S_T$ with temperature can be captured using Chapman's non-Fickian diffusion current. We compare our theoretical results with experimental plots of the Soret coefficients for three polypeptides in aqueous solution: Lysozyme, BLGA, and Poly-L-Lysine, and find a strong match. We emphasise that, in addition to the yet-to-be-understood details of solvation forces, Chapman's non-Fickian diffusion current is an indispensable element that needs to be taken into account for a complete understanding of thermophoresis and thermodiffusion.

Title: Strain-rate, temperature and size effects on the mechanical behavior of fiber bundles
Authors: Jerome Weiss
Abstract: The mechanical characteristics of fibers (of various materials), as well as of fiber bundles, are of primary importance for the design and the mechanical behavior of textiles, or of fibrous and composite materials. These characteristics are classically determined from strain-rate controlled tensile testing, generally assuming a negligible role of thermal activation on damage and fracturing processes. Under this assumption, the distribution of individual fiber strengths can be deduced from a downscaling of the macroscopic mechanical behavior at the bundle scale. There are however many experimental evidences of strain-rate and temperature effects on the mechanical behavior of individual fibers or bundles, which can also creep under constant applied load. This indicates a strong role of thermal activation on these processes. Here, these effects are analyzed from a fiber-bundle model with equal-load-sharing, in which thermal activation of fiber breakings is introduced from a kinetic Monte-Carlo algorithm adapted for time-varying stresses. This allows to rationalize these rate or temperature effects, such as a decrease of bundle strength, strain at peak stress, and apparent Young's modulus with decreasing strain-rate and/or increasing temperature. This also shows that the classical downscaling procedure used to estimate the distribution of individual fiber strengths from the mechanical behavior at the bundle scale should be considered with caution. If mechanical testing of the bundle is performed under conditions favoring the role of thermal activation (e.g. low applied strain-rate), this procedure can strongly underestimate the intrinsic (athermal) Weibull's parameters of the fiber strengths distribution. The same model is used as well to explore size (number of fibers) effects on bundle mechanical response.

Title: Shape, confinement and inertia effects on the dynamics of a driven spheroid in a viscous fluid
Authors: Aditya Bhowmik, Kevin Stratford, Oliver Henrich, Sumesh P. Thampi
Abstract: The dynamics of anisotropic particles in viscous flows underpin a wide range of processes in soft matter, microfluidics, and targeted drug delivery. Here, we investigate the motion of externally driven prolate and oblate spheroids suspended in a Newtonian fluid and confined within a square microchannel. Using lattice Boltzmann simulations, complemented by far-field hydrodynamic theory based on superposition of wall interactions, we systematically quantify how particle aspect ratio, strength of confinement, and fluid inertia influence the dynamics of a spheroid. For unconfined spheroids, we show that the translational velocity is maximized not for a sphere but for a prolate (end-on) or oblate (broadside-on) spheroid of a specific aspect ratio. Under confinement, the optimal aspect ratio shifts toward oblate shapes due to the dominant contribution of wall-induced frictional resistance. Off-center positioning introduces strong translation-rotation coupling, giving rise to two families of oscillatory trajectories - glancing and reversing - whose existence and structure are captured as closed orbits in phase space. Weak fluid inertia breaks these closed loops: glancing trajectories spiral outward and merge with reversing trajectories, and new stable fixed points emerge. Together, these results reveal how modest deviations from sphericity or creeping-flow conditions profoundly alter the dynamics of driven particles in confined geometries. The predictions offer guidelines for optimizing particle shape in microfluidic transport and highlight the rich nonlinear behavior accessible in confined suspensions of nonspherical colloids.

Title: StrAPS: Structural Angular Power Spectrum for Discovering Novel Morphologies in Block Copolymers
Authors: Dominic M. Robe, Elnaz Hajizadeh
Abstract: The morphologies of phase separating systems have formal distinctions such as symmetry groups, but the analysis protocol for labeling a particular phase field with a morphology requires manual expertise, arbitrary thresholds, or established signatures. In this work, it is investigated if the angular power spectrum of the 3D structure factor can discriminate between morphologies. The 3D structure factor is computed on configurations of phase separating block copolymers generated by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The shell of structure factor values containing the primary peaks is isolated. This 2D field on a sphere is decomposed into spherical harmonic modes of even polynomial degree $\ell\le 12$, then further reduced to the rotationally invariant angular power spectrum. It is found that these few coefficients for low $\ell$ discriminate robustly between different morphologies. This analysis serves as an automatic tool for flagging novel structures, without a need to enumerate the plausible morphologies in advance.

Title: Probing near-field EM fluctuations in superparamagnetic CoFeB with NV quantum dephasometry
Authors: Shoaib Mahmud, Wei Zhang, Pronoy Das, Angshuman Deka, Wenbo Sun, Zubin Jacob
Abstract: Superparamagnetism in nanoscale magnetic layers is a critical property for a wide range of spintronic-based sensor and computing applications. While conventional magnetization measurements can detect superparamagnetic signatures, they often require the application of high perturbative fields and are difficult to implement for magnetic layers integrated within functional devices. In this study, we non-invasively investigate the superparamagnetic spin dynamics of a nanoscale CoFeB layer of thickness 1.1 nm, deposited on a diamond substrate, by probing its low-frequency near-field electromagnetic (EM) fluctuations using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers-based quantum dephasometry. Our measurements reveal an unconventional, non-monotonic temperature dependence of the dephasing time of NV centers, which we attribute to EM fluctuations produced by thermally driven superparamagnetic domain flipping in CoFeB. Our findings are further supported by the theoretical interpretation of the dephasing dynamics of NV centers and the complementary SQUID-based magnetization characterizations of the CoFeB layer. Additionally, exploiting the technique of NV dephasometry, we extract the spectral density of the EM fluctuations in CoFeB, which is used to isolate different components of the EM fluctuations acting on NV centers. We also measure the CoFeB-to-NV distance-dependent coherence times of NV centers to investigate the effect of the dimensionality of the CoFeB layer on the generated near-field EM fluctuations. These results provide critical insight into the magnetization dynamics and near-field EM environment of nanoscale magnetic layers. It also has significant implications for the development of hybrid quantum spintronic devices and applications involving nanoscale opto-magnetic materials.

Title: Velocity Weakening in Anisotropic Friction on a Tilted Titania Nanorod Forest
Authors: Debottam Datta, Enrico Gnecco, J. P. Singh, Nitya Nand Gosvami
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate velocity-dependent directional friction on a surface structured with tilted (~57°) titania nanorods using standard and colloidal probe force microscopy. Friction is measured at four different sliding speeds in two configurations, along and opposite to the tilt and perpendicular to the tilt direction, exhibiting anisotropic friction. Furthermore, friction decreases logarithmically with increasing sliding speed, which is attributed to the viscoelastic bending of the nanorods caused by stress-induced defect migration. The velocity weakening is more pronounced in the direction perpendicular to the tilt than along and opposite to it. The experimental findings are corroborated by creep measurements, which are well-reproduced by the Standard Linear Solid (SLS) model of viscoelasticity. Our results may be applied to the development of direction- and velocity-dependent sensors for microscale sliding motion as a robust alternative to structured interfaces based on polymeric materials.

Title: Tuning Optoelectronic Properties and Photoelectrochemical Performance of \b{eta}-TaON via Vanadium Doping
Authors: Mirabbos Hojamberdiev, Ronald Vargas, Lorean Madriz, Dilshod Nematov, Ulugbek Shaislamov, Hajime Wagata, Yuta Kubota, Kunio Yubuta, Katsuya Teshima, Nobuhiro Matsushita
Abstract: The application of beta-TaON for solar-driven water splitting is hindered by limitations in phase purity, stoichiometry, crystallinity, visible-light absorption, carrier mobility, and high recombination rates. This study investigates the impact of vanadium doping (0-25 at.% V) on the structural, optoelectronic, and photoelectrochemical properties of beta-TaON using both experimental and density functional theory (DFT) approaches. Phase-pure beta-TaON is retained up to 10 at.% V, beyond which secondary phases (Ta2O5 and VN) form, indicating a threshold of ~10 at.% under the applied synthesis conditions. All samples exhibit a porous microstructure. Increasing vanadium content induces a redshift in the absorption edge, reducing the bandgap from 2.72 eV (undoped) to 2.38 eV at 25 at.% V for the main beta-TaON phase, in agreement with DFT results. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms substitutional incorporation of V5+ for Ta5+ in the beta-TaON lattice. DFT calculations reveal reduced electron effective mass, enhanced n-type conductivity, and favorable band edge shifts enabling spontaneous overall water splitting at <=10 at.% V. Photoelectrochemical measurements show improved photocurrent and more negative onset potentials for 5-10 at.% V, while higher V doping degrades performance due to phase segregation, which likely increases recombination and hinders interfacial charge transport. Vanadium doping (<=10 at.% V) is an effective strategy for tuning the electronic structure and enhancing the optical properties and photoelectrochemical performance of beta-TaON.

Title: Room Temperature RF Sputtering of Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductor Nd2Ni0.8Cu0.2O4+d films

Abstract: Lowering the operating temperature of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) is essential for improving durability and enabling large scale commercialization. Mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) of the Ruddlesden-Popper family, such as Nd$2$Ni${1-x}$Cu$x$O${4+\delta}$ (NNCO), offer attractive cathode properties due to their high oxygen transport and favourable defect chemistry. In this work, we investigate the fabrication of Nd$2$Ni${0.8}$Cu${0.2}$O${4+\delta}$ thin films using a room temperature RF sputtering process followed by moderate temperature annealing. To simplify deposition, a single stoichiometric target was employed, despite the compositional challenges posed by elements with different sputtering yields. We examine the effect of sputtering power density on phase formation and film stoichiometry through X-ray diffraction, Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry, Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, and temperature dependent resistivity measurements. Increasing the sputtering power density strongly reduces the presence of spurious phases and promotes stabilization of the desired n=1 Ruddlesden-Popper phase. Films deposited at 230 W (3.1 W cm$^{-2}$) exhibit a predominant NNCO structure, elemental ratios close to nominal composition, and resistivity values consistent with bulk materials. These findings demonstrate that high power sputtering combined with ex situ annealing enables the production of NNCO thin films suitable for SOFC cathodes. The results support the potential of PVD based approaches for scalable fabrication of advanced SOFC components.

Title: Adaptive Pseudoboson Density-Matrix Renormalization Group for Dilute 2D Systems
Authors: Fabian J. Pauw, Thomas Köhler, Ulrich Schollwöck, Sebastian Paeckel
Abstract: Simulating strongly correlated systems in two dimensions is notoriously challenging due to rapid entanglement growth and frustration. Here, we introduce the adaptive projected-purified pseudoboson density-matrix renormalization group (A3P-DMRG) tailored to explore the ground states of dilute lattice models. The method compresses cluster Hilbert spaces by retaining only the most probable low-occupation Fock states, identified via probabilistic bounds and refined through a self-consistent mean-field basis optimization. We demonstrate that A3P-DMRG is advantageous in low-filling and weak-coupling regimes for large system sizes where conventional DMRG struggles. This establishes the method as a versatile tool for studying dilute quantum many-body systems relevant to ultra-cold atom quantum simulators, photonic lattices, Moiré materials and quantum chemistry.

Title: Dynamical metastability and transient topological magnons in interacting driven-dissipative magnetic systems
Authors: Vincent P. Flynn, Lorenza Viola, Benedetta Flebus
Abstract: Metastability, i.e., partial relaxation to long-lived, quasi-stationary states before true asymptotic equilibrium sets in, emerges ubiquitously in classical and quantum dynamical systems as a result of timescales separation. In open quantum systems, an intrinsically nonequilibrium analogue, dynamical metastability, can originate from the spectral geometry of a non-Hermitian operator. In noninteracting models, this mechanism produces boundary-sensitive anomalous relaxation, transient amplification, and topologically mandated long-lived edge modes, all of which are enhanced as system size grows. Here we extend dynamical metastability into the nonlinear, interacting regime and identify magnetic heterostructures as a natural platform for its exploration. We introduce an interacting spin Lindbladian whose linearized magnon dynamics map onto a dynamically metastable Hatano-Nelson chain, and show that dynamical metastability in the noninteracting limit seeds genuinely nonlinear phenomena, including size-dependent spin dipping and anomalous attraction to unstable equilibria. Long-lived edge states associated to topologically mandated Dirac bosons persist under nonlinearities and disorder. We further analyze the magnetization dynamics in magnetic multilayers within the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski framework, identifying Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, nonlocal damping, and spin-transfer torque as control parameters governing bulk-boundary stability mismatch and band topology. While all the distinctive dynamical phenomena previously identified reappear in this experimentally relevant setting, the LLGS framework also supports multistability and limit cycles that are absent in the quantum model. Our results constitute the first systematic study of dynamical metastability in nonlinear dynamics, directly relevant to spin-torque oscillator arrays, magnonic devices, and beyond.

Title: Exact dimer ground state and quantum phase transitions in a coupled spin ladder
Authors: Manas Ranjan Mahapatra, Rakesh Kumar
Abstract: Spin ladders are key models that act as intermediaries between one-dimensional and two-dimensional spin systems. In this study, we examine a coupled spin-$1/2$ ladder, where frustrated ladders with leg, rung, and diagonal interactions are linked through a horizontal coupling. By introducing a spatially anisotropic third-nearest-neighbor interaction along the horizontal direction, the model was found to possess an exact dimer ground state, characterized by a product of singlets forming a columnar dimer phase. The model is analyzed using bond-operator mean-field theory (BOMFT) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). BOMFT reveals three distinct phases: a double-stripe ordered phase, a Néel ordered phase, and a quantum disordered dimerized phase. The critical points for the transitions are $J_1 = -0.81$ (double-stripe to dimerized) and $J_1 = 2.81$ (dimerized to Néel phase). DMRG results corroborate the exact ground state and refine the critical points to $J_1 = -0.79$ and $J_1 = 2.29$ for the respective transitions. Additionally, another transition is identified as the Néel order vanishes for $J_1 > 4.5$. The static spin structure factor further corroborates the nature of the ordered phases.

Title: Evolutionary design of thermodynamic logic gates and their heat emission
Authors: Stephen Whitelam
Abstract: Landauer's principle bounds the heat generated by logical operations, but in practice the thermodynamic cost of computation is dominated by the control systems that implement logic. CMOS gates dissipate energy far above the Landauer bound, while laboratory demonstrations of near-Landauer erasure rely on external measurement or feedback systems whose energy costs exceed that of the logic operation by many orders of magnitude. Here we use simulations to show that a genetic algorithm can program a thermodynamic computer to implement logic operations in which the total heat emitted by the control system is of a similar order of magnitude to that of the information-bearing degrees of freedom. Moreover, the computer can be programmed so that heat is drawn away from the information-bearing degrees of freedom and dissipated within the control unit, suggesting the possibility of computing architectures in which heat management is an integral part of the program design.

Title: Eco-Friendly Supercapacitor Architecture Based on Cotton Textile Waste and Biopolymer-Based Electrodes
Authors: Luis Torres Quispe, Clemente Luyo Caycho, Javier Quino-Favero, Silvia Ponce, Abel Gutarra
Abstract: This study presents an eco-friendly and bio-based symmetric supercapacitor using cotton textile waste-derived hydrogels as electrolytes and chitosan-based carbon electrodes as metal-free charge-storage components. Cotton-derived hydrogels were synthesized via an alkaline dissolution-gelation route and modified with ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) to enhance ionic conductivity. The ionic modification increased the hydrogel conductivity from 17.1 to 37.8 mS cm^-1, confirming a nearly twofold improvement in ion transport efficiency. The resulting hydrogel exhibited improved thermal stability, homogeneous ionic transport, and strong polymer-ion interactions confirmed by FTIR and TGA analyses. In a symmetric device, the ion-modified hydrogel enables reduced equivalent series resistance, faster charge-transfer kinetics, and a short time constant (tau = 3.2 s), comparable to commercial energy-storage systems. After 1000 cycles, the device exhibits a 12.3% increase in specific capacitance, confirming stable proof-of-concept operation. Cycling leads to a moderate increase in R_ESR (18 to 22 ohm) and tau (3.2 to 4.1 s), indicating slower charge-ion redistribution. Notably, this R_ESR includes the contribution of the test-cell setup; in compact coin-type configurations, the resistance would be considerably lower. EIS reveals a concurrent rise in interfacial resistive terms, consistent with post-cycling hydrogel darkening and FTIR evidence of Fe-SCN coordination, suggesting that resistance buildup mainly originates from minor Fe-SCN interactions when the expelled liquid reaches the stainless-steel collector, rather than from loss of capacitive functionality. Overall, these results demonstrate the viability of cotton waste-derived hydrogels and chitosan-based electrodes as sustainable components for green energy storage, offering a recyclable and eco-friendly alternative to conventional systems.

Title: Hidden Density-Wave Instability in the Trimer Ruthenate Ba4Ru3O10
Authors: Gang Cao, Hengdi Zhao, Adrienne Bond, Tristan R. Cao, Gabriel Schebel, Arabella Quane, Yifei Ni, Yu Zhang, Logan Wall, Rahul Nandkishore, Pedro Schlottmann, Feng Ye
Abstract: We report a hidden density-wave instability in the trimer-based ruthenate Ba4Ru3O10, previously regarded as a pure antiferromagnet with a phase transition at TA=100 K. This transition is manifested in lattice parameters, transport, thermodynamics, and magnetic susceptibility, yet remains remarkably insensitive to magnetic fields up to at least 14 T, indicating an electronically driven reconstruction. At much lower temperatures T*= 20 K, charge transport becomes strongly nonlinear, exhibiting distinct depinning thresholds, negative differential resistance, pronounced current- and frequency-dependence, and slow collective dynamics in the Hertz range. While each feature is characteristic of density-wave transport, their simultaneous occurrence in an antiferromagnetic oxide is unprecedented. All nonlinear signatures vanish upon only 3% Ir substitution, which preserves the crystal structure and insulating state, ruling out Joule heating or extrinsic artifacts. The wide separation between the electronic reconstruction at TA and the emergence of nonlinear dynamics at T* identifies Ba4Ru3O10 as a rare correlated system hosting a strongly pinned collective electronic state intertwined with antiferromagnetism.

Title: Shunt-controlled resistive state of superconducting wires
Authors: Khalil Harrabi, Zain Alzoubi, Leonardo Cadorim, Milorad Milosevic
Abstract: The use of resistive shunts in superconducting electronics is vast and versatile, to dampen oscillations in junctions, stabilize switching behavior, aid current sensing, divert current during quenches, and protect both the superconductor and the circuit from damage. In single-photon detection by superconducting nanowires, the shunt is crucial for the timely relaxation of the sensor between the events to detect. Here we step out from the superconducting state and discuss the effect of the shunt resistor on the resistive state of a superconducting wire, at elevated currents still below the critical current for the transition to the normal state. We reveal how the shunt resistance controls the system dynamics and the onset of different resistive phases that include hot-spot and phase-slippage events. The accompanying dynamic current redistribution in the circuit also affects the local heating properties and additionally contributes to the control of the resistive state, particularly important at the elevated operation temperatures.

Title: A Minimal Nonlocal Theory of Thixotropic Flow
Authors: Saghar Zolfaghari, Safa Jamali
Abstract: Dense amorphous materials exhibit both nonlocal flow cooperativity and pronounced history dependence, yet existing continuum models capture only one of these features at a time. Nonlocal rheologies are intrinsically memoryless, while thixotropic models remain local. Here we introduce a coupling between structural memory and nonlocal fluidity to include aging and rejuvenation in nonlocal granular fluidity. The resulting model reproduces hysteresis in shear-rate sweeps and delayed yielding in creep, while preserving nonlocal flow profiles. By introducing memory augmented non local granular fluidity, MNGF, we show that nonlocality alone cannot encode history, and memory alone cannot encode spatial cooperativity, but their coupling is essential and minimal. These results demonstrate that memory and nonlocality must be treated jointly to describe history dependent flows, and provide a unified framework for modeling time-dependent rheology in dense amorphous materials.

Title: Trion transfer in mixed-dimensional heterostructures
Authors: N. Fang, U. Erkilic, Y. R. Chang, S. Fujii, D. Yamashita, C. F. Fong, S. Morito, K. Kanahashi, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, K. Ueno, K. Nagashio, Y. K. Kato
Abstract: Charged excitons, or trions, offering unique spin and charge degrees of freedom, have primarily been investigated in doped systems where charges are long considered indispensable. Here, we present an alternative route to ultra-efficient trion emission from an intrinsic, defect-free semiconductor via a transfer mechanism. By exciting trions in two-dimensional tungsten-diselenide donors and transferring them into one-dimensional carbon-nanotube acceptors in mixed-dimensional heterostructures, we circumvent the usual carrier requirement, overcoming intrinsic Auger-quenching limitations. Benefitting from a reservoir effect induced by dimensional heterogeneity, this process achieves trion emission efficiencies increased by over 100-fold compared to conventional doping-based approaches, and remains robust across diverse doping conditions. Our findings extend the exciton transfer paradigm to the three-body quasiparticles, offering a new platform for advancing excitonic physics and trion-based optoelectronic/spintronic applications.

Title: Metal hydrides achieve high-Tc superconductivity at low pressure by mimicking high-pressure H3S chemical bonding
Authors: Wendi Zhao, Shumin Guo, Chengda Li, Abhiyan Pandit, Tian Cui, Defang Duan, Maosheng Miao
Abstract: Compressed hydrides are promising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity, yet achieving simultaneous structural stability and high-Tc at low pressures remains challenging. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for accomplishing this goal by mimicking the bonding characteristics of high-pressure H3S within metal hydrides. Using Li3CuH4 as an example, its Cu-H covalent interaction effectively mimics the core function of the S-H bonding in H3S. This interaction not only induces a high hydrogen-derived electronic density of states at the Fermi level, but also softens the hydrogen phonon modes, thereby significantly enhancing the electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, embedding the strongly ionic Li3H lattice into the covalent Cu-H framework stabilizes the structure at significantly low pressures via a chemical-template effect, while maintaining high-Tc. Li3CuH4 exhibits excellent thermodynamic stability at 20 GPa, with a Tc of 39.25 K at 12 GPa. Further comprehensive high-throughput studies on Li3MH4 (M = transition metal) compounds uncover general principles applicable to a broader range of compounds. This work establishes a new paradigm for the simultaneous optimization of the stability and high-temperature superconductivity of metal hydrides through complementary sublattice interactions, thus advancing the search for practical and viable superconducting materials.

Title: Altermagnetism, ARPES, symmetry, non-relativistic band splitting
Authors: Jiayu Liu, Xun Ma, Xinnuo Zhang, Wenchuan Jing, Zhengtai Liu, Dawei Shen
Abstract: Altermagnetism arises from composite real-space and spin-space symmetries, combining zero net magnetization with pronounced momentum-dependent spin splitting. This review highlights the pivotal role of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), along with its spin-resolved (SARPES) and circular-dichroism (CD-ARPES) variants, in directly visualizing nonrelativistic band splitting and spin textures in altermagnets. Within the spin-group framework, we distinguish ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic orders and elucidate the symmetry origin of spin polarization. We then systematically review representative systems: the debated d-wave prototype RuO2, layered d-wave altermagnets KV2Se2O and Rb1-delta V2Te2O, and a series of g-wave compounds including MnTe (domain-tunable) and CrSb (topological), together with the noncoplanar antiferromagnet MnTe2 and other emerging candidate platforms. Overall, ARPES has become a key probe for resolving symmetry-driven spin splitting. Future advances in micro/nano-beam and in-situ spectroscopies, combined with strain and domain engineering, heterostructure design, and exploration of broader unconventional magnetic states, are expected to drive the joint evolution of altermagnetism and photoemission spectroscopy, paving the way for spintronic and correlated quantum research.

Title: Josephson-like magnetic tunnel junction -- transition from classical to quantum regime
Authors: V.V.Yurlov, P.N. Skirdkov, K.A. Zvezdin, A.K. Zvezdin
Abstract: We theoretically propose and analyze a Josephson-like magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structure that exhibits quantum spin dynamics analogous to those in superconducting Josephson junctions. By exploiting the isomorphism between the equations of motion for low-dissipation MTJs with easy-plane anisotropy and the Josephson phase dynamics, we construct a theoretical framework for realizing spintronic qubits. Within this framework, we identify the physical parameters -- such as anisotropy constants, Gilbert damping, spin current amplitude, and geometric factors -- that govern the transition from classical to quantum behavior. We show that different types of spintronic qubits, including analogs of charge, flux, and transmon superconducting qubits, can be implemented depending on the hierarchy of energy scales. A Hamiltonian formalism is developed for each regime, enabling an analytical treatment of the two-level quantum dynamics and estimation of coherence times. In particular, we demonstrate that the spin current can be used not only to excite but also to stabilize the qubit states through dissipation control. These findings provide a route toward integrating spintronic qubits into CMOS-compatible architectures and lay the groundwork for a fully spintronic platform for quantum computation.

Title: Electronic Structure of Multilayer Graphene with Arbitrary Stackings
Authors: Fred Sun, Jia-An Yan
Abstract: Stacking geometry in multilayer graphene (MLG) provides an interesting degree of freedom to engineer its electronic structure near the Fermi level, wherein the linear bands in single layer graphene could retain or evolve into parabolic or flat bands. Using a tight-binding model, we carried out a detailed analytical analysis of the electronic band structures for arbitrarily stacked MLGs. We show that their low energy band dispersions near the Fermi level may be deduced from its substacks in isolation. The analytical solutions of the momenta with zero eigenvalue for an AA stacking allows us to generalize the results of the zero energy momenta for arbitrarily stacked MLGs. Moreover, we find that an interplay of parallel and rhombohedral stackings allows for flat band engineering and enhancement in arbitrarily stacked MLGs. The existence of flat bands in MLGs might offer another interesting platform for exploring the superconductivity in graphene systems beyond the twisted bilayer graphene.

Title: Magnonic spontaneous oscillation induced by parametric pumping
Authors: Yi Li, Carissa Kiehl, Jinho Lim, Cliff Abbott, Pratap K. Pal, Alex J. Szymczak, Juliang Li, Ralu Divan, Clarence L. Chang, Charudatta Phatak, Dmytro A. Bozhko, Axel Hoffmann, Valentine Novosad
Abstract: Spontaneous dynamic systems have attracted significant attention for their rich underlying physics such as phase-locking and synchronization. In this work, we report a new mechanism of generating magnetic spontaneous oscillation via parametric pumping. By applying a pump tone to excite propagating spin waves in a yttrium iron garnet delay line, four-wave mixing converts the pump mode into two phase-autonomous propagating magnon modes, i.e. a spontaneous mode with nearly twice the wavenumber of the pump mode and an idler mode with nearly zero wavenumber. This allows us to reliably generate ultrasharp spin wave dynamics with broad frequency tunability from the pump and magnetic field. We show that the spontaneous mode can be phase-locked to a probe tone, similar to an auto-oscillator. Furthermore, the spontaneous dynamics can be used to implement a high-gain magnonic parametric amplifier with a gain up to 40 dB. Our results open a new avenue for studying nonlinear magnonics and synchronization physics in propagating magnon geometry and for developing new magnonic devices.

Title: Anisotropic Core-Shell Swift Heavy Ion Tracks in beta-Ga2O3
Authors: Huan He, Jiayu Liang, Shaowei He, Yanwen Zhang, Jiahui Zhang, Ziqi Cai, Tan Shi, Hang Zang, Flyura Djurabekova, Chaohui He, Junlei Zhao
Abstract: Swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation generates nanoscale ion tracks through intense electronic excitation, yet the microscopic mechanisms governing their morphology and phase stability in low symmetry oxides remain poorly understood. Here, a multiscale atomistic simulation framework is employed to investigate SHI-induced track formation and recovery in monoclinic beta-Ga2O3 over a wide range of electronic energy losses (Se) and crystallographic orientations. A sequence of distinct structural responses is identified with increasing Se: complete lattice recovery at low Se, recrystallization into a metastable gamma-Ga2O3 phase at intermediate Se, and the formation of core-shell ion tracks at high Se, consisting of an amorphous core surrounded by a recrystallized gamma-phase shell. Despite the essentially isotropic initial energy deposition, the final ion-track morphology exhibits pronounced crystallographic anisotropy, governed by orientation-dependent recovery dynamics. The superior recrystallization along [010] direction is attributed to its exceptionally high elastic stiffness. Notably, SHI irradiation perpendicular to the (100) plane induces a more severe structural response at low Se (less than 10 keV/nm), however, at higher Se, it yields a smaller residual ion track compared with the other orientations. The simulated ion-track sizes show excellent quantitative agreement with available experimental measurements over a broad range of Se values. These findings establish a unified atomic-scale picture of core-shell track formation and anisotropic recovery in beta-Ga2O3.

Title: Ballistic transport in nanodevices based on single-crystalline Cu thin film
Authors: Yongjin Cho, Su Jae Kim, Min-Hyoung Jung, Yousil Lee, Hu Young Jeong, Young-Min Kim, Hu-Jong Lee, Seong-Gon Kim, Se-Young Jeong, Gil-Ho Lee
Abstract: In ballistic transport, the movement of charged carriers is essentially unimpeded by scattering events. In this limit, microscopic parameters such as crystal momentum, spin and quantum phases are well conserved, allowing electrons to maintain their quantum coherence over longer distances. Nanoscale materials, like carbon nanotubes, graphene, and nanowires, exhibit ballistic transport. However, their scalability in devices is significantly limited. While deposited metal films offer excellent scalability for nanodevices, achieving ballistic transport in these films poses a challenge due to their short electronic mean free path. Here, we investigated the electronic transport in cross-geometry devices fabricated with 90 nm-thick copper films without grain boundaries. We observed ballistic transport in devices with channel width smaller than 150 nm below 85 K by measuring negative bend resistance. Our findings would open the opportunity for probing intrinsic quantum properties of Cu, and for realizing scalable low-loss signal transmission and high-quality interconnects in semiconductor devices.

Title: Evolution of magnetic correlation in doped Hubbard model with altermagnetic spin splitting
Authors: Yinlong Li, Rana Imran Mushtaq, Ji Liu, Wing Chi Yu, Xiaosen Yang, Cho-Tung Yip, Ho-Kin Tang
Abstract: The evolution of magnetic correlation in strongly correlated electron systems with altermagentic spin splitting remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate how spin splitting generated by spin-dependent next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$ reshapes the Fermi surface nesting and van Hove singularities in the two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model, leading evolution of magnetic instabilities. Using the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method, we find the dominant magnetic correlation as functions of the filling and $t'/t$ by computing the momentum-resolved spin structure factor. The analysis reveals a transition from antiferromagnetic $(\pi,\pi)$ order in the isotropic, half-filled system to non-collinear spiral $(\pi,q)$ order upon increasing the spin-dependent anisotropy or doping away from half-filling, ultimately entering a short-range correlation regime where stripe and spiral correlation coexist. These findings highlight a possible route to realizing spiral correlation in altermagnetic systems, potentially providing a platform for spintronic devices that exploit non-collinear spin textures.

Title: Operationalizing the Arrow of Time in mesoscopic: A Unified Framework for Non-equilibrium Matter
Authors: Yikun Ren, Feixiang Xu, Ming Lin
Abstract: What sustains a non-equilibrium system against fluctuations from within - as witnessed in non-equilibrium steady states, glassy relaxation, and even living organisms? Here we show that the arrow of time itself can be operationalized into a measurable physical quantity on mesoscopic particles - the eigen-phase displacement. This displacement gives rise to a non-local generalized force, the thermodynamic inertia force, which emerges from the integrated contribution of local constraints rather than as a conventional local force. It actively counteracts fluctuations and its algebraic structure is a semi-group, fundamentally distinct from the Lie group of Newton inertia, thereby encoding the irreversibility of time's arrow. Building on this foundation, we construct a unified Microstate-Sequence-Mode-Coupling (MSS-MCT) theory. Its thermodynamic limit is defined by Microstate Sequence (MSS) theory, and its dynamical action is captured by a consequent mode-coupling theory (MCT). From this single first-principles framework, we simultaneously resolve two long-standing puzzles: it predicts the giant non-Gaussian parameter(1~10), closing the order-of-magnitude gap with experiments that standard mode-coupling theory could not explain; and it delivers a first-principles, non-fitting derivation of the universal polymer constant $C_{1} \approx 16.7$ with merely 1 percent error - the most accurate theoretical prediction to date, dramatically surpassing the Adam-Gibbs and others. Our work establishes thermodynamic inertia as a foundational principle for non-equilibrium matter, bridging thermodynamic and dynamic descriptions from glassy relaxation to the maintenance of life.

Title: Localized-basis formulation of interacting Hamiltonians in flat topological bands: coherent states and coherent-like states for fractional physics
Authors: Nobuyuki Okuma
Abstract: In topological bands, it is impossible to construct exponentially localized Wannier functions while preserving the symmetries. Instead, in quantum Hall systems, one can define an overcomplete basis of spatially localized coherent states. In this work, we propose a unified framework for understanding the quantum Hall effect and Chern insulators from the perspective of localized bases, by extending the overcomplete basis of coherent states to Chern bands in terms of coherent-like states. Specifically, by representing both coherent states and coherent-like states as wave packets defined on a band, the difference between them can be encoded solely in the functional form of the wave packet in momentum space. Furthermore, for filling factor $\nu=1/3$, we define a local repulsive interaction Hamiltonian based on these bases and discuss properties of its ground states. In particular, by relating this Hamiltonian to previously studied models, we show that in quantum Hall systems it possesses exactly zero-energy ground states with topological degeneracy, thereby confirming that it serves as a model for fractional quantum Hall systems. In addition, we numerically verify that the Hamiltonian possesses topological degeneracy for representative Chern insulator models. An advantage of this formulation is that it allows fractional quantum Hall systems and various fractional Chern insulator systems to be discussed within a unified framework using the same Hamiltonian form. In addition, we discuss that coherent-like states can also be defined in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators. Corresponding to the fermionic time-reversal symmetry of the system, Kramers-degenerate coherent-like states can be naturally defined. The localized basis constructed from coherent-like states is expected to be useful for describing strongly correlated topological phases in flat-band systems.

Title: Disorder-Induced Topological Phases in a Two-Dimensional Chern Insulator with Strong Magnetic Disorder
Authors: Devesh Vaish, Michael Potthoff
Abstract: Strong directional disorder in local magnetic moments coupled to a Chern insulator gives rise to topological phases that cannot be continuously connected to the clean limit and are therefore genuinely disorder-driven. We demonstrate this in a spinful Qi-Wu-Zhang model of a two-dimensional Chern insulator coupled to disordered classical spins of unit length. The topological phase diagram is computed numerically using two complementary approaches: twisted boundary conditions and the topological Hamiltonian technique. Our results show that strong disorder can act as a fundamental topological mechanism rather than merely a perturbation. For strong exchange coupling, tuning the mass parameter reveals a transition between phases with different Chern numbers $C$. Remarkably, this transition is driven by zeros, rather than poles, of the disorder-averaged Green's function crossing the chemical potential, and has no analogue in any clean system. We further identify a strong-coupling phase with $C = 0$ that is nonetheless topologically nontrivial, characterized by a distinct Chern number $C^{(\mathrm{S})} \neq 0$ over the manifold of classical spin configurations. This phase is also disorder-driven, as $C^{(\mathrm{S})} = 0$ in the clean limit.

Title: Quantitative models for excess carrier diffusion and recombination in STEM-EBIC experiments on semiconductor nanostructures
Authors: Tobias Meyer, Christoph Flathmann, David A. Ehrlich, Patrick Paap-Peretzki, Jonas Lindner, Christian Jooß, Michael Seibt
Abstract: The increased complexity and reduced size of (opto-)electronic devices demands for quantitative descriptions of excess carrier transport and recombination via various mechanisms. In addition, experimental methods capable of resolving carrier dynamics on the nanometer scale are required. In this paper, we present a quantitative model of a confined geometry including recombination at two surfaces, which is very generic for electron beam induced current measurements in a scanning transmission electron microscope - a method which offers atomic scale spatial resolution. The model is based on analytical considerations as well as finite element simulations and underlying assumptions are subjected to an in-depth discussion. Finally, the successfull application to experimental data obtained on the complex oxide SrTi0.995Nb0.005O3 demonstrates the practicality and robustness of the approach, which enables the precise determination of its bulk diffusion length of L = 10.2 +- 0.1 nm.

Title: Polar unidirectional magnetotransport in $p-$type tellurene from quantum geometry
Authors: Claudio Iacovelli, Pierpaolo Fontana, Victor Velasco, Chang Niu, Peide D. Ye, Marcus V. O. Moutinho, Caio Lewenkopf, Marcello B. Silva Neto
Abstract: Unidirectional magnetoresistance, or electric magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA), is a nonlinear magnetotransport phenomenon that arises in noncentrosymmetric conductors , where changes in resistance $R(B)$ are: (i) chiral, $\Delta R(B)/R(0)=2\,\chi\, {\bf I}\cdot{\bf B}$, or (ii) polar, $\Delta R(B)/R(0)=2\,\gamma\, {\bf I}\cdot({\bf P}\times{\bf B})$, with eMChA coefficients $\chi$ and $\gamma$. In [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 106602 (2025)], we showed that the eMChA in the conduction band of tellurene is polar ($\chi=0$, $\gamma\neq 0$) and emerges from the quantum metric dipole due to its Weyl node and from the lone pair polarization ${\bf P}$. Here, we extend our work to the valence band of tellurene, where the eMChA is usually said to be chiral ($\chi \neq 0, \gamma = 0$). We show that also a polar coefficient $\gamma \neq 0$ emerges naturally through a downfolding procedure, in which remote Weyl-node containing bands induce momentum-space gradients of the quantum metric in the low-energy levels, activating finite metric dipoles. Combining semiclassical Boltzmann transport with a ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ description of tellurene, our numerical calculations agree quantitatively with doping ($\mu$) dependent second-harmonic measurements of the longitudinal voltage $V^{2\omega}_\parallel(\mu)$ in perpendicular field. The combined chiral and polar characters ($\chi\neq0, \gamma\neq 0)$ of the eMChA in tellurene also explains the shift in the angular ($\phi$) dependence of $V^{2\omega}_\parallel(\phi)$ for in plane fields. Our results demonstrate that the polar eMChA can arise in topologically trivial bands through multiband effects and establishes tellurene as a platform for quantum-geometric rectification in both electron and hole regimes.

Title: MLIP-MC: A Framework for Adsorption Simulations using Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Connor W. Edwards, Fengxu Yang, Konstantin Stracke, Jack D. Evans
Abstract: Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are essential for screening metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for gas adsorption, yet their accuracy is limited by underlying interatomic potentials. Universal machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), trained on diverse chemical datasets, promise zero-shot prediction without system-specific training. We introduce MLIP-MC, an open-source Python framework to conduct GCMC simulations with MLIPs, and use this framework to benchmark a series of universal models, including MACE-MP-0, ORB-v3, and fairchem ODAC, for CO2 adsorption on ZIF-8, ZIF-4, and Mg-MOF-74. All universal models exhibit systematic biases, consistently over- or underestimating adsorption energetics. Crucially, accuracy depends on training data composition: only models trained on MOF-adsorbate interactions achieve reasonable agreement with a density functional theory derived reference. Errors grow linearly with CO2 uptake, reflecting compounding inaccuracies in adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. Our results demonstrate that current universal MLIPs require finetuning for quantitative adsorption predictions and demonstrate the power of MLIP-MC to rapidly test models.

Title: Interplay between non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermiticity: A multi-method study of non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo model
Authors: Wei-Zhu Yi, Yun Chen, Jun-Jun Pang, Hong Chen, Baigeng Wang, Rui Wang
Abstract: Non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo problems host both non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermitian physics, which provide a prototypical model to explore exotic collective quantum phenomena driven by the two different ingredients. Here, we first propose an experimental setup that realizes this model with exact channel symmetry as well as a controllable PT symmetry. Then, we perform a multi-method study of this model, focusing on the low-energy spectrum, the thermodynamic quantities, and the transport properties associated with different fixed points. Using the Bethe ansatz approach, we identify existence of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov-like state previously found in the non-Hermitian single-channel Kondo model. Then, based on non-Hermitian numerical renormalization group calculations, we reveal clear numerical signatures of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state emerging in the relatively strong non-Hermiticity regime of the PT-asymmetric model. Furthermore, our boundary conformal field theory, which is found to be applicable for the PT-symmetric model, uncovers an anomalous temperature dependence of the Kondo conductance, which is beyond conventional Hermitian Kondo systems.

Title: Coulomb Interaction in Atomically Thin Semiconductors and Density-Independent Exciton-Scattering Processes
Authors: Henry Mittenzwey, Andreas Knorr, Thorsten Deilmann
Abstract: In quantum-kinetic approaches to the dynamics of Coulomb-bound many-body correlations such as excitons, trions, biexcitons or higher-order correlations, a detailed knowledge of the many-body Coulomb Hamiltonian serving as a starting point is important. In this manuscript, the second-quantized description of the Coulomb interaction between Bloch electrons in a Heisenberg-equation-of-motion approach in atomically thin semiconductors is derived and reviewed. Emphasis is put on a discussion of Umklapp processes and the dielectric screening including all local-field effects. A link between \textit{ab initio} methods of screening and few-band models in effective-mass approximations for the quantum kinetics is established and all important Coulomb scattering processes contributing to the exciton energy landscape and density-independent exciton scattering are discussed.

Title: Non-monotonic Irreversibility in Polytropic Steering
Authors: Cong Fu, Youhui Lin, Shanhe Su, Yu-Han Ma
Abstract: The efficient manipulation of thermodynamic states within the finite time is fundamentally constrained by the intrinsic dissipative cost. While the slow-driving regime is well-characterized by a universal $1/\tau$-scaling of irreversibility, the physics governing fast, non-adiabatic transitions remains elusive. Here, we propose the polytropic steering protocols that provide an exact analytical bridge between the isothermal and adiabatic limits for Brownian particles far-from-equilibrium. We demonstrate that for any protocol duration $\tau$, the system can be precisely steered along a prescribed polytropic trajectory, revealing a striking non-monotonic dependence of irreversibility on the driving rate. Contrary to the near-equilibrium paradigm where faster driving necessitates higher energetic costs, we identify a most-irreversible timescale, beyond which dissipation is anomalously suppressed by rapid driving. By mapping these protocols onto a broad class of controllable thermodynamic cycle, we establish power-efficiency tradeoffs and position the polytropic index as a genuine thermodynamic control knob for the rational design of high-speed, high-performance microscopic thermal machines.

Title: Relativistic spin-momentum locking in ferromagnets
Authors: Xujia Gong, Amar Fakhredine, Carmine Autieri
Abstract: The relativistic spin-momentum locking has been proven in time-reversal-breaking classes of materials with zero net magnetization in the non-relativistic limit, such as altermagnets and other non-collinear magnets. Using density functional theory calculations, we aim to show relativistic spin-momentum locking in ferromagnets, focusing on a broad class of ferromagnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry, and compare with fcc Ni. In SrRuO3, the antisymmetric exchange interaction produces a spin canting orthogonal to the easy axis, while in all other cases, spin canting is forbidden. Even when the canted magnetic moment in real space is forbidden, relativistic spin-momentum locking shows sizable contributions in k-space. Using prototypical ferromagnets such as orthorhombic SrRuO3, hexagonal CrTe and CrAs with the NiAs crystal structure, half-Heusler MnPtSb, and fcc Ni, we demonstrate that relativistic spin-momentum locking can generate strong effects in ferromagnets. Subdominant components of centrosymmetric ferro-magnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry host spin-momentum locking similar to altermagnets, while noncentrosymmetric MnPtSb hosts relativistic p-wave due to the spin-orbit coupling. Fcc Ni shows a more complex behavior with a combination of two spin-momentum locking patterns characteristic of altermagnets. Because ferromagnets typically have larger bandwidths than altermagnets, they provide a promising platform for observing even-wave relativistic spin-momentum locking and associated emergent phenomena. From an application standpoint, relativistic spin-momentum locking governs symmetry-allowed spin Hall currents, spin photocurrents, and other momentum-dependent spin responses in k-space.

Title: Measuring Spin-Charge Separation by an Off-diagonal Dissipative Response
Authors: Liang Tong, Shi Chen, Yu Chen
Abstract: Fractionalization of symmetry - exemplified by spin-charge separation in the 1D Hubbard model and fractional charges in the fractional quantum Hall effect - is a typical strongly correlated phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite the success in measuring velocity differences, however, it is still quite challenging in probing emergent excitations' anomalous dimensions experimentally. We propose a off-diagonal dissipative response protocol, leveraging dissipative response theory (DRT), to directly detect spin-charge separation. By selectively dissipating spin-$\downarrow$ particles and measuring the spin-$\uparrow$ response, we uncover a universal temporal signature: the off-diagonal response exhibits a crossover from cubic-in-time ($t^3$) growth at short times to linear-in-time ($t$) decay at long times. Crucially, the coefficients $\varkappa^s$ (short-time) and $\varkappa^l$ (long-time) encode the distinct anomalous dimensions and velocities of spinons and holons, providing unambiguous evidence of fractionalization. This signal vanishes trivially without spin-charge separation. Our predictions, verified numerically via tDMRG, with microscopic parameters linking with Luttinger parameters by Bethe ansatz, establish off-diagonal dissipative response as a probe of quantum fractionalization in synthetic quantum matter.

Title: Tuning magnetic, lattice, and transport properties in CoNb3S6 via Fe doping
Authors: Deepu Kumar, Joydev Khatua, Mukesh Suthar, Rajesh Kumar Ulaganathan, Jeonghun Kang, Hengbo Cui, Sihun Seong, Seo Hyoung Chang, Kee Hoon Kim, Raman Sankar, Maeng-Je Seong, Kwang-Yong Choi
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the effects of Fe doping on the lattice dynamics, magnetic ordering, and magneto-transport properties of the intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnets Co1-xFexNb3S6 (x = 0.1 and 0.3). Temperature- and polarization-dependent Raman scattering measurements reveal a pronounced blue shift of the 180 cm-1 phonon mode with increasing Fe concentration, indicating enhanced sensitivity of lattice vibrations to Fe-induced structural and mass effects. While the temperature evolution of the phonon modes is dominated by conventional anharmonic phonon softening, subtle anomalies observed near the Néel temperature for x = 0.1 point to weak spin-phonon coupling. Electrical transport and magnetic susceptibility data show clear signatures of the antiferromagnetic phase transitions at TN ~ 20.5-23.7 K for x = 0.1 and TN ~ 32.0 K for x = 0.3. Out-of-plane magnetization measurements reveal hysteretic behavior with two field-induced transitions for x =0.1, which evolve into a single hysteresis loop at x =0.3, signaling a subtle reconstruction of the magnetic ground state. Magneto-transport measurements for x = 0.1 further display a butterfly-shaped hysteretic magnetoresistance and a weak topological Hall effect; however, both features are strongly suppressed at x = 0.3. These results illustrate the critical role of Fe-induced magnetic structure reconstruction in fine-tuning topological and magnetic transport phenomena in intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnets.

Title: Non-Hermiticity Induced Universal Anomalies in Kondo Conductance
Authors: Wei-Zhu Yi, Yun Chen, Jun-Jun Pang, Hong Chen, Baigeng Wang, Rui Wang
Abstract: Strong correlation, when combined with dissipation in open systems, can lead to a variety of exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we study nontrivial interplays between non-Fermi liquid behaviors emerging from strong correlation and non-Hermiticity arising from open systems. We propose a practical physical setup that realizes a non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo model. We identify a weak-coupling local moment fixed point and a strong-coupling non-Fermi liquid fixed point under PT symmetry, both are enriched by the non-Hermitian effect. Remarkably, universal unconventional Kondo conductance behaviors are found for both cases, which are distinct from all previously studied Kondo systems. Particularly, we show that an anomalous upturn of conductance could take place with increasing the temperature, originating from the interplay between non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermiticity. Our results identify a novel class of transport phenomena unrecognized before, driven by intertwined effects of correlation and dissipation.

Title: Quantitative measurements of the lift force acting on a sphere sliding along a liquid-liquid interface
Authors: Hao Zhang, Zaicheng Zhang, Abdelhamid Maali
Abstract: This work explores the lift force experienced by a particle moving in a viscous fluid near a liquid-liquid interface. The lift force is induced by the interaction between the viscous flow generated by the particle's motion and the deformation of the soft interface. The factors influencing the lift force including the velocity, the viscosity, and the sphere radius, and the separation distance were systematically studied. The experiments demonstrate that the lift force intensifies as the particle approaches the interface, and saturates at shorter distances. These findings are consistent with predictions made using soft lubrication theory and numerical calculations, providing strong validation for the theoretical framework.

Title: Ion Implantation Enhanced Nucleation Facilitates Heat Transport across Atomically-Sharp Semiconductor Interfaces
Authors: Jinwen Liu, Zifeng Huang, Lina Yang, Yachao Zhang, Xingqiang Zhang, Kun Zhang, Xufei Guo, Yuxiang Wang, Hong Zhou, Jincheng Zhang, Wei Wang, Yue Hao, Zhe Cheng
Abstract: Overheating is a critical bottleneck limiting the performance and reliability of next-generation high-power and high-frequency electronics. Interfacial thermal resistance constitutes a significant portion of the total thermal resistance. In this study, we report an ultrahigh thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of approximately 800 MW/m2-K at the atomically-sharp AlN-SiC interface, achieved through an ion implantation-enhanced nucleation epitaxy technique. This value is among the highest TBC values reported for semiconductor interfaces, confirmed by structural characterizations which show an ultrahigh-quality interface. Atomistic Green Function calculations reveal that elastic phonon transmission dominates the interface, with nearly half of the acoustic modes (0-15 THz) exhibiting near-unity transmission due to the atomically sharp structure. Furthermore, using high-energy-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, we probe vibrational properties with nanometer spatial resolution and identify unique interfacial phonon modes connecting the mismatched phonon spectra, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. The ultrahigh TBC is attributed to both the high elastic phonon transmission due to the high quality interfaces and the inelastic phonon scattering channel due to interfacial phonon modes. These findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of interfacial thermal transport but also provide a pathway for effective thermal management in emerging electronic devices.

Title: Influence of Disorder on Exciton Transfer in a Quantum Dot Chain with Short-Range Interaction and a Side-Coupled Defect
Authors: Aleksey Vlasov, Pavel Golovinski
Abstract: This paper considers the propagation of excitons in linear chains of QDs with a side defect, located on a dielectric substrate. This configuration is suitable for spatially selective excitation of the system by pulsed optical radiation through the side defect. The dynamics of excitation in the chain is governed by structural disorder, caused by technological variations in the parameters of the QDs themselves and their mutual arrangement. To describe the quantum properties of excitons in the QD chain, a model Hamiltonian is used, taking into account the coupling of neighboring QDs due to dipole-dipole interaction. The localization of stationary states is calculated depending on the magnitude of disorder and the chain length. A criterion is introduced that determines the boundaries of the phase transition from the localized to the delocalized excitation phase. The dynamics of exciton transfer along the QD chain is calculated depending on its length and degree of disorder for linear excitation of the system by a laser pulse. It is shown that dynamic localization emerging in the system corresponds to the stationary localization properties of the states of the chain with a side defect.

Title: Non-exponential relaxation without dynamic heterogeneity in van der Waals liquids above the melting point
Authors: Rolf Zeißler, Niklas Pfeiffer, Thomas Blochowicz
Abstract: We investigate the influence of dynamic heterogeneity on the spectral shape of structural relaxation in van der Waals liquids above the melting point by means of depolarized dynamic light scattering. To this end, we study optically anisotropic probe molecules both in the bulk and when diluted in an optically isotropic solvent. Strikingly, the relaxation shape of the probe molecules in dilution is indistinguishable from that of the pure liquid composed of the probe molecules. By contrast, when explicit dynamic heterogeneity is introduced, e.g., through internal degrees of freedom or a distribution of probe molecule sizes, the relaxation shape becomes sensitive to the solvent concentration. These findings indicate that dynamic heterogeneity has a negligible influence on the rotational dynamics of single component van der Waals liquids above the melting point, despite the pronounced non-exponential character of their relaxation shape.

Title: From interface-limited to Auger-dominated carrier dynamics in $π$-SnS

Abstract: Metastable cubic tin(II) sulfide ($\pi$-SnS) is an earth-abundant semiconductor whose three-dimensionally bonded chiral lattice may overcome the short minority-carrier lifetime of orthorhombic SnS while maintaining a near-ideal bandgap for tandem photovoltaics. Despite its promise, ultrafast carrier cooling and recombination mechanisms over illumination density remain poorly constrained. We use core-level extreme-ultraviolet attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy at the Sn $4d$ edge to track carrier injection, cooling, and recombination in $\pi$-SnS with element- and orbital-specific sensitivity. Following femtosecond near-infrared excitation, the Sn $4d\rightarrow$CB onset exhibits conduction-band state filling and a carrier-induced edge shift, enabling extraction of density-dependent kinetics. The transient response follows a biexponential decay with a fast hot-carrier cooling component and a slower recombination component. At low carrier densities, recombination is consistent with interface-limited processes, whereas above $\sim1\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ both cooling and recombination accelerate, indicating a crossover to carrier-carrier interaction-dominated dynamics. Coherent phonon oscillations with a period of $\sim188$ fs reveal coupling between electronic excitation and lattice motion. These results provide a comprehensive picture of nonequilibrium carrier and phonon dynamics in cubic SnS, reveal a change of mechanisms over a range of carrier densities, and establish the value of using attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to study ultrafast processes in complex semiconductors that have optoelectronic and energy-conversion applications.

Title: Machine Learning-integrated Multiscale Simulation Framework: Bridging Scales in Associative Polymer-Colloid Suspensions
Authors: Jalal Abdolahi, Dominic M. Robe, Ronald G. Larson, Elnaz Hajizadeh
Abstract: Predicting the rheological behavior of associative polymers bridging colloidal particles into transient networks is fundamentally challenging because the coupled spatiotemporal scales prevent efficient molecular-fidelity modeling. We address this through a novel, unified multiscale simulation framework for telechelic polymer-colloid suspensions integrating: explicit-chain Brownian dynamics resolving polymer-particle association kinetics; active learning metamodels compressing kinetics into efficient surrogates; and Population Balance-Brownian Dynamics (Pop-BD) computing network-scale dynamics from metamodel predictions. Validated against explicit-chain Brownian dynamics, our framework accurately reproduces time-and frequency-dependent stress relaxation moduli, enabling simulations of larger systems over longer timescales. Systematic investigations reveal that network connectivity exhibits critical transitions at specific chain-to-particle ratios, with bond density and lifetime correlating to enhanced relaxation times and moduli. Higher particle volume fractions yield more persistent bonds and slower relaxation. This framework connects chain-level dynamics to macroscopic rheology, enabling computationally efficient rational design of associative colloidal materials for waterborne coatings and soft-matter applications.

Title: Bulk-boundary correspondence in topological two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems: Toeplitz operators and singular values
Authors: J. Sirker
Abstract: In contrast to eigenvalue-based approaches, we formulate the bulk-boundary correspondence for two-dimensional non-Hermitian quadratic lattice Hamiltonians in terms of Toeplitz operators and singular values, which correctly capture the stability, localization, and scaling of edge and corner modes. We show that singular values, rather than eigenvalues, provide the only stable foundation for topological protection in non-Hermitian systems because they remain robust under translational-symmetry-breaking perturbations that destabilize the eigenvalue spectrum, rendering it unsuitable for topological classification. Building on Toeplitz operator theory, we establish general results for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians defined on half and quarter planes, relating the topological indices of the associated Toeplitz operators to the number of finite-size singular values that are separated from the bulk singular-value spectrum and vanish in the thermodynamic limit. This yields a precise bulk-boundary correspondence for edge and corner modes, including higher-order topological phases, without requiring crystalline symmetries. We illustrate our general results with detailed examples exhibiting topologically protected families of edge states, coexisting edge and corner modes, and phases with both gapped bulk and edges supporting only stable corner modes. The latter is exemplified by a non-Hermitian generalization of the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model.

Title: Ultrasensitive strain modulation of terahertz magnons at a magnetic phase transition
Authors: Lichen Wang, Sajna Hameed, Yiran Liu, Manuel Knauft, Kazuki Higuchi, Maximilian Krautloher, Sonia Francoual, Giniyat Khaliullin, Huimei Liu, Matteo Minola, Bernhard Keimer
Abstract: Antiferromagnets typically host spin-wave (magnon) excitations in the terahertz (THz) regime, offering a promising platform for high-speed magnonic information technologies. Harnessing these excitations requires sensitive control of their spectral properties. Here we use resonant x-ray diffraction and Raman scattering to demonstrate uniaxial-strain control of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state and THz magnon excitations in the layered Mott insulator Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Although the states separated by the strain-induced phase transition differ only by the sign of the weak and partially frustrated interlayer interaction, their magnon energies differ by more than 10% (~ 0.3 THz). Our theoretical analysis explains this surprising observation by tracing the origin of both the sign reversal of the interlayer coupling and the magnon energy to the spin-orbital composition of the Ru valence electrons. The extreme strain sensitivity of the THz magnon energy near a magnetic phase transition opens up pathways towards a new generation of transition-edge magnonic devices.

Title: Unified Phase-Field Framework for Antiferroelectric, Ferroelectric and Dielectric Phases: Application to HZO Thin Films
Authors: P. Pankaj, Sandeep Sugathan, Si Joon Kim, Pil-Ryung Cha
Abstract: Polycrystalline hafnia-based thin films exhibit mixed ferroelectric (FE), antiferroelectric (AFE), and dielectric (DE) behavior, with switching characteristics strongly influenced by microstructure and phase distribution. Here, we develop a unified grain-resolved three-dimensional phase-field framework for metal-insulator-metal capacitors that simultaneously captures ferroic phase characteristics in realistic polycrystalline microstructures by explicitly incorporating grain topology and crystallographic orientation. Antipolar sublattice kinetics are represented via the coupled evolution of macroscopic and staggered polarization order parameters. All thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are calibrated to experimental P-E hysteresis loops and held fixed across all simulations. The results show that phase fractions primarily determine hysteresis character, while vertical segregation of AFE- and FE-rich regions systematically reduces the effective coercive field (Ec) under identical electrical loading. Grain-resolved analysis reveals that this reduction arises from microstructure-assisted switching pathways and electrostatic coupling between layers. These findings demonstrate that vertical phase arrangement provides a viable strategy to engineer switching behavior in hafnia-based ferroic capacitors and highlight the importance of explicit microstructural resolution for quantitative phase-field modeling.

Title: Phason-Driven Diversity of Nucleation Pathways in Icosahedral Quasicrystals
Authors: Gang Cui, Lei Zhang, Pingwen Zhang, An-Chang Shi, Kai Jiang
Abstract: The nucleation of quasicrystals remains a fundamental puzzle, primarily due to the absence of a periodic translational template. Here, we demonstrate that phasons - hidden degrees of freedom unique to quasiperiodic order - drive diverse nucleation pathways in icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs). Combining a Landau free-energy model with the spring pair method, we compute distinct critical nuclei and their corresponding minimum energy paths. At low temperatures, a direct, symmetry-preserving pathway dominates. In contrast, higher temperatures promote a "symmetry detour" that reduces the nucleation barrier via a lower-symmetry critical nucleus. Remarkably, while the resulting bulk IQCs exhibit distinct real-space symmetries, they remain thermodynamically degenerate with identical diffraction patterns. We resolve this paradox within the high-dimensional projection framework, showing that phason shifts modulate real-space symmetry without altering bulk thermodynamics. Our findings establish phasons as the structural origin of pathway diversity, offering a new physical picture for the emergence of quasiperiodic order.

Title: Ion Concentration and Voltage Imaging with Fluorescent Nanodiamonds
Authors: Patrick Voorhoeve, Hiroshi Abe, Takeshi Ohshima, Anita Quigley, Rob Kapsa, Nikolai Dontschuk, Philipp Reineck
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond exists in different charge states with distinct photoluminescence properties, which are sensitive to the nanoscale electrochemical environment. Hence, the NV charge state is emerging as a powerful all-optical platform for nanoscale sensing and imaging. Although significant progress has been made in engineering near-surface NV centers in bulk diamond, controlling the NV charge state in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) has proven challenging, limiting the sensitivity and reliability of FND-based charge state sensing. Here, we demonstrate reliable, reversible switching between the fluorescent NV$^0$ and non-fluorescent NV$^+$ charge states in sub-30 nm FNDs via surface oxidation and hydrogenation, respectively, for single particles and particle powder. In aqueous electrochemical cells, we demonstrate voltage and ion concentration imaging based on the NV charge state in self-assembled FND layers on transparent substrates. Applied voltages reliably modulate the FND PL with a sensitivity of up to 16 mV Hz$^{-1/2}$. Importantly, FND PL is also modulated by local changes in salt concentration with a sensitivity of up to 1.8% per millimolar NaCl, enabling all-optical imaging of ion concentration gradients at the microscale. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing fast, stable, and scalable nanoscale charge- and voltage-imaging technologies with sub-micrometer spatial resolution.

Title: Coexistence of Topological Anderson Insulator and Multifractal Critical Phase in a Non-Hermitian Quasicrystal
Authors: Qi-Bo Zeng, Rong Lü
Abstract: The interplay of topology, disorder, and non-Hermiticity gives rise to phenomena beyond the conventional classification of quantum phases. We propose a one-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with quasiperiodically modulated nonreciprocal intracell hopping. We show that quasiperiodic modulation can substantially enhance topological robustness and, remarkably, induce a non-Hermitian topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phase. Beyond the topological transition, increasing nonreciprocity drives a cascade of localization transitions in which all bulk eigenstates evolve from extended to multifractal critical and ultimately to localized states. Strikingly, the extended-to-critical transition coincides exactly with a real-complex spectral transition. We establish complete phase diagrams and derive exact analytical boundaries for both topological and localization transitions, uncovering an unanticipated coexistence of TAI and multifractal critical phases. Finally, we propose a feasible implementation in topolectrical circuits. Our results reveal a new paradigm for the cooperative effects of topology, quasiperiodicity, and non-Hermiticity.

Abstract: We demonstrate a non-volatile magnetoelectric magnonic memory (MEMM) that enables fully electrical write/read via direct magnon-driven sensing in an insulating antiferromagnet. A fabricated SrIrO3/La-BiFeO3/SrIrO3 trilayer exhibits sub-100 ps switching, a remnant polarization of 20 uC/cm2, and a readout voltage contrast close to 1mV between high and low-resistance states. To connect device physics to circuit behavior, we develop and experimentally validate a compact circuit model that captures spin Hall injection and spin transport. Simulations with optimized material parameters predict output voltages > 100mV, enabling cascading without external amplification. Using this framework, we design MEMM-based memory and logic blocks, including a 1T1R array, two inverter implementations (complementary two-device and single-device), and a three-input majority gate, and evaluate deep-pipelined operation. The model projects switching energies down to 1 aJ per operation and logic propagation delays of 30-60 ps, indicating MEMM as a promising platform for energy-constrained, high throughput computing.

Title: Interaction-Enabled Two- and Three-Fold Exceptional Points
Authors: Musashi Kato, Tsuneya Yoshida
Abstract: We propose a novel type of exceptional points, dubbed interaction-enabled $n$-fold exceptional points [EP$n$s ($n=2,3$)] -- EP$n$s protected by topology that are prohibited at the non-interacting level. Specifically, we demonstrate that both bosonic and fermionic systems host such interaction-enabled EP$n$s ($n=2,3$) in parameter space that are protected by charge U(1), pseudo-spin-parity, and $PT$ symmetries. The interaction-enabled EP2s are protected by zero-dimensional topology and give rise to qualitative changes in the loss rate, an experimentally measurable quantity for cold atoms. Furthermore, we reveal that interactions enable EP3s protected by one-dimensional topology beyond the point-gap topological classifications, suggesting the potential presence of a broader class of interaction-enabled non-Hermitian degeneracies.

Title: NMR study on equilateral triangular lattice antiferromagnet Ba2La2CoTe2O12
Authors: Keito Morioka, Takayuki Goto, Masari Watanabe, Yuki Kojima, Nobuyuki Kurita, Hidekazu Tanaka, Satoshi Iguchi, Takahiko Sasaki
Abstract: We report a 139La-NMR study of Ba2La2CoTe2O12, S = 1/2 equilateral triangular-lattice antiferromagnet with easy-plane anisotropy at low temperatures. This compound undergoes a magnetic phase transition at TN = 3.26 K into an ordered state with the 120 degree spin structure. Under magnetic fields above 3T, TN splits into TN1 and TN2, which correspond to the transitions from the paramagnetic phase to the up-up-down (uud) phase and from the uud phase to the triangular coplanar phase, respectively. The NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 exhibits a critical divergence at TN1, indicating the onset of long-range magnetic order. At TN2, the NMR-linewidth measured at 5.4 T exhibits an anomalous decrease, which we attribute to a change in the spin structure from the uud to the triangular coplanar phase.

Title: Dynamical screening effects on formation of swift heavy ions damage in GaN
Authors: S. V. Moskalets, R. A. Rymzhanov, A. E. Volkov
Abstract: We used a multiscale model to study the damage caused by swift heavy ions in GaN. The model combines Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the material response to the excitation initiated by a projectile. We found that the most appropriate simulation approach couples the dynamical screening of charges of target atoms during the scattering of fast electrons with the Tersoff-Brenner interatomic potential describing atomic dynamics in the excited target. The simulations demonstrate the formation of damaged ion tracks with an amorphous core, containing voids filled with nitrogen. The core is surrounded by a damaged crystalline region containing edge dislocations, consistent with experimental observations.

Title: Synergism in radiation effects in condensed matter. Fundamental and application aspects
Authors: Boris Oksengendler, Muhsin Ashurov, Sultan Suleymanov, Nigora Turayeva, Farida Iskandarova, Gulnoza Akhmatova, Rahmatillo Ibrohimov
Abstract: The impressive success achieved by condensed matter radiation physics over its 170-year development period is related to the solution of problems in three areas, the emergence of new materials, the development of new sources of radiation, and the formulation of new concepts with a wide range of applications. In the borderlands of the 20th and 21st centuries, significant changes occurred in each of these aspects (not-so-catastrophic disasters, R. Tom). A major role was played by the emergence of a new ideology - Complexity, which led to the birth of four paradigms, self-organization, dynamic chaos, self-organized criticality and nonadditivity (the first three are related to the concept of synergetics, the fourth - synergism). This article is devoted to radiation synergism, with an emphasis on combinations of radiation and other effects. It presents methods of graphical techniques to identify the specific issue of synergism effects, which is the non-additivity of the overall radiation effect. A parameter expression is proposed to account for the non-additivity of the radiation effect in the experiment, which can be compared to the q parameter introduced by Tsallis in the general science of Complexity, opening up new possibilities in condensed matter radiation physics for both living and non-living objects.

Title: Delocalisation explains efficient transport and charge generation in neat Y6 organic photovoltaics
Authors: Daniel Balzer, Paul A. Hume, Geoffrey R. Weal, Justin M. Hodgkiss, Ivan Kassal
Abstract: Non-fullerene acceptors (NFA), such as Y6, have significantly improved the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). However, the fundamental processes behind the high efficiencies of NFA devices have remained incompletely understood, with the high efficiencies persisting without the large energetic offsets often thought to be required for charge separation. Even more surprising has been the efficient charge generation in neat Y6 devices, where there is no energetic offset at all. Here, we simulate charge transport and separation in Y6 using delocalised kinetic Monte Carlo (dKMC) parameterised using atomistic calculations, thus taking into account the often-neglected ingredients of delocalisation, disorder, and polaron formation. Including delocalisation predicts higher carrier mobilities and exciton diffusion coefficients than is possible with classical simulations, bringing them into agreement with experimental values. Delocalisation also predicts higher charge-generation efficiencies in neat Y6, in agreement with experimental measurements. Finally, this work establishes dKMC as a realistic, predictive tool for understanding next-generation OPVs.

Title: Nonlinear effects in a strongly coupled Nanoelectromechanical System
Authors: Narges Tarakameh Samani, Farhad Shahbazi, Mehdi Abdi
Abstract: Controlling nonlinear effects in micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems is essential for unlocking their full potential in sensing, signal processing, and frequency control. In this study, we develop a voltage-dependent Hamiltonian framework for a nanoelectromechanical resonator with two strongly coupled vibrational modes, representative of a nanostring platform. The mode frequencies and couplings of the system are tuned electrostatically using a DC voltage, which also controls the strength of the interactions. Our theoretical model reproduces the experimentally observed avoided crossing in the absence of an AC drive and generates tunable frequency-comb spectra when a parametric drive is applied. By scanning the DC voltage, we generate a phase diagram that links comb formation and sharp regime boundaries to underlying bifurcations, multi-stability, and attractor switching. Phase-resolved diagnostics based on a Kuramoto order parameter, together with autocorrelation and Poincaré analyses, quantify coherence and critical slowing down near these transitions. We further explore the relationship between nonlinear coupling, parametric excitation, and stability transitions within a single device of experimental relevance and establish a dynamical framework for engineering nanoelectromechanical resonators that offer enhanced tunability, functionality, and a predictive link to experimental outcomes.

Title: Exchange interactions and finite-temperature magnetism in (111)-oriented (LaMnO$_3$)$_{2n}$|(SrMnO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices
Authors: Shivalika Sharma, Julio do Nascimento, Imran Ahamed, Fabrizio Cossu, Heung-Sik Kim, Igor Di Marco
Abstract: We present a first-principles investigation of magnetic exchange interactions and critical behavior in (111)-oriented (LaMnO$_3$)$_{2n}$|(SrMnO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices for $n=2,4,6$. For all superlattices under investigation, we find robust half-metallic ferromagnetism extending across all the layers of both component regions. Changing octahedral tilt patterns is found to have negligible effects on the magnetic properties, despite determining the presence or absence of small Jahn-Teller distortions. The analysis of the response of the magnetic coupling to a variation of the Coulomb interaction parameters demonstrates that ferromagnetism is driven by a double-exchange mechanism involving itinerant $e_g$ electrons, while its final strength is hampered by antiferromagnetic contributions due to the superexchange of localized $t_{2g}$ electrons. Multi-scale simulations based on atomistic spin dynamics show that the thinnest superlattices, $n=2,4$, possess an ordering temperature that is at least comparable to that of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$. Conversely, as thickness increases, a two-phase behavior emerges, where the SrMnO$_3$ region loses long-range order faster than the LaMnO$_3$ region. While the global ordering temperature increases together with thickness, we argue that the high-temperature regime for the observed two-phase behavior is not representative of the real physical system, which will undergo a combined electronic, magnetic and structural phase transition as soon as the long-range order is lost inside the SrMnO$_3$ region. This study provides insights into the emergent magnetic phases and transition temperatures relevant to oxide heterostructures.

Title: Magnetic skyrmion lattice disclinations in pentagon- and heptagon-shaped FeGe crystals
Authors: Thibaud Denneulin, Nikolai S. Kiselev, Vladyslav M. Kuchkin, Rafal E. Dunin-Borkowski
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions in chiral magnets typically arrange into hexagonal lattices, with their structural order influenced by factors such as temperature, external magnetic fields and geometric constraints. While translational defects in skyrmion lattices such as dislocations have been extensively studied, individual angular defects, or disclinations, remain largely unexplored. Here, we report on the stabilization of five-fold and seven-fold disclinations in pentagon- and heptagon-shaped FeGe nanocrystals created using focused ion beam milling. The magnetic and elastic structures of the disclinated lattices are investigated using Fresnel imaging and off-axis electron holography in a transmission electron microscope. The results are supported by micromagnetic simulations and analytical models based on linear elasticity theory.

Title: Stacking-Tunable Electronic Properties in Recently Synthesized Hydrogen-Substituted Graphdiyne
Authors: Guilherme S. L. Fabris, Raphael B. de Oliveira, Bruno Ipaves, Marcelo L. Pereira Junior, Douglas S. Galvao
Abstract: Recent progress in porous carbon materials has highlighted the importance of structural design in controlling emergent physicochemical properties. In this context, hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY), a three-dimensional framework derived from graphdiyne (GDY), has recently emerged as a promising architecture whose stacking-dependent behavior remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of HsGDY across distinct stacking sequences. Our results identify the AA and ABC configurations as the most energetically favorable, with AA corresponding to the global minimum, consistent with recent experimental observations. Electronic-structure analysis reveals that HsGDY is an indirect semiconductor with an electronic band gap of 0.89 eV (optB88-vdW), primarily governed by interlayer coupling and van der Waals interactions. The optical response exhibits pronounced absorption features spanning the visible to ultraviolet regions, highlighting strong potential for optoelectronic applications. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at 700 K confirm the thermal robustness of the framework, with negligible structural distortions. Collectively, these findings elucidate the stacking-dependent stability and semiconducting character of HsGDY, providing a solid theoretical foundation for its integration into next-generation nanoelectronic and energy-harvesting technologies.

Title: Disorder-driven stochastic dynamics in Mott resistive-switching systems
Authors: David J. Alspaugh, Lorenzo Fratino, Nareg Ghazikhanian, Ivan K. Schuller, Marcelo Rozenberg
Abstract: Controlled disorder in correlated materials provides a new route to emergent stochastic dynamics in neuromorphic hardware. Here we show that focused ion beam irradiation in VO$_{2}$- and V$_{2}$O$_{3}$-based resistive-switching oscillators induces a transition from regular periodic oscillations to strongly irregular stochastic firing, while simultaneously reducing the required switching energy by orders of magnitude. Under an applied electric field, these materials undergo a volatile insulator-to-metal transition characterized by the formation of percolating metallic filaments within an insulating bulk. Using numerical simulations based on the Mott resistor network, we demonstrate that defect-induced modifications to filament nucleation and stability drive these devices into stochastic oscillatory regimes. These results are validated by experimental measurements on irradiated VO$_{2}$ and V$_{2}$O$_{3}$ devices.

Title: The Sokoban Random Walk: A Trapping Perspective
Authors: Prashant Singh, Eli Barkai, David A Kessler
Abstract: We study caging/trapping in Sokoban-type models, featuring a random walker moving through a disordered medium of obstacles and capable of pushing some obstacles blocking its path. In one-dimension, we allow the walker to push up to an arbitrary $N_{\rm P}$ number of obstacles. For $N_{\rm P}\gg 1$, we use large-deviation theory to show that the survival probability to remain uncaged exhibits crossover from an exponential decay with time at intermediate times to a stretched-exponential decay at long times, with an exponent $1/3$ independent of $N_{\rm P}$. The long-time exponent matches the Balagurov--Vaks--Donsker--Varadhan (BVDV) theory of the classical trapping problem, while the exponential decay is qualitatively distinct from the Rosenstock's intermediate-time theory for classical trapping. Similarly, in two dimensions, numerical simulations reveal that both the Sokoban model and its generalized version exhibit long-time stretched-exponential relaxation with exponent $1/2$, again consistent with the BVDV theory. Finally, in two dimensions, we find that the mean trap size is nonmonotonic in $\rho$: it is small at both low and high densities, but reaches a peak at a characteristic density $\rho_*$. We estimate $\rho_* \approx 0.55$ for the Sokoban model and $\rho_* \approx 0.675$ for the generalized Sokoban model.

Title: Composite Boson Theory of Fractional Chern Insulators
Authors: Guangyu Yu, Zheng Zhu
Abstract: The understanding of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has been deeply guided by band topology and quantum geometry. Here, we introduce a real-space theoretical framework in which FCIs are understood in terms of composite bosons, local objects consisting of electrons bound to their energetically excluded surrounding orbitals. The central element of our framework is the construction of a radially ordered set of maximally localized basis for Chern bands without requiring continuous rotational symmetry. Within this basis, the complex many-body problem simplifies to a real-space organizing principle: a stable FCI occurs if the orbitals excluded around central electrons are those maximizing the two-body interaction energy. We validate this with direct numerical evidence for composite boson formation in the Haldane model, demonstrating that our criterion reliably characterizes FCIs. Importantly, our analysis illustrates that the composite boson framework bridges the fractional quantum Hall effect in continuum and lattice paradigms, providing a unified and intuitive real-space interpretation for distinct correlated phases. It thus establishes a foundation for diagnosing and guiding the design of both Abelian and non-Abelian topologically ordered phases across distinct platforms.

Title: Upper critical field in few-layer Ising superconductors
Authors: Lena Engström, Andrej Mesaros, Pascal Simon
Abstract: The N-layer 2H-stacked transition metal dichalcogenides 2H-NbSe2 and 2H-TaS2 are superconductors in which each quasi-two-dimensional layer breaks inversion symmetry. In this paper, we show that, as for the individual monolayers, it is crucial to include all pockets at the Fermi surface to accurately determine the upper critical field. Furthermore, we propose an experiment where a distinct scaling with a varying displacement field is predicted for an intralayer spin-singlet order in a bilayer. The scaling of the upper critical field with external tuning parameters can thus be used to extract information about the spin-symmetry of the superconducting order. We also explore the possibility of a mixed-parity spin-singlet and -triplet order parameter. In that case, we predict that the experimentally observable scaling would remain that of the spin-singlet component.

Title: Optical transport of cold atoms to quantum degeneracy
Authors: Yanqing Tao, Yufei Wang, Ligeng Yu, Bo Song
Abstract: Efficient transport of cold atoms is essential for continuous operation, enabling applications ranging from atomic lasers to continuously operated qubits. However, deep potentials required to overcome vibrations, axial trap nonuniformity and insufficient cooling have limited transport of cold atoms near quantum degeneracy. Here we demonstrate rapid optical transport of cold atoms to Bose-Einstein condensation using a moving optical lattice formed by two Bessel beams. A gas of $3 \times 10^5$ ytterbium atoms at a temperature of $340\,$nK is transported over $34\,$cm in $350\,$ms with efficiency over $60\%$. Furthermore, a degenerate gas of $1 \times 10^5$ atoms with a $40\%$ condensate fraction emerges from the phase synchronization process driven by atomic interactions. This demonstration enables the fast preparation of ultracold atomic beams and large-scale atom arrays for quantum sensing, simulation and computing.

Title: Topology optimization of type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces based on Ginzburg-Landau theory under Weyl gauge
Authors: Yongbo Deng, Jan G. Korvink
Abstract: Geometry design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors. Topology optimization is one of the most powerful approaches used to determine structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of both low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.

Title: Magnetocardiography measurements using an optically pumped magnetometer under ambient conditions
Authors: Kushal Patel, Kesavaraja C, Pranab Dutta, Korak Biswas
Abstract: In this work, we report the development of a rubidium-based single-beam scalar optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) and demonstrate its application in measuring human cardiac magnetic fields in an unshielded environment. The developed magnetometers exhibit a noise floor below 15 pT/sqrt(Hz) in the frequency range of 1 to 35 Hz, with a measurement bandwidth of 100 Hz. When operated in a gradiometric configuration, the noise floor is further reduced to below 3 pT/sqrt(Hz) over the same frequency range. Magnetocardiography (MCG) signals were recorded at five different locations across the thorax. A clear polarity reversal of the QRS complex was observed across these measurement positions, confirming the spatial sensitivity of the system. The proposed system shows strong potential for clinical diagnostics, offering valuable physiological information through non-contact MCG measurements

Title: Enhancement of mechanical properties of graphene oxide fibers via liquid crystalline phase formation and flake size optimization
Authors: M. Zhezhu, G. Baghdasaryan, G. Gevorgyan, S. Gyozalyan, Y. Grigoryan, K. Margaryan, H. Gharagulyan
Abstract: Graphene oxide (GO) fibers are promising materials for lightweight, high-strength applications due to their unique structural tunability and mechanical performance. However, the properties of GO fibers strongly depend on the ordering of GO flakes during the assembly process. In this work, we demonstrate that GO fibers spun from a liquid crystalline (LC) GO dispersion exhibit significantly enhanced mechanical properties compared to those produced from non-LC GO dispersions. The improved tensile strength is attributed to the larger GO flake size and highly ordered alignment achieved in the LC phase. The LC-derived fibers demonstrated a Young's modulus of 12.3 GPa, a tensile strength of 146.8 MPa, and an elongation at break of 2.5%. These findings emphasize the critical role of flake size and LC ordering in enhancing the performance of GO-based fibers and suggest a straightforward pathway toward scalable fabrication of strong yet flexible carbon-based materials.

Title: Propagation processing of short pulses in Rydberg exciton medium under blockade conditions
Authors: Sylwia Zielińska-Raczyńska, David Ziemkiewicz
Abstract: Propagation of short pulses through Cu$_2$O crystal containing Rydberg excitons is studied with the use of density matrix formalism and FDTD method. Saturation effects related to the so-called Rydberg blockade are studied extensively, exploring not only reduction of absorption (bleaching) but also power-dependent changes of the dispersive properties of the medium. The role of exciton lifetime and coherent population oscillations in the dynamics of the system is investigated. A pump-probe setup with two pulses is also studied, showing good agreement with recent experimental studies.

Title: Dirac Spin Liquid Candidate in a Rydberg Quantum Simulator
Authors: Guillaume Bornet, Marcus Bintz, Cheng Chen, Gabriel Emperauger, Daniel Barredo, Shubhayu Chatterjee, Vincent S. Liu, Thierry Lahaye, Michael P. Zaletel, Norman Y. Yao, Antoine Browaeys
Abstract: We experimentally investigate a frustrated spin-exchange antiferromagnet in a quantum simulator, composed of N = 114 dipolar Rydberg atoms arranged into a kagome array. Motivated by a recent theoretical proposal of a gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid ground state, we use local addressing to adiabatically prepare low-energy states. We measure the local polarization and spin-spin correlations over this adiabatic protocol, and observe our system move from a staggered product state, through an intermediate magnetic crystal, and finally into a disordered, correlated liquid. We estimate the entropy density of this atomic liquid to be similar to that of frustrated magnetic insulators at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We compare the correlations in our liquid to those of a simple, parameter-free ansatz for the Dirac spin liquid, and find good agreement in the sign structure and spatial decay. Finally, we probe the static susceptibility of our system to a local field perturbation and to a geometrical distortion. Our results establish Rydberg atom arrays as a promising platform for the preparation and microscopic characterization of quantum spin liquid candidates.

Title: Pattern recognition with superconducting wirelet neurons
Authors: Khalil Harrabi, Leonardo Cadorim, Milorad Milosevic
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to reproduce the energy efficiency and adaptability of biological intelligence in hardware. Superconducting devices are an attractive platform due to their ultra-low dissipation and fast switching dynamics. Here we introduce a shunted superconducting wirelet as an artificial neuron, representing the simplest possible superconducting neuron implementation. This minimal design, a single superconducting channel with a resistive shunt, enables straightforward fabrication, electronic control, and high scalability. The neuron exhibits spiking voltage behavior driven by the interplay of resistive switching and relaxation, with key properties such as threshold, firing frequency, and refractory time tunable via applied current, temperature, and shunt resistance. We further show that the resulting temporal voltage signals can be incorporated into a training algorithm to achieve accurate pattern recognition, demonstrating suitability for neuromorphic tasks. Finally, we discuss on-chip training using similar wirelets with gated synaptic weights, establishing a scalable, energy-efficient building block for cryogenic artificial intelligence hardware, integrable with other emergent superconducting technologies.

Title: Supersonic Microparticle Impact Experiments at Temperatures Approaching 2000 °C
Authors: Jamshid Ochilov, Isaac Faith Nahmad, Intekhab Alam, Peter Yip, vand Suraj Ravindran
Abstract: Experiments at extreme strain rates and temperatures are critical for characterizing materials in high-speed applications. In this study, we develop a laser-driven particle impact platform capable of accelerating microparticles to supersonic velocities and impacting targets heated to temperatures approaching 2000 °C. The conventional laser-induced particle impact testing (LIPIT) system has been modified to enable high-temperature experiments through the integration of a resistive heating system and the development of a robust launch pad assembly suitable for accelerating particles in high-temperature environments. To eliminate the oxidation of materials at elevated temperatures, an optically accessible portable vacuum chamber has been developed and integrated into the setup. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated through a study of the temperature dependent particle impact cratering behavior of POCO graphite. With this new platform, high-velocity, high-temperature impact experiments can be performed in a controlled environment, supporting the investigation of materials under extreme conditions.

Title: Probing atom-surface interactions from tunneling-time measurements via rotation-transport on an atom chip
Authors: J-B. Gerent, R. Veyron, V. Mancois, R. Huang, E. Beraud, S. Bernon
Abstract: We propose a novel method to measure the interaction between an ultracold gas of neutral atoms and a surface. This solution combines an optical dipole trap reflected by the surface, a magnetic trap formed by current carrying wires embedded below the surface, and a rotation of the surface itself. It allows to adiabatically transport a $^{87}$Rb BEC from few $\mu$m to few hundred nm of the surface. At such distances, atom-surface interaction strongly affects the trapping potential, causing an increase of the tunneling rate towards the surface. In this paper, we show that the measurement of the lifetime of the cloud and its comparison to a tunneling model will allow to extract the Casimir-Polder (CP) force coefficient in the retarded regime ($c_4$). Our model includes noise-induced heating, calibration biases of experimentally controlled parameters and accuracy of the atom lifetime measurement. Using typical trapping parameters and experimental uncertainties, we numerically estimate the relative uncertainty of $c_4$ to be 10%. This method can be implemented with any atomic species that can be magnetically and optically trapped.

Title: Dislocation dynamics on deformable surfaces
Authors: Marcello De Donno, Luiza Angheluta, Marco Salvalaglio
Abstract: We develop a fully coupled theoretical description of dislocation dynamics on deformable crystalline surfaces, using continuum modeling and the amplitude-phase-field crystal (APFC) framework extended to curved geometries. We derive a general kinematic expression for dislocation velocity directly from the complex-amplitude evolution equations, which is also applicable to deformed surfaces through curvature-modified differential operators. From numerical simulations, we show that even small out-of-plane deformations reshape the phenomenology of defect motion through curvature-induced self-propulsion, modified glide directions, and non-classical defect-defect interactions. Our results show how surface geometry profoundly influences defect dynamics and establish the surface-APFC model as a powerful framework for predicting and interpreting curvature-defect coupling across a wide range of systems, from stiff but deformable layers to soft matter surfaces and membranes that retain crystalline order.

Title: Polymer Brushes and Grafted Polymers: AI/ML-Driven Synthesis, Simulation, and Characterization towards autonomous SDL
Authors: Rigoberto C. Advincula, Jihua Chen
Abstract: Polymer brushes and grafted polymers have attracted significant interest at the intersection of polymers, interfacial chemistry, colloidal science, and nanostructuring. The confinement of high-density grafted polymers and differences in swelling regimes govern the synthetic challenges and the interesting physics underlying their macromolecular dynamics. In this article, we focus on another intersection, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), and how workflows will enhance the microstructure and composition of these systems. It will also accelerate potential applications through high-throughput experimentation (HTE) and data-driven intelligence, enabling scientific discovery and optimization. Applications in microfluidics, sensors, bioimplants, drug delivery, and related areas may yet offer more opportunities for ML-driven optimization. There is also interest in applying these studies with self-driving laboratories (SDLs) that can leverage autonomous systems for synthesis screening, characterization, and application evaluation.

Title: Ilmenite-Type Ca$_x$IrO$_3$ via Topochemical Ion Exchange: Stacking Faults and Low-Temperature Magnetic Anomaly
Authors: Haruki Kira, Yuya Haraguchi, Wataru Yokoshima, Daisuke Nishio-Hamane, Hiroko Aruga Katori
Abstract: We report the synthesis of an ilmenite-type polymorph of Ca$_x$IrO$_3$ distinct from the known post-perovskite and perovskite phases, via low-temperature topochemical Ca$^{2+}$/2Na$^+$ exchange from Na$_2$IrO$_3$. Powder X-ray diffraction is indexable in $R\bar{3}$, and whole pattern modelling that includes layer glide faults indicates that the selective broadening can be captured by a first order Markov stacking description based on stochastic switching between two symmetry equivalent lateral stacking steps, with explicit model dependence and an uncertainty of at least several percent. A freezing-like bulk magnetic anomaly is suggested at $T^* \sim 25$ K (defined by the onset of a ZFC/FC bifurcation at $\mu_{0}H = 10$ mT), accompanied by a broad heat capacity feature and Curie-Weiss behavior with a large negative Weiss temperature of $\theta_W \sim -98$ K. The effective moment $\mu_{\rm eff} = 1.68 \mu_{\rm B}$ per Ir is consistent with $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ for an Ir$^{4+}$. SEM-EDX suggests an A-site content below unity (Ca/Ir $<$ 1); accordingly, we describe the ion-exchanged product using the nonstoichiometric formula Ca$_x$IrO$_3$. These results identify ilmenite-type CaIrO$_3$ as a honeycomb iridate in which stacking disorder can be quantified (with caveats regarding model and instrument correlations) and related to its low-temperature magnetic behavior.

Title: M-CODE: Materials Categorization via Ontology, Dimensionality and Evolution
Authors: Vsevolod Biryukov, Kamal Choudhary, Timur Bazhirov
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in materials science requires data standards and data management practices that can capture the complexity of real-world structures, including surfaces, interfaces, defects, and dimensionality reduction. We present M-CODE - Materials Categorization via Ontology, Dimensionality and Evolution - a compact categorization system that links materials-science-specific terminology to a set of reusable concepts as building blocks and provenance-aware transformations. M-CODE classifies structures by dimensionality, structural complexity (from pristine to compound pristine, defective, and processed), and variants that capture common structure creation and evolution approaches. A practical implementation of the categorization is provided in an open-source codebase that includes JSON schemas, examples, and Python and TypeScript types/interfaces, designed to support reproducible dataset generation, validation, and community contributions.

Title: Reversible tuning of magnetic order and intrinsic superconductivity in strained FeTe thin films via stoichiometry control
Authors: Hao Xu, Jing Jiang, Xuesong Gai, Rui-Qi Cao, Xiao-Xiao Man, Kaiwei Chen, Haicheng Lin, Peng Deng, Ke He, Kai Liu, Dapeng Zhao, Zhong-Yi Lu, Kai Chang, Chong Liu
Abstract: FeTe is a prototypical parent compound of iron-based superconductors. While bulk FeTe is non-superconducting with a long-range bicollinear antiferromagnetic order, superconductivity has been achieved in thin films. However, the approaches usually involve complex oxygen incorporation or interfacial effects, the microscopic mechanisms of which remain elusive. Here, we prepare high-purity, bare FeTe thin films on SrTiO3 and investigate their magnetic and superconducting states combining both microscopic and macroscopic characterizations. By reducing the interstitial Fe impurities, we successfully suppress the long-range antiferromagnetic order, enhance the quasiparticle coherence and induce superconductivity at ~10 K. Moreover, this process is readily reversible by tuning the Fe concentration. Our findings reveal that precise stoichiometric control is sufficient to induce intrinsic superconductivity in strained FeTe thin films. This work provides insights into the competition between magnetism and superconductivity in iron chalcogenides, and supplies a robust pathway for developing stable, high-purity superconducting FeTe films.

Title: Programming active-molecule dynamics via intramolecular nonreciprocity
Authors: Ye Zhang, Meng Xiao, Duanduan Wan
Abstract: The dynamics of a self-propelled particle are typically hard-wired by its microscopic construction, limiting the range of behaviors accessible without redesigning the particle itself. Here we show that intramolecular nonreciprocity provides a minimal and versatile mechanism to overcome this constraint. We construct active molecules from short chains of two species of self-propelled particles whose propulsion directions are coupled nonreciprocally according to a prescribed internal sequence. At the single-molecule level, homogeneous sequences exhibit standard persistent random-walk dynamics, whereas heterogeneous sequences produce distinct trajectories inaccessible to either constituent species alone. At the collective level, using motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) as a representative example, we find that modifying the internal sequence shifts the MIPS onset by multiple orders of magnitude in propulsion strength, without altering particle-level interactions. These results demonstrate that intramolecular nonreciprocity among a small set of active components enables sequence-level programmability from single-molecule dynamics to emergent collective behavior, providing a minimal mechanism to encode and control active-matter dynamics across scales.

Chapman
Abstract: Molecular and polymeric crystals show a wide range of functional properties that arise from the interplay between the atomic-scale structure of their constituent molecules and the organization of these molecules within the crystal lattice at macroscopic length scales. X-ray diffraction can provide structural information at these disparate length scales, but usually only through experiments that address one or the other of molecular (or unit-cell) structure versus crystal structure. Consequently, the accuracy of determined molecular or polymer structures may be limited by unaccounted crystal inhomogeneities of the crystal lattice and the characterization of crystalline materials might not reveal the underlying causes of crystal morphology. Here we introduce X-ray convergent-beam diffraction to obtain spatially-resolved structural information from crystals by projection topographic imaging. Using highly focusing X-ray multilayer Laue lenses, we show that Bragg reflections can be mapped into tomographic images of the crystal, for the characterization of strain and defects at high resolution. We demonstrate how the crystal morphology obtained this way can be accounted for when determining structure factors as a function of position in the crystal. The approach may assist in studies such as diffusion and binding in MOFS, protein-drug binding, crystal growth, and the mechanical responses of photo-reactive or thermally driven dynamic crystals.

Title: RF field characterization and rectification effects in spin pumping and spin-torque FMR for spin-orbitronics
Authors: Melissa Yactayo, Michel Hehn, J.-C. Rojas-Sánchez, Sébastien Petit-Watelot
Abstract: Quantifying spin-orbital-to-charge conversion efficiency is crucial for spin-orbitronics. Two widely used methods for determining these efficiencies are based on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), spin pumping FMR for the inverse effect, and spin-torque FMR for the direct effect. A key parameter to achieve accurate quantification, especially for spin-pumping FMR, is the RF field strength, $h_{\mathrm{RF}}$. We present a comprehensive theoretical model and experimental protocol that allow a correct quantification of $h_{\mathrm{RF}}$. It was validated by extensive experimental results and it was rigorously tested across various antennas geometries and ferromagnetic systems. We demonstrate that odd-symmetric Lorentzian voltages-which perfectly mimic spin-pumping or spin-torque FMR signals-can arise purely from rectification effects (due to anisotropic magnetoresistance) when $h_{\mathrm{RF}}$ orientation is parallel to the ferromagnetic surface. Through a systematic study of various 10-nm-thick ferromagnetic layers, such as Ni, NiFe, Fe, and CoFeB, we find that while Fe and CoFeB exhibit minimal rectification, Ni and NiFe generate strong rectified signals that must be corrected. We further demonstrate that these rectification effects become negligible for ferromagnetic thicknesses $\leq$ 6 nm, as validated in NiFe/Pt bilayers, providing an important guideline for the design of future heterostructures.

Title: Phonon Echo from Multi-Level Systems and Many-Body Interactions in Low-Temperature Glasses
Authors: Di Zhou
Abstract: At low temperatures, glasses exhibit distinctive properties compared to crystalline solids. A notable example is the phonon echo, a phenomenon that motivated the two-level-system (TLS) model. This model has successfully explained many universal anomalies in glasses. Here, we extend the TLS framework to a multi-level system and show that phonon echoes persist when nonlinear energy structures and disorder are included. By incorporating virtual phonon exchange, we introduce many-body interactions between these multi-level systems, leading to nonlinear eigen-energies that enhance the echo signal. Meanwhile, finite-temperature thermal fluctuations cause dephasing, resulting in a decay of echo amplitude over time. The analytical and numerical results are consistent across semi-classical and quantum regimes. Our work validates the multi-level-system model and underscores the role of many-body interactions in low-temperature glassy dynamics.

Title: Self-Viscophoresis: Autonomous Motion by Biasing Thermal Fluctuations via Self-Generated Viscosity Asymmetry
Authors: Bokusui Nakayama, Yusuke Takagi, Ryoya Hirose, Masatoshi Ichikawa, Marie Tani, Ibuki Kawamata, Eiji Yamamoto, Akira Kakugo
Abstract: Microscale transport often relies on ubiquitous yet intrinsically random thermal fluctuations. Understanding how such fluctuations can be biased into directed motion has long been a central theme of nonequilibrium physics. Here, we introduce self-viscophoresis, a mechanism of autonomous motion based on the rectification of thermal fluctuations in a self-generated nonequilibrium viscosity field. Asymmetric colloidal particles dispersed in a thermoresponsive polymer solution induce local heating under uniform illumination, producing a spatially asymmetric viscosity profile around the particle and resulting in persistent directed motion. To elucidate the physical origin of this behavior, we develop a minimal Langevin model coupling isotropic thermal fluctuations to a dynamically updating temperature-viscosity field. The model shows that viscosity asymmetry anisotropically damps stochastic dynamics, effectively biasing thermal fluctuations into a net drift. It thus reproduces the observed directed motion without invoking deterministic propulsion terms associated with effective potentials or environmental fluid flows. Our results distinguish self-viscophoresis from conventional self-propulsion mechanisms and establish it as a general framework enabling reversible control of both the direction and dimensionality of motion.

Title: Altermagnetic Even-Odd Effects in CsV$_2$Te$_2$O Josephson Junctions
Authors: Chuang Li, Jin-Xing Hou, Shuai-Ling Zhu, Hao Zheng, Yu Song, Yang Liu, Song-Bo Zhang, Lun-Hui Hu
Abstract: The interplay between conventional superconductivity and unconventional magnetism offers an exciting platform for realizing exotic superconducting phenomena. Here, we investigate Josephson effects in planar and vertical junctions based on CsV$_2$Te$_2$O-family materials, which host hidden $d$-wave altermagnetism with G-type antiferromagnetic order. In monolayer-based planar junctions, the quasi-1D, nearly flat, spin-polarized bands of the altermagnet, when coupled to $s$-wave superconductors, produce a \textit{fully} spin-polarized supercurrent with strong directional anisotropy -- a spin-selective Josephson effect. In multilayers, we uncover an \textit{altermagnetic even-odd effect}: spin-polarized supercurrents persist only in odd-layer planar junctions but cancel exactly in even layers. Thus, layer parity acts as a switch for spin-polarized supercurrent. In vertical junctions, odd-layer barriers enhance equal-spin triplet transport while even layers favor opposite-spin transport, yielding a robust period-two oscillation in the total supercurrent with layer number. These layer-parity-dependent responses represent a general even-odd effect in hidden altermagnets, applicable to diverse magnetic and transport phenomena.

Title: Reentrant Superconductivity in Zeeman Fields
Authors: Tomoya Sano, Kota Tabata, Satoshi Ikegaya, Yasuhiro Asano
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model for a superconductor that exhibits the reentrant superconductivity in Zeeman fields. The Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian includes three vectors in spin space: a $d$ vector of a spin-triplet superconducting state, a potential representing spin-orbit interactions, and a Zeeman field. When the three vectors are perpendicular to one another, the spin-orbit interaction suppresses superconductivity in weak Zeeman fields and enhances superconductivity in strong Zeeman fields. The instability (stability) of superconducting state is characterized by the appearance of odd-frequency (even-frequency) Cooper pairs.

Title: Zr-based bulk metallic glass clamp cell for high-pressure inelastic neutron scattering
Authors: S. Hayashida, T. Wada, M. Ishikado, K. Munakata, K. Iida, K. Kamazawa, R. Kajimoto, Y. Inamura, M. Nakamura, K. Iwasa, K. Ohoyama, H. Kato, H. Kira, M. Matsuura, Y. Uwatoko
Abstract: We report the fabrication and characterization of a Zr-based bulk metallic glass (Zr-BMG) clamp cell designed for high-pressure inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. The INS spectra of the empty cell exhibit broad and featureless backgrounds, reflecting the amorphous structure of the Zr-BMG. Test measurements using a reference sample, CsFeCl$_{3}$, confirm that the neutron transmission of the Zr-BMG cell is significantly higher than that of a conventional monobloc CuBe clamp cell. These results demonstrate that the Zr-BMG clamp cell provides both enhanced neutron transparency and a clean background profile, thereby advancing high-pressure INS studies.

Title: Magnetic fluctuations driven by quantum geometry
Authors: Makoto Shimizu, Chang-guen Oh, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: Using quantum distance, magnetic susceptibility in the non-interacting limit can be rigorously split into two contributions: one arising solely from band dispersion, while the other stems from quantum geometric contributions. In this Letter, we apply this decomposition to two materials, LaFeAsO and Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O, and demonstrate that their dominant magnetic fluctuations originate from the geometric contribution. In LaFeAsO, stripe-type antiferromagnetic fluctuations arise primarily from quantum geometry, while in Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O the geometric term suppresses antiferromagnetic fluctuations and stabilizes ferromagnetic fluctuations. Our findings highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in governing magnetic fluctuations in multi-band systems, and provide a unique and quantitative framework to disentangle band-structure and wavefunction-geometry effects that have often been discussed collectively as multi-orbital effects.

Title: Universal observable as a signal of chiral anomaly in lattice Weyl fermions
Authors: Shi Chen, Yu Chen
Abstract: The Adler-Bell-Jackiw chiral anomaly is shown to retain its Lorentz-invariant form, $\partial_\mu J^\mu_5 \propto \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$, in lattice Weyl systems beyond moderate magnetic fields, where neither Lorentz nor rotational symmetry is present. We show that the longitudinal and Hall magnetoconductivities factorize into a product of a universal part, governed by the chiral anomaly, and a non-universal part that depends on the density of states at the Fermi level. A rotationally invariant observable $\varkappa = \sigma (c_V/T)^2$ is introduced as a robust signature of the anomaly, where $\sigma$ denotes the Euclidean norm of the longitudinal and Hall conductivities and $c_V$ is the specific heat density. This quantity follows a universal $B^2$ dependence and scales as $|\cos\Theta|$, with $\Theta$ being the angle between $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$. Through analytical derivation and full numerical simulation, we establish that $\varkappa$ remains universal independent of system parameters and of the orientation of the magnetic or electric field for fixed $\Theta$. The emergent SO(3) symmetry in $\varkappa$ persists despite the absence of isotropy in both the microscopic model and the low-energy effective theory.

Title: Quantifying Strain and its Effect on Charge Transport in Ge/Si Core/Shell Nanowires

Abstract: Strain engineering in semiconductor nanostructures offers a promising route to optimize electronic and optical properties for advanced quantum technologies. This study explores the relationship between core and shell thicknesses and strain distribution in Ge/Si core/shell nanowires, targeting their application as hosts for spin qubits. Nanowires were synthesized using an Au-catalyzed chemical vapor deposition technique, achieving control over core and shell dimensions. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping confirmed structural integrity, while Geometric Phase Analysis and Raman spectroscopy provided quantitative insights into strain variations driven by core and shell dimensions. Furthermore, polarization resolved $\mu$-Raman measurements allowed us to quantify the longitudinal and transverse phonon mode splitting as a function of strain in the Ge core. The strain dependent electronic properties were investigated by hole mobility measurements. Finally, we observe a record high hole mobility of 25,500 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, underscoring the potential of these core/shell nanowire structures for the realization of high-fidelity spin qubits. Our findings highlight the critical role of geometry in strain tuning and provide valuable design guidelines for optimizing Ge/Si nanowires in scalable quantum device architectures.

Title: Realization of a Synthetic Hall Torus with a Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: T. -H. Chien, S. -C. Wu, Y. -H. Su, L. -R. Liu, N. -C. Chiu, M. Sarkar, Q. Zhou, Y. -J. Lin
Abstract: We report the first experimental realization of a synthetic Hall torus using a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a ring-shaped trap with in situ imaging. By cyclically coupling three hyperfine spin states via Raman and microwave fields, we impose a periodic boundary condition in the synthetic dimension, which together with a real-space ring trap, realizes a toroidal geometry with a synthetic magnetic flux. This flux induces azimuthal density modulations in the condensate, whose periodicity is uniquely determined by the quantized toroidal magnetic flux-a hallmark of the Hall torus geometry. By varying the relative phase between the couplings across repeated experimental runs, we control the location of the density extrema, emulating the behavior of Thouless charge pump in a toroidal geometry. We further investigate the onset of these modulations as the system transitions from a cylindrical to a toroidal topology. Our results establish a versatile platform for investigating quantum Hall physics and topological phenomena in synthetic curved spaces.

Title: Magnetic excitations in the Kitaev material Na$_2$IrO$_3$ studied by neutron scattering
Authors: Alexandre Bertin, Hengdi Zhao, Gang Cao, Andrea Piovano, Paul Steffens, Alexandre Ivanov, Markus Braden
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering experiments with a large set of comounted Na$_2$IrO$_3$ crystals reveal the low-energy magnon dispersion in this candidate material for Kitaev physics. The magnon gap amounts to 1.7(1) meV and can be interpreted similarly to the sister compound $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ to stem from the zone boundaries in the antiferromagnetic zigzag structure. The neutron experiments find no evidence for low-energy excitations with ferromagnetic character, which contrasts to the findings in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. Our results are consistent with a recently proposed microscopic model that involves an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg nearest-neighbor exchange in Na$_2$IrO$_3$ in contrast to the ferromagnetic one considered for $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. Although the magnetic response shows the signatures of bond-directional anisotropy in both materials the different relative signs of Kitaev and Heisenberg interaction result in different deviations from the initial Kitaev model. Low-energy ferromagnetic fluctuations cannot be considered as a fingerprint of ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction.

Title: Compositional Metrology of Atom Probe Applied to non-Metallic Materials
Authors: Enrico Di Russo, François Vurpillot, Lorenzo Rigutti
Abstract: Two decades after its introduction, laser-assisted Atom Probe Tomography (La-APT) has demonstrated a unique potential for the study of the 3D distribution of atomic species in semiconductor materials and devices, and in a growing list of inorganic non-metallic solids. A crucial and often underestimated issue with APT is its accuracy in compositional measurements of non-metallic systems. This work introduces the principles of APT as an experimental technique, recalling the aspects potentially leading to compositional biases and underlining in particular the role of the surface electric field in governing the different physical-chemical phenomena that enable the measurement. It reviews the possible mechanisms of specific losses, as well as the methods for assessing a compositional bias and proposing possible correction methods. Finally, it establishes a state of the art on compositional biases in APT of non-metallic materials, on the basis of which it will be possible to conclude on specific recommendations for best practices, and the perspective of application of APT to new materials.

Title: Non-commutative Dynamic Approaches to the Kibble-Zurek Scaling Limit with an Initial Gapless Order
Authors: Zhe Wang, Chengxiang Ding, Dongxu Liu, Fuxiang Li, Zheng Yan, Shuai Yin
Abstract: Nonequilibrium many-body physics is one of the core problems in modern physics, while the dynamical scaling from a gapless phase to the critical point is a most important challenge with very few knowledge so far. In the driven dynamics with a tuning rate $R$ across the quantum critical point (QCP) of a system with size $L$, the finite-time scaling shows that the square of the order parameter $m^2$ obeys a simple scaling relation $m^2\propto R^{2\beta/\nu r}$ in the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling limit with $RL^r\gg1$. Here, by studying the driven critical dynamics from a gapless ordered phase in the bilayer Heisenberg model, we unveil that the approaches to the scaling region dominated by the KZ scaling limit with $RL^r\gg1$ are {\it non-commutative}: this scaling region is inaccessible for large $R$ and finite medium $L$, while merely accessible for large $L$ and moderately finite $R$. We attribute this to the memory effect induced by the finite-size correction in the gapless ordered phase. This non-commutative property makes $m^2$ still strongly depends on the system size and deviates from $m^2\propto R^{2\beta/\nu r}$ even for large $R$. We further show that a similar correction applies to the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics. Our results establish an essential extension of nonequilibrium scaling theory with a gapless ordered initial state.

Title: DFT and MLIP study of solute segregation to coherent and semi-coherent α-Fe/Fe$_3$C interfaces
Authors: Amin Reiners-Sakic, Ronald Schnitzer, David Holec
Abstract: Solute segregation to interfaces significantly impacts material behavior. A large majority of theoretical works focus on grain boundaries and coherent interfaces. Studies on semi-coherent interfaces are usually prohibited by the structural complexity, yielding models beyond the practical capability of density functional theory (DFT), or chemical complexity, restricted by the availability of (classical) interatomic potentials. This work investigates solute segregation to the coherent and semi-coherent $\alpha$-Fe/Fe$_3$C interface in pearlite and its effect on mechanical properties using novel universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). DFT calculated solution enthalpies, segregation energetics, and changes in cohesion at the coherent interface are used to benchmark several state-of-the-art uMLIPs. We find that the GRACE-2L-OAM and GRACE-2L-OMAT models most accurately reproduce the quantum-mechanical predictions. While Cu has the strongest segregation energy of $\approx$ -0.3 eV to the coherent interface among the investigated tramp and trace elements, all of them, As, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, P, Sb, and Sn, exhibit significantly more negative segregation values reaching below $\approx$ -1.5 eV in the presence of the misfit dislocation at the semi-coherent interface. The deepest traps are identified in the vicinity of the dislocation core, although the spatial distribution of segregation energies differs markedly among the solute species. The cohesion of the coherent interface is strongly reduced by Sb, Sn, P, and As, and only mildly by Cu, whereas Ni shows a negligible effect, and Cr and Mo slightly enhance cohesion. In contrast, all investigated solutes (except for P) tend to embrittle the semi-coherent interface, with Sn and, especially, Sb having the strongest impact in tensile tests performed in the out-of-plane direction.

Title: Why is the $d$-Wave spin splitting in CuF$_2$ bulk-like?
Authors: Muskan, Subhadeep Bandyopadhyay, Sayantika Bhowal
Abstract: With the advent of nonrelativistic spin splitting in collinear compensated antiferromagnets, several candidate materials have also been proposed, among which the family of transition-metal difluorides stands out as a prominent example. Within this family, most members exhibit planar $d$-wave spin splitting, whereas CuF$_2$ shows bulk $d$-wave splitting with an explicit $k_z$ dependence. In this work, we show that this transition from planar to bulk $d$-wave splitting in CuF$_2$ is primarily driven by the antipolar displacements of the F ions, which are absent in the tetragonal rutile structure of the other family members. Our calculations reveal that these additional structural distortions introduce an extra plane of anisotropic magnetization density, giving rise to an additional totally symmetric component of the magnetic octupole tensor. The $k$-space representation of this octupole component, consequently, dictates an additional direction of spin splitting, thereby transforming the $d$-wave spin splitting pattern from planar to bulk-like. We further analyze the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the magnetic octupoles and the resulting spin splitting in the band structure. Our work highlights the possibility of controlling the pattern of nonrelativistic spin splitting through structural modifications, for example, via the application of external pressure.

Zumbühl
Abstract: Tunnel junctions are one of the key elements of chip-scale microsystems serving various technologies from classical microelectronics to quantum information. Aluminium and its oxide (AlOx) have dominated cryogenic tunnel junction technology for decades due to the high quality of AlOx barriers and Al superconducting properties below 1.2 K. However, many applications require non-superconducting junctions, either standalone or in combination with superconducting technology, motivating efforts to suppress Al superconductivity through magnetic fields, doping, or proximity effects -- approaches that so far suffered from integration compatibility and scalability issues. Here, we present a CMOS-compatible normal-metal tunnel junction technology based on TiW alloy and AlOx barriers. We demonstrate wafer-scale fabrication of TiW/Al-AlOx/TiW junctions and validate their performance in Coulomb blockade thermometers operating down to 20 mK, confirming robust normal-state behavior. This TiW-based architecture offers a scalable solution for non-superconducting tunnel junctions across a broad temperature range, enabling integration into advanced cryogenic, quantum and nanoelectronic chip-level systems.

Title: Data-Efficient Machine learning for Predicting Dopant Formation Energies in TiO$_2$ Monolayer
Authors: Kati Asikainen, Matti Alatalo, Marko Huttula, Assa Aravindh Sasikala Devi
Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly applied in materials science, yet their predictive power is often constrained by data scarcity. Here, we show that accurate predictions can be achieved, even with a limited number of training examples, provided the dataset is compact and and grounded in physically relevant quantities. By combining density functional theory calculations with a machine-learning framework, we construct accurate descriptor-based models to predict the formation energies of doped lepidocrocite TiO$_2$ monolayers. The predictive accuracy of machine-learning models was first evaluated for single-dopant Pt configurations, demonstrating that the selected structural and chemical descriptors reliably capture the key factors governing dopant stability. Chemical transferability is then examined by extending the dataset to include Ag-doped configurations. Predictive accuracy improved systematically as additional Ag-doped data points were included in the training, while the performance of Pt remains robust. These results highlight the potential of small and well-curated datasets combined with physically informed descriptors to enable not only accurate but also chemically transferable machine-learning-driven screening in doped TiO$_2$ monolayer.

Title: Free-electron decoherence: Theory and applications
Authors: Cruz I. Velasco, Valerio Di Giulio, F. Javier García de Abajo
Abstract: Electron microscopy relies on the spatial coherence of electron beams to generate atomic-scale images using interference and diffraction, which can be degraded by inelastic scattering processes that induce decoherence. Here, we present a theoretical study of decoherence arising from the electromagnetic interaction of free electrons with bulk materials and planar surfaces. We show that bulk plasmons dominate decoherence in Al and Au, while electronic excitations above the band gap, supplemented by weaker coupling to phononic and guided modes, are the primary channels in ionic insulators such as LiF. A thermal population of electromagnetic modes leads to a divergence in the energy-loss probability at low frequencies, which in turn produces a pronounced temperature dependence. We show that this effect can be exploited for nanoscale thermometry, predicting that optimized energy-filtered holography enables $\sim0.1\%$ changes in fringe visibility for physically viable temperature variations in metals. Through these results, we establish a unified theoretical framework to describe free-electron decoherence in the bulk and surfaces of arbitrary materials.

Title: A self-consistent criterion for the range of validity of weakly driven processes
Authors: Pierre Nazé
Abstract: One of the longstanding open questions in linear response theory concerns its true range of validity. Determining when the linear approximation can be trusted typically requires knowledge of second-order corrections, which are often difficult to compute explicitly. In this letter, I propose a self-consistent criterion for the validity of linear response, formulated in terms of a typical length scale that emerges from the fluctuation-response inequality within the theory itself. The result applies to classical open systems. I illustrate the criterion with explicit examples of Brownian particles in harmonic traps, and classical open systems presenting Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Finally, I discuss the physical meaning of this typical length, providing both thermodynamic and information-theoretic interpretations.

Title: The cost of speed: Time-optimal thermal control of trapped Brownian particles
Authors: Miguel Ibanez, Antonio Patron-Castro, Antonio Lasanta, Carlos A. Plata, Antonio Prados, Raul A. Rica-Alarcon
Abstract: A thermal analogue of the classical brachistochrone problem, which minimizes the connection time between two equilibrium states of harmonically confined Brownian particles, has recently been solved theoretically. Here we report its experimental realization using two optically trapped microparticles subjected to a bang-bang effective temperature protocol. Despite their distinct relaxation times, both degrees of freedom are steered to their respective equilibrium states simultaneously in a finite minimal time. We provide a complete time-resolved characterization of the nonequilibrium dynamics through the evolution of the position variances and the entropy production within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, enabling a quantitative comparison with direct relaxation and a suboptimal protocol. In addition, we employ information-geometric tools -- recently referred to as thermal kinematics -- to track the system's path in state space with a single dynamical quantity. Our results show that faster equilibration requires a larger entropy production and an increased thermodynamic length, revealing a direct trade-off between temporal optimality and thermodynamic cost in multidimensional stochastic systems driven by a single intensive control parameter.

Title: The distinction of time-reversal-like degeneracy by electronic transport in a new compound
Authors: Yi-Yan Wang, Ping Su, Kai-Yuan Hu, Yi-Ran Li, Na Li, Ying Zhou, Dan-Dan Wu, Yan Sun, Qiu-Ju Li, Xia Zhao, Hui Liang, Xue-Feng Sun
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new compound, Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$, and reveal the hidden time-reversal-like degenerate states within it. Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ is an antiferromagnet with the distorted kagome lattice of Ce atoms, in which several fractional magnetization plateaus emerge with the increase of magnetic field. At the 1/2 magnetization plateau, obvious hysteresis has been observed in the magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity during the rise and fall of the magnetic field. However, hysteresis vanishes in the corresponding measurements of magnetization, indicating the existence of degenerate states with the same net magnetization but different electronic transport properties. The degenerate states can be connected by the time-reversal-like operation. In addition, by comparing with HoAgGe, it is suggested that the special crystal structure in Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ may have a shielding effect on the time-reversal-like operation, thereby affecting the distinction of degenerate states. Our work establishes Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ as an example of utilizing electronic transport properties to identify and distinguish hidden symmetries in frustrated magnetic systems.

Title: Antiferromagnetic Barkhausen noise induced by weak random-field disorder
Authors: Bosiljka Tadic
Abstract: This study numerically investigates magnetisation reversal processes driven by an external magnetic field in three-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin models with weak random field disorder. Considering an extremely weak disorder and low temperature, we observe a step-wise hysteresis loop and the appearance of short magnetisation bursts of a characteristic triangular shape; the number of bursts increases with disorder, indicative of Barkhausen-type noise. These phenomena are attributed to the simultaneous reversal at a given external field of segments composed of spins with identical neighbourhoods. A local random field orients one or more spin neighbours, resulting in small, ferromagnetic-like clusters distributed throughout the system. As disorder increases, these clusters may merge to form a labyrinthine structure within the antiferromagnetic background, facilitating brief avalanche propagation. The results demonstrate that, compared with familiar random-field ferromagnets, the observed antiferromagnetic Barkhausen noise and the related avalanche sequence have a profoundly different structure, organised into peaks associated with the transition between magnetisation plateaus. They exhibit prominent cyclical trends and disorder-dependent multifractal fluctuations, with the singularity spectrum quantifying the degree of disorder. The activity avalanches exhibit scale invariance resembling that recently found in experiments with disordered ferr\textit{i}magnets and martensites, as well as in quantum Barkhausen noise, which are associated with active geometric regions rather than individual-spin dynamics. The observed scaling behaviour is interpreted in terms of self-organised critical dynamics.

Title: Variational preparation and characterization of chiral spin liquids in quantum circuits
Authors: Zi-Yang Zhang, Donghoon Kim, Ji-Yao Chen
Abstract: Quantum circuits have been shown to be a fertile ground for realizing long-range entangled phases of matter. While various quantum double models with non-chiral topological order have been theoretically investigated and experimentally implemented, the realization and characterization of chiral topological phases have remained less explored. Here we show that chiral topological phases in spin systems, i.e., chiral spin liquids, can be prepared in quantum circuits using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework. On top of the VQE ground state, signatures of the chiral topological order are revealed using the recently proposed tangent space excitation ansatz for quantum circuits. We show that, both topological ground state degeneracy and the chiral edge mode can be faithfully captured by this approach. We demonstrate our approach using the Kitaev honeycomb model, finding excellent agreement of low-energy excitation spectrum on quantum circuits with exact solution in all topological sectors. Further applying this approach to a non-exactly solvable chiral spin liquid model on square lattice, the results suggest this approach works well even when the topological sectors are not exactly known.

Title: Spin qubit shuttling between coupled quantum dots with inhomogeneous Landé g-tensors
Authors: Zhi-Hai Liu, Xiao-Fei Liu, H. Q. Xu
Abstract: By utilizing the site-dependent spin quantization axis in semiconductor quantum dot (QD) arrays, shuttling-based spin qubit gates have become an appealing approach to realize scalable quantum computing due to the circumvention of using high-frequency driving fields. The emergence of a spin deviation from the local quantization axis of one residing QD is the prerequisite to implement the qubit gates. In this work, we study the non-adiabatic dynamics of a spin qubit shuttling between coupled QDs with inhomogeneous Landé g-tensors and a small magnetic field. The spin dynamics is analyzed through solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation of the qubit under the effects of spin-orbit interaction and rapid ramping inter-dot detuning. The precondition, imposed on the ramping time and the tunnel-coupling strength, to ensure a high-fidelity inter-dot transfer is estimated. We then calculate the change in the spin orientation of a transferred qubit, and study the dependences of the spin deviation on the difference in the quantization axes of the two QDs, the tunnel-coupling strength, and the ramping time. We also demonstrate that the effect of multiple rounds of inter-dot bidirectional shuttling can be captured by an operator matrix, and evaluate the idling times required for realizing the single-qubit Pauli-X and Pauli-Y gates. Intriguingly, it is confirmed that a generalized Hadamard gate can be achieved through tuning the idling times.

Title: Exact Multi-Valley Envelope Function Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Nanostructures
Authors: Lasse Ermoneit, Abel Thayil, Thomas Koprucki, Markus Kantner
Abstract: Valley splitting in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells is a central parameter for silicon spin qubits and is commonly described with envelope-function and effective-mass theories. These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory.

Title: Uniaxial strain tuned magnetism of the altermagnet candidate h-FeS
Authors: Weiliang Yao, Feng Ye, Zachary J. Morgan, Douglas L. Abernathy, Ruixian Liu, Sijie Xu, Yuxiang Gao, Kevin Allen, Yuan Fang, Emilia Morosan, Qimiao Si, Pengcheng Dai
Abstract: Altermagnets are collinear magnetic materials with 'alter'nating local crystalline environments, characterized by joint spin and crystalline symmetries that enable ferromagnetic-like transport properties but with vanishing net magnetization. Hexagonal FeS (h-FeS) is a recently identified altermagnet candidate that shows a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) accompanied by a tiny net magnetization. Here, we show that both the spontaneous AHE and magnetization can be effectively suppressed by an in-plane compressive strain. Since neutron diffraction measurements show that the applied uniaxial strain only modifies the in-plane domain population but does not affect the in-plane magnetic structure, the major effect of the applied strain is to tune the small $c$-axis ferromagnetic moment. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between the tiny net magnetization and the spontaneous AHE in h-FeS, and show that uniaxial strain provides an effective knob to tune both properties in this altermagnet candidate for spintronic applications.

Abstract: We study the proximity effect in the Hubbard model coupled to BCS superconductors describing a single-layer strongly correlated electron system in a phase-biased Josephson junction. We find two distinct gapped solutions, one Mott-like insulating (M-phase) and one proximitized superconducting phase (S-phase), separated by first-order transition with hysteresis. In the M-phase the large correlation charge gap strongly suppresses the critical current, while the S-phase behaves as a $0$-junction, with a proximitized gap that closes for $\phi=\pi$ to yield a correlated metal. Phase bias and junction transparency can thus serve as tuning knobs to switch between conducting and insulating regimes. Working within the dynamical mean field theory using the numerical renormalization group as the impurity solver, we associate M- and S-phase solutions with the doublet and singlet fixed points of the underlying superconducting Anderson impurity problem. We obtain detailed insight into the spectral structure on all energy scales. In the M-phase, the self-energy has sub-gap resonances symmetrically located around the Fermi level resulting from the splitting of the ''mid-gap pole'' found in Mott insulators; this structure accounts for phase insensitivity.

Title: Radio-Frequency Gasket for Studies of Superconductivity in Diamond Anvil Cells
Authors: Dmitrii V. Semenok, Di Zhou, Viktor V. Struzhkin
Abstract: This work presents the development and testing of a novel radio-frequency (RF) gasket with a Lenz lens surface geometry for contactless measurements in diamond anvil cells (DACs). Conventional RF approaches, which fabricate the Lenz lens onto the diamond anvil itself, preclude the placement of electrical circuits. Our method overcomes this limitation by transferring the RF sensor to a composite Ta-based gasket. The sensor consists of single-turn microcoils that are formed by magnetron sputtering a gold film onto an insulating Ta$_2$O$_5$ layer. The Lenz lens topology is then patterned using focused ion beam etching. We validated this technique using polycrystalline Cu1234 and Bi2212 high-$\textit{T$_c$}$ superconductors at ambient and high pressures. The measurements consistently identified the superconducting transition temperature across carrier frequencies from 111 kHz to 200 MHz. This new gasket technique establishes a reliable and sensitive tool for contactless studies of superconductivity under high pressure.

Title: Unraveling the electronic structure of silicon vacancy centers in 4H-SiC
Authors: Ali Tayefeh Younesi, Minh Tuan Luu, Christopher Linderälv, Vytautas Žalandauskas, Marianne Etzelmüller Bathen, Nguyen Tien Son, Takeshi Ohshima, Gergő Thiering, Lukas Razinkovas, Ronald Ulbricht
Abstract: Point defects in silicon carbide (SiC), particularly the negatively-charged silicon vacancy ($\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$) in 4H-SiC, are leading candidates for scalable quantum technologies due to their favorable spin-optical properties and compatibility with industrial semiconductor fabrication processes. Comprehensive knowledge of a defect's electronic structure is essential for interpreting spin-optical dynamics and for the reliable design and optimization of defect-based quantum devices. Despite extensive study, our knowledge of the electronic structure of $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\ is limited since key excited-state manifolds have remained inaccessible to conventional steady-state spectroscopy. In this study, transient absorption spectroscopy is utilized to probe non-equilibrium electronic transitions of $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\ and to uncover previously unobserved excited states. The first direct observation of the elusive V2' quartet transition is presented, with its broad spectral signature attributed to nonadiabatic vibronic coupling. Within the spin-doublet manifold, which is central to optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) but has remained unresolved spectroscopically, multiple optical transitions are identified. The complete electronic level structure in the relevant energy range is elucidated by combining polarization-resolved spectroscopy, group-theoretical analysis, quantum embedding calculations and first-principles optical lineshape modeling. Collectively, these results provide a microscopic understanding of the $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\ electronic structure. Our approach also establishes a general framework for resolving and understanding complex excited-state manifolds in wide-bandgap color centers.

Title: Fast and accurate quasi-atom method for simultaneous atomistic and continuum simulation of solids
Authors: Artem Chuprov, Egor E. Nuzhin, Alexey A. Tsukanov, Nikolay V. Brilliantov
Abstract: We report a novel hybrid method of simultaneous atomistic simulation of solids in critical regions (contacts surfaces, cracks areas, etc.), along with continuum modeling of other parts. The continuum is treated in terms of quasi-atoms of different size, comprising composite medium. The parameters of interaction potential between the quasi-atoms are optimized to match elastic properties of the composite medium to those of the atomic one. The optimization method coincides conceptually with the online Machine Learning (ML) methods, making it computationally very efficient. Such an approach allows a straightforward application of standard software packages for molecular dynamics (MD), supplemented by the ML-based optimizer. The new method is applied to model systems with a simple, pairwise Lennard-Jones potential, as well with multi-body Tersoff potential, describing covalent bonds. Using LAMMPS software we simulate collision of particles of different size. Comparing simulation results, obtained by the novel method, with full-atomic simulations, we demonstrate its accuracy, validity and overwhelming superiority in computational speed. Furthermore, we compare our method with other hybrid methods, specifically, with the closest one -- AtC (Atomic to Continuum) method. We demonstrate a significant superiority of our approach in computational speed and implementation convenience. Finally, we discuss a possible extension of the method for modeling other phenomena.

Title: Probing topological Floquet states in graphene with ultrafast terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy
Authors: Nils Jacobsen, Michael Schüler, Angel Rubio, Martin Wolf, Melanie Müller, Michael A. Sentef
Abstract: Floquet control of band topology is a central theme in ultrafast quantum materials science. Established experimental probes of light-induced topological states include ultrafast transport and time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, each with important strengths but also well-known limitations. Here we propose ultrafast terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) as a real space energy-resolved probe of Floquet physics. We show that THz-STM enables direct local detection of bulk Floquet gaps and distinct Floquet edge state signatures. We derive a nonequilibrium Green's-function formalism for time-dependent tunneling that directly extends standard STM theory and provides an intuitive interpretation of rectified ultrafast tunneling currents. We apply the approach to bulk graphene and graphene nanoribbons of variable width. For the bulk, we show that THz-STM provides direct spectroscopic access to Floquet-induced gap openings, and we contrast pulsed pump-probe protocols with the continuous-wave Floquet steady-state limit. For finite ribbons, we demonstrate time- and space-resolved imaging of Floquet-induced topological edge states and identify the ribbon-width scale below which edge state protection breaks down. We further show how band structures of graphene nanoribbons and Floquet chiral edge modes can be reconstructed via Floquet quasiparticle interference. Finally we demonstrate that chiral impurities that break time-reversal symmetry induce characteristic spatial THz-STM signatures that can be used as a direct probe of Floquet edge state chirality.

Title: Electron-phonon coupling in EuAl4 under hydrostatic pressure
Authors: A. S. Sukhanov, S. Gebel, A.N. Korshunov, N. D. Andriushin, M.S. Pavlovskii, Y. Gao, K.M. Moya, K. Allen, E. Morosan, M. C. Rahn
Abstract: In the intermetallid rare-earth tetragonal EuAl4 system, competing itinerant exchange mechanisms lead to a complex magnetic phase diagram, featuring a centrosymmetric skyrmion lattice. Previous inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) experiments revealed that the incommensurate charge-density wave (CDW) transition in EuAl4 (TCDW = 142 K) is driven by momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC). We present the results of IXS under high hydrostatic pressure induced by diaond anvils and show how the EPC in EuAl4 is renormalized and suppressed in the material's temperature-pressure phase diagram. Our findings highlight the crucial role of momentum-dependent EPC in the formation of the CDW in EuAl4 and provide further insights into how external pressure can be used to tune charge ordering in quantum materials.

Title: Drift-Diffusion Matching: Embedding dynamics in latent manifolds of asymmetric neural networks
Authors: Ramón Nartallo-Kaluarachchi, Renaud Lambiotte, Alain Goriely
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a theoretical framework for understanding computation in biological neural circuits, yet classical results, such as Hopfield's model of associative memory, rely on symmetric connectivity that restricts network dynamics to gradient-like flows. In contrast, biological networks support rich time-dependent behaviour facilitated by their asymmetry. Here we introduce a general framework, which we term drift-diffusion matching, for training continuous-time RNNs to represent arbitrary stochastic dynamical systems within a low-dimensional latent subspace. Allowing asymmetric connectivity, we show that RNNs can faithfully embed the drift and diffusion of a given stochastic differential equation, including nonlinear and nonequilibrium dynamics such as chaotic attractors. As an application, we construct RNN realisations of stochastic systems that transiently explore various attractors through both input-driven switching and autonomous transitions driven by nonequilibrium currents, which we interpret as models of associative and sequential (episodic) memory. To elucidate how these dynamics are encoded in the network, we introduce decompositions of the RNN based on its asymmetric connectivity and its time-irreversibility. Our results extend attractor neural network theory beyond equilibrium, showing that asymmetric neural populations can implement a broad class of dynamical computations within low-dimensional manifolds, unifying ideas from associative memory, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and neural computation.

Title: Identifying open-orbit topological surface states in dual topological semimetal TaSb$_2$
Authors: Susmita Changdar, Heike Schlörb, Oleksandr Suvorov, Dimitry Efremov, Alexander Yaresko, Rui Lou, Alexander Fedorov, Bernd Büchner, Andy Thomas, Sergey Borisenko, Setti Thirupathaiah
Abstract: TaSb$_2$, a member of the transition metal dipnictide family of materials, hosts the very rare dual topological phase - weak topological insulating state and topological crystalline insulating state along different crystallographic orientations. So far, studies on the electronic structure of transition metal dipnictides have focused on their overall electronic structure and the bulk open-orbit Fermi surfaces. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and transport measurements, we distinguish the intertwined bulk and surface states on the weakly topological $(20\bar{1})$ plane of TaSb$_2$. We identify multiple electron- and hole-like bulk bands, yielding a near-perfect carrier compensation. Crucially, we observe open-orbit FSs parallel to $\bar{L}$-$\bar{Y}$ direction that are entirely of surface origin. Circular-dichroism ARPES reveals $k \rightarrow -k$ spectral reversal, indicating spin-momentum locking and the topological nature of these surface states. Consistent with this, magnetotransport measurements display weak antilocalization, establishing TaSb$_2$ as a platform for spin-polarized topological transport on a weakly topological surface.

Title: Competing states in the $S=1/2$ triangular-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model: a dynamical density-matrix renormalization group study
Authors: Shengtao Jiang, Steven R. White, Steven A. Kivelson, Hong-Chen Jiang
Abstract: Previous studies of the $S=1/2$ triangular-lattice $J_1$--$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet have inferred the existence of a non-magnetic ground-state phase for an intermediate range of $J_2$, but disagree concerning whether it is a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL), a gapless (Dirac) QSL, or a weakly symmetry-broken phase. Using an improved dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method, we investigate the relevant intermediate $J_2$ regime for cylinders with circumferences from 6 to 9. Depending on the initial state and boundary conditions, we find two {\it distinct} variational states. The higher energy state is consistent with a Dirac QSL. In the lower-energy state, both the static and dynamical properties are qualitatively similar to the magnetically ordered state at $J_2=0$, suggestive of either a weakly magnetically ordered non-QSL or a gapped QSL proximate to a continuous transition to such an ordered state.

Title: Low-Temperature Sputtering and Polarity Determination of Vertically Aligned ZnO Nanocolumns
Authors: A. Hamzi, L. Ouardas, M. Saleh, P. Leuasoongnoen, T. Sonklin, P. David, S. le Denmat, O. Leynaud, E. Mossang, B. Fernandez, S. Pojprapai, D. Mornex, R. Songmuang
Abstract: We report the low temperature growth of vertically aligned ZnO nanocolumns on Si substrates by using reactive radio frequency magnetron this http URL sputtering pressure combined with low substrate temperatures induce a pronounced self shadowing effect,leading to the formation of isolated nanocolumns. In contrast, lower sputtering pressure promotes void filling in deposited films, favouring the growth of dense, low roughness columnar films. Modification of native SiOx on Si surfaces via substrate preheating prior to deposition, alters the initial nucleation stage, thereby determining dominant polarity and morphology of ZnO nanostructures. O polar columnar films and nanocolumns exhibit higher effective piezoelectric coefficient, corresponding to their higher differential resistance and reduced dielectric loss, suggesting suppressed carrier induced screening of piezoelectric charges. This low thermal budget, scalable sputtering approach provides an alternative route for integrating ZnO nanostructures onto thermal constrained substrates, including those used in flexible and wearable electronics.

Title: Sub-1-Angstrom-Resolution Imaging Reveals Phase Contrast Transition in Ice Ih Caused by Basal Stacking Faults
Authors: Jingshan S. Du, Suvo Banik, Lehan Yao, Shuai Zhang, Subramanian K. R. S. Sankaranarayanan, James J. De Yoreo
Abstract: Phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of hexagonal ice (Ih) along [0001] sometimes shows a honeycomb-like pattern, often interpreted as individual oxygen columns in single crystals. Here, we show that this pattern commonly arises from intrinsic basal stacking faults instead. A translational boundary separating domains of comparable thickness, with an in-plane offset of (2/3a + 1/3b), produces this honeycomb-like contrast. Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [0001] but with a 3-fold symmetry. We imaged this structure at a record-breaking line resolution of 89 picometers, finer than the O-H covalent bond length. These findings highlight the defect tolerance of ice's molecular packing and clarify the structural relationships among hexagonal, stacking-disordered, and cubic ice phases. This resolution milestone opens new avenues for characterizing subtle structural perturbations of water in the solid state.

Title: Ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic framework exceeding the ultimate hydrogen storage targets: a first-principles multiscale computational study
Authors: Marcus Djokic, Jose L. Mendoza-Cortes
Abstract: The development of efficient hydrogen storage materials is crucial for advancing the hydrogen economy and meeting the U.S. Department of Energy's targets of 6.5 wt\% and 50 g \ce{H2} L$^{-1}$ for automotive applications. We present a computational study of ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for hydrogen storage. Following the \textbf{M}ulti-binding \textbf{S}ites \textbf{U}nited in \textbf{C}ovalent-\textbf{O}rganic \textbf{F}ramework (MSUCOF) approach, we introduce MSUCOF-4-FeCp, designed by incorporating ferrocene (\ce{FeCp2}) moieties into IRCOF-102. Notably, it achieves exceptional performance with gravimetric and volumetric uptakes of 18.0 wt\% and 72.6 g \ce{H2} L$^{-1}$ at 298 K and 700 bar. The material exhibits optimal binding energies (15--20 kJ$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$) ensuring both high storage capacity and deliverable hydrogen under practical conditions. This work establishes ferrocene functionalization as a cost-effective alternative to precious metal incorporation in COFs.

Title: From Classical to Quantum: Extending Prometheus for Unsupervised Discovery of Phase Transitions in Three Dimensions and Quantum Systems
Authors: Brandon Yee, Wilson Collins, Maximilian Rutkowski
Abstract: We extend the Prometheus framework for unsupervised phase transition discovery from 2D classical systems to 3D classical and quantum many-body systems, addressing scalability in higher dimensions and generalization to quantum fluctuations. For the 3D Ising model ($L \leq 32$), the framework detects the critical temperature within 0.01\% of literature values ($T_c/J = 4.511 \pm 0.005$) and extracts critical exponents with $\geq 70\%$ accuracy ($\beta = 0.328 \pm 0.015$, $\gamma = 1.24 \pm 0.06$, $\nu = 0.632 \pm 0.025$), correctly identifying the 3D Ising universality class via $\chi^2$ comparison ($p = 0.72$) without analytical guidance. For quantum systems, we developed quantum-aware VAE (Q-VAE) architectures using complex-valued wavefunctions and fidelity-based loss. Applied to the transverse field Ising model, we achieve 2\% accuracy in quantum critical point detection ($h_c/J = 1.00 \pm 0.02$) and successfully discover ground state magnetization as the order parameter ($r = 0.97$). Notably, for the disordered transverse field Ising model, we detect exotic infinite-randomness criticality characterized by activated dynamical scaling $\ln \xi \sim |h - h_c|^{-\psi}$, extracting a tunneling exponent $\psi = 0.48 \pm 0.08$ consistent with theoretical predictions ($\psi = 0.5$). This demonstrates that unsupervised learning can identify qualitatively different types of critical behavior, not just locate critical points. Our systematic validation across classical thermal transitions ($T = 0$ to $T > 0$) and quantum phase transitions ($T = 0$, varying $h$) establishes that VAE-based discovery generalizes across fundamentally different physical domains, providing robust tools for exploring phase diagrams where analytical solutions are unavailable.

Title: Anisotropy-driven interfacial magnetism in Ru-deficient SrRuO$_3$ thin films
Authors: Vítor A. de Oliveira Lima, Michael I. Faley, Asmaa Qdemat, Valeria Lauter, Haile Ambaye, Omar Concepción, Ankita Singh, Emmanuel Kentzinger, Milan Radovic, Shibrabata Nandi, Thomas Brückel, Connie Bednarski-Meinke
Abstract: While stoichiometric SrRuO$_3$ (SRO) is a metallic itinerant ferromagnet with relatively homogeneous magnetization, Ru deficiency provides a powerful route to alter its electronic transport and depth-dependent magnetic properties. Ru-deficient SRO thin films grown by radio-frequency high oxygen pressure sputtering were investigated using a combination of X-ray reflectivity, polarized neutron reflectometry, off-specular neutron scattering, scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electrical transport, and magnetometry. Structural and compositional analyses reveal that Ru deficiency is intrinsic to the films, with an enhanced deficiency at the interfaces. As a result, coherent electronic transport is suppressed and the saturation magnetization is reduced, while the Curie temperature remains largely unaffected, placing Ru-deficient SRO in a regime consistent with ferromagnetic insulator-like behavior. Depth- and lateral-resolved magnetic measurements further show that the interfacial regions remain ferromagnetic but exhibit enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which constrains the local magnetization to remain predominantly out-of-plane and strongly reduces its in-plane projection. Our results establish Ru deficiency as a key control parameter governing transport, magnetization, and anisotropy in SRO thin films and highlight defect and interface engineering as powerful routes to tailor interfacial magnetism in correlated oxide heterostructures.

Title: Stick-slip dynamics in an interleaved system with self-amplified friction
Authors: A. Plati, F. Restagno, C. Poulard
Abstract: Understanding how stick-slip dynamics manifests in diverse physical conditions is a crucial topic in tribology. Although it has been extensively studied in simple frictional configurations, the characterization of stick-slip behavior in complex assemblies is challenging. This work presents the first systematic investigation of stick-slip dynamics in a system with multiple contact surfaces undergoing friction amplification through conversion of traction forces into normal compression. Using interleaved paper blocks as a model system, we combine force measurements and image processing to characterize stick-slip events occurring when the two blocks are pulled apart at different detachment velocities. We find that both the peak force and the amplitude of the stick-slip events decrease along with the system's detachment. By combining a previously designed model for friction amplification and the stick-slip dynamics predicted by a simple frictional spring-block system, we link the observed behavior to the evolving normal compression within the assembly. Through force measurements and imaging, we extract the effective stiffness of the system from stick-slip events at low velocities and relate it to the system's normal compression. We then predict the observed decrease of the global stiffness as function of the detachment by considering the spatial distribution of normal forces within the assembly, which determines an effective number of sheets contributing to the system's mechanical response. Our findings reveal a non-trivial interplay between internal stress distribution and mechanical response mediated by frictional forces, with implications for granular materials, textiles, fibrous systems, and mechanical metamaterials.

Title: Optical and transport anisotropies in spin-textured altermagnets
Authors: Andrea Maiani
Abstract: Spin textures are ubiquitous in antiferromagnets, yet their consequences for altermagnets remain largely unexplored. We show that spatial variations of the Néel order act on the low-energy electrons as effective gauge fields, leading to strong anisotropies in both dc transport and optical absorption, even without intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. As a concrete example, we analyze a coplanar spin helix and predict that the principal axes of the conductivity and linear dichroism are set by the helix wave vector and can be tuned by the texture geometry. Our results point to polarization-resolved optics and anisotropic transport as direct probes of textured altermagnetic states, and suggest a simple route to direction-selectivity.

Title: Large Transverse Thermoelectric Effect in Weyl Semimetal TaIrTe$_4$ Engineered for Photodetection
Authors: Morgan G. Blevins, Xianglin Ji, Vivian J. Santamaria-Garcia, Abhishek Mukherjee, Thanh Nguyen, Mingda Li, Svetlana V. Boriskina
Abstract: Anomalous local photocurrent generation via second-order nonlinear and thermoelectric responses is a signature of many topological semimetals. The emergence of these photocurrents is inherently linked to symmetry breaking and anisotropy of their crystal lattices. Studies of type-II Weyl semimetals of group C$_{2v}$ (WTe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, TaIrTe$_4$) have reported anomalous, nonlocal photocurrents localized to crystals edges or far from electrodes, which are highly dependent on the geometry of the material sample. While originally attributed to a nonlinear charge current response, it was recently shown that these currents could instead be attributed to the anisotropic Seebeck coefficients of the materials. Here, we confirm that anomalous photocurrents observed in TaIrTe$_4$ under either visible or far-infrared far-field illumination originate from the large transverse thermoelectric effect. We engineer the mutual orientation of crystal edges and electrodes as well as the thermal environment of TaIrTe$_4$ to control and amplify its spatial photocurrent response. We show that substrate engineering can locally enhance photocurrent. This framework of thermal device engineering can enable broadband photo detection schemes by leveraging spectral and spatial dependence of photocurrents for applications like wavefront sensing, beam positioning, and edge detection.

Title: Practical and improved density functionals for computational catalysis on metal surfaces
Authors: Benjamin X. Shi, Timothy Berkelbach
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has been critical towards our current atomistic understanding of catalysis on transition-metal surfaces. It has opened new paradigms in rational catalyst design, predicting fundamental properties, like the adsorption energy and reaction barriers, linked to catalytic performance. However, such applications depend sensitively on the predictive accuracy of DFT and achieving experimental-level reliability, so-called transition-metal chemical accuracy (13 kJ/mol), remains challenging for present density functional approximations (DFAs) or even methods beyond DFT. We introduce a new framework for designing DFAs tailored towards studying molecules adsorbed on transition-metal surfaces, building upon recent developments in non-self-consistent DFAs. We propose two functionals within this framework, demonstrating that transition-metal chemical accuracy can be achieved across a diverse set of 39 adsorption reactions while delivering consistent performance for 17 barrier heights. Moreover, we show that these non-self-consistent DFAs address qualitative failures that challenge current self-consistent DFAs, such as CO adsorption on Pt(111) and graphene on Ni(111). The resulting functionals are computationally practical and compatible with existing DFT codes, with scripts and workflows provided to use them. Looking ahead, this framework establishes a path toward developing more accurate and sophisticated DFAs for computational heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.

Title: Nematostriction in frustrated two-dimensional Heisenberg models
Authors: Olav F. Syljuåsen, Jens Paaske
Abstract: We investigate the nematic phase transition in the Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$-model on square and triangular lattices, accounting for finite lattice compressibility and bond-length-dependent magnetic exchange. Using Nematic Bond Theory, a diagrammatic self-consistent method, we study the nematostriction that happens when the onset of nematic order in the spin-system drives a concomitant structural phase transition. We analyze the mechanisms by which the magnetoelastic couplings renormalize the critical temperature and modify the phonon spectrum. The magnetoelastic feeback can also alter fundamentally the nature of the phase transition. Specifically, on the square lattice, the transition shifts from continuous to weakly first-order (discontinuous) beyond a critical magnetoelastic coupling threshold. Conversely, on the triangular lattice, the transition remains discontinuous regardless of coupling strength.

Title: Stacking-Engineered Thermal Transport and Phonon Filtering in Rhenium Disulfide
Authors: Yongjian Zhou, Haoran Cui, Zefang Ye, Jung-Fu Lin, Yan Wang, Yaguo Wang
Abstract: Cross-plane heat transport is a critical bottleneck for van der Waals (vdW) electronics, yet its microscopic governing principles remain elusive. We demonstrate that stacking order is an effective control knob for cross-plane phonon transport in multilayer Rhenium Disulfide (ReS2). Thickness-dependent thermal conductivity measurements reveal remarkably long cross-plane phonon mean free paths (MFPs) (>= 200-300 nm) and provide a direct experimental observation of the transition from quasi-ballistic transport to a thickness-independent ballistic limit. AA stacking exhibits nearly double the cross-plane thermal conductivity of AB stacking, driven by longer acoustic phonon lifetimes from a more "coherent" interlayer registry. Integrated deep neural-network molecular dynamics reveals that phonon filtering in ReS2 is fundamentally frequency-selective: weak vdW coupling acts as a low-pass filter, whereas stronger coupling broadens the transmission passband. These results establish ReS2 as a model system where stacking order and interlayer coupling can be engineered to tune heat conduction across diffusive, quasi-ballistic, and ballistic regimes, offering a new framework for thermal management in 2D electronics.

Title: Signatures of Dynes superconductivity in the THz response of ALD-grown NbN thin films
Authors: Frederik Bolle, Yayi Lin, Ozan Saritas, Martin Dressel, Ciprian Padurariu, Sahitya Varma Vegesna, Nitesh Yerra, Heidemarie Krüger, Marc Scheffler
Abstract: The frequency-dependent complex optical conductivity reflects key properties of superconductors, such as the energy gap in the density of states (DOS) and the superfluid density. For disordered superconductors, the optical conductivity often can be described within Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, while in corresponding tunneling experiments, deviations in the observed DOS typically require modelling by the phenomenological Dynes formula. The implications of such Dynes DOS for optics were rarely discussed so far. Here we probe the terahertz conductivity of superconducting NbN thin films with thicknesses ranging from 4.5 to 20nm, which were grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Our frequency range from 0.3 to 2.1 THz covers energies below and above the spectral gap. For 20nm thick NbN, we find in the optical conductivity distinct deviations from the BCS model, including a step-like characteristic in the absorption at half the zero-temperature spectral gap. These observations can be fully captured by Dynes electrodynamics with a small and temperature-independent pair-breaking rate. For the other films, we also observe signs of Dynes electrodynamics, and we discuss the evolution of the energy gap, the superfluid density, and the pair-breaking rate as function of film thickness.

Title: Controlled Theory of Skyrmion Chern Bands in Moiré Quantum Materials: Quantum Geometry and Collective Dynamics
Authors: Yi-Hsien Du
Abstract: Recent experiments in moiré quantum materials exhibit quantized Hall states without an external magnetic field, motivating continuum mechanisms based on smooth moiré-periodic pseudospin textures. We present a controlled theory of skyrmion Chern bands generated by such textures. An exact local $SU(2)$ transformation reveals an emergent non-Abelian gauge field; for large branch splitting we perform an operator-level Schrieffer-Wolff expansion, yielding a single-branch Hamiltonian together with systematically dressed physical operators that define the projected interacting theory beyond strict adiabaticity. The leading dynamics is governed by a $U(1)$ Berry connection whose flux is set by the skyrmion density, while controlled non-adiabatic corrections are fixed by the texture's real-space quantum geometric tensor. In a Landau-level representation built from the averaged emergent field, moiré-periodic modulations induce Umklapp-resolved deformations of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman kinematics and microscopic sources of excess optical quantum weight above the topological lower bound. Assuming a gapped Hall phase, we further derive a skyrmion-crystal effective field theory with a universal Berry-phase term and a noncommutative magnetophonon. Our results provide experimentally accessible signatures for twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers and rhombohedral graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride.

Title: Majorana Signatures in Planar Tunneling through a Kitaev Spin Liquid
Authors: Weiyao Li, Vitor Dantas, Wen-Han Kao, Natalia B. Perkins
Abstract: We propose a planar tunneling setup to probe vacancy-bound Majorana modes in the chiral Kitaev spin liquid. In this geometry, the inelastic tunneling conductance can be expressed directly in terms of real-space spin correlations, establishing a link between measurable spectra and the underlying fractionalized excitations. We show that spin vacancies host localized Majorana states that generate sharp near-zero-bias features, well separated from the continuum of bulk spin excitations. Compared to local STM measurements, the planar configuration naturally enhances the signal by coherently summing over multiple vacancies, reducing spatial resolution requirements. Our results demonstrate a realistic and scalable route to detect Majorana excitations in Kitaev materials.

Title: 3d Conformal Field Theories via Fuzzy Sphere Algebra
Authors: Luisa Eck, Zhenghan Wang
Abstract: Fuzzy sphere models conjecturally realize 3d CFTs in small systems of spinful fermions, but why they work so well is still not fully understood. Their Hamiltonians are built from electron density operators projected to the lowest Landau Level. We analyze the algebra of the density modes and verify that it satisfies the Jacobi identity. The fuzzy sphere geometry admits two thermodynamic limits: a local planar limit yielding the fuzzy plane, and a commutative limit yielding an ordinary sphere. In the planar limit, high-angular-momentum modes recover the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, whereas in the commutative limit the low-angular-momentum modes become semiclassical. We further find an explicit representation of the conformal algebra so(3,2) in the minimal two-electron system and extend it to larger systems via an so(3) equivariant coproduct. Because the coproduct splits one so(3) representation into a tensor product, it is structurally mismatched with the thermodynamic limit of critical fuzzy sphere Hamiltonians.

Title: The effect of graphene orientation on permeability and corrosion initiation under composite coatings
Authors: Majid Shaker, Erfan Salahinejad, Weiqi Cao, Xiaomin Meng, Vahdat Zahedi Asl, Qi Ge
Abstract: The unique anisotropic properties of graphene, particularly impermeability, have made it a promising candidate for further advances in corrosion prevention applications. Despite the large number of experimental works divulging the use of graphene in anticorrosion coatings, there is no report on the numerical modelling and simulation of the relationships between the orientation of graphene sheets in composite coatings and the introduced corrosion protection efficiency, to our knowledge. Herein, it is tried to model the influence of the orientation of graphene sheets dispersed in organic coatings on the diffusivity and flux of corrosive substances besides the corrosion initiation time of the protected substrates. To discover the relationship between the graphene orientation and corrosion-related phenomena, this study introduces a novel model consisting of a trigonometric factor named unprotected projected surface area proportion, which calculates corrosion-related parameters based on the principal Fick's laws. The model reveals that the decrease in the angle between graphene sheets and the substrate is highly beneficial for postponing the corrosion onset. It is accordingly estimated that a mismatch angle of 10 degree can slow down the diffusion process significantly and delay the corrosion initiation by around 65 times in a 100 micron thick epoxy/graphene composite coating in comparison to the counterpart with the perpendicular alignment. The predicted corrosion parameters were in a good agreement with the experimental data, indicating the merit of the proposed model. Thus, this model can be further employed as the fundamental of future research on the optimum graphene orientation in anticorrosion composite coatings.

Title: A Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Neural Operator for Mechanics of Spinodal Metamaterial
Authors: Pu You, Hongshun Chen, Bahador Bahmani, Horacio D. Espinosa
Abstract: Cellular metamaterials offer a vast design space for tailoring nonlinear mechanical responses, yet exploring this space with conventional modeling approaches is often infeasible or not scalable. To fully exploit their nonlinear behavior for inverse design, it is essential to learn the full stress-strain response rather than relying on bulk quantities, motivating the use of neural operators for function-to-function mapping. However, data-driven modeling of nonlinear response for metamaterials is severely constrained by the limited availability of costly experimental data. Here, we propose a Bayesian multi-fidelity deep operator network that aggregates abundant low-fidelity finite element simulations with sparse high-fidelity experimental data from in-situ nanomechanical experiments on spinodal metamaterials, enabling heterogeneous information aggregation. A hybrid Bayesian active learning strategy is introduced to select informative samples by jointly maximizing epistemic uncertainty and geometric diversity of the microstructure, substantially reducing the cost of 3D nonlinear simulations. This approach adaptively trains the low-fidelity operator, which is then augmented by a high-fidelity Bayesian residual learner. We demonstrate that only 22 strategically selected samples from a design pool of 3000 are sufficient to achieve an 84.1 percent reduction in MSE compared to the high-fidelity baseline. The framework significantly outperforms single-fidelity baselines, providing superior predictions for full nonlinear stress-strain responses as well as stiffness, strength, and energy absorption. This work provides a robust, data-efficient pathway for the inverse design and constitutive modeling of cellular metamaterials.

Title: Entanglement in quantum spin chains is strictly finite at any temperature
Authors: Ainesh Bakshi, Soonwon Choi, Saúl Pilatowsky-Cameo
Abstract: Entanglement is the hallmark of quantum physics, yet its characterization in interacting many-body systems at thermal equilibrium remains one of the most important challenges in quantum statistical physics. We prove that the Gibbs state of any quantum spin chain can be exactly decomposed into a mixture of matrix product states with a bond dimension that is independent of the system size, at any finite temperature. As a consequence, the Schmidt number, arguably the most stringent measure of bipartite entanglement, is strictly finite for thermal states, even in the thermodynamic limit. Our decomposition is explicit and is accompanied by an efficient classical algorithm to sample the resulting matrix product states.

Title: Spatiotemporal noise stabilizes unbounded diversity in strongly-competitive communities
Authors: Amer Al-Hiyasat, Daniel W. Swartz, Jeff Gore, Mehran Kardar
Abstract: Classical ecological models predict that large, diverse communities should be unstable, presenting a central challenge to explaining the stable biodiversity seen in nature. We revisit this long-standing problem by extending the generalized Lotka-Volterra model to include both spatial structure and environmental fluctuations across space and time. We find that neither space nor environmental noise alone can resolve the tension between diversity and stability, but that their combined effects permit arbitrarily many species to stably coexist despite strongly disordered competitive interactions. We analytically characterize the noise-induced transition to coexistence, showing that spatiotemporal noise drives an anomalous scaling of abundance fluctuations, known empirically as Taylor's law. At the community level, this manifests as an effective sublinear self-inhibition that renders the community stable and asymptotically neutral in the high-diversity limit. Spatiotemporal noise thus provides a novel resolution to the diversity-stability paradox and a generic mechanism by which complex communities can persist.

Title: Quantum Algorithm Framework for Phase-Contrast Transmission Electron Microscopy Image Simulation
Authors: Sean D. Lam, Roberto dos Reis
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithmic framework for simulating phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (CTEM) image formation using a fault-tolerant, gate-based quantum circuit model. The electron wavefield on an $N\times N$ grid is amplitude-encoded into a $2\log_2 N$-qubit register. Free-space propagation and objective-lens aberrations are implemented via two-dimensional quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs) and diagonal phase operators in reciprocal space, while specimen interaction is modeled under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA) as a position-dependent phase grating. We validate projected potentials, contrast transfer function (CTF) behavior, and image contrast trends against classical multislice simulations for MoS$_2$ over experimentally relevant parameters, and provide resource estimates and key assumptions that determine end-to-end runtime. While extracting complete $N\times N$ intensity images requires $O(N^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements that preclude advantage for full-image reconstruction, the framework enables quantum advantage for tasks requiring Fourier-space queries, global image statistics, or phase-coherent observables inaccessible to classical intensity-only detection. This framework provides a physics-grounded mapping from CTEM theory to quantum circuits and establishes a baseline for extending toward full multislice and inelastic scattering models.

Title: A probabilistic interpretation for interpolation Macdonald polynomials
Authors: Houcine Ben Dali, Lauren Williams
Abstract: Previous work of Ayyer, Martin, and Williams gave a probabilistic interpretation of the Macdonald polynomials $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;1,t)$ at $q=1$ in terms of a Markov chain called the multispecies $t$-Push TASEP, a Markov chain involving particles of types $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n$ hopping around a ring. In particular, they showed that for each composition $\eta$ obtained by permuting the parts of $\lambda$, the stationary probability of being in state $\eta$ is proportional to the ASEP polynomial $F_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n; 1,t)$, and the normalizing constant (or partition function) is $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n; 1,t)$. There is an inhomogeneous generalization of Macdonald polynomials due to Knop and Sahi called interpolation Macdonald polynomials $P^*_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$, as well as an inhomogeneous generalization of ASEP polynomials called interpolation ASEP polynomials $F^*_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$ that we introduced in previous work. In this article we introduce a new Markov chain called the interpolation $t$-Push TASEP, and show that its steady state probabilities and partition function are given by the interpolation ASEP polynomials and the interpolation Macdonald polynomial, evaluated at $q=1$. This generalizes the previous result of Ayyer, Martin, and Williams.

Title: Optical effects in modified Maxwell electrodynamics under a uniform electromagnetic background
Authors: M. J. Neves, Pedro D. S. Silva
Abstract: In this work, we investigate optical effects in modified Maxwell electrodynamics (ModMax) in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. Considering uniform and constant magnetic and electric backgrounds, the solutions for the refractive indices are revisited. Using these results, we obtain the propagating modes and the phase shift (birefringence) for plane wave solutions in the presence of a pure magnetic background field. Afterwards, we investigate the Goos-Hänchen effect considering the interface between a simple dielectric and a medium whose electromagnetic response tensors are ruled by the ModMax electrodynamics. Further, based on the general reflection problem, we discuss the complex Kerr rotation with both the electric $(E)$ and magnetic $(B)$ background fields, considering two main cases: i) $B>E$ and ii) $E>B$. Our findings indicate that the $\gamma$ parameter and ratios $(B/E)$ and $(E/B)$ play a central role in describing the Kerr signals (rotation and ellipticity) of systems with optical effects induced by non-linear electromagnetic effects.

Title: Time-Domain Two-Magnon Interference Enabled by a Tunable Beamsplitter
Authors: Cody Trevillian, Steven Louis, Vasyl Tyberkevych
Abstract: This letter presents a model system for controllable two-magnon interference in the time domain. This two-magnon interference, i.e., a magnonic analog to the photonic Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, is supported by a tunable magnonic beamsplitter operation formed in a hybrid cavity magnonic system comprising a pair of mutually coupled magnon modes. By applying a time-dependent magnetic field, magnons can be excited independently in each mode and subsequently brought into interaction, shifting from independent to collective oscillations, to realize a controllable magnonic beamsplitter. When the beamsplitter operation is applied to an initially unentangled two-magnon state, a maximally entangled magnonic $N00N$ state with tunable phase sensitivity is produced. These findings suggest that two-magnon interference in hybrid cavity magnonic systems may enable novel quantum metrological devices to study fundamental magnon dynamics and contribute to developing hybrid magnonic quantum computing architectures.

Title: Ward-Takahashi Identity and Gauge-Invariant Response Theory for Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Hongchao Li, Xie-Hang Yu, Masaya Nakagawa, Masahito Ueda
Abstract: We derive the Ward-Takahashi identity and establish the gauge-invariant response theory for open quantum systems described by Lindbladians to show that particle-number conservation is not necessary to satisfy gauge invariance. We construct an observable which can be used to test the gauge invariance in the absence of particle-number conservation. We derive the low-energy collective modes that emerge as a consequence of gauge invariance in open quantum systems, and find that two-body loss induces diffusive modes in dissipative Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductivity. Possible experimental situations for testing gauge invariance in open quantum systems are also discussed.

Title: Surface defects in carbon-doped hexagonal boron nitride for negative-contrast direct laser writing
Authors: Dmitrii Litvinov, Virgil Gavriliuc, Magdalena Grzeszczyk, Kristina Vaklinova, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kostya S. Novoselov, Maciej Koperski
Abstract: Radiative defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are active in a broad spectral range from deep ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. Representatives of these defects act as bright single photon sources, spin-1 systems, and multiproperty atomic-scale sensors. They are predominantly investigated in bulk hBN films, where defects are decoupled from surface and interfacial effects. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of surface defects optically active in the green/yellow visible spectral range, which exhibit photophysical properties distinct from their bulk counterparts. High-power resonant laser illumination quenched the emission from the ensemble of such defects, which was attributed to a light-driven structural reconfiguration. The quenched defects were found to recover their emissive capabilities via a thermal cycling process, revealing an activation energy of 24.5 meV for the structural transition. Alternatively, permanent quenching of the defects was triggered by surface chemistry, involving lithiation-enabled attachment of functional groups. These mechanisms were utilized to realize negative-contrast direct laser writing, designing arbitrary geometric emissive patterns on demand in a microscopic configuration. The surface-active radiative centers in hBN appear particularly attractive for exploring environmental sensitivity, surface science, and coupling to photonic structures or electronic devices by taking unique advantage of the two-dimensional characteristics of the host lattice.

Title: Defect relative entropy in symmetric orbifold CFTs
Authors: Mostafa Ghasemi
Abstract: In this work, we compute the defect relative entropy between topological defects in the symmetric product orbifold CFT $\mathrm{Sym}^N(M) = M^{\otimes N}/S_N$. Our analysis covers two distinct classes of defects: universal defects, which realize the $\mathrm{Rep}(S_N)$ non-invertible symmetry, and non-universal defects. We show that the defect relative entropy reduces to a Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence. The resulting expression decomposes naturally into two contributions: one governed by characters of the symmetric group $S_N$, and the other controlled by modular $S$-matrix elements of the seed RCFT. Remarkably, both sets of data appear as probability distributions, yielding an information-theoretic interpretation of permutation group data and modular data within the symmetric orbifold. The structure of the divergence depends sensitively on the defect class. For universal defects, only the permutation group data contributes; for maximally fractional defects, both permutation and modular data enter and together define the relevant probability distributions. This feature suggests that the maximally fractional defect can be understood as a kind of product of the RCFT defect and the symmetric orbifold defect.

Title: Causally constrained reduced-order neural models of complex turbulent dynamical systems
Authors: Fabrizio Falasca, Laure Zanna
Abstract: We introduce a flexible framework based on response theory and score matching to suppress spurious, noncausal dependencies in reduced-order neural emulators of turbulent systems, focusing on climate dynamics as a proof-of-concept. We showcase the approach using the stochastic Charney-DeVore model as a relevant prototype for low-frequency atmospheric variability. We show that the resulting causal constraints enhance neural emulators' ability to respond to both weak and strong external forcings, despite being trained exclusively on unforced data. The approach is broadly applicable to modeling complex turbulent dynamical systems in reduced spaces and can be readily integrated into general neural network architectures.

Title: Geometry Challenges Entropy: Regime-DependentRectification in Nanofluidic Cascades
Authors: Ting Peng
Abstract: Can geometry alone reshape equilibrium? Cascaded nanofluidic chambers show complex accumulation patterns, traditionally attributed to geometric diode effects. We use 3D molecular dynamics to decouple funnel rectification from boundary reflection. Simulations with argon parameters (r = 0.19 nm) reveal a striking "reverse" rectification in a 2-chamber setup: the narrow side accumulates over 5x more particles (N_1/N_0 = 5.37 +/- 0.01, p < 0.0001). In a 10-chamber argon cascade, this effect drives massive downstream accumulation. A symmetric control (w_L = w_R) eliminates the gradient, confirming that funnel asymmetry - not boundary/edge effects - is the primary driver in the ballistic regime. By contrast, the super-atom regime is dominated by boundary reflection. Our results challenge standard entropic transport theory and provide design rules for passive, geometry-driven density gradients - no pump, no drive.

Title: Anomalies in quantum spin systems and Nielsen-Ninomiya type Theorems
Authors: Ruizhi Liu
Abstract: We provide an algebraic perspective on Nielsen--Ninomiya-type no-go theorems arising from group cohomological anomalies, revisiting in particular the version proved by Kapustin and Sopenko. Departing from their analytic proof, our approach emphasizes the algebraic structure of symmetry actions and the local computability of anomaly indices. We demonstrate that this no-go theorem is due to a fundamental algebraic incompatibility between anomaly data and the dimension of local Hilbert spaces. Specifically, when an anomaly index is locally computable via quasi-local unitary operators, a suitable gauge fixing trivializes their (generalized) determinants, imposing unexpected and nontrivial constraints on lattice regularizations.

Title: Timescale for macroscopic equilibration in isolated quantum systems: a rigorous derivation for free fermions
Authors: Takashi Hara, Tatsuhiko Koike
Abstract: For a class of translation-invariant free-fermion systems (including those with uniform nearest neighbor hopping) on a $d$-dimensional $L \times \cdots \times L$ hypercubic lattice, we prove that, starting from an arbitrary pure initial state, the system equilibrates with respect to the coarse-grained density within a timescale of order $L$. This scaling is optimal, since there exist initial states whose equilibration requires time of order $L$. Our result establishes $O(L)$ as the equilibration timescale, as is expected in normal macroscopic systems with a conserved quantity, such as total number of particles.

Title: Quarkyonic matter and hadron-quark crossover from an ultracold atom perspective
Authors: Hiroyuki Tajima, Kei Iida, Toru Kojo, Haozhao Liang
Abstract: The dense matter equation of state is of great interest due to the recent development of astrophysical observations for neutron stars. A rapid increase in pressure indicates a continuous crossover from a hadron phase to a quark phase without any phase transitions, yet its microscopic mechanism remains elusive. Recently, a peak in the speed of sound and a baryon momentum-shell structure, which are predicted from a quarkyonic matter picture, have been regarded as key features of the hadron-quark crossover. In this work, we explore a field-theoretical framework to describe the hadron-quark crossover, drawing an analogy with the Bose-Einstein condensate to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BEC-BCS) crossover established in ultracold atomic experiments. Strikingly, a peak in the speed of sound and the baryon momentum-shell structure can simultaneously be explained by the tripling fluctuation effect arising from a different context of quantum many-body physics. We demonstrate these properties in a simplified model and provide a microscopic derivation of the quarkyonic matter model within our field-theoretical framework.

Title: Electron readout contrast enhancement in the parallel nuclear regime of an exchange-coupled donor spin qubit system

Abstract: Recent experiments on donor-based spin qubits in silicon have leveraged the exchange interaction between electrons bound to separate donor nuclei to perform two-qubit operations. A consistently observed yet unexplained phenomenon in such systems is the significant increase in electron readout contrast, measured via Elzerman-style readout to a single-electron transistor (SET) island, when the donor nuclei are initialized in a parallel spin orientation compared to an anti-parallel orientation. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the exchange-coupled donor system in the parallel nuclear regime and propose a physical mechanism for this effect. We attribute the enhanced readout contrast to an additional electron tunneling event to the SET during a single read period, when the donor nuclei are aligned in a parallel spin configuration. These insights inform strategies for improving electron readout fidelity in these systems and contribute to a more complete understanding of spin-dependent tunnelling processes in donor-based qubit architectures.

Title: Homological origin of transversal implementability of logical diagonal gates in quantum CSS codes
Authors: Junichi Haruna
Abstract: Transversal Pauli Z rotations provide a natural route to fault-tolerant logical diagonal gates in quantum CSS codes, yet their capability is fundamentally constrained. In this work, we formulate the refinement problem of realizing a logical diagonal gate by a transversal implementation with a finer discrete rotation angle and show that its solvability is completely characterized by the Bockstein homomorphism in homology theory. Furthermore, we prove that the linear independence of the X-stabilizer generators together with the commutativity condition modulo a power of two ensures the existence of transversal implementations of all logical Pauli Z rotations with discrete angles in general CSS codes. Our results identify a canonical homological obstruction governing transversal implementability and provide a conceptual foundation for a formal theory of transversal structures in quantum error correction.

Title: Dissipative Spectroscopy
Authors: Xudong He, Yu Chen
Abstract: We introduce dissipative spectroscopy as a framework for extracting spectral information from quantum systems via controlled dissipation. By establishing a general dissipative response theory applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian environments, we develop a protocol to access the dissipative spectrum (DS) through driven oscillation-dissipation resonance. We show that the DS can identify two-particle soft modes near quantum critical points and, on the normal-phase side, predict the emergence of macroscopic order exhibiting power-law growth following a dissipation quench. These distinctive signatures appear in quasiparticle-dominant regimes, previously considered trivial. Furthermore, we introduce extended dissipative susceptibilities that capture leading memory effects and demonstrate their utility in a dissipative fermionic model. Our results indicate that the DS is readily accessible and offers a versatile tool for probing equilibrium properties as well as predicting nonequilibrium dissipative dynamics.

Title: On the challenge of simulating dipolar contributions to spin relaxation with generalized cluster correlation expansion methods
Authors: Conor Ryan, Alessandro Lunghi
Abstract: The study of spin decoherence is often performed by assuming that spin-phonon interactions lead to relaxation at high temperatures, and spin-spin dipolar interactions instead contribute to pure dephasing at low temperatures. This has resulted in the neglect of spin relaxation due to spin-spin dipolar interactions and its influence on decoherence at low temperatures. For a complete understanding of low temperature spin dynamics, it is then imperative to focus also on the latter mechanism. One such method which has shown great promise in the efficient calculation of central spin dynamics due to spin-spin dipolar interactions with a surrounding spin bath is the Cluster-Correlation Expansion (CCE). An extension of this method through the explicit inclusion of the central spin degrees of freedom, known as the generalized Cluster-Correlation Expansion (gCCE) is capable of simulating the transfer of energy from the central spin into the bath, and thus could have the potential to investigate spin relaxation in this setting. In this work, we show that gCCE, in its standard form, is insufficient for providing even a qualitatively accurate description of spin-spin relaxation. A full mathematical deconstruction of the underlying theory of gCCE clearly points to the origin of such a breakdown and provides a starting point for its potential future resolution.

Title: Boundary conditions for the Schrödinger equation in the numerical simulation of quantum systems
Authors: Marco Patriarca
Abstract: We study the problem of the boundary conditions in the numerical simulation of closed and open quantum systems, described by a Schrödinger equation. On one hand, we show that a closed quantum system is defined by local boundary conditions. On the other hand, we argue that, because of the uncertainty principle, no local boundary condition can be defined for open quantum systems. For this reason plane waves or wave packet trains cannot be simulated on a finite numerical lattice with the usual procedures. We suggest a method that avoids these difficulties by using only a small numerical lattice and maintains the correspondence with the physical picture, in which the incident and scattered waves may be infinitely extended.

Title: NISQ-compatible quantum cryptography based on Parrondo dynamics in discrete-time quantum walks
Authors: Aditi Rath, Dinesh Kumar Panda, Colin Benjamin
Abstract: Compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is crucial for the realistic implementation of quantum cryptographic protocols. We investigate a cryptographic scheme based on discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) on cyclic graphs that exploits Parrondo dynamics, wherein periodic evolution emerges from a deterministic sequence of individually chaotic coin operators. We construct an explicit quantum circuit realization tailored to NISQ architectures and analyze its performance through numerical simulations in Qiskit under both ideal and noisy conditions. Protocol performance is quantified using probability distributions, Hellinger fidelity, and total variation distance. To assess security at the circuit level, we model intercept-resend and man-in-the-middle attacks and evaluate the resulting quantum bit error rate. In the absence of adversarial intervention, the protocol enables reliable message recovery, whereas eavesdropping induces characteristic disturbances that disrupt the periodic reconstruction mechanism. We further examine hardware feasibility on contemporary NISQ processors, specifically $ibm\_torino$, incorporating qubit connectivity and state-transfer constraints into the circuit design. Our analysis demonstrates that communication between spatially separated logical modules increases circuit depth via SWAP operations, leading to cumulative noise effects. By exploring hybrid state-transfer strategies, we show that qubit selection and connectivity play a decisive role in determining fidelity and overall protocol performance, highlighting hardware-dependent trade-offs in NISQ implementations.

Title: Erratic Liouvillian Skin Localization and Subdiffusive Transport
Authors: Stefano Longhi
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems with globally reciprocal couplings -- such as the Hatano-Nelson model with stochastic imaginary gauge fields -- avoid the conventional non-Hermitian skin effect, displaying erratic bulk localization while retaining ballistic transport. An open question is whether similar behavior arises when non-reciprocity originates at the Liouvillian level rather than from an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian obtained via post-selection. Here we investigate this scenario in a lattice model with globally reciprocal Liouvillian dynamics and locally asymmetric incoherent hopping, a disordered setting in which Liouvillian-specific effects have remained largely unexplored. While the steady state again shows disorder-dependent, erratic localization without boundary accumulation, we find that global reciprocity in the Liouvillian does not protect transport. Instead, in the regime dominated by incoherent hopping, excitations spread via Sinai-type subdiffusion, dramatically slower than the ordinary diffusion found in symmetric stochastic lattices. Our results reveal a fundamental distinction between globally reciprocal Hamiltonian and Liouvillian dynamics: global reciprocity suppresses the skin effect in both cases, but only in Liouvillian dynamics can it coexist with ultra-slow, disorder-induced subdiffusive transport.

Title: Thermal Min-Max Games: Unifying Bounded Rationality and Typical-Case Equilibrium
Authors: Yuma Ichikawa
Abstract: Strategic-form min-max game theory examines the existence, multiplicity, selection of equilibria, and the worst-case computational complexity under perfect rationality. However, in many applications, games are drawn from an ensemble, and players exhibit bounded rationality. We introduce thermal min-max games, a thermodynamic relaxation that unifies bounded and perfect rationality by assigning each player a temperature to regulate their rationality level. To analyze typical behavior in the large-strategy limit, we develop a nested replica framework for this relaxation. This theory provides tractable predictions for typical equilibrium values and mixed-strategy statistics as functions of rationality strength, strategy-count aspect ratio, and payoff randomness. Numerical experiments demonstrate that these asymptotic predictions accurately align with the equilibrium of finite games of moderate size.

Title: Symmetry in language statistics shapes the geometry of model representations
Authors: Dhruva Karkada, Daniel J. Korchinski, Andres Nava, Matthieu Wyart, Yasaman Bahri
Abstract: Although learned representations underlie neural networks' success, their fundamental properties remain poorly understood. A striking example is the emergence of simple geometric structures in LLM representations: for example, calendar months organize into a circle, years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded by a linear probe. We show that the statistics of language exhibit a translation symmetry -- e.g., the co-occurrence probability of two months depends only on the time interval between them -- and we prove that the latter governs the aforementioned geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models. Moreover, we find that these structures persist even when the co-occurrence statistics are strongly perturbed (for example, by removing all sentences in which two months appear together) and at moderate embedding dimension. We show that this robustness naturally emerges if the co-occurrence statistics are collectively controlled by an underlying continuous latent variable. We empirically validate this theoretical framework in word embedding models, text embedding models, and large language models.

Title: Complex-valued in-medium potential between heavy impurities in ultracold atoms
Authors: Yukinao Akamatsu, Shimpei Endo, Keisuke Fujii, Masaru Hongo
Abstract: We formulate the induced potential in a finite temperature cold atomic medium between two heavy impurities, or polarons, which is shown to be \textit{complex-valued} in general. The imaginary part of the complex-valued potential describes a decoherence effect, and thus, the resulting Schrödinger equation for the two polarons acquires a non-Hermitian term. We apply the developed formulation to two representative cases of polarons interacting with medium particles through the $s$-wave contact interaction: (i) the normal phase of single-component (i.e., spin-polarized) fermions using the fermionic field theory, and (ii) a superfluid phase using the superfluid effective field theory, which is valid either for a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of a single-component Bose gas or for the BEC-BCS crossover in two-component fermions at a low-energy regime. Computing the leading-order term, the imaginary part of the potential in both cases is found to show a universal $r^{-2}$ behavior at long distance. We propose three experimental ways to observe the effects of the universal imaginary potential in cold atoms.

Authors: M. Boström, S. Pal, H. R. Gopidi, S. Osella, A. Gholamhosseinian, G. Palasantzas, O. I. Malyi
Abstract: The Casimir-Lifshitz force is calculated between a heterogeneous gapped metal surface and a silica sphere attached to an AFM cantilever tip. We demonstrate that heterogeneous surface patches with different off-stoichiometry surface properties lead to changes in the predicted distances for a specific force. This can incorrectly be interpreted as occurrences of surface roughness.

Title: Beyond Attraction: A Novel Approach to Repulsive Casimir-Lifshitz Forces using heterogeneous off-stoichiometry in gapped metals
Authors: S. Pal, S. Osella, O. I. Malyi, M. Boström
Abstract: We uncover a novel physical mechanism that enables a switch between attractive and repulsive Casimir forces when a Teflon surface interacts with a new form of quantum material (i.e., gapped metal) surface across different liquid media. We demonstrate the discovery of a zero-frequency Casimir effect, which, for the first time, reveals the potential for quantum switching within nanometer distances-a scale previously thought to be unattainable. Hence, our results introduce a new method to induce phase (stoichiometry)-controlled attraction-repulsion transitions and achieving quantum levitation in a liquid medium by tuning the liquid environment. This study thus not only advances our understanding of quantum forces at the nanoscale via their correlation to dielectric properties of involved materials but also opens up exciting possibilities for their manipulation in novel ways, forming the basis towards innovative advancements in nanoscale technology.

Title: Unconventional early-time relaxation in the Rydberg chain
Authors: Martin Schnee, Roya Radgohar, Stefanos Kourtis
Abstract: We show that unconventional relaxation dynamics of special initial states in one-dimensional arrays of Rydberg atoms produce non-generic decay of the initial-state survival probability (SP) at very early times. Using the PXP hamiltonian as a minimal model of the Rydberg blockade, we prove that the early-time SP for states exhibiting quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) decays at a characteristic rate, whose finite-size scaling is determined solely by scars. We numerically investigate the effects of both revival-enhancing and ergodicity-restoring deformations of the PXP hamiltonian and find results consistent with the limiting cases of integrable and ergodic dynamics, respectively. We moreover argue that such unconventional early relaxation of scarred initial states is characteristic of a whole class of QMBS models. Since the SP can be easily measured experimentally, our findings enable us to probe the presence of scars at time scales much shorter than that of thermalization.

Title: Interedge backscattering in time-reversal symmetric quantum spin Hall Josephson junctions
Authors: Cajetan Heinz, Patrik Recher, Fernando Dominguez
Abstract: Using standard tight-binding methods, we investigate a novel backscattering mechanism taking place on quantum spin Hall N'SNSN' Josephson junctions in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. This extended geometry allows for the interplay between two types of Andreev bound states (ABS): the usual phase-dependent ABS localized at the edges of the central SNS junction \emph{and} phase-independent ABS localized at the edges of the N'S regions. Crucially, the latter arise at discrete energies $E_n$ and mediate a backscattering process between opposite edges on the SNS junction, yielding gap openings when both types of ABS are at resonance. In this scenario, a 4$\pi$-periodic ABS decouples from the rest of the spectrum, and thus, it can be probed preventing the emission to the quasicontinuum. Interestingly, this backscattering mechanism introduces a new length scale, determining the ratio between $4\pi$- and $2\pi$-periodic supercurrent contributions and distorts the superconducting quantum interference (SQI) pattern. Finally, to proof the participation of these ABS, we propose to use a magnetic flux to tune $E_n$ to zero, resulting in the selective lifting of the fractional Josephson effect.

Title: Thermodynamic Advantage of Quantum Time-Reversal
Authors: Alexander B. Boyd, Paul M. Riechers
Abstract: Classical computations inherently require energy dissipation that increases significantly as the reliability of the computation improves. This dissipation arises when transitions between memory states are not balanced by their time-reversed counterparts. While classical memories exhibit a discrete set of possible time-reversal symmetries, quantum memory offers a continuum. This continuum enables the design of quantum memories that minimize irreversibility. As a result, quantum memory reduces energy dissipation several orders of magnitude below classical memory.

Title: Dynamical Boundary Following and Corner Trapping of Undulating Worms
Authors: Sohum Kapadia, Arshad Kudrolli
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of {\it Lumbriculus variegatus} in circular and polygonal chambers and show that the worms align with the boundaries as they move forward and then become dynamically trapped at the concave corners over prolonged periods. We model the worm as a self-propelled rod and derive analytical expressions for the evolution of its orientation when it encounters the flat and the circular boundaries of the chamber. By further incorporating translational and rotational diffusion, arising due to the undulatory and peristaltic body strokes, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that the self-propelled rod model can capture both the boundary aligning and the corner trapping behavior of the worm. The Péclet number $Pe$, representing the ratio of forward propulsion to rotational diffusion, is found to characterize the boundary alignment dynamics and trapping time distribution of the worm. Simulations show that the angle of the worm's body with the boundary while entering a concave corner plays a key role in determining the trapping time, with shallow angles leading to faster escapes. Our study demonstrates that directed motion combined with limited angular diffusion can lead to spatial localization that mimics shelter seeking behavior in slender undulating limbless worms, even in the absence of thigmotaxis or contact seeking behavior.

Title: Brownian-motion approach to statistical mechanics: Langevin equations, fluctuations, and timescales
Authors: Sushanta Dattagupta, Aritra Ghosh
Abstract: We briefly review the problem of Brownian motion and describe some intriguing facets. The problem is first treated in its original form as enunciated by Einstein, Langevin, and others. Then, utilizing the problem of Brownian motion as a paradigm and upon using the Langevin equation(s), we present a brief exposition of the modern areas of stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems in a manner accessible to a non-expert. This is followed by an analysis of non-Markovian Brownian dynamics via generalized Langevin equation(s) in which we particularly shed light onto its derivation, the emergence of the fluctuation-dissipation relation, and the recently-discovered effective-mass framework.

Title: Small-Mass Asymptotics of Massive Point Vortex Dynamics in Bose--Einstein Condensates I: Averaging and Normal Forms
Authors: Tomoki Ohsawa, Andrea Richaud, Roy Goodman
Abstract: We perform an asymptotic analysis of massive point-vortex dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensates in the small-mass limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We define two distinguished manifolds in the phase space of the dynamics. We call the first the kinematic subspace $\mathcal{K}$, whereas the second is an almost-invariant set $\mathcal{S}$ called a ``slow manifold.'' The orthogonal projection of the massive dynamics to $\mathcal{K}$ yields the standard massless vortex dynamics or the Kirchhoff equations -- also the 0th-order approximation to the massive equation as $\varepsilon \to 0$. Our first main result proves that the massive dynamics starting $O(\varepsilon)$-close to $\mathcal{K}$ remains $O(\varepsilon)$-close to the massless dynamics for short times. The second main result is the derivation of a normal form for the system's Hamiltonian for the two-vortex case; it describes the coupling between motion within $\mathcal{S}$ and that transverse to it. Specifically, we use the Lie transformation perturbation method to derive the first few terms in a formal expansion for $\mathcal{S}$ and demonstrate numerically that fast oscillations due to the vortices' mass are suppressed, given initial conditions sufficiently close to $\mathcal{S}$.

Title: The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results
Authors: Xin-Chi Zhou, Bing-Chen Yao, Yongjian Wang, Yucheng Wang, Yudong Wei, Qi Zhou, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three classes of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up seven distinct fundamental phases in nature: three pure phases and four coexisting ones with mobility edges, yet a unified theory built on universal mechanism and full realization of all these phases has not been developed. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic (QP) system which realizes all the fundamental localization phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for their characterization. First, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral(-like) symmetry preserves in the proposed spinful QP model, giving a criterion for emergence of the pure phases and otherwise the coexisting ones. Further, we uncover a novel mechanism for the critical states that their emergence is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful QP model, which considerably broadens rigorous realizations of the exotic critical states. We then show criteria of exact solvability for the present spinful QP system, with which we construct various exactly solvable models for all distinct localization phases. In particular, we propose two novel models, dubbed spin-selective QP lattice model and QP optical Raman lattice model, to achieve all basic types of mobility edges and all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization physics, respectively. The experimental scheme is proposed and studied in detail to realize these models with high feasibility. This study establishes a complete and profound theoretical framework which enables an in-depth exploration of the broad classes of all fundamental localization phenomena in QP systems, and offers key insights for constructing their exactly solvable models with experimental feasibility.

Title: Activated solids: Spontaneous deformations, non-affine fluctuations, softening, and failure
Authors: Parswa Nath, Debankur Das, Surajit Sengupta, Debasish Chaudhuri
Abstract: Internal activity can fundamentally reshape the mechanical behavior of solids, yet its role in softening and failure remains incompletely understood. In this study, we investigate spontaneous deformations in activated solids via non-affine fluctuations that quantify local rearrangements relative to global strain. Using scaling analysis and numerical simulations, we show that non-affinity in crystalline solids grows quadratically with active speed, increases linearly with persistence time before saturating, and scales inversely with the distance to the melting density. Spatial correlations reveal an activity-dependent growing correlation length, while relaxation dynamics are governed by the active persistence time. With increasing activity, the distributions of local non-affinity broaden, become more skewed, and develop heavy tails, eventually forming a secondary maximum that signals coexisting small and large non-affinities; this heterogeneity precedes defect formation and two-step melting from solid to hexatic and ultimately to fluid. Finally, we demonstrate that spatially patterned activation provides a simple route to locally induce non-affinity and mechanical softening. Our predictions are experimentally testable and suggest a pathway to tunable mechanics in adaptive metamaterials, with implications for mechanical regulation in biological systems.

Title: Imaginary gauge potentials in a non-Hermitian spin-orbit coupled quantum gas
Authors: Junheng Tao, Emmanuel Mercado-Gutierrez, Mingshu Zhao, Ian Spielman
Abstract: In 1996, Hatano and Nelson proposed a non-Hermitian lattice model containing an imaginary Peierls phase [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77 570-573 (1996)], which subsequent analyses revealed to be an instance of a new class of topological systems. Here, we experimentally realize a continuum analog to this model containing an imaginary gauge potential using a homogeneous spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Non-Hermiticity is introduced by adding tunable spin-dependent loss via microwave coupling to a subspace with spontaneous emission. We demonstrate that the resulting Heisenberg equations of motion for position and momentum depend explicitly on the system's phase-space distribution. First, we observe collective nonreciprocal transport in real space, with a "self-acceleration" that decreases with the BEC's spatial extent, consistent with non-Hermitian Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. We then examine localized edge states: the relatively strong interactions in our BEC suppress the formation of topological edge states, yielding instead highly excited states localized by an interplay between self-acceleration and wavefunction spreading. Finally, we confirm that our non-Hermitian description remains valid at all times by comparing to a multi-level master-equation treatment.

Title: Eppur si muove: Shape of topological defects -- and consequent motion -- in active nematics
Authors: Giacomo Marco La Montagna, Sumeja Burekovic, Ananyo Maitra, Cesare Nardini
Abstract: Topological defects in systems with liquid-crystalline order are crucial in determining their large-scale properties. In active systems, they are known to have properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in nematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical descriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by activity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We compute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is intimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions are corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.

Title: Low-temperature transport in high-conductivity correlated metals: a density-functional plus dynamical mean-field study of cubic perovskites
Authors: Harrison LaBollita, Jeremy Lee-Hand, Fabian B. Kugler, Lorenzo Van Muñoz, Sophie Beck, Alexander Hampel, Jason Kaye, Antoine Georges, Cyrus E. Dreyer
Abstract: While methods based on density-functional perturbation theory have dramatically improved our understanding of electron-phonon contributions to transport in materials, methods for accurately capturing electron-electron scattering relevant to low temperatures have seen significantly less development. The case of high-conductivity, moderately correlated materials characterized by low scattering rates is particularly challenging, since exquisite numerical precision of the low-energy electronic structure is required. Recent methodological advancements to density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), including adaptive Brillouin-zone integration and numerically precise self-energies, enable a rigorous investigation of electron-electron scattering in such materials. In particular, these tools may be leveraged to perform a robust scattering-rate analysis on both real- and imaginary-frequency axes. Applying this methodology to a subset of ABO$_3$ perovskite oxides -- SrVO$_3$, SrMoO$_3$, PbMoO$_3$, and SrRuO$_3$ -- we demonstrate its ability to qualitatively and quantitatively describe electron-electron contributions to the temperature-dependent direct-current resistivity. This combination of numerical techniques offers fundamental insight into the role of electronic correlations in transport phenomena and provides a predictive tool for identifying materials with potential for technological applications.

Title: Phase domain walls in coherently driven Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: S. S. Gavrilov
Abstract: We consider coherent states of weakly interacting bosons under the conditions of external resonant excitation, with a focus on a two-dimensional polariton fluid driven by a plane electromagnetic wave near the ground state. The coherent driving breaks the U(1) symmetry explicitly, which prevents the occurrence of quantum vortices in a uniform scalar condensate. Surprisingly, a spinor (two-component) system of the same kind admits topological excitations, such as domain walls of relative phase or confined half-vortex molecules, typical of a freely evolving spinor Bose system. Opposite-phase domains arise from the spontaneous breakdown of the spin symmetry $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Domain walls form with time even when the initial state of the system is uniform or completely disordered; they fall into different topological types distinguished by the total phase variation in the transverse direction. One type of domain walls is similar to ``magnetic'' solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates and exhibits nonzero spin polarization whose sign depends on the direction of motion. Domain walls of the second type, by contrast, behave like monopoles with broken spatiotemporal symmetry and tend to move in certain preferred directions. The interaction of vortices and domain walls results in a long-range ordering of the system.

Title: Revisiting vestigial order in nematic superconductors: gauge-field mechanisms and model constraints
Authors: Ilaria Maccari, Egor Babaev, Johan Carlström
Abstract: An electronic nematic order that originates from superconducting fluctuation but persists above the superconducting transition temperature is often referred to as a vestigial nematic phase. Such a vestigial order belongs to the broader class of composite orders discussed in earlier literature, characterized by ordering in gauge-invariant combinations of superconducting order parameters while the individual superconducting order parameters remain disordered. These states include metallic superfluids, paired phases, and composite (charge-4e) superconductors. Whether and under what conditions such a vestigial phase can emerge in realistic models of nematic superconductors remains an open question. Recent analytical work [P. T. How and S. K. Yip, Phys. Rev. B 107, 104514 (2023)] concluded that vestigial nematic phases--and related mechanisms--do not appear in the widely studied models proposed for, e.g., Bi$_2$Se$_3$-based candidates. To shed light on this question, we perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of a three-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model of a nematic superconductor. Consistent with the findings of How and Yip, our numerical results confirm that commonly considered models do not exhibit vestigial nematic phases or nematic-fluctuation-induced charge-4e superconductivity. Extending the analysis to include coupling to a gauge field, we show that vestigial nematic order can, under restrictive conditions, be stabilized through an alternative mechanism: intercomponent coupling mediated by the gauge field or the effects of strong correlations.

Title: Absence of Long-Range Order and Magnetic Anisotropy in the Triangular Magnet NdMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$
Authors: Sonu Kumar, Gaël Bastien, Jan Prokleška, Mateusz Kempiński, Wojciech Kempiński, Karol Załęski, Andrej Kancko, Cinthia Antunes Corrêa, Tim Treu, Philipp Gegenwart, Małgorzata Śliwińska-Bartkowiak, Ross H. Colman
Abstract: We investigated the rare-earth triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ using single-crystal magnetization (1.8~K $\leq T \leq$ 300~K, $\mu_0 H \leq 7$~T) and specific-heat measurements down to 45~mK. The dc susceptibility confirms a well-isolated Kramers doublet ground state with pronounced Ising-type anisotropy, with $g_c \approx 3.7$ and $g_{ab} \approx 1.45$. Curie--Weiss fits yield weak, anisotropic antiferromagnetic exchange, with $\theta_c = -0.54$~K and $\theta_{ab} = -0.87$~K. Heat-capacity measurements show no long-range magnetic order down to 40~mK, corresponding to a frustration index $f \gtrsim 20$. Instead, $C_m/T$ exhibits a broad maximum near 0.081~K whose magnitude and field evolution are consistent with short-range correlations in an anisotropic triangular lattice. Applied magnetic fields open a Zeeman gap where the specific-heat anomaly follows $\Delta = g \mu_B \mu_0 H$, and $M(H,T)$ is well described by a Brillouin function for an effective $J = 1/2$ moment. The field tuning of the low-temperature entropy manifold allows self-cooling from 1.8~K to 53~mK by adiabatic demagnetisation from a 9~T field. These results identify NdMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ as a nearly ideal weak-exchange triangular magnet with a field-tunable correlated ground state, where two-dimensional crossover effects may emerge from frustrated XXZ interactions.

Title: Deterministic Switching of the Néel Vector by Asymmetric Spin Torque
Authors: Shui-Sen Zhang, Zi-An Wang, Bo Li, Wen-Jian Lu, Mingliang Tian, Yu-Ping Sun, Haifeng Du, Ding-Fu Shao
Abstract: Néel vector, the order parameter of collinear antiferromagnets, serves as a state variable in associated antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronic devices to encode information. A deterministic switching of Néel vector is crucial for the write-in operation, which, however, remains a challenging problem in AFM spintronics. Here we demonstrate, based on analytical derivation and macro-spin simulations, that Néel vector switching can be generally achieved via a current-induced spin torque, provided the spin accumulations responsible for this torque are non-identical between opposite sublattices. This condition occurs widely in AFM films, as symmetry equivalence between sublattice-dependent spin accumulations is usually absent, allowing unequal spin accumulations induced by Edelstein effect or a spin current. Unlike previously studied spin torques induced by uniform or staggered spin accumulations -- where either the field-like or damping-like component dominates exclusively -- the asymmetric spin torque features cooperative contributions from both components, leading to Néel vector dynamics that are fundamentally distinct from previous expectations. Crucially, the static states stabilized by the asymmetric spin torque enable versatile Néel vector switching strategies -- field-free spin-transfer torque switching during current application, as well as field-free or field-assisted spin-orbit torque switching after the current pulse -- demonstrating that established spin torque techniques from ferromagnetic spintronics can be directly adapted to AFM systems, a capability absent in previous theoretical frameworks. Our work establishes a general mechanism for current-induced Néel vector switching, which is in principle feasible for all collinear antiferromagnets, and thus paves the route to realize efficient writing in AFM spintronics.

Title: Information thermodynamics of cellular ion pumps
Authors: Julian D. Jiménez-Paz, Matthew P. Leighton, David A. Sivak
Abstract: The framework of bipartite stochastic thermodynamics is a powerful tool to analyze a composite system's internal thermodynamics. It has been used to study the components of different molecular machines such as ATP synthase. However, this approach has not yet been used to describe ion-transporting proteins despite their high-level functional similarity. Here we study the bipartite thermodynamics of the sodium-potassium pump in the nonequilibrium steady state. Using a physically intuitive partition between the ATP-consuming subsystem and the ion-transporting subsystem, we find considerable information flow comparable to other molecular machines, and Maxwell-demon behavior in the ATP-consuming subsystem. We vary ion concentrations and transmembrane voltage in a range including the neuronal action potential, and find that the information flow inverts during depolarization.

Title: Multiscale complexity of two-dimensional Ising systems with short-range, ferromagnetic interactions
Authors: Ibrahim Al-Azki, Valentina Baccetti
Abstract: Complex systems exhibit macroscopic behaviors that emerge from the coordinated interactions of their individual components. Understanding the microscopic origins of these emergent properties remains a significant challenge, especially in less-understood systems, due to the absence of a generalized framework for identifying the governing degrees of freedom. The multiscale complexity formalism, developed to address this challenge, consists of a set of information-theoretic indices designed to identify the scales at which collective behaviors emerge. In this article, we evaluate one such index, the complexity profile, by applying it to the two-dimensional Ising model with finite-range interactions. In particular, we show that the complexity profile captures the transition between the disordered and ordered phases by detecting the emergence of multiscale structure 1 exclusively in the critical region, and therefore offering insights into the formation of magnetic domains from an information-theoretic perspective. Additionally, we show that the pairwise complexity exhibits a maximum in the disordered phase that remains bounded in the thermodynamic limit. These results highlight the potential of the multiscale complexity formalism to probe emergent behaviors and detect hidden features of critical phenomena in interacting systems beyond the classical characterization of correlations.

Title: Dipolar optimal control of quantum states
Authors: Héctor Briongos-Merino, Felipe Isaule, Bruno Juliá-Díaz, Montserrat Guilleumas
Abstract: Quantum state control is a fundamental tool for quantum technologies. In this work, we propose and analyze the use of quantum optimal control to exploit the dipolar interaction of ultracold atoms on a lattice ring, focusing on the generation of selected states with entangled circulation. This scheme requires time-dependent control over the orientation of the magnetic field, a technique that is feasible in ultracold atom laboratories. The system's evolution is driven by just two independent control functions. We describe the symmetry constraints of this approach and numerically test them using the extended Bose-Hubbard model. We find that the proposed control can engineer entangled current states with perfect fidelity across a wide range of systems, and that in the remaining cases, the theoretical upper bounds for fidelity are reached.

Title: Kinetic energy in random recurrent neural networks
Authors: Li-Ru Zhang, Haiping Huang
Abstract: High-dimensional chaotic dynamics can emerge in a large random recurrent neural network when the synaptic gain crosses a threshold. Recent works showed that the kinetic energy of neural activity links the chaotic dynamics and the supporting unstable fixed points (equilibria) in the phase space. Here, we investigate the kinetic-energy-centric properties of random recurrent neural networks by combining dynamical mean-field theory with extensive numerical simulations. We find that the average kinetic energy shifts continuously from zero to a positive value at a critical value of coupling variance (synaptic gain) and exhibits a cubic scaling behavior near the critical point from above. This scaling behavior is supported by numerical simulations and provides a quantitative characterization of how fast the dynamics change during the onset of chaos. The steady-state activity distribution is further calculated by the theory and compared with simulations on finite-size systems from the kinetic-energy optimization perspective as well. The activity distribution is also analyzed in a geometric angle, establishing a relationship between the original chaotic dynamics and the gradient dynamics of the kinetic energy. The trajectory length on the chaotic manifold can be derived from the stationary kinetic energy, and the associated stationary behavior is analyzed as well. This study provides a kinetic-energy-centric route toward understanding the dynamics landscape of recurrent neural networks, which may provide insights for reservoir computing and even for internal synaptic learning.

Title: Electrostatic gate-controlled quantum interference in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas at the (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface
Authors: Km Rubi, Kun Han, Huang Zhen, Michel Goiran, Duncan K. Maude, Walter Escoffier, A. Ariando
Abstract: We report quantum oscillations in magnetoresistance that are periodic in magnetic field ($B$), observed at the interface between (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)O$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$. Unlike Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, which appear at magnetic fields $ > 7$ T and diminish quickly as the temperature rises, these $B$-periodic oscillations emerge at low fields and persist up to 10 K. Their amplitude decays exponentially with both temperature and field, specifying dephasing of quantum interference. Increasing the carrier density through electrostatic gating results in a systematic reduction in both the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations, with complete suppression beyond a certain gate voltage. We attribute these oscillations to the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak effect, likely arising from naturally formed closed-loop paths due to the interconnected quasi-one-dimensional conduction channels along SrTiO$_3$ domain walls. The relatively long phase coherence length ($\sim$ 1.8 $\mu$m at 0.1 K), estimated from the oscillation amplitude, highlights the potential of complex oxide interfaces as a promising platform for exploring quantum interference effects and advancing device concepts in quantum technologies, such as mesoscopic interferometers and quantum sensors.

Title: Generalized Brillouin Zone Fragmentation
Authors: Haiyu Meng, Yee Sin Ang, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: The Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ) encodes how lattice momentum is complex-deformed due to non-Hermitian skin accumulation, and has proved essential in restoring bulk-boundary correspondences. However, we find that generically, the GBZ is neither unique nor well-defined if more than one skin localization direction or strength exists, even in systems with no asymmetric hoppings. Instead, open boundary condition (OBC) eigenstates become complicated superpositions of multiple competing skin modes from "fragments" of all possible GBZs solutions. We develop a formalism that computes the fragmented GBZ in a scalable manner, with fragmentation extent quantified through our newly-defined composition IPR and spectral relative entropy. GBZ fragmentation is revealed to fundamentally challenge the notion of discontinuous phase transitions, since topological winding contributions from different GBZ fragments can "melt away" at different rates. Phenomenologically, GBZ fragmentation also leads to edge localization in all observables in energetically weighted ensembles such as thermal ensembles. This contrasts with conventional GBZs where the skin localization completely cancels in biorthogonal expectations. Occurring universally in multi-mode non-Hermitian media, as we concretely demonstrate with photonic crystal simulations, GBZ fragmentation points towards a new paradigm that is essential for understanding the band structure and the topological and dynamical properties of diverse generic non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Originality of resonance and locking phenomena in SFS $φ_0$ Josephson junction
Authors: M. Nashaat, Yu. M. Shukrinov
Abstract: We demonstrate the realization and interplay of two ferromagnetic resonances in one SFS $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction. First resonance that is realized under microwave radiation is the famous Kittel resonance. The other is Buzdin one appearing as a result of interaction of superconducting current and ferromagnetic interlayer magnetization. Transformations of one type of resonance to another under variation of external electromagnetic radiation and the $\varphi_0$ junction parameters open an interesting way to manipulation both of them. The combined ferromagnetic resonance that exhibits the features of both resonances is demonstrated too. The coupling of the Josephson phase with the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer, caused by the spin-orbit interaction, leads to double synchronization, namely, synchronization of both magnetic precession and Josephson oscillations by external radiation. The obtained results demonstrate reach physics and unique opportunities for various applications.

Title: PyKirigami: An interactive Python simulator for kirigami structures
Authors: Qinghai Jiang, Gary P. T. Choi
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of kirigami has been used in creating deployable structures for various scientific and technological applications. While high-fidelity Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is the standard for analyzing stress distributions and material deformation, it is computationally intensive and often ill-suited for the rapid exploration of vast kinematic configuration spaces. In this work, we develop PyKirigami, a lightweight, open-source Python framework for the efficient deployment simulation of kirigami structures. Unlike continuum mechanics solvers, PyKirigami models tessellations as articulated rigid-body networks, allowing for the real-time simulation of global deployment trajectories and volumetric transformations. The tool incorporates collision detection and interactive actuation, enabling users to validate folding paths and identify geometric locking states in both 2D and 3D topologies. This framework serves as a fast kinematic prototyping tool for kirigami structures, allowing researchers to verify deployment mechanics and self-contacts prior to performing detailed mechanical analysis or physical fabrication.

Title: Extended s-wave altermagnets
Authors: Matteo Dürrnagel, Lennart Klebl, Tobias Müller, Ronny Thomale, Michael Klett
Abstract: We propose extended s-wave altermagnets (sAMs) as a class of magnetic states which are fully gapped, spin-compensated, and feature spin-polarized bands. sAMs are formed through valley-exchange symmetries, which act as momentum-space translations beyond standard crystallographic spin-group classifications. Using an effective two-valley model, we demonstrate that sAMs exhibit isotropic spin splitting, enable spin-selective transport in tailored heterostructures, and give rise to descendant pair density wave order. From a microscopic sAM minimal model, we develop the guiding principles to identify sAMs in quantum magnets.

Title: Nonperturbative Semiclassical Spin Dynamics for Ordered Quantum Magnets
Authors: Hao Zhang, Tianyue Huang, Allen O. Scheie, Mengze Zhu, Tao Xie, N. Murai, S. Ohira-Kawamura, Andrey Zheludev, Andreas M. Läuchli, Cristian D. Batista
Abstract: In ordered quantum magnets where interactions between elementary excitations dominate over their kinetic energy, perturbative approaches often fail, making non-perturbative methods essential to capture spectral features such as bound states and the redistribution of weight within excitation continua. Although an increasing number of experiments report anomalous spin excitation continua in such systems, their microscopic interpretation remains an open challenge. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet in its 1/3-plateau phase using two complementary non-perturbative approaches: exact diagonalization in a truncated Hilbert space for a gas of elementary excitations (THED) and matrix product state (MPS) simulations. Alongside cross-validation between these methods, we benchmark our results against inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data. The THED analysis confirms the presence of two-magnon bound states and identifies the anomalous scattering continuum observed in both MPS and INS as a two-magnon resonance, arising from hybridization between the bound state and the two-magnon continuum. Furthermore, THED reveals bound states overlapping with the continuum, enriching the interpretation of continuum anomalies. More broadly, THED provides a robust framework for investigating anomalous spin excitation continua and bound-state effects in other materials with gapped spectra. Its combination of accuracy and computational efficiency makes it a powerful tool for extracting reliable microscopic models in semiclassical regimes.

Title: Generalization of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki Model for Quantum Ferromagnetism
Authors: Isao Maruyama, Shin Miyahara
Abstract: We study a spin-$S$ ferromagnetic model with exactly-written ground states, known as the partially-magnetized valence bond solid (VBS) states with magnetization $m=(S-1)/S$, which is a ferromagnetic generalization of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. We find that the VBS state and an antiferromagnetic ground state with magnetization $m=0$ are degenerate for $S=3/2$ and $S=2$ by using the Lanczos method and the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG). However, increasing $S$, the magnetization of the ground states is uniquely determined as the fraction $m=(S-1)/S$. This is not just a ferromagnet, but a quantum ferromagnet due to quantum entanglement inherent in VBS states. In the low-energy excitation spectrum, we find the coexistence of the Haldane gap and Goldstone-like ferromagnetic magnon excitation. This ``magnetic chimera'' clearly appears under a finite magnetic field. Finally, we discuss an application to the measurement-based quantum computation and an extension of the Haldane's conjecture.

Title: Massive Discovery of Low-Dimensional Materials from Universal Computational Strategy
Authors: Mohammad Bagheri, Ethan Berger, Hannu-Pekka Komsa, Pekka Koskinen
Abstract: Low-dimensional materials have attractive properties that drive intense efforts for novel materials discovery. However, experiments are tedious for systematic discovery, and present computational methods are often tuned to two-dimensional (2D) materials, overlooking other low-dimensional materials. Here, we combined universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMLIPs) and an advanced, interatomic force constant (FC) -based dimensionality classification method to make a massive discovery of novel low-dimensional materials. We first benchmarked UMLIPs' first-principles-level accuracy in quantifying FCs and calculated phonons for 35,689 materials from the Materials Project database. We then used the FC-based method for dimensionality classification to discover 9139 low-dimensional materials, including 1838 0D clusters, 1760 1D chains, 3057 2D sheets/layers, and 2484 mixed-dimensionality materials, all of which conventional geometric descriptors have not recognized. By calculating the binding energies for the discovered 2D materials, we also identified 887 sheets that could be easily or potentially exfoliated from their parent bulk structures.

Title: Superconducting Gap Structures in Wallpaper Fermion Systems
Authors: Kaito Yoda, Ai Yamakage
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the superconducting gap structures in wallpaper fermions, which are surface states of topological nonsymmorphic crystalline insulators, based on a two-dimensional effective model. A symmetry analysis identifies six types of momentum-independent pair potentials. One hosts a point node, two host line nodes, and the remaining three are fully gapped. By classifying the Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian in the zero-dimensional symmetry class, we show that the point and line nodes are protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants. In addition, for the twofold-rotation-odd pair potential, nodes appear on the glide-invariant line and are protected by crystalline symmetries, as clarified by the Mackey--Bradley theorem.

Title: Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties
Authors: Zhandos A. Moldabekov, Sebastian Schwalbe, Uwe Hernandez Acosta, Thomas Gawne, Jan Vorberger, Michele Pavanello, Tobias Dornheim
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based attenuation of narrow-band fluctuations to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus substantially reducing the burden of computational cost required for XRTS analysis.

Title: Probing frustrated metallo-molecular spin Kondo lattice interfaces through anomalous Nernst effect
Authors: Servet Ozdemir, Matthew Rogers, Conor J. McCluskey, Raymond G. McQuaid, Zachariah Parkin, Mannan Ali, Gavin Burnell, Joseph Barker, B J Hickey, Oscar Cespedes
Abstract: Frustrated Kondo spin lattice (KSL) systems away from the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state have been found to display strange metal behaviour. A signature of strange metals in correlated systems is large Nernst response. Metallo-molecular interfaces of supramolecular lattices have been demonstrated as 2D KSL systems in STM studies. Here going beyond STM experiments we report a frustrated AFM state on molecular interfaces of Pt(111) and Pt(111)/Co films with around room temperature spin freezing transitions. Near these transitions we measure an anomalous Nernst coefficient of at least 3 $\mu$V/K.

Title: Chern insulators and topological flat bands in cavity-embedded kagome systems
Authors: Hikaru Goto, Ryo Okugawa, Takami Tohyama
Abstract: We investigate topological band structures of a kagome system coupled to a circularly polarized cavity mode, using a model based on a muffin-tin potential and quantum light-matter interaction. We show that Chern insulating phases emerge in the cavity-embedded kagome system due to the light-matter interaction that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We also find that a nearly flat band can be topologically nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number. By varying the light-matter interaction, we also reveal that topological phase transitions occur between different Chern insulating phases in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The phase transitions change the sign of the Chern number, switching the direction of the edge current. We demonstrate the existence of topological edge modes in the cavity-embedded kagome Chern insulators by constructing a low-energy effective tight-binding model.

Title: Electron-hole liquid in biological tissues under ultra high dose rate ionizing radiation
Authors: Diana Shvydka, Victor Karpov
Abstract: We develop a quantitative model of ionization processes in biological tissues under Ultra High Dose Rate (UHDR) radiation. The underlying conjecture is that of electron-hole liquid (EHL) forming in water based substances of biological tissues. Unlike the earlier known EHL in semiconductor crystals, the charge carriers here are low mobile due to strong interactions with the background (solvated electrons, etc.); hence, EHL resembling ionic melts. Similar to all ionic systems, the Coulomb coupling makes that EHL energetically favorable that leads to recombination barriers suppressing subsequent structural transformations. In particular, generation of secondary reactive species in such EHL becomes limited translating into reduction of biological damages and tissue sparing effect. We show how these processes are sensitive to the tissue quality and frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity. Equations for dose and dose rate defining the sparing thresholds are derived.

Title: Green's function expansion for multiple coupled optical resonators with finite retardation using quasinormal modes
Authors: Robert Meiners Fuchs, Juanjuan Ren, Stephen Hughes, Marten Richter
Abstract: The electromagnetic Green's function is a crucial ingredient for the theoretical study of modern photonic quantum devices, but is often difficult or even impossible to calculate directly. We present a numerically efficient framework for calculating the scattered electromagnetic Green's function of a multi-cavity system with spatially separated open cavities (with arbitrary shape, dispersion and loss) and finite retardation times. The framework is based on a Dyson scattering equation that enables the construction of the Green's function from the quasinormal modes of the individual resonators within a few-mode approximation and a finite number of iteration steps without requiring nested integrals. The approach shows excellent agreement with the full numerical Green's function for the example of two coupled dipoles located in the gaps of two metal dimers serving as quasinormal mode cavities, and is easily extended to arbitrarily large separations and multiple cavities.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and topological properties of tellurium across its dimensional hierarchy, including bulk trigonal Te-I, two-dimensional tellurene polymorphs, and one-dimensional helical nanowires. Using density functional theory with full inclusion of spin-orbit coupling, we confirm that bulk Te-I is a narrow-gap semiconductor hosting Weyl nodes arising from broken inversion symmetry and degenerate phonon modes suggestive of chiral phonon behavior. In contrast, two-dimensional alpha and beta-tellurene are found to be topologically trivial, with no spin-orbit-driven band inversion in the occupied manifold. Beyond these established phases, we find that buckled kagome and buckled square tellurene lattices exhibit a nontrivial two-dimensional topology of the occupied electronic bands, indicating incipient quantum spin Hall character in metallic systems. In contrast, one-side hydrogen-passivated hexagonal tellurene realizes a fully gapped quantum spin Hall phase with a robust Z2 = 1 invariant, preserved under applied strain and chemical functionalization. In the one-dimensional limit, helical tellurium nanowires preserve chirality and host edge-localized states accompanied by pronounced anisotropy in carrier effective masses. These results establish tellurium as a highly tunable platform for engineering topological phenomena across dimensionality, bridging three-dimensional Weyl physics, two-dimensional quantum spin Hall and incipient Z2 phases, and one-dimensional helical systems.

Title: Emergence of Chimeras States in One-dimensional Ising model with Long-Range Diffusion
Authors: Alejandro de Haro García, Joaquín J. Torres
Abstract: In this work, we examine the conditions for the emergence of chimera-like states in Ising systems. We study an Ising chain with periodic boundaries in contact with a thermal bath at temperature T, that induces stochastic changes in spin variables. To capture the non-locality needed for chimera formation, we introduce a model setup with non-local diffusion of spin values through the whole system. More precisely, diffusion is modeled through spin-exchange interactions between units up to a distance R, using Kawasaki dynamics. This setup mimics, e.g., neural media, as the brain, in the presence of electrical (diffusive) interactions. We explored the influence of such non-local dynamics on the emergence of complex spatiotemporal synchronization patterns of activity. Depending on system parameters we report here for the first time chimera-like states in the Ising model, characterized by relatively stable moving domains of spins with different local magnetization. We analyzed the system at T=0, both analytically and via simulations and computed the system's phase diagram, revealing rich behavior: regions with only chimeras, coexistence of chimeras and stable domains, and metastable chimeras that decay into uniform stable domains. This study offers fundamental insights into how coherent and incoherent synchronization patterns can arise in complex networked systems as it is, e.g., the brain.

Title: Controlling Quantum Transport in a Superconducting Device via Dissipative Baths
Authors: S. V. Aksenov, M. S. Shustin, I. S. Burmistrov
Abstract: Within the quantum field-theoretical approach describing the evolution of a quadratic Liouvillian in the basis of Keldysh contour coherent states, we investigate the spectral and transport properties of a dissipative superconducting system coupled to normal Fermi reservoirs. We derive a generalization of the Meir-Wingreen formula and Onsager matrix for a superconducting system subject to an arbitrary number of fermionic baths. Following Kirchhoff's rule, we obtain an expression describing the dissipation induced loss current and formulate modified quantum kinetic equations. For wide-band contacts locally coupled to individual sites, we find that each contact reduces the degeneracy multiplicity of the non-equilibrium steady state by one. These results are numerically verified through several cases of the extended Kitaev model at symmetric points with a single contact. Furthermore, in the linear response regime at low temperatures, we demonstrate that (non-)degenerate non-equilibrium steady states correspond to (non-)quantized conductance peaks. Revisiting a paradigmatic problem of resonant transport in the Majorana mode of the Kitaev model we demonstrate that the dissipation accounts for the zero-bias peak suppression and its asymmetry.

Title: Spin and orbital-to-charge conversion in noncentrosymmetric materials: Hall versus Rashba-Edelstein effects
Authors: Diego Garcia Ovalle, Aurelien Manchon
Abstract: We investigate spin- and orbital-to-charge conversion phenomena in nonmagnetic materials with broken inversion symmetry, treating the contributions from the Hall effect and the Rashba-Edelstein effect on an equal footing. We develop a general formalism for this interconversion based solely on macroscopic observables. The theory is validated through a case study of ferroelectric GeTe, where we find that the effective Rashba parameter obtained is smaller than previously reported values for the same material. Incorporating these parameters into a drift-diffusion model, we show that the generated charge current is primarily governed by the Rashba-Edelstein effect, rather than by the spin or orbital Hall effects.

Title: Coherent-state path integrals in quantum thermodynamics
Authors: Luca Salasnich, Cesare Vianello
Abstract: In these notes, we elucidate some subtle aspects of coherent-state path integrals, focusing on their application to the equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-particle systems. These subtleties emerge when evaluating path integrals in the continuum, either in imaginary time or in Matsubara-frequency space. Our central message is that, when handled with due care, the path integral yields results identical to those obtained from the canonical Hamiltonian approach. We illustrate this through a pedagogical treatment of several paradigmatic systems: the bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillators, the single-site Bose-Hubbard and Hubbard models, the weakly-interacting Bose gas with finite-range interactions, and the BCS superconductor with finite-range interactions.

Title: Crystal-Field--Driven Magnetoelectric Coupling in the Non-Kramers Hexaaluminate PrMgAl11O19
Authors: Sonu Kumar, Gaël Bastien, Ross H. Colman, Maxim Savinov, Petr Proschek, Michal Vališka, Mateusz Kempiński, Wojciech Kempiński, Małgorzata Śliwińska-Bartkowiak, Stanislav Kamba
Abstract: We report broadband dielectric spectra of the non-Kramers hexaaluminate PrMgAl\textsubscript{11}O\textsubscript{19}, revealing a pronounced interplay between permittivity and magnetization at cryogenic temperatures. The zero-field dielectric response follows a Barrett-type quantum-paraelectric form, while a broad dielectric anomaly near \SI{5}{K} shows a complex field dependence that mirrors the multi-hump behavior of the magnetic specific heat, evidencing robust magnetoelectric coupling. The inverse permittivity $\varepsilon'^{-1}(T,H)$ scales linearly with $M^2$, consistent with a biquadratic $P^2M^2$ term in a Landau framework. Fits yield temperature-dependent coupling constant $\lambda(T)$ that decreases with heating from ($1.07\pm0.01)\times10^{-4}\,\mu_{\mathrm{B}}^{-2}$ (at 5\,K) to $(4.77\pm0.02)\times10^{-5}\,\mu_{\mathrm{B}}^{-2}$ (at 10\,K), reflecting the thermal population of low-lying energy levels of Pr$^{3+}$. Consistently, the uniaxial thermal expansion develops an additional low-temperature hump below $\sim\SI{30}{K}$ that is progressively suppressed by magnetic field, recovering an approximately saturated response by \SI{9}{T}. These results identify PrMgAl\textsubscript{11}O\textsubscript{19} as a paradigmatic non-Kramers hexaaluminate where quantum paraelectricity and magnetoelectric interactions are intrinsically entangled, establishing hexaaluminates as a tunable platform for magnetoelectric physics in frustrated quantum materials.

Title: Two-Electron Correlations in the Metallic Electron Gas
Authors: Zhiyi Li, Pengcheng Hou, Bao-Zong Wang, Youjin Deng, Kun Chen
Abstract: We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the four-point vertex function for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas using variational diagrammatic Monte Carlo. From these results, we extract Landau parameters that demonstrate a density-driven crossover from underscreening to overscreening. Guided by our numerical data, we propose a charge-based Kukkonen--Overhauser effective interaction within the local-density approximation, supplemented by a small s-wave correction (sKO$^+$), which accurately captures the electron--electron scattering amplitude. Using our numerically determined scattering amplitude, together with the sKO$^+$ ansatz, we compute the electron-electron contribution to the thermal resistivity, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimental measurements in simple metals.

Title: Excitonic Theory of the Ultrafast Optical Response of 2D-Quantum-Confined Semiconductors at Elevated Densities
Authors: Henry Mittenzwey, Oliver Voigt, Andreas Knorr
Abstract: An excitonic approach to the ultrafast optical response of confined semiconductors at elevated densities below the Mott transition is presented. The theory is valid from the coherent regime, where coherent excitonic transitions and biexcitons dominate, to the incoherent regime, where excitonic occupations dominate. Numerical simulations of the $1s$ exciton dynamics during intense circularly polarized pump pulses in two different Coulomb-interaction regimes are performed for two-dimensional semiconductors: Moderate Coulomb interaction is compared with dominating Coulomb interaction with respect to the light-matter interaction strength. The different many-body contributions are disentangled and it is found, that excitonic Rabi oscillations in the Coulomb-dominated regime are considerably less strong. By also comparing circular and linear excitation in a MoSe$_2$ monolayer, it is found, that linear excitation creates a regime, where excitonic Rabi oscillations are almost completely suppressed.

Title: In search of the electron-phonon contribution to total energy
Authors: Samuel Poncé, Xavier Gonze
Abstract: The total energy is a fundamental characteristic of solids, molecules, and nanostructures. In most first-principles calculations of the total energy, the nuclear kinetic operator is decoupled from the many-body electronic Hamiltonian and nuclear potential, and the dynamics of the nuclei is reintroduced afterward. This two-step procedure introduced by Born and Oppenheimer (BO) is approximate. Energies beyond the electronic and vibrational (or phononic) main contributions might be relevant when small energy differences are important, such as when predicting stable polymorphs or describing magnetic energy landscape. We clarify the different flavors of BO decoupling and give an exact formulation for the total energy in the basis of BO electronic wavefunctions. Then, we list contributions, beyond the main ones, that appear in a perturbative expansion in powers of $M_0^{-1/4}$, where $M_0$ is a typical nuclear mass, up to sixth order. Some of these might be grouped and denoted the electron-phonon contribution to total energy, $E^{\textrm{elph}}$, that first appears at fourth order. The electronic inertial mass contributes at sixth order. We clarify that the sum of the Allen-Heine-Cardona zero-point renormalization of eigenvalues over occupied states is not the electron-phonon contribution to the total energy but a part of the phononic contribution. The computation of the lowest-order $E^{\textrm{elph}}$ is implemented and shown to be small but non-negligible (3.8~meV per atom) in the case of diamond and its hexagonal polymorph. We also estimate the electronic inertial mass contribution and the quasi-harmonic one. We confirm the size consistency of all computed terms.

Title: Odd viscosity and anomalous Hall effect in two dimensional electron systems with smooth disorder
Authors: D.S. Zohrabyan, M.M. Glazov
Abstract: A microscopic theory of odd viscosity in two-dimensional electron systems with smooth disorder and spin-orbit interaction is developed. It is shown that spin-orbit scattering in presence of spin polarization induced by magnetic field gives rise to an off-diagonal component of the viscosity tensor. Hydrodynamic equations for spin and electric currents are derived for electrons interacting with smooth disorder. The contribution of odd viscosity to the anomalous Hall effect is calculated.

Title: Random planting with harvest: A statistical-mechanical analysis
Authors: Julian Talbot
Abstract: We formulate a statistical-mechanical description of a recently introduced random planting model in which plants are represented by growing hard disks. Seedlings of negligible size are introduced at random positions in a field, grow at a prescribed rate, and are harvested upon reaching a fixed maturity diameter. Planting attempts that would lead to an overlap at any time during growth are rejected. Starting from an empty field, this simple dynamical rule drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state in which the mean planting and harvesting rates coincide. We show that the steady state can be mapped onto a nonadditive polydisperse hard-disk fluid and exploit this mapping to develop analytical predictions based on a low-density virial expansion and on scaled particle theory. The resulting description yields an effective adsorption isotherm for the steady-state plant density as a function of the planting rate and compares favorably with numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters. At large planting rates, the density approaches the optimal value achieved by desynchronized regular planting, and the data are consistent with an algebraic approach to this limit with an exponent close to 1/3. Beyond density and yield, we show that the spatial organization of the field at high planting rates exhibits clear signatures of the same underlying geometric constraints that characterize optimal desynchronized planting. This connection is revealed through both the conventional radial distribution function and a radius-resolved pair correlation g(z,r) which highlights strong size correlations associated with parent-child seeding events and whose structure can be interpreted as a dynamically broadened precursor of the corresponding ideal mixe--size lattice. Finally, we extend the theory to sigmoidal growth laws and compute the associated virial coefficient.

Title: Wave energy conversion by floating and submerged piezoelectric bimorph plates
Authors: Zachary J. Wegert, Ben Wilks, Ngamta Thamwattana, Vivien J. Challis, Santanu Koley, Michael H. Meylan
Abstract: Gaining insight into the interaction between flexible piezoelectric structures and ocean waves can inform the development of compact, high-efficiency wave-energy converters that harvest renewable energy from the marine environment. In this paper, the problem of wave energy absorption by floating and submerged piezoelectric plates is investigated. The equations of motion for a plate consisting of two piezoelectric layers separated by an elastic substrate are derived in dimensional form from the full piezoelectric constitutive laws. A solution using a modal expansion method is proposed, in which the component radiation and diffraction problems are reduced to hypersingular integral equations and solved numerically using a constant panel method. The method is general and can solve the equations of motion for submerged rigid, flexible elastic or flexible piezoelectric plates. Extensive numerical results for the energy absorption and efficiency are given for a range of parameters, including different piezoelectric materials: polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT-5H). Importantly, greater energy absorption is obtained for submerged plates when compared to plates floating on the surface. Furthermore, clamped boundary conditions give slightly larger energy absorption compared to the simply supported case. Our open-source code is provided at this https URL.

Title: Entropic trade-off relations in stochastic thermodynamics via replica Markov processes
Authors: Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: Traditional thermodynamic trade-off relations usually apply to quantities that depend linearly on probability distributions. In contrast, many important information-theoretic measures, such as entropies, are nonlinear and therefore difficult to analyze with existing frameworks. Motivated by replica methods in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we introduce replica Markov processes, i.e., Markovian dynamics of $K$ independent, identical copies, and derive trade-off relations that bound relative moments of replica observables in terms of the dynamical activity. By choosing appropriate replica observables, these inequalities translate into bounds on nonlinear quantities of the original single process. Focusing on entropic measures of uncertainty, we obtain upper bounds on both the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy for general trajectory-observable distributions. Moreover, we derive upper bounds on the Rényi and Tsallis entropies, where the bounds involve the initial dynamical activity. Analogous bounds can be derived for the entropies of the state distribution. In particular, we provide upper bounds on both the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy of state distributions. Moreover, we show that the Rényi and Tsallis entropies of the state distribution are bounded from above by terms involving the local escape rate from the initial node. We also illustrate how replicas can be used to study other nonlinear functionals such as extreme-value observables. Finally, we extend the construction to continuously monitored open quantum systems, where the bounds are expressed in terms of the quantum dynamical activity. These results provide entropic counterparts to activity-based uncertainty relations and establish a general method for constraining nonlinear information-theoretic quantities in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics.

Title: Plastic Work Partitioning During Slip- and Twinning-Dominated Deformation in AZ31B Magnesium Alloy
Authors: Michał Maj, Sandra Musiał, Marcin Nowak
Abstract: Plastic work partitioning was investigated in extruded AZ31B magnesium alloy under loading orientations promoting slip- or twinning-dominated deformation. Slip-dominated deformation exhibits stable plastic flow with approximately 50$\%$ of plastic work dissipated as heat. In contrast, twinning-dominated deformation initially stores most plastic work, delaying dissipation and promoting rapid strain hardening and early strain localization. The distinct mechanical responses correlate with microstructural evolution, revealing deformation-mechanism-dependent energy storage behavior in HCP magnesium alloys.

Title: Simulating fermionic fractional Chern insulators with infinite projected entangled-pair states
Authors: Hao Chen, Titus Neupert, Juraj Hasik
Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.

Title: A Dual-Gate Altermagnetic Tunnel Junction Based on Bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO
Authors: Yunfei Gao, Aolin Li, Zesen Fu, Bei Zhang, Haiming Duan, Fangping Ouyang
Abstract: Altermagnets demonstrate significant potential in spintronics due to their unique non-relativistic spin-splitting properties, yet altermagnetic devices still face challenges in efficiently switching logic states. Here, we report electrostatically controllable spin-momentum locking in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO and design a dual-gate altermagnetic tunnel junction (AMTJ), which can switch between high and low resistance states without switching the Néel vector. First-principles calculations demonstrate that vertical electric field can induce significant spin splitting in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO. Reversing the electric field direction can alter the spin-momentum locking in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO. Leveraging this electric-field-tunable spin splitting, the dual-gate AMTJ exhibits an ultrahigh tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of $10^{7}$. This work provides theoretical support for the design of fully electrically controlled AMTJs and demonstrates their great potential for applications in spintronic devices.

Title: Generalized cluster states in 2+1d: non-invertible symmetries, interfaces, and parameterized families
Authors: Kansei Inamura, Shuhei Ohyama
Abstract: We construct 2+1-dimensional lattice models of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with non-invertible symmetries and investigate their properties using tensor networks. These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\mathrm{Rep}((\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry.

Title: Quaternionic superconductivity with a single-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes--Ginzburg-Landau framework and charge-4e couplings
Authors: Christian Tantardini, Sabri .F. Elatresh
Abstract: We recast spinful superconductivity as a \textit{quaternion field theory}, where a quaternion is a four-component hypercomplex number with units $(\boldsymbol{e}_x,\boldsymbol{e}_y,\boldsymbol{e}_z)$, that encodes the spin-singlet/triplet gap in a single field $q(\mathbf{k})$. This yields a compact Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian $H_{\rm BdG}=\xi_{\mathbf{k}}\tau_z+\tau_+q+\tau_-\,q^\ddagger$ and keeps time-reversal symmetry, Altland-Zirnbauer classification, and topological diagnostics in the same variables. We introduce a quarteting field $Q\!\propto\!\mathrm{Sc}(q^2)$ and a minimal Ginzburg-Landau (GL) functional with covariant derivatives $(\nabla-2ie\mathbf A)q$ and $(\nabla-4ie\mathbf A)Q$. Analytically, a one-loop evaluation of the fluctuation bubble $\Pi(0)$ gives a quantitative vestigial charge-$4e$ criterion $\mu_{\rm eff}=\mu-g^2\Pi(0)<0$. Numerically, we verified: (i) a two-dimensional (2D) class-DIII lattice model whose $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, computed from the occupied BdG eigenvectors via the standard sewing-matrix (Pfaffian) construction at time-reversal-invariant momenta, matches helical edge spectra; (ii) a GL simulation of a pure-$Q$ vortex carrying $h/4e$ flux within $\sim2\%$ and exhibiting $\xi_Q\!\propto\!\sqrt{\eta/|\mu_{\rm eff}|}$; and (iii) a short-junction current-phase relation with a controlled window where the second harmonic dominates ($I_2\!\gg\!I_1$), together with doubled alternating-current Josephson emission and a Shapiro response consistent with $4e$-dominated transport. The framework provides a compact, symmetry-faithful route from microscopic pairing to device-level charge-$4e$ signatures.

Title: Supercoiling DNA with a free end
Authors: Daniela Moretti, Giuseppe Gonnella, Antonio Suma, Giada Forte, Davide Marenduzzo, Cristian Micheletti
Abstract: In this work, we combine coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations and mean-field theory to study supercoiling dynamics, as well as the steady-state profiles of twist and writhe, in an open DNA polymer where one of the free ends is subjected to a constant torque. Even though the other end is free, and hence can spin and release torsional stress, we observe that the entire chain transitions between a swollen and a plectonemic phase as the torque increases beyond a critical threshold. In the plectonemic phase, we observe a non-linear twist profile in the steady state, resulting from the mutual interconversion between the injected twist and geometrical writhe, which distributes inhomogeneously along the chain. We also show that the non-equilibrium dynamics of twist accumulation is diffusive, and that writhe diffusion is negligible in this geometry, as plectonemes remain localised near the end that is being rotated. We discuss the feasibility of testing our results with single-molecule experiments.

Title: A Purely Magnetic Route to High-Harmonic Spin Pumping
Authors: Ousmane Ly
Abstract: Spin pumping provides a fundamental route for dynamical spin transport, yet in its conventional form it produces only linear spin responses at the driving frequency. Recent studies have shown that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can lift these restrictions and enable strongly nonlinear spin and charge currents. Here we propose a distinct mechanism for high-harmonic spin pumping that operates independently of spin-orbit interactions. We demonstrate that purely magnetic structures can sustain high-harmonic spin currents when an additional static magnetic order parameter is introduced perpendicular to the cone axis of a precessing magnetization. This secondary magnetic order qualitatively reshapes the dynamical response, giving rise to a cascade of higher harmonics in the pumped spin current in the absence of SOC. Our results establish a SOC-independent route to ultrafast and nonlinear spin pumping rooted solely in magnetic structure and dynamics.

Title: Elastic, Quasielastic, and Superelastic Electron Scattering from Thermal Lattice Distortions in Perfect Crystals
Authors: Eric J. Heller, Anton M. Graf, Yubo Zhang, Alhun Aydin., Joonas Keski-Rahkonen
Abstract: In standard treatments of electron transport, momentum relaxation in a perfect, defect-free crystal is linked with phonon creation or annihilation. In this work, we reconsider this problem for a finite, isolated crystal, retaining the lattice center-of-mass (recoil) degree of freedom and enforcing conservation of total mechanical momentum together with discrete crystal pseudomomentum. Starting from the density-density form of the electron-lattice interaction, we show that an electron in the interior of a perfect crystal admits elastic momentum-transfer channels in which total momentum is conserved by recoil of the lattice background without phonon excitation. These elastic channels can provide the leading contribution to momentum relaxation. We further identify mixed quasi-elastic and superelastic processes in which phonon occupations change but do not account entirely for the electron's momentum transfer. The elastic channels arise within the standard microscopic Hamiltonian and do not require additional disorder or defects. The resulting framework provides a complementary microscopic perspective on momentum relaxation in clean crystals and is consistent with experimental phenomena such as weak localization, quantum oscillations, ultrasonic attenuation, and the observed separation of momentum and energy relaxation times.

Title: Anisotropic electron gas in a hyperbolic van der Waals material
Authors: Nicola Melchioni, Andrea Mancini, Antonio Ambrosio
Abstract: Electron gases in low dimensional materials exhibit unconventional transport and optical phenomena due to reduced phase space, enhanced interactions, and strong sensitivity to lattice symmetry. While commonly realized in quantum confined systems and engineered heterostructures, such states are rare in naturally occurring materials. Hyperbolic materials provide a compelling alternative, as extreme lattice anisotropy can host unconventional electronic states and novel electron-phonon interactions. Here, we investigate the angle resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) response of MoOCl2, the first naturally occurring hyperbolic material whose hyperbolicity originates from a highly anisotropic electron gas. We observe pronounced polarization dependent Fano line shapes, revealing coherent coupling between phonons and an anisotropic electronic continuum. We characterize the directional response of this continuum, incorporating it into effective Raman tensors that quantitatively reproduce the ARPR measurements and capture the distinct Raman fingerprint of MoOCl2. Excitation energy and thickness dependent ARPR measurements further demonstrate a tunable quasi 1D electronic continuum with weak interlayer coupling, establishing MoOCl2 as a model system for Raman studies of electron-phonon coupling in hyperbolic materials

Title: Hierarchical Lorentz Mirror Model: Normal Transport and a Universal $2/3$ Mean--Variance Law
Authors: Raphael Lefevere, Hal Tasaki
Abstract: The Lorentz mirror model provides a clean setting to study macroscopic transport generated solely by quenched environmental randomness. We introduce a hierarchical version whose distribution of left--right crossings satisfies an exact recursion. In dimensions $d\geq 3$, we prove normal transport: the mean conductance scales as (cross-section)/(length) on all length scales. A Gaussian closure, supported by numerics, predicts that the variance-to-mean ratio of the conductance converges to the universal value $2/3$ for all $d\geq 2$ (the ``$2/3$ law''). We provide numerical evidence for the $2/3$ law in the original (non-hierarchical) Lorentz mirror model in $d=3$, and conjecture that it is a universal signature of normal transport induced by random current matching. In the marginal case $d=2$, our hierarchical recursion reproduces the known scaling of the mean conductance and its variance.

Title: Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Oxidative Aging and Stabilization in Polymer Melts with Primary Antioxidants: Effects of Antioxidant Concentration and Molecular Architecture
Authors: Takato Ishida, Emmanuel Richaud
Abstract: Industrial polymeric materials often rely on antioxidants to achieve long-term reliability. Previous studies have frequently discussed the stabilization effect in the presence of macroscopic additive migration. However, the micro- to meso-scale coupling between polymer dynamics and antioxidant molecular dynamics remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we extend a polymer dynamics simulation framework that can account for oxidative aging. We also update the model so that it can explicitly incorporate antioxidant molecules into the simulation. As a result, the framework enables us to quantify how molecular architecture of antioxidants affects oxidation kinetics, which has previously been inferred only indirectly from apparent changes in reaction rates. It also allows us to evaluate the effects of antioxidant concentration and molecular architecture on the spatial heterogeneity of oxidative aging.

Title: Remarks on non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space in 1+1 dimensions
Authors: Kansei Inamura
Abstract: We propose an index of non-invertible symmetry operators in 1+1 dimensions and discuss its relation to the realizability of non-invertible symmetries on the tensor product of finite dimensional on-site Hilbert spaces on the lattice. Our index generalizes the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index of invertible symmetry operators represented by quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.

Title: Feasibility of performing quantum chemistry calculations on quantum computers
Authors: Thibaud Louvet, Thomas Ayral, Xavier Waintal
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is envisioned as an early and disruptive application for quantum computers. Yet, closer scrutiny of the proposed algorithms shows that there are considerable difficulties along the way. Here, we propose two criteria for evaluating two leading quantum approaches for finding the ground state of molecules. The first criterion applies to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. It sets an upper bound to the level of imprecision/decoherence that can be tolerated in quantum hardware as a function of the targeted precision, the number of gates and the typical energy contribution from states populated by decoherence processes. We find that decoherence is highly detrimental to the accuracy of VQE and performing relevant chemistry calculations would require performances that are expected for fault-tolerant quantum computers, not mere noisy hardware, even with advanced error mitigation techniques. Physically, the sensitivity of VQE to decoherence originates from the fact that, in VQE, the spectrum of the studied molecule has no correlation with the spectrum of the quantum hardware used to perform the computation. The second criterion applies to the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm, which is often presented as the go-to replacement of VQE upon availability of (noiseless) fault-tolerant quantum computers. QPE requires an input state with a large enough overlap with the sought-after ground state. We provide a criterion to estimate quantitatively this overlap based on the energy and the energy variance of said input state. Using input states from a variety of state-of-the-art classical methods, we show that the scaling of this overlap with system size does display the standard orthogonality catastrophe, namely an exponential suppression with system size. This in turns leads to an exponentially reduced QPE success probability.

Title: Terahertz s-SNOM reveals nonlocal nanoscale conductivity of graphene
Authors: Henrik B. Lassen, William V. Carstensen, Leonid Iliushyn, Timothy J. Booth, Peter Bøggild, Edmund J. R. Kelleher, Peter U. Jepsen
Abstract: As photonic and electronic technologies approach nanometre length scales and terahertz operating speeds, electrical conductivity can no longer be treated as a purely local material parameter. In this regime, charge transport becomes intrinsically nonlocal, with conductivity depending on both frequency and momentum, $\sigma(\omega,q)$, fundamentally limiting field confinement, dispersion, and loss in nanoscale devices. Here, we directly measure the nonlocal nanoscale conductivity of graphene using terahertz scattering-type near-field optical microscopy. By combining broadband THz near-field spectroscopy with quantitative electrodynamic modelling, we extract the complex conductivity of single- and few-layer graphene with $\sim$50 nm spatial resolution. We find that nonlocal response dominates the terahertz conductivity of monolayer graphene even at length scales comparable to practical device dimensions. These results establish nonlocal conductivity as a measurable and design-relevant material property in the terahertz regime, providing a quantitative foundation for predicting performance limits in ultracompact photonic and electronic systems.

Title: Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations
Authors: Kazue Kudo
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using an annealing-based approach involves solving generalized eigenvalue problems. Discretizing a PDE yields a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be formulated as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be transformed into an optimization problem with an objective function given by a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm requires iterative computations. However, it enables efficient annealing-based computation of eigenvectors to arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables. Investigations using simulated annealing demonstrate how the number of iterations scales with system size and annealing time. Computational performance depends on system size, annealing time, and problem characteristics.

Abstract: A growing self-avoiding walk (GSAW) is a walk on a graph that is directed, does not visit the same vertex twice, and has a trapped endpoint. We show that the generating function enumerating GSAWs on a half-infinite strip of finite height is rational, and we give a procedure to construct a combinatorial finite state machine that allows one to compute this generating function. We then modify this procedure to compute generating functions for GSAWs under two probabilistic models. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the expected length and displacement for GSAWs on the quarter plane, half plane, full plane, and half-infinite strips of bounded height for which we cannot compute the generating function. Finally, we prove that the generating functions for Greek key tours (GSAWs on a finite grid that visit every vertex) on a half-infinite strip of fixed height are also rational, allowing us to resolve several conjectures.

Title: Quantum transport on Bethe lattices with non-Hermitian sources and a drain
Authors: Naomichi Hatano, Hosho Katsura, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: We consider quantum transport in a tight-binding model on the Bethe lattice of finite generation, which we expect to be the first step toward analyzing electronic transport in a light-harvesting molecule. We seek conditions under which the electronic current from the peripheral sites to the central site reaches its maximum. As a new feature, we add complex potentials for sources at peripheral sites and a drain at the central site, and solve a non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem, instead of simulating an initial-value problem. Solving the eigenvalue problem clearly reveals which electronic channels contribute most to the quantum transport. We find that the number of eigenstates that can penetrate from the peripheral sites to the central site is limited among the total number of eigenstates. All the other eigenstates are localized around the peripheral sites and cannot reach the central site. The former eigenstates can carry current, reducing the problem to quantum transport on a parity-time symmetric tight-binding chain. We find that the current has a maximum with respect to the strengths of the sources and the drain. Counterintuitively, the current decreases as we increase the strengths beyond the maximum and vanishes in the limit of infinite strength. Moreover, we find that the current maximum is given by a zero mode. When the number of links is common to all generations, the current takes the maximum value at the exceptional point where two eigenstates coalesce to a zero mode, which emerges because of the non-Hermiticity due to the PT-symmetric complex potentials. By introducing randomness either into the hopping amplitude or the number of links in each generation of the tree, we obtain a random-hopping tight-binding model, and find that the current reaches its maximum not exactly, but approximately, for a zero mode, although it is no longer located at an exceptional point in general.

Title: Non-Bloch self-energy of dissipative interacting fermions
Authors: He-Ran Wang, Zijian Wang, Zhong Wang
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect describes the phenomenon of exponential localization of single-particle eigenstates near the boundary of the system. We consider its generalization to the many-body regime by investigating a general class of interacting fermion lattice models in Markovian open quantum systems. Therein, the elementary excitations from the "vacuum" (steady state) are given by two types of dissipative fermionic modes composed of single-fermion operators, which govern the long-time nonequilibrium dynamics. We perturbatively calculate the self-energy matrix of these bare modes in the presence of interactions, and utilize the non-Bloch band theory to derive an exact integral representation. By imposing complex momentum conservation, we obtain a simplified expression for corrections to Liouvillian spectrum that agrees well with numerical calculations to high precision. We further perform perturbative analysis of Liouvillian eigenstates and identify signatures of interaction-enhanced NHSE at the quasiparticle level, manifested as renormalization of the generalized Brillouin zone. Our results establish a diagrammatic framework for dissipative interacting fermions with non-Hermitian skin effect in a description of full-fledged Lindblad master equations, which resembles Fermi liquid theory in terms of interaction-dressed quasiparticles.

Title: Generalized Loschmidt echo and information scrambling in open systems
Authors: Yi-Neng Zhou, Chang Liu
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, typically explored in closed quantum systems, describes the spread of initially localized information throughout a system and can be quantified by measures such as the Loschmidt echo (LE) and out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). In this paper, we explore information scrambling in the presence of dissipation by generalizing the concepts of LE and OTOC to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. We investigate the universal dynamics of the generalized LE across regimes of weak and strong dissipation. In the weak dissipation regime, we identify a universal structure, while in the strong dissipation regime, we observe a distinctive two-local-minima structure, which we interpret through an analysis of the Lindblad spectrum. Furthermore, we establish connections between the thermal averages of LE and OTOC and prove a general relation between OTOC and Rényi entropy in open systems. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol for measuring OTOC in open systems. These findings provide deeper insights into information scrambling under dissipation and pave the way for experimental studies in open quantum systems.

Title: Dynamical Phases of Higher Dimensional Floquet CFTs
Authors: Diptarka Das, Sumit R. Das, Arnab Kundu, Krishnendu Sengupta
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non-heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.

Title: Independent e- and m-anyon confinement in the parallel field toric code on non-square lattices
Authors: Simon M. Linsel, Lode Pollet, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: Kitaev's toric code has become one of the most studied models in physics and is highly relevant to the fields of both quantum error correction and condensed matter physics. Most notably, it is the simplest known model hosting an extended, deconfined topological bulk phase. To this day, it remains challenging to reliably and robustly probe topological phases, as many state-of-the-art order parameters are sensitive to specific models and even specific parameter regimes. With the emergence of powerful quantum simulators which are approaching the regimes of topological bulk phases, there is a timely need for experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we study the ground state physics of the parallel field toric code on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. By extending the concept of experimentally accessible percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) we show that electric and magnetic anyons are independently confined on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, unlike on the square lattice. Our work manifestly demonstrates that, even in the ground state, we must make a distinction between topological order and (de-)confinement. Moreover, we report multi-critical points in the aforementioned confinement phase diagrams. Finally, we map out the topological phase diagrams on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices and compare the performance of the POPs with other topological order parameters. Our work paves the way for studies of confinement involving dynamical matter and the associated multi-critical points in contemporary quantum simulation platforms for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories.

Title: How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte
Authors: Vinay Thakur, Prabhat Prakash, Raghavan Ranganathan
Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.

Title: Enhancement of photon emission rate near QCD critical point
Authors: Yukinao Akamatsu, Masayuki Asakawa, Masaru Hongo, Mikhail Stephanov, Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We compute photon emission rate enhancement near the QCD critical point using an effective theory of dynamic critical phenomena and derive a universal photon spectrum. The emission rate scales similarly to conductivity, increasing with the correlation length ($\xi$), diverging at the critical point. The spectrum exhibits $\omega dN_{\gamma}/d^3k \propto \omega^{-1/2}$ in the scaling regime, with the transition occurring at a frequency comparable to shear damping rate $\omega \sim \gamma_{\eta}/\xi^2$, reflecting the nonequilibrium properties of the near-critical liquid.

Title: A cavity array microscope for parallel single-atom interfacing
Authors: Adam L. Shaw, Anna Soper, Danial Shadmany, Aishwarya Kumar, Lukas Palm, Da-Yeon Koh, Vassilios Kaxiras, Lavanya Taneja, Matt Jaffe, David I. Schuster, Jonathan Simon
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform has demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic in atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building large-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians. However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to spatially interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including through a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for networking applications. As an outlook, we realize a next-generation iteration of the platform with over 500 cavities and a nearly 10 times improvement in finesse. Our work unlocks the regime of many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.

Title: Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK
Authors: Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez, Jiuci Xu
Abstract: We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.

Title: Replacement-Type Quantum Gates
Authors: Florian Ginzel, Javad Kazemi, Valentin Torggler, Wolfgang Lechner
Abstract: We introduce the paradigm of replacement-type quantum gates. This type of gate introduces input qubits, candidate qubits, and output qubits. The candidate qubits are prepared such, that a displacement conditional on the input qubit results in the targeted output state. Finally, the circuit continues with the output qubits constructed from the candidate qubits instead of the input qubits, thus the name "replacement-type gate". We present examples of replacement-type $X$ and $\mathrm{CNOT}$ gates realized with spin qubits and with neutral atom qubits with error rates predicted near the threshold of the XZZX surface code. By making use of the extended Hilbert space, including the position of the particles, these gates approximately preserve the innate noise bias of the qubits. The gate preserves the noise bias which motivates advanced quantum computer architectures with quantum error correction.

Title: Delay-facilitated self-assembly in compartmentalized systems
Authors: Severin Angerpointner, Richard Swiderski, Erwin Frey
Abstract: Self-assembly processes in biological and synthetic biomolecular systems are often governed by the spatial separation of biochemical processes. While previous work has focused on optimizing self-assembly through fine-tuned reaction parameters or using phase-separated liquid compartments with fast particle exchange, the role of slow inter-compartmental exchange remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that slow particle exchange between reaction domains can enhance self-assembly efficiency through a cooperative mechanism: delay-facilitated assembly. Using a minimal model of irreversible self-assembly in two compartments with distinct reaction and exchange dynamics, we identify scenarios that maximize yield and minimize assembly time, even under conditions where isolated compartments would fail to facilitate any self-assembly. The mechanism relies on a separation of timescales between intra-compartmental reactions and inter-compartmental exchange and is robust across a wide range of geometries, including spatially extended domains with diffusive transport. We demonstrate that this effect enables geometric control of self-assembly processes through compartment volumes and exchange rates, eliminating the need for fine-tuning local reaction rates. These results offer a conceptual framework for leveraging spatial separation in synthetic self-assembly design and suggest that biological systems may use slow particle exchange to improve assembly efficiency.

Title: Coarse-Grained Fixed-Point Tensor Networks and Holographic Reflected Entropy in 3D Gravity
Authors: Ning Bao, Jinwei Chu, Yikun Jiang, Jacob March
Abstract: We use the framework of $\textit{fixed-point BCFT tensor networks}$ to present a microscopic CFT derivation of the correspondence between reflected entropy (RE) and entanglement wedge cross section (EW) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, for both bipartite and multipartite settings. These fixed-point tensor networks, obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals. Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from intrinsic CFT data.

Title: Krylov complexity and Wightman power spectrum with positive chemical potential in Schrödinger field theory
Authors: Peng-Zhang He, Lei-Hua Liu, Hai-Qing Zhang, Qing-Quan Jiang
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in Schrödinger field theory in the grand canonical ensemble with chemical potential $\mu$, with an emphasis on the qualitatively new features that arise for $\mu>0$. In this regime the fermionic Wightman power spectrum is effectively single-sided and sharply truncated at $\omega=\mu$, which induces a crossover in the Lanczos coefficients {and signals a dynamical transition from a bulk-dominated regime to a spectral-edge-dominated regime}: $b_n$ displays a two-stage linear growth (from an early-time slope $\pi/\beta$ to an asymptotic slope $2/\beta$), while $a_n$ bends from near-zero values to a linear descent with slope $-4/\beta$. We provide analytic support for the resulting complexity growth from three complementary viewpoints: (i) using an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebraic construction matched to the asymptotic Lanczos data, we show that the late-time Krylov complexity must grow quadratically, $K(t)\propto t^{2}$; (ii) by analyzing engineered Wightman spectra with controlled decay and truncation, we identify single-sided exponential decay as the key spectral feature responsible for the quadratic asymptotics, while an approximately even two-sided exponential spectrum explains the early-time $K(t)\sim\sinh^{2}(\pi t/\beta)$ behavior at large $\mu$; (iii) we formulate the problem in terms of orthogonal polynomials and estimate the crossover scale separating the early- and late-stage regimes. Overall, our results help clarify the role of chemical potential and spectral truncation in shaping operator growth and Krylov complexity in this non-relativistic quantum field theory setting.

Title: Generalizing fusion rules by shuffle: Symmetry-based classifications of nonlocal systems constructed from similarity transformations
Authors: Yoshiki Fukusumi, Taishi Kawamoto
Abstract: We study fusion rings, or symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs), which lie outside the non-negative integer matrix representation (NIM-rep), by combining knowledge from generalized symmetry and that from pseudo-Hermitian systems. By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.

Title: Non-hermitian Density Matrices from Time-like Entanglement and Wormholes
Authors: Jonathan Harper, Taishi Kawamoto, Ryota Maeda, Nanami Nakamura, Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We extensively explore the connections between time-like entanglement and non-hermitian density matrices in quantum many-body systems. We classify setups where we encounter non-hermitian density matrices into two types: one is due to causal influences under unitary evolutions, and the other is due to non-unitary evolutions in non-hermitian systems. We provide various examples of these setups including interacting harmonic oscillators, two dimensional conformal field theories and holographic dualities. In them, we compute the time-like entanglement entropy and imagitivity, which measures how much density matrices are non-hermitian. In both two classes, typical holographic examples are given by traversable AdS wormholes. We explain how causal influences in a wormhole dual to a pair of non-hermitian quantum systems is possible even without interactions between them. We argue that to realize a traversable wormhole we need not only ordinary quantum entanglement but also time-like entanglement.

Title: Near-extremal hydrodynamics and the holographic product formula
Authors: Edwan Préau
Abstract: The holographic product formula is used to determine the general form taken by holographic spectral functions in the near-extremal hydrodynamic regime, with energy $\omega$, momentum $k$ and temperature $T$ much smaller than a hard scale $\mu$. The resulting expressions simplify in the extremal limit $T \ll \omega,k\ll \mu$, for which the low-temperature gapless modes and the IR conformal behavior factorize. In some cases, this factorization extends to the general near-extremal regime $\omega,k,T\ll\mu$ at leading order in $T/\mu$. Several examples are discussed with different types of gapless modes and IR CFTs, including new numerical results for low temperature quasi-normal modes. We end with a concrete application that shows how the inclusion of the IR conformal behavior improves the description of the spectral function at low energies.

Title: Entropy of matter on the Carroll geometry
Authors: Saurav Samanta, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Abstract: Two prescriptions for the construction of Carroll geometries, the expansion of geometric variables near horizon and the expansion of metric with zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$ (speed of light in vacuum), are known to complement each other. The entropy of an ideal gas, confined in a box and kept very close to the horizon, depends on the transverse area of the container. We show this by using the Carroll geometry constructed through the expansion of the metric and then taking the zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$. Therefore, the present analysis assures the complementing nature of two ways of finding the Carroll geometry from the thermodynamical point of view.

Title: Quantum Cellular Automata on a Dual-Species Rydberg Processor
Authors: Ryan White, Vikram Ramesh, Alexander Impertro, Shraddha Anand, Francesco Cesa, Giuliano Giudici, Thomas Iadecola, Hannes Pichler, Hannes Bernien
Abstract: As quantum devices scale to larger and larger sizes, a significant challenge emerges in scaling their coherent controls accordingly. Quantum cellular automata (QCAs) constitute a promising framework that bypasses this control problem: universal dynamics can be achieved using only a static qubit array and global control operations. We realize QCAs on a dual-species Rydberg array of rubidium and cesium atoms, leveraging independent global control of each species to perform a myriad of quantum protocols. With simple pulse sequences, we explore many-body dynamics and generate a variety of entangled states, including GHZ states, 96.7(1.7)%-fidelity Bell states, 17-qubit cluster states, and high-connectivity graph states. The versatility and scalability of QCAs offers compelling routes for scaling quantum information systems with global controls, as well as new perspectives on quantum many-body dynamics.

Title: StochasticGW-GPU: rapid quasi-particle energies for molecules beyond 10000 atoms
Authors: Phillip S. Thomas, Minh Nguyen, Dimitri Bazile, Tucker Allen, Barry Y. Li, Wenfei Li, Mauro Del Ben, Jack Deslippe, Daniel Neuhauser
Abstract: $\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ is a code for computing accurate Quasi-Particle (QP) energies of molecules and material systems in the GW approximation. $\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ utilizes the stochastic Resolution of the Identity (sROI) technique to enable a massively-parallel implementation with computational costs that scale semi-linearly with system size, allowing the method to access systems with tens of thousands of electrons. We introduce a new implementation, $\mathtt{StochasticGW-GPU}$, for which the main bottleneck steps have been ported to GPUs and which gives substantial performance improvements over previous versions of the code. We showcase the new code by computing band gaps of hydrogenated silicon clusters ($\textrm{S}\textrm{i}_{\textrm{x}}\textrm{H}_{\textrm{y}}$) containing up to 10001 atoms and 35144 electrons, and we obtain individual QP energies with a statistical precision of better than $\pm0.03$ eV with times-to-solution on the order of minutes.

Title: Complexity of Quantum Trajectories
Authors: Luca Lumia, Emanuele Tirrito, Mario Collura, Fabian H.L. Essler, Rosario Fazio
Abstract: Open quantum systems can be described by unraveling Lindblad master equations into ensembles of quantum trajectories. Here we investigate how the complexity of such trajectories is affected by conservation laws and other dynamical constraints of the underlying Lindblad evolution. We characterize this complexity using a data-driven approach based on the intrinsic dimension, defined as the minimal number of variables required to encode the information contained in a data set. Applying this framework to several systems, including dissipative variants of the quantum top and of the XXZ chain, we find that the intrinsic dimension is sensitive to the structure of their dynamics. The Lindblad evolution in these systems is typically chaotic, but additional constraints arise at specific parameter values, where the dynamics becomes integrable, exhibits Hilbert-space fragmentation, or develops a closed BBGKY hierarchy, leading to pronounced minima in the intrinsic dimension. Our approach results in an unsupervised probe of the complexity of dissipative quantum systems that is sensitive to chaos and ergodicity breaking phenomena beyond the initial transient regime.

Title: How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning
Authors: Jonathan Lin, Aman Desai, Frank Barrows, Francesco Caravelli
Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.

Title: Krylov Distribution
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha, Mohammad Javad Vasli
Abstract: We introduce the Krylov distribution $\mathcal{D}(\xi)$, a static Krylov-space diagnostic that characterizes how inverse-energy response is organized in Hilbert space. The central object is the resolvent-dressed state $(H-\xi)^{-1}|\psi_0\rangle$, whose decomposition in the Krylov basis generated from a reference state defines a normalized distribution over Krylov levels. Unlike conventional spectral functions, which resolve response solely along the energy axis, the Krylov distribution captures how the resolvent explores the dynamically accessible subspace as the spectral parameter $\xi$ is varied. Using asymptotic analysis, exact results in solvable models, and numerical studies of an interacting spin chain, we identify three universal regimes: saturation outside the spectral support, extensive growth within continuous spectra, and sublinear or logarithmic scaling near spectral edges and quantum critical points. We further show that fidelity susceptibility and the quantum geometric tensor admit natural decompositions in terms of Krylov-resolved resolvent amplitudes.

Title: High-Dimensional Limit of Stochastic Gradient Flow via Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
Authors: Sota Nishiyama, Masaaki Imaizumi
Abstract: Modern machine learning models are typically trained via multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with small batch sizes, and understanding their dynamics in high dimensions is of great interest. However, an analytical framework for describing the high-dimensional asymptotic behavior of multi-pass SGD with small batch sizes for nonlinear models is currently missing. In this study, we address this gap by analyzing the high-dimensional dynamics of a stochastic differential equation called a \emph{stochastic gradient flow} (SGF), which approximates multi-pass SGD in this regime. In the limit where the number of data samples $n$ and the dimension $d$ grow proportionally, we derive a closed system of low-dimensional and continuous-time equations and prove that it characterizes the asymptotic distribution of the SGF parameters. Our theory is based on the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and is applicable to a wide range of models encompassing generalized linear models and two-layer neural networks. We further show that the resulting DMFT equations recover several existing high-dimensional descriptions of SGD dynamics as special cases, thereby providing a unifying perspective on prior frameworks such as online SGD and high-dimensional linear regression. Our proof builds on the existing DMFT technique for gradient flow and extends it to handle the stochasticity in SGF using tools from stochastic calculus.

Title: MagneX: A High-Performance, GPU-Enabled, Data-Driven Micromagnetics Solver for Spintronics
Authors: Andy Nonaka, Yingheng Tang, Julian C. LePelch, Prabhat Kumar, Weiqun Zhang, Jorge A. Munoz, Christian Fernandez-Soria, Cesar Diaz, David J. Gardner, Zhi Jackie Yao
Abstract: In order to comprehensively investigate the multiphysics coupling in spintronic devices, it is essential to parallelize and utilize GPU-acceleration to address the spatial and temporal disparities inherent in the relevant physics. Additionally, the use of cutting-edge time integration libraries as well as machine learning (ML) approaches to replace and potentially accelerate expensive computational routines are attractive capabilities to enhance modeling capabilities moving forward. Leveraging the Exascale Computing Project software framework AMReX, as well as SUNDIALS time-integration libraries and python-based ML workflows, we have developed an open-source micromagnetics modeling tool called MagneX. This tool incorporates various crucial magnetic coupling mechanisms, including Zeeman coupling, demagnetization coupling, crystalline anisotropy interaction, exchange coupling, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) coupling. We demonstrate the GPU performance and scalability of the code and rigorously validate MagneX's functionality using the mumag standard problems and widely-accepted DMI benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the data-driven capability of MagneX by replacing the computationally-expensive demagnetization physics with neural network libraries trained from our simulation data. With the capacity to explore complete physical interactions, this innovative approach offers a promising pathway to better understand and develop fully integrated spintronic and electronic systems.
