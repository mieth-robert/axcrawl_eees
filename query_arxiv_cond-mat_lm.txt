Title: Understanding entropy production via a thermal zero-player game
Authors: Mehmet Süzen
Abstract: A new thermal bath scheme for Ising-Conway Entropy Game (ICEg) is introduced. New game moves in sampling the given temperature is achieved via Monte Carlo dynamics of both Metropolis and Glauber as a stochastic game. This kind of approach makes the game an ideal tool for demonstrating thermal dependency of entropy production in a novel way. Using this new approach, Ising-Conway Entropy game's rate of entropy production depending on different temperatures are explored. Thermalized game is shown to be physically interesting and plausible test bed for studying complex dynamical systems in classical statistical mechanics, that is conceptually simple, pedagogically accessible, yet realistic.

Title: Anomalous Thickness Dependence of the Vortex Pearl Length in Few-Layer NbSe2
Authors: Nofar Fridman, Tomer Daniel Feld, Avia Noah, Ayelet Zalic, Maya Markman, T.R Devidas, Yishay Zur, Einav Grynszpan, Alon Gutfreund, Itay Keren, Atzmon Vakahi, Sergei Remennik, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Martin Emile Huber, Igor Aleiner, Hadar Steinberg, Oded Agam, Yonathan Anahory
Abstract: The coexistence of multiple types of orders is a common thread in condensed matter physics and unconventional superconductors. The nature of superconducting orders may be unveiled by analyzing local perturbations such as vortices. For thin films, the vortex magnetic profile is characterized by the Pearl-length {\Lambda}, which is inversely proportional to the 2D superfluid density; hence, normally, also inversely proportional to the film thickness, d. Here we employ the scanning SQUID-on-tip microscopy to measure {\Lambda} in NbSe2 flakes with thicknesses ranging from N=3 to 53 layers. For N>10, we find the expected dependence {\Lambda}{\varpropto}1/d. However, six-layer films show a sharp increase of {\Lambda} deviating by a factor of three from the expected value. This value remains fixed for N=3 to 6. This unexpected behavior suggests the competition between two orders; one residing only on the first and last layers of the film while the other prevails in all layers.

Title: Constrained many-body phases in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Higgs lattice gauge theory
Authors: Alexander Schuckert, Stefan Kühn, Kevin C. Smith, Eleanor Crane, Steven M. Girvin
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to soft-core bosonic matter at unit filling, inspired by the Higgs sector of the standard model. Through a combination of analytical perturbative approaches, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix-renormalization-group simulations, we uncover a rich phase diagram driven by gauge-field-mediated resonant pair hopping and the confinement of single particles. The pair hopping results in a bunching state with superextensive energy and macroscopic particle number fluctuations at strong electric field strengths and weak on-site interactions. The bunching state crosses over into a pair superfluid phase as the on-site interaction increases, characterized by a finite superfluid density and powerlaw-decaying pair correlations. At large on-site interaction strengths and driven by effective interactions induced by the gauge constraint, the superfluid transitions into an incompressible pair Mott insulator phase. At weak field strengths and on-site interactions, we find a plasma-like region, where single bosons exhibit large short-range correlations and the ground state is composed almost equally of states with even and odd local boson occupation. The presence of a bunching state with large number fluctuations, which is difficult to study using classical numerics, motivates experimental realizations in hybrid boson-qubit quantum simulation platforms such as circuit QED, neutral atoms, and trapped ions. Our findings highlight the rich interplay between gauge fields and soft-core bosonic matter.

Title: Emergent active turbulence and intermittency in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
Authors: Prince Vibek Baruah, Nadia Bihari Padhan, Biswajit Maji, Rahul Pandit, Prerna Sharma
Abstract: Active-fluid turbulence has been found in bacterial suspensions, but not so far in their algal counterparts. We present the first experimental evidence for turbulence in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We carry out a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of the flow present in these cell suspensions and show that they are quantitatively distinct from their counterparts in two-dimensional fluid and bacterial turbulence. Both kinetic-energy and density spectra of the fluid flow in algal turbulence show power-law regimes with unique scaling exponents. The fluid velocity probability distribution function (PDF) is strongly non-Gaussian and the length dependence of the PDF of fluid-velocity increments indicates small-scale intermittency. We compare and contrast our results with recent theoretical predictions for active-scalar turbulence and active glasses. Overall, our results highlight that active turbulence can arise, even in absence of orientational instabilities, so it is not limited to bacterial suspensions but it can also be found in many biological systems with free-swimming micro-organisms.

Title: Materials Graph Library (MatGL), an open-source graph deep learning library for materials science and chemistry
Authors: Tsz Wai Ko, Bowen Deng, Marcel Nassar, Luis Barroso-Luque, Runze Liu, Ji Qi, Elliott Liu, Gerbrand Ceder, Santiago Miret, Shyue Ping Ong
Abstract: Graph deep learning models, which incorporate a natural inductive bias for a collection of atoms, are of immense interest in materials science and chemistry. Here, we introduce the Materials Graph Library (MatGL), an open-source graph deep learning library for materials science and chemistry. Built on top of the popular Deep Graph Library (DGL) and Python Materials Genomics (Pymatgen) packages, our intention is for MatGL to be an extensible ``batteries-included'' library for the development of advanced graph deep learning models for materials property predictions and interatomic potentials. At present, MatGL has efficient implementations for both invariant and equivariant graph deep learning models, including the Materials 3-body Graph Network (M3GNet), MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet), Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Network (CHGNet), TensorNet and SO3Net architectures. MatGL also includes a variety of pre-trained universal interatomic potentials (aka ``foundational materials models (FMM)'') and property prediction models are also included for out-of-box usage, benchmarking and fine-tuning. Finally, MatGL includes support for Pytorch Lightning for rapid training of models.

Title: Intervalley-Coupled Twisted Bilayer Graphene from Substrate Commensuration
Authors: Bo-Ting Chen, Michael G. Scheer, Biao Lian
Abstract: We show that intervalley coupling can be induced in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) by aligning the bottom graphene layer with either of two types of commensurate insulating triangular Bravais lattice substrate. The intervalley coupling folds the $\pm K$ valleys of TBG to $\Gamma$-point and hybridizes the original TBG flat bands into a four-band model equivalent to the $p_x$-$p_y$ orbital honeycomb lattice model, in which the second conduction and valence bands have quadratic band touchings and can become flat due to geometric frustration. The spin-orbit coupling from the substrate opens gaps between the bands, yielding topological bands with spin Chern numbers $\mathcal{C}$ up to $\pm 4$. For realistic substrate potential strengths, the minimal bandwidths of the hybridized flat bands are still achieved around the TBG magic angle $\theta_M=1.05^\circ$, and their quantum metrics are nearly ideal. We identify two candidate substrate materials Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and GeSb$_2$Te$_4$, which nearly perfectly realize the commensurate lattice constant ratio of $\sqrt{3}$ with graphene. These systems provide a promising platform for exploring strongly correlated topological states driven by geometric frustration.

Title: Effect of Alloying on Intrinsic Ductility in WTaCrV High Entropy Alloys
Authors: Akshay Korpe, Osman El-Atwani, Enrique Martinez Saez
Abstract: Tungsten (W) exhibits desirable properties for extreme applications, such as the divertor in magnetic fusion reactors, but its practicality remains limited due to poor formability and insufficient irradiation resistance. In this work, we study the intrinsic ductility of body-centered cubic WTaCrV based high entropy alloys (HEAs), which are known to exhibit excellent irradiation resistance. The ductility evaluations are carried out using a criterion based on the competition between the critical stress intensity factors for emission (KIe) and cleavage (KIc) in the {110} slip planes and {110} crack planes, which are evaluated within the linear elastic fracture mechanics framework and computed using density functional theory calculations. The results suggest that increasing the alloying concentrations of V and reducing the concentrations of W can significantly improve the ductility in these HEAs. The elastic anisotropy for these HEAs is analyzed using the Zener anisotropy ratio and its correlation with the concentration of W in the alloys is studied. Results indicate that these alloys tend to be fairly isotropic independently from the concentration of W in them. The computed data for the elastic constants of these HEAs is also compared against the available experimental data. The results are in good agreement, hence validating the robustness and accuracy of the computational methods. Multiple phenomenological ductility metrics were also computed and analyzed against the analytical model. The results suggest that these models may have higher computational efficiency due to less number of parameters required for their computation. Some models, like the surrogate D parameter and the Pugh ratio, show a good correlation with the Rice model. The potential of these empirical models to serve as surrogate screening models for optimizing the compositional space is also discussed.

Title: Magnetotransport Properties in Epitaxial Films of Metallic Delafossite PdCoO$_2$: Effects of Thickness and Width Variations in Hall Bar Devices
Authors: Arnaud P. Nono Tchiomo, Anand Sharma, Sethulakshmi Sajeev, Anna Scheid, Peter A. van Aken, Takayuki Harada, Prosper Ngabonziza
Abstract: We report on a combined structural and magnetotransport study of Hall bar devices of various lateral dimensions patterned side-by-side on epitaxial PdCoO$_2$ thin films. We study the effects of both the thickness of the PdCoO$_2$ film and the width of the channel on the electronic transport and the magnetoresistance properties of the Hall bar devices. All the films with thicknesses down to 4.88 nm are epitaxially oriented, phase pure, and exhibit a metallic behavior. At room temperature, the Hall bar device with the channel width $\text{W}=2.5\, \mu\text{m}$ exhibits a record resistivity value of $0.85\,\mu\Omega$cm, while the value of $2.70\,\mu\Omega$cm is obtained in a wider device with channel width $\text{W}=10\, \mu\text{m}$. For the 4.88 nm thick sample, we find that while the density of the conduction electrons is comparable in both channels, the electrons move about twice as fast in the narrower channel. At low temperatures, for Hall bar devices of channel width $2.5\,\mu\text{m}$ fabricated on epitaxial films of thicknesses 4.88 and 5.21 nm, the electron mobilities of $\approx$ 65 and 40 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, respectively, are extracted. For thin-film Hall bar devices of width $10\,\mu\text{m}$ fabricated on the same 4.88 and 5.21 nm thick samples, the mobility values of $\approx$ 32 and 18 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ are obtained. The magnetoresistance characteristics of these PdCoO$_2$ films are observed to be temperature dependent and exhibit a dependency with the orientation of the applied magnetic field. When the applied field is oriented 90° away from the crystal $c$-axis, a persistent negative MR at all temperatures is observed; whereas when the field is parallel to the $c$-axis, the negative magnetoresistance is suppressed at temperatures above 150K.

Title: Mapping strain and structural heterogeneities around bubbles in amorphous ionically conductive Bi$_2$O$_3$
Authors: Ellis Rae Kennedy, Stephanie M. Ribet, Ian S. Winter, Caitlin A. Kohnert, Yongqiang Wang, Karen C. Bustillo, Colin Ophus, Benjamin K. Derby
Abstract: While amorphous materials are often approximated to have a statistically homogeneous atomic structure, they frequently exhibit localized structural heterogeneity that challenges simplified models. This study uses 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy to investigate the strain and structural modifications around gas bubbles in amorphous Bi$_2$O$_3$ induced by argon irradiation. We present a method for determining strain fields surrounding bubbles that can be used to measure the internal pressure of the gas. Compressive strain is observed around the cavities, with higher-order crystalline symmetries emerging near the cavity interfaces, suggesting paracrystalline ordering as a result of bubble coarsening. This ordering, along with a compressive strain gradient, indicates that gas bubbles induce significant localized changes in atomic packing. By analyzing strain fields with maximum compressive strains of 3\%, we estimate a lower bound on the internal pressure of the bubbles at 2.5 GPa. These findings provide insight into the complex structural behavior of amorphous materials under stress, particularly in systems with gas inclusions, and offer new methods for probing the local atomic structure in disordered materials. Although considering structural heterogeneity in amorphous systems is non-trivial, these features have crucial impacts on material functionalities, such as mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and electronic mobility.

Title: A universal scaling of condensation temperature in quantum fluids
Authors: S.V. Dordevic
Abstract: The phenomena of superconductivity and superfluidity are believed to originate from the same underlying physics, namely the condensation of either bosons or pairs of fermions (Cooper pairs). In this work I complied and analyzed literature data for a number of quantum fluids and showed that indeed they all follow the same simple scaling law. The critical temperature for condensation T$_c$ is found to scale with the condensate coherence length $\xi$ and the effective mass of condensing particles m$^{\ast}$. The scaling plot includes members of most known classes of superconductors, as well as a number of superfluids and condensates, such as $^3$He, $^4$He, dilute Bose and Fermi gases, excitons, polaritons, neutron superfluid and proton superconductor in neutron stars, nuclear pairing, quark--antiquark condensate and Higgs condensate. The scaling plot spans more that 24 orders of magnitude of critical temperatures, albeit the scaling exponent is not the one predicted by theory. The plot might help the search for a dark matter particle.

Title: Classification of Fragile Topology Enabled by Matrix Homotopy
Authors: Ki Young Lee, Stephan Wong, Sachin Vaidya, Terry A. Loring, Alexander Cerjan
Abstract: The moire flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene have attracted considerable attention not only because of the emergence of correlated phases but also due to their nontrivial topology. Specifically, they exhibit a new class of topology that can be nullified by the addition of trivial bands, termed fragile topology, which suggests the need for an expansion of existing classification schemes. Here, we develop a Z2 energy-resolved topological marker for classifying fragile phases using a system's position-space description, enabling the direct classification of finite, disordered, and aperiodic materials. By translating the physical symmetries protecting the system's fragile topological phase into matrix symmetries of the system's Hamiltonian and position operators, we use matrix homotopy to construct our topological marker while simultaneously yielding a quantitative measure of topological robustness. We show our framework's effectiveness using a C2T-symmetric twisted bilayer graphene model and photonic crystal as a continuum example. We have found that fragile topology can persist both under strong disorder and in heterostructures lacking a bulk spectral gap, and even an example of disorder-induced re-entrant topology. Overall, the proposed scheme serves as an effective tool for elucidating aspects of fragile topology, offering guidance for potential applications across a variety of experimental platforms from topological photonics to correlated phases in materials.

Title: Enhanced superconducting correlations in the Emery model and its connections to strange metallic transport and normal state coherence
Authors: Sijia Zhao, Rong Zhang, Wen O. Wang, Jixun K. Ding, Tianyi Liu, Brian Moritz, Edwin W. Huang, Thomas P. Devereaux
Abstract: Numerical evidence for superconductivity in the single-band Hubbard model is elusive or ambiguous despite extensive study, raising the question of whether the single-band Hubbard model is a faithful low energy effective model for cuprates, and whether explicitly including the oxygen ions will recover the properties necessary for superconducting transition. Here we show, by using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the doped two-dimensional three-band Emery model, that while the single-band model exhibits strikingly T-linear transport behavior, the three-band model shows a low temperature resistivity curvature indicating a crossover to a more metallic transport regime. Evidence has also been found in thermodynamic and superconducting measurements, which suggests that some degree of coherence in transport might be necessary for the high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates, further implying a possible connection between superconducting and transport behaviors.

Title: Resistive Anomaly near a Ferromagnetic Phase Transition: A Classical Memory Effect
Authors: Dmitrii L. Maslov, Vladimir I. Yudson, Cristian D. Batista
Abstract: We investigate resistive anomalies in metals near ferromagnetic phase transitions, focusing on the role of long-range critical fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that diffusive motion of electrons near the critical temperature ($T_c$) enhances a singular behavior of the resistivity near $T_c$ through a classical memory effect, surpassing the prediction by Fisher and Langer \cite{Fisher:1968}. We show that, close enough to $T_c$, the resistivity exhibits a cusp or anticusp, whose profile is controlled by the critical exponent of the order parameter. We also parameterize the non-Drude behavior of the optical conductivity due to a classical memory effect in terms of critical exponents. These findings offer a deeper understanding of resistive anomalies and their connection to critical exponents in metallic systems.

Title: Machine learning driven search of hydrogen storage materials
Authors: Tanumoy Banerjee, Kevin Ji, Weiyi Xia, Gaoyuan Ouyang, Tyler Del Rose, Ihor Z. Hlova, Benjamin Ueland, Duane D. Johnson, Cai-Zhuan Wang, Ganesh Balasubramanian, Prashant Singh
Abstract: The transition to a low-carbon economy demands efficient and sustainable energy-storage solutions, with hydrogen emerging as a promising clean-energy carrier and with metal hydrides recognized for their hydrogen-storage capacity. Here, we leverage machine learning (ML) to predict hydrogen-to-metal (H/M) ratios and solution energy by incorporating thermodynamic parameters and local lattice distortion (LLD) as key features. Our best-performing ML model provides improvements to H/M ratios and solution energies over a broad class of ternary alloys (easily extendable to multi-principal-element alloys), such as Ti-Nb-X (X = Mo, Cr, Hf, Ta, V, Zr) and Co-Ni-X (X = Al, Mg, V). Ti-Nb-Mo alloys reveal compositional effects in H-storage behavior, in particular Ti, Nb, and V enhance H-storage capacity, while Mo reduces H/M and hydrogen weight percent by 40-50%. We attributed to slow hydrogen kinetics in molybdenum rich alloys, which is validated by our pressure-composition isotherm (PCT) experiments on pure Ti and Ti5Mo95 alloys. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular simulations also confirm that Ti and Nb promote H diffusion, whereas Mo hinders it, highlighting the interplay between electronic structure, lattice distortions, and hydrogen uptake. Notably, our Gradient Boosting Regression model identifies LLD as a critical factor in H/M predictions. To aid material selection, we present two periodic tables illustrating elemental effects on (a) H2 wt% and (b) solution energy, derived from ML, and provide a reference for identifying alloying elements that enhance hydrogen solubility and storage.

Title: Stress-stress correlations in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids
Authors: Jimin Bai, Long-Zhou Huang, Jin Shang, Yun-Jiang Wang, Jie Zhang, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: Stress-stress correlations in crystalline solids with long-range order can be straightforwardly derived using elasticity theory. In contrast, the `emergent elasticity' of amorphous solids, rigid materials characterized by an underlying disordered structure, defies direct explanation within traditional theoretical frameworks. To address this challenge, tensor gauge theories have been recently proposed as a promising approach to describe the emergent elasticity of disordered solids and predict their stress-stress correlations. In this work, we revisit this problem in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids by employing a canonical elasticity theory approach, supported by experimental and simulation data. We demonstrate that, with respect to static stress-stress correlations, the response of a 2D disordered solid is indistinguishable from that of a 2D isotropic crystalline solid and it is well predicted by vanilla elasticity theory. Moreover, we show that the presence of pinch-point singularities in the stress response is not an exclusive feature of amorphous solids. Our results confirm previous observations about the universal character of static stress-stress correlations in crystalline and amorphous packings.

Title: Principal component analysis for 5/2 fractional quantum Hall states
Authors: Zhe Zhang, Jiajie Qiao, Xiaoliang Wu, Shaowen Yu, Qin Jin
Abstract: For the special single-layer fractional quantum Hall system with a filling factor of 5/2, which has an even denominator, this paper uses principal component analysis (PCA) to study its behavior under the breaking of particle-hole symmetry. By introducing a model three-body potential to represent the mechanism of particle-hole symmetry breaking, the paper finds that the 5/2 system evolves into two types of special topological quantum states with non-Abelian statistics as the strength and direction of the three-body potential vary. The transition points of these states correspond to the particle-hole symmetric pure Coulomb interaction system. Our results validate the applicability of machine learning as a new research tool in fractional quantum Hall systems. Furthermore, machine learning directly analyzes the raw wave functions, without relying on prior empirical theoretical assumptions and models, making it applicable to a broader range of fractional quantum Hall systems experiencing phase transitions due to particle-hole symmetry breaking.

Title: Unveiling the Oxidation Mechanisms of Octa-Penta Graphene: A Multidimensional Exploration from First-Principles to Machine Learning
Authors: Chenyi Zhou, Rubin Huo, Boyi Situ, Zihan Yan, Zhe Zhang, Yusong Tu
Abstract: Octa-penta graphene (OPG), a novel carbon allotrope characterized by its distinctive arrangement of pentagonal and octagonal rings, has garnered considerable attention due to its exceptional structure and functional properties. This study systematically investigates the oxidation mechanisms of OPG and elucidates the oxygen migration patterns on the OPG monolayer through first-principles calculations and machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations. Specifically, the oxidation processes on OPG-L and OPG-Z involve exothermic chemisorption, where oxygen molecules dissociate at the surfaces, forming stable epoxy groups. Furthermore, the integrated-crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) and Bader charge analyses provide insights into the physical mechanisms of oxygen atom adsorption. Importantly, we found that oxidation also impact the electronic properties of OPG, with OPG-L retaining its metallic characteristics post-oxygen adsorption, whereas OPG-Z undergoes a transformation from a metallic to a semiconducting state due to the introduction of oxygen. Oxygen migration on OPG monolayer involves breaking and reforming of C-O bonds, with varying stability across adsorption sites and limited migration along the basal plane. MLMD simulations corroborate these migration patterns, offering detailed migration trajectories consistent with theoretical predictions. These findings enhance the understanding of oxygen migration dynamics on OPG, facilitate its experimental validations, and highlight its potential as a novel 2D material for applications in batteries, heat-resistant materials, and oxidation-resistant coatings.

Title: A Foundational Potential Energy Surface Dataset for Materials

Persson (1 and 3), Shyue Ping Ong (2) ((1) Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (2) University of California San Diego, (3) University of California Berkeley, (4) University of Cambridge)
Abstract: Accurate potential energy surface (PES) descriptions are essential for atomistic simulations of materials. Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (UMLIPs)$^{1-3}$ offer a computationally efficient alternative to density functional theory (DFT)$^4$ for PES modeling across the periodic table. However, their accuracy today is fundamentally constrained due to a reliance on DFT relaxation data.$^{5,6}$ Here, we introduce MatPES, a foundational PES dataset comprising $\sim 400,000$ structures carefully sampled from 281 million molecular dynamics snapshots that span 16 billion atomic environments. We demonstrate that UMLIPs trained on the modestly sized MatPES dataset can rival, or even outperform, prior models trained on much larger datasets across a broad range of equilibrium, near-equilibrium, and molecular dynamics property benchmarks. We also introduce the first high-fidelity PES dataset based on the revised regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed (r$^2$SCAN) functional$^7$ with greatly improved descriptions of interatomic bonding. The open source MatPES initiative emphasizes the importance of data quality over quantity in materials science and enables broad community-driven advancements toward more reliable, generalizable, and efficient UMLIPs for large-scale materials discovery and design.

Title: Spectral signature of periodic modulation and sliding of pseudogap state in moire system
Authors: Yingzhuo Han, Yingbo Wang, Yucheng Xue, Jiefei Shi, Xiaomeng Wang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jian Kang, Yuhang Jiang, Jinhai Mao
Abstract: The nature of the pseudogap state is widely believed as a key to understanding the pairing mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity. Over the past two decades, significant efforts have been devoted to searching for spontaneous symmetry breaking or potential order parameters associated with these pseudogap states, aiming to better characterize their properties. Recently, pseudogap states have also been realized in moire systems with extensive gate tunability, yet their local electronic structure remains largely unexplored8. In this study, we report the observation of gate-tunable spontaneous symmetry breaking and sliding behavior of the pseudogap state in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MAtBG) using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy. Our spectroscopy reveals a distinct pseudogap at 4.4 K within the doping range -3 < v < -2. Spectroscopic imaging highlights a gap size modulation at moire scale that is sensitive to the filling, indicative of a wave-like fluctuating pseudogap feature. Specifically, the positions of gap size minima (GSM) coincide with regions of the highest local density of states (LDOS) at the filling v = -2.63, but a unidirectional sliding behavior of GSM is observed for other fillings. In addition, the pseudogap size distribution at certain doping levels also causes a clear nematic order, or an anisotropic gap distribution. Our results have shed light on the complex nature of this pseudogap state, revealing critical insights into the phase diagram of correlated electron systems.

Title: $1/f$ noise in the Ising model
Authors: Rahul Chhimpa, Avinash Chand Yadav
Abstract: We simulate the $N$-spin critical Ising model on a square lattice using Glauber dynamics and consider the typical one-unit time equal to $N$ single-spin-flip attempts. The divergence of correlation time with the linear extent of the system results in critical slowing down, a challenge to equilibration because the spin configurations generated in such a way are temporally correlated. We examine temporal correlations in the number of accepted spin flips and show a signature of non-trivial long-time correlation of a logarithmically decaying form or the corresponding power spectral density follows canonical $1/f$ noise.

Title: Chiral currents at zero magnetic field in some two-dimensional superconductors
Authors: Chandra M. Varma
Abstract: Non-reciprocal critical currents without applying an external magnetic field have been observed recently in several superconductors, in various forms of Graphene, a Kagome compound and in an under-doped cuprate. A necessary requirement for this is that the usual supercurrent be accompanied by a chiral super-current, i.e. with the symmetry of a hall current; equivalently that the superfluid density tensor have a chiral component. It also requires inversion breaking. The conditions for this phenomena are derived to find that their normal states must break time-reversal and chirality and that the superconducting states must in addition be non-unitary. Each of the superconductors where spontaneous non-reciprocal critical currents are observed have shown some evidence for such broken symmetries in the normal state. The superconducting state of such materials have topological edge currents, but their projected electro-magnetic part is in general not an integer. The edge states are protected in the superconductor due to a gap. Under ideal conditions, the normal state should show an anomalous Hall effect.

Title: Square lattice model with staggered magnetic fluxes: zero Chern number topological states and topological flat bands
Authors: Li-Xiang Chen, Dong-Hao Guan, Lu Qi, Xiuyun Zhang, Ying Han, Ai-Lei He
Abstract: Staggered magnetic fluxes (SMF) play a crucial role in achieving Chern insulators (CIs), by which a series of CI models have been established on various lattices. In addition, SMF induced higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) in a lattice model has been reported. In this work, we propose a square lattice model with SMF. We find intracellular SMF can induce zero-Chern-number topological insulator (ZCNTI) at quarter filling which hosts topologically protected edge states characterized by the quantized polarization, in analogy to the topological state in two dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger model. When lattice dimerization and intracellular SMF are introduced, there exists HOTI state at half filling. Furthermore, this model hosts topological flat band (TFB) by considering the next-nearest-neighbor hoppings. Several fractional Chern insulator states are investigated when hard-core bosons are filled into this TFB model.

Title: Spin-lattice relaxation of NV centers in nanodiamonds adsorbed on conducting and non-conducting surfaces
Authors: Izidor Benedičič, Yuri Tanuma, Žiga Gosar, Bastien Anézo, Mariusz Mrózek, Adam Wojciechowski, Denis Arčon
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds can be utilized as low-cost, highly versatile quantum sensors for studying surface properties in condensed matter physics through the application of relaxometry protocols. For such applications, a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic relaxation processes of NV centers in nanodiamonds is necessary. Here, we study the spin-lattice relaxation rates of NV ensembles in nanodiamonds with average diameters of 40 nm and 3 $\mu$m between room temperature and $\sim$ 6 K. The NV relaxation curves fit to a stretched-exponential form with a stretching exponent $\alpha \approx 0.7$, implying the large distribution of relaxation times of individual centers within nanodiamonds. We determine the Orbach-like scattering on phonons as the leading relaxation mechanism. Finally, we discuss the viability of nanodiamonds as surface sensors when deposited on a metallic substrate and emphasize the need for well-controlled surface preparation techniques.

Title: Engineering nonequilibrium superconducting phases in a voltage-driven superconductor under an external magnetic field
Authors: Taira Kawamura, Yoji Ohashi
Abstract: We theoretically investigate nonequilibrium properties of a normal metal-superconductor-normal metal (NSN) junction under an external magnetic field. When a bias voltage is applied between the normal-metal leads, the confined superconductor is driven out of equilibrium, resulting in a nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution function having a two-step structure. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function technique, we determine a comprehensive phase diagram of the nonequilibrium superconductor. Our analysis reveals that the interplay between Zeeman-split energy bands and the nonequilibrium distribution function gives rise to a rich phase structure. Notably, we find that superconductivity destroyed by a strong external magnetic field revives by applying the bias voltage. This reentrant phenomenon is shown to originate from four effective "Fermi surfaces" that result from the combination of Zeeman-split energy bands and the two-step structure in the nonequilibrium distribution function. Our results demonstrate the possibility of controlling quantum states of matter through the combined engineering of energy band structures and distribution functions.

Title: Investigations of Metal-Organic structures for applications in Organic Spin Valve devices
Authors: Sonia Kaushik, Manisha Priyadarsini, Avinash G. Khanderao, Dileep Kumar
Abstract: Organic spintronics has drawn the interest of the science community due to various applications in spin-valve devices. But to date, an efficient room-temperature Organic Spin Valve device has not been experimentally realized due to the complicated spin transport at the metal-organic interfaces. These studies are always challenging due to the complicated spin-polarized charge transfer at the metal-organic interfaces. The present study focuses on a comprehensive understanding of the interfacial properties that are essential for advancing device performance and functionality. The Ferromagnetic metals and half-metallic electrodes such as Co, Co2FeAl, etc., and fullerene (C60) bilayer samples are prepared and studied via different structural and magnetic characterizations. Due to the mechanical softness of C60, deep penetration of ferromagnetic metal atoms is observed inside the C60 film. In-situ MOKE measurements reveal the origin of the 23 Å thick magnetic dead layer at the interface, which is attributed to the diffused ferromagnetic clusters exhibiting superparamagnetic behavior. In contrast to the inorganic substrates, magnetic anisotropy tends to develop at 40 Å thick Co film deposited on C60 which enhances with increasing thickness. The XRD measurements confirm the presence of in-plane compressive strain and texturing along the hcp (002) phase in the Co film. The anomaly observed in the hard axis of magnetization is due to high dispersion in the local magnetic anisotropy. The variation of the magnetic anisotropy axis is observed in the Co2FeAlwedge deposited in the proximity of C60. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between ferromagnetic materials and organic semiconductors offering potential avenues for tailoring magnetoresistance effects and fundamental understanding of organic spintronic devices.

Title: Thermoelectric fluctuations of interfering Majorana bound states
Authors: Sergey Smirnov
Abstract: Nonequilibrium states produced by electric and thermal voltages ($V$, $V_T$) provide a straightforward insight into underlying degrees of freedom of composite nanostructures and are of particular interest to probe Majorana bound states. Here we explore fluctuations of thermoelectric currents at finite frequencies $\omega$ in a quantum dot coupled to two interfering Majorana bound states. At small $V$ we find that in the emission spectra the differential thermoelectric quantum noise $\partial S^>/\partial V_T$ shows an antiresonance whereas in the absorption spectra Majorana interference induces an antiresonance-resonance pair. At large $V$ this pair is preserved whereas the emission antiresonance turns into an antiresonance-resonance pair identical to the absorption one making $\partial S^>/\partial V_T$ antisymmetric in the frequency $\omega$. This antisymmetry distinguishes Majorana behavior from the one induced by Andreev bound states and does not break at higher temperatures making it attractive for experiments on Majorana interference via thermoelectric fluctuation response.

Title: Anomalous Hall effect in Dirac semimetal probed by in-plane magnetic field
Authors: Shinichi Nishihaya, Hiroaki Ishizuka, Yuki Deguchi, Ayano Nakamura, Tadashi Yoneda, Hsiang Lee, Markus Kriener, Masaki Uchida
Abstract: Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) formulated by geometric properties of Bloch wavefunctions is a ubiquitous transport phenomenon not limited to magnetic systems but also allowed in non-magnetic ones under an external field breaking time-reversal symmetry. On the other hand, detection of field-induced AHE is practically challenging because the band modulation through the Zeeman and spin-orbit couplings is typically small compared to other contributions as induced by the Lorentz force. Here, we demonstrate on Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$ films that the field-induced AHE in non-magnetic systems can be quantitatively probed by applying and rotating the magnetic field within the Hall deflection plane. Measurements on the Cd$_3$As$_2$ (112) plane reveal that AHE emerges as a clear three-fold symmetric component for the in-plane field rotation. This intrinsic response becomes more pronounced in ultralow-electron-density films where significant variations in the geometric properties are expected under the magnetic field. Our findings open new opportunities in the research of Hall responses manifested as orbital magnetization in non-magnetic systems.

Title: Pervasive protonation of perovskite membranes made by the water-soluble sacrificial layer method
Authors: Umair Saeed, Felip Sandiumenge, Kumara Cordero-Edwards, Jessica Padilla-Pantoja, José Manuel Caicedo Roque, David Pesquera, José Santiso, Gustau Catalan
Abstract: The fabrication of perovskite oxide free-standing films (membranes) by lift-off methods using water-soluble sacrificial layers is appealing because of the new mechanical degrees of freedom that these membranes present over conventional epitaxial films. However, little is known about how their fabrication process, and in particular the exposure to water during the etching step, affects their properties. Here, we investigate how membranes of two perovskite archetypes, antiferroelectric PbZrO3 and paraelectric SrTiO3, are affected by water-based etching step. Using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, we find evidence that hydrogen penetrates the perovskite structure. Concomitant with this protonation, the functional properties also change, and both materials display ferroelectric-like behavior that is absent in bulk ceramics or hydrogen-free films at room temperature. We also find that thermal annealing can be used to expel the hydrogen from the membranes, which henceforth recover bulk-like properties. The two main conclusions of this work are that (i) any perovskite membrane made by sacrificial layer hydrolysis is vulnerable to hydrogen penetration (protonation) that can induce important but extrinsic changes in functional properties, and (ii) the hydrogen can, and should, be expelled by annealing to recover intrinsic behaviour.

Title: Random search with stochastic resetting: when finding the target is not enough
Authors: Paul C. Bressloff
Abstract: In this paper we consider a random search process with stochastic resetting and a partially accessible target $\calU$. That is, when the searcher finds the target by attaching to its surface $\partial \calU$ it does not have immediate access to the resources within the target interior. After a random waiting time, the searcher either gains access to the resources within or detaches and continues its search process. We also assume that the searcher requires an alternating sequence of periods of bulk diffusion interspersed with local surface interactions before being able to attach to the surface. The attachment, detachment and target entry events are the analogs of adsorption, desorption and absorption of a particle by a partially reactive surface in physical chemistry. In applications to animal foraging, the resources could represent food or shelter while resetting corresponds to an animal returning to its home base. We begin by considering a Brownian particle on the half-line with a partially accessible target at the origin $x=0$. We calculate the non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) in the case of reversible adsorption and obtain the corresponding first passage time (FPT) density for absorption when adsorption is only partially reversible. We then reformulate the stochastic process in terms of a pair of renewal equations that relate the probability density and FPT density for absorption in terms of the corresponding quantities for irreversible adsorption. The renewal equations allow us to incorporate non-Markovian models of absorption and desorption. They also provide a useful decomposition of quantities such as the mean FPT (MFPT) in terms of the number of desorption events and the statistics of the waiting time density. Finally, we consider various extensions of the theory, including higher-dimensional search processes and an encounter-based model of absorption.

Title: Co-existing magnetization reversal mechanisms in shakti spin ice systems
Authors: Vladyslav M. Kuchkin, Unnar B. Arnalds, Hannes Jónsson, Pavel F. Bessarab
Abstract: The switching mechanisms in artificial spin ice systems are investigated with focus on shakti and modified shakti lattices. Minimum energy paths are calculated using the geodesic nudged elastic band (GNEB) method implemented with a micromagnetic description of the system, including the internal magnetic structure of the islands and edge modulations. Two switching mechanisms, uniform magnetization rotation and domain wall formation, are found to have comparable activation energy. The preference for one over the other depends strongly on the saturation magnetization and the magnetic ordering of neighboring islands. Surprisingly, these mechanisms can coexist, leading to an enhanced probability of magnetization reversal. These results provide valuable insight that can help control internal magnetization switching processes in spin ice systems and help predict their thermodynamic properties.

Title: Minimizing sensor-sample distances in scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry

Abstract: Scanning magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has led to significant advances in the sensitive imaging of magnetic systems. The spatial resolution of the technique, however, remains limited to tens to hundreds of nanometers, even for probes where NV centers are engineered within 10 nm from the tip apex. Here, we present a correlated investigation of the crucial parameters that determine the spatial resolution: the mechanical and magnetic stand-off distances, as well as the sub-surface NV center depth in diamond. We study their contributions using mechanical approach curves, photoluminescence measurements, magnetometry scans, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of surface adsorbates. We first show that the stand-off distance is mainly limited by features on the surface of the diamond tip, hindering mechanical access. Next, we demonstrate that frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) feedback partially overcomes this issue, leading to closer and more consistent magnetic stand-off distances (26-87 nm) compared to the more common amplitude-modulated (AM-AFM) feedback (43-128 nm). FM operation thus permits improved magnetic imaging of sub-100-nm spin textures, shown for the spin cycloid in BFO and domain walls in a CoFeB synthetic antiferromagnet. Finally, by examining 1H and 19F NMR signals in soft contact with a polytetrafluoroethylene surface, we demonstrate a minimum NV-to-sample distance of 7.9+/-0.4 nm.

Title: Hydroxylation-driven surface reconstruction at the origin of compressive-to-tensile stress transition in metal oxide nanoparticles
Authors: Yang Hu, Vladyslav Turlo
Abstract: Experiments reveal negative (non-Laplacian) surface stresses in metal oxide nanoparticles, partly associated with humidity during fabrication and annealing. Using a neural network interatomic potential for MgO, we prove that water adsorption induces surface hydroxylation, shifting facets from {100} to {110} to {111} and switching the average surface stress from positive to negative. Predicted lattice strains versus nanoparticle size agree well with experiments, clarifying experimental correlations. The new framework informs broad applications in catalysis, sensors, batteries, and biomedicine.

Title: T-MSD: An improved method for ionic diffusion coefficient calculation from molecular dynamics
Authors: Yuxiang Gao, Xiaodong Cao, Zhicheng Zhong
Abstract: Ionic conductivity is a critical property of solid ionic conductors, directly influencing the performance of energy storage devices such as batteries. However, accurately calculating ionic conductivity or diffusion coefficient remains challenging due to the complex, dynamic nature of ionic motion, which often yield significant deviations, especially at room temperature. In this study, we propose an improved method, T-MSD, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of diffusion coefficient calculations. Combining time-averaged mean square displacement analysis with block jackknife resampling, this method effectively addresses the impact of rare, anomalous diffusion events and provides robust statistical error estimates from a single simulation. Applied to large-scale deep-potential molecular dynamics simulations, we show that T-MSD eliminates the need for multiple independent simulations while ensuring accurate diffusion coefficient calculations across systems of varying sizes and simulation durations. This approach offers a practical and reliable framework for precise ionic conductivity estimation, advancing the study and design of high-performance solid ionic conductors.

Title: Nematic order from phase synchronization of shape oscillations
Authors: Ioannis Hadjifrangiskou, Sumesh P. Thampi, Rahil N. Valani
Abstract: We show that a suspension of non-interacting deformable particles subjected to an oscillatory shear flow leads to development of nematic order that arises from the phenomenon of phase synchronization. The synchronized state corresponds to a unique, stable limit cycle confined in the toroidal state space. The limit cycle exists since, unlike rigid particles, deformable particles can modulate aspect ratio, adjust their tumbling rate and thus, achieve phase synchronization. These synchronized regions emerge as Arnold tongues in the parameter-space of the driving amplitude and frequency. Considering the rheological implications of ordering dynamics in soft and active matter, our results motivate oscillatory shear flow experiments with deformable particles.

Title: Euler buckling on curved surfaces
Authors: Shiheng Zhao, Pierre A. Haas
Abstract: Euler buckling epitomises mechanical instabilities: An inextensible straight elastic line buckles under compression when the compressive force reaches a critical value $F_\ast>0$. Here, we extend this classical, planar instability to the buckling under compression of an inextensible relaxed elastic line on a curved surface. By weakly nonlinear analysis of an asymptotically short elastic line, we reveal that the buckling bifurcation changes fundamentally: The critical force for the lowest buckling mode is $F_\ast=0$ and higher buckling modes disconnect from the undeformed branch to connect in pairs. Solving the buckling problem numerically, we additionally find a new post-buckling instability: A long elastic line on a curved surface snaps through under sufficient compression. Our results thus set the foundations for understanding the buckling instabilities on curved surfaces that pervade the emergence of shape in biology.

Title: Identifying high-energy electronic states of NV$^-$ centers in diamond
Authors: Minh Tuan Luu, Christopher Linderälv, Zsolt Benedek, Ádám Ganyecz, Gergely Barcza, Viktor Ivády, Ronald Ulbricht
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond is a prototype photoluminescent point defect spin qubit with promising quantum technology applications, enabled by its efficient optical spin polarization and readout. Its low-lying electronic states and optical spin polarization cycle have been well characterized over decades, establishing it as a benchmark system for state-of-the-art computational methods in point defect research. While the optical cycle is well understood, a comprehensive energetic analysis of higher-lying states has received less attention until recently. In this joint experimental theoretical study, we identify and characterize five high-energy states beyond those involved in the optical cycle. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we determine their transition energies and relative oscillator strengths. Additionally, we perform two independent numerical studies employing two state-of-the-art post-DFT methods to support the experimental findings and assign energy levels. These results enhance our understanding of the NV center's energy spectrum and providing a broader reference for benchmarking high-level first-principles methods.

Title: Quantum metric induced magneto-optical effects in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets
Authors: Yongpan Li, Yichen Liu, Cheng-Cheng Liu
Abstract: The magneto-optical effects (MOEs), as a fundamental physical phenomenon, can reveal the electronic structures of materials. The related probing methods are widely used in the study of magnetic materials. However, space-time inversion ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric antiferromagnets were previously believed to be magneto-optically inactive. Here, we point out that this traditional understanding is incorrect. Based on our generic formulas and symmetry analysis, we find that in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets, it is the quantum metric, i.e., the real part of the quantum geometry, that induces MOEs. Combining a tight-binding model and first-principles calculations, we confirm this observation by showing MOEs in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnet. Our work demonstrates that $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets previously thought to lack MOEs can indeed exhibit MOEs and greatly broaden the research on MOEs.

Title: Casimir-like effect driven self-assembly of graphene on molten metals
Authors: Kristýna Bukvišová, Radek Kalousek, Marek Patočka, Jakub Zlámal, Jakub Planer, Vojtěch Mahel, Daniel Citterberg, Libor Novák, Tomáš Šikola, Suneel Kodambaka, Miroslav Kolíbal
Abstract: Casimir effect, explained by Hendrik Casimir in 1948, is a macroscopic manifestation of quantum electrodynamics. Symmetry breaking due to space confinement of vacuum fluctuations in between two planar mirrors results in an attractive force acting between the two mirrors. Here, we show that spontaneous self-assembly of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials grown on molten metals (rheotaxy) is driven by the mechanical forces exerted by the liquid on the graphene domain and that these forces are subject to a Casimir-like effect. We present in situ environmental and ultrahigh vacuum scanning electron microscopy observations of chemical vapor deposition of graphene on both solid and molten gold and copper, which reveal that the self-assembly occurs via translational and rotational motions of graphene domains during growth on molten metals. Using high-temperature (~ 1300 K) atomic force microscopy measurements of graphene/molten-metal interfaces, coupled with density functional theory and continuum modelling of 2D layers floating on a liquid surface, we attribute the observed phenomena to Casimir-like effect of surface undulations and give further guidance for achieving seamless stitching of 2D layer domains into large scale monolayers.

Title: Observation of collective charge excitations in a cuprate superconductor

Abstract: Emergent symmetry breakings in condensed matter systems are often intimately linked to collective excitations. For example, the intertwined spin-charge stripe order in cuprate superconductors is associated with spin and charge excitations. While the collective behavior of spin excitations is well established, the nature of charge excitations remains to be understood. Here we present a high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of charge excitations in the stripe-ordered cuprate La$_{1.675}$Eu$_{0.2}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$. The RIXS spectra consist of both charge and phonon excitations around the charge ordering wave vector. By modeling the momentum-dependent phonon intensity, the charge-excitation spectral weight is extracted for a wide range of energy. As such, we reveal the highly dispersive nature of the charge excitations, with an energy scale comparable to the spin excitations. Since charge order and superconductivity in cuprates are possibly driven by the same electronic correlations, determining the interaction strength underlying charge order is essential to establishing a comprehensive microscopic model of high-temperature superconductivity.

Title: Emergence of Robust High-Temperature Superconductivity in Li3IrH9 at Moderate Pressures
Authors: Wendi Zhao, Shumin Guo, Tiancheng Mg, Zhengtao Liu, Chengda Li, Defang Duan, Tian Cui
Abstract: The discovery of near-room temperature superconductivity in compressed hydrides has sparked intensive efforts to find superconducting hydrides that are stable at low pressure or even ambient pressure. Herein, we present the ternary hydride Li3IrH9 as an exceptional candidate, which exhibits thermodynamic stability above 100 GPa and dynamic stability down to 8 GPa, exhibiting a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of up to 113 K. In this structure, the broadening and overlapping between the electronic bands of the Ir-H antibonding states and the neighboring H ions result in the intrinsic metallicity of the hydrogen sublattice and drive the emergence of hydrogen-dominated significant electronic states at the Fermi level. Within this specific mechanism, the softened optical modes generated by hydrogen atoms encapsulated in the center of the Li octahedron play a critical role in strengthening electron-phonon coupling, an effect that remains robust even under high-pressures. Through high-throughput computational screening, we further identified a new family of superconductors derived from this prototype, including Li3RhH9 (Tc = 124 K at 20 GPa) and Li3CoH9 (Tc = 80 K at 10 GPa). This work provides original theoretical insights to accelerate the discovery of emerging hydride superconductor families that exhibit robust high-temperature superconductivity under moderate-pressures, along with promising potential for practical implementation.

Title: Capillary jet in a slab of foam
Authors: Théophile Gaichies, Bryan Giraud, Anniina Salonen, Arnaud Antkowiak, Emmanuelle Rio
Abstract: A capillary jet plunging into a quasi-2D slab of monodisperse foam of the same solution is studied experimentally. We show that the jet can have a drastic impact on the foam. At small speeds it inflates the channels separating the bubbles. At intermediate speeds, impact with channels creates very small bubbles. At higher speeds, the jet thins the foam films, which can result in bubble rupture. We study the mechanisms behind these processes using an elementary foam formed by three soap films in contact through a Plateau border. We obtain scaling laws, which transfer quantitatively from the elementary foam to the 2D foam.

Title: Unveiling the effect of adding B4C at the W-on-Si interface
Authors: Adele Valpreda (1), Hendrik W. Lokhorst (1), Jacobus M. Sturm (1), Andrey E. Yakshin (1), Marcelo Ackermann (1) ((1) Industrial Focus Group XUV Optics, MESA+ Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands)
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the W-on-Si interface and the effect of adding a B4C interlayer at such interface, using low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy, X-ray reflectivity, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We extract the effective width of the interface in three different structures having: no-B4C, 0.24 nm, and 1.2 nm of B4C deposited in between the W and the Si films. The analysis reveals that the W distribution does not get significantly sharper when B4C atoms are deposited at the W-on-Si interface, showing that B4C does not act as a physical barrier against the diffusion of atoms during the deposition of these structures. W/Si thin-film structures are used in various applications, including X-ray optics. While many studies reported that adding a sub-nm thick B4C film at the W/Si interfaces is beneficial for the overall reflectivity of the structures, the physical mechanisms involved were not yet fully understood. In this context, being able to characterize the width of the interfaces with sub-nm resolution is key. In this study, we show how the analysis of the sub-surface signal of the LEIS spectra enables the characterization of the interface W-on-(B4C-)Si, highlighting the importance of systematically extracting the values of the effective interface width for the analysis and understanding of thin-film growth.

Title: Concurrent Multifractality and Anomalous Hall Response in the Nodal Line Semimetal Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ Near Localization

Abstract: Topological states of matter exhibit unique protection against scattering by disorder. Different topological classes exhibit distinct forms and degrees of protection. Here, we investigate the response of the ferromagnetic nodal line semimetal Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ to disorder and electronic interactions. By combining global magneto-transport with atomic-scale scanning tunneling spectroscopy we find a simultaneous onset of diverse phenomena below a common temperature scale of about 15 K: A crossover from metallic to insulating temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity, saturation of the anomalous Hall conductivity to its maximal value, formation of a sharp zero-bias dip in the tunneling density of state, and emergence of multi-fractal structure of the electronic wavefunction peaking at the Fermi energy. These concurrent observations reflect the emergence of a novel energy scale possibly related to the opening of a gap in the nodal line band of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. Our study provides overarching insight into the role of disorder, electronic interactions and Berry curvature in setting the micro- and macro-scale responses of topological semimetals.

Title: Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moiré matter beyond one billion sites
Authors: Yitao Sun, Marcel Niedermeier, Tiago V. C. Antão, Adolfo O. Fumega, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.

Title: Duality of Wave Modulation and Nanotwinning in Ni-Mn-Ga Martensite via Long-Period Commensurate States
Authors: P. Veřtát, M. Zelený, A. Sozinov, M. Klicpera, O. Fabelo, R. Chulist, M. Vinogradova, P. Sedlák, H. Seiner, O. Heczko, L. Straka
Abstract: Understanding the crystal structure of magnetic shape memory alloys is crucial for elucidating their martensite twin boundary supermobility and related functionalities. This study analyzes and discusses the structure of martensitic single crystals of Ni50.0Mn27.7Ga22.3 and Ni50.0Mn28.1Ga21.9. Neutron and X-ray diffraction reveal an anharmonic, incommensurate five-layer modulation that evolves with temperature. This evolution gives rise to two key microstructural features: i) periodic nanodomains, identified as emerging a/b-nanotwins, and ii) long-period commensurate structures, such as the 34O, 24O, and 14O states, whose orthorhombic unit cells inherently realize a/b-nanotwins. Ab initio calculations show that these long-period structures are energetically favorable, leading to a lock-in transition. In the alloys studied, the 24O state is the locked-in phase at low temperatures, whereas literature data indicate that Ni50Mn25Ga25 (exact Ni2MnGa stoichiometry) evolves toward the 14O phase. Crucially, these results unify two seemingly contrasting structural descriptions -- wave-like modulation and discrete nanotwinning -- thereby establishing a foundation for a deeper understanding of the crystal-structure-functionality relationship in magnetic shape memory alloys.

Title: Energy barriers for small electron polaron hopping in bismuth ferrite from first principles
Authors: Sabine Körbel
Abstract: Evidence from first-principles calculations indicates that excess electrons in BiFeO3 form small polarons with energy levels deep inside the electronic band gap. Hence, n-type electronic transport could occur by hopping of small electron polarons rather than by band-like transport. Here, by means of first-principles calculations, small electron polaron hopping in BiFeO3 is investigated. Both bulk BiFeO3 and a typical ferroelectric domain wall, the neutral 71° domain wall, are considered. The latter is included to account for experimental observations of electrical conductivity at domain walls in otherwise insulating ferroelectrics. The object of this study is to shed light on the intrinsic electron conduction in rhombohedral BiFeO3 and the effect of pristine neutral ferroelectric domain walls. The computed energy barriers for small electron polaron hopping are of the order of the thermal energy at room temperature, both in bulk and within the neutral 71° domain wall. The domain wall is found to act as a two-dimensional trap for small electron polarons with a trap depth of about two to three times the thermal energy at room temperature. Based on these findings, the intrinsic n-type mobility and diffusion constant in BiFeO3 at room temperature are estimated, and experimental conductivity data for BiFeO3 are discussed.

Title: Identical Suppression of Spin and Charge Density Wave Transitions in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ by Pressure

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in nickelate systems is a key focus of condensed matter research. Microscopic insights into magnetism, which emerges near superconductivity, require a synergistic approach that combines complementary techniques with controlled parameter tuning. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the three-layer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR), neutron powder diffraction (NPD), resistivity, and specific heat measurements. At ambient pressure, two incommensurate spin density wave (SDW) transitions were identified at $T_{\rm SDW} \simeq 132$ K and $T^\ast \simeq 90$ K. NPD experiments revealed that the magnetic wave vector $(0, 0.574, 0)$ remains unchanged below 130 K, indicating that the transition at $T^\ast$ corresponds to a reorientation of the Ni magnetic moments within a similar magnetic structure. Comparison of the observed internal magnetic fields with dipole-field calculations reveals a magnetic structure consistent with an antiferromagnetically coupled SDW on the outer two Ni layers, with smaller moments on the inner Ni layer. The internal fields at muon stopping sites appeared abruptly at $T_{\rm SDW}$, suggesting a first-order-like nature of the SDW transition, which is closely linked to the charge density wave (CDW) order occurring at the same temperature ($T_{\rm SDW} = T_{\rm CDW}$). Under applied pressure, all transition temperatures, including $T_{\rm SDW}$, $T^\ast$, and $T_{\rm CDW}$, were suppressed at a nearly uniform rate of $\simeq -13$ K/GPa. This behavior contrasts with the double-layer RP nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where pressure enhances the separation of the density wave transitions.

Title: Observation of non-adiabatic Landau-Zener tunneling among Floquet states
Authors: Yun Yen, Marcel Reutzel, Andi Li, Zehua Wang, Hrvoje Petek, Michael Schüler
Abstract: Electromagnetic fields not only induce electronic transitions but also fundamentally modify the quantum states of matter through strong light-matter interactions. As one established route, Floquet engineering provides a powerful framework to dress electronic states with time-periodic fields, giving rise to quasi-stationary Floquet states. With increasing field strength, non-perturbative responses of the dressed states emerge, yet their nonlinear dynamics remain challenging to interpret. In this work we explore the emergence of non-adiabatic Landau-Zener transitions among Floquet states in Cu(111) under intense optical fields. At increasing field strength, we observe a transition from perturbative dressing to a regime where Floquet states undergo non-adiabatic tunneling, revealing a breakdown of adiabatic Floquet evolution. These insights are obtained through interferometrically time-resolved multi-photon photoemission spectroscopy, which serves as a sensitive probe of transient Floquet state dynamics. Numerical simulations and the theory of instantaneous Floquet states allow us to directly examine real-time excitation pathways in this non-perturbative photoemission regime. Our results establish a direct connection the onset of light-dressing of matter, non-perturbative ultrafast lightwave electronics, and high-optical-harmonic generation in the solids.

Title: Relationship between the shear moduli and defect-induced structural relaxation ofhigh-entropy metallic glasses
Authors: Andrey Makarov, Evgenia Gonchrova, Jichao Qiao, Roman Konchakov, Vitaly Khonik
Abstract: We performed high-frequency shear modulus and calorimetry measurements on seven high-entropy metallic glasses (HEMGs) in the initial, relaxed and crystalline states. It is shown that the shear modulus of HEMGs is intrinsically related with the concentration of defects responsible for structural relaxation. In the absence of structural relaxation, temperature coefficient of shear modulus of glass equals to that of the maternal crystal. All found regularities are governed by a single equation.

Title: On the nature of the glass transition in metallic glasses after deep relaxation
Authors: A.S. Makarov, G.V. Afonin, R.A. Konchakov, J.C. Qiao, N.P. Kobelev, V.A. Khonik
Abstract: We performed parallel study of calorimetric and high-frequency shear modulus behavior of Zr-based metallic glasses after deep relaxation just below the glass transition. It is shown that deep relaxation results in the appearance of a strong peak of the excess heat capacity while the shear modulus is moderately affected. A theory assuming high-frequency shear modulus to be a major physical parameter controlling glass relaxation is suggested. The energy barrier for these rearrangements is proportional to the shear modulus while its magnitude, in turn, varies due to the changes in the defect concentration (diaelastic effect). Both dependences lead to the occurrence of heat effects. The excess heat capacity calculated using experimental shear modulus data demonstrates very good agreement with the experimental calorimetric data for all states of glasses. It is argued that the glass transition behavior after deep relaxation of glass is close to a phase transition of the first kind.

Title: Beyond Disorder: Unveiling Cooperativeness in Multidirectional Associative Memories
Authors: Andrea Alessandrelli, Adriano Barra, Andrea Ladiana, Andrea Lepre, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: By leveraging tools from the statistical mechanics of complex systems, in these short notes we extend the architecture of a neural network for hetero-associative memory (called three-directional associative memories, TAM) to explore supervised and unsupervised learning protocols. In particular, by providing entropic-heterogeneous datasets to its various layers, we predict and quantify a new emergent phenomenon -- that we term {\em layer's cooperativeness} -- where the interplay of dataset entropies across network's layers enhances their retrieval capabilities Beyond those they would have without reciprocal influence. Naively we would expect layers trained with less informative datasets to develop smaller retrieval regions compared to those pertaining to layers that experienced more information: this does not happen and all the retrieval regions settle to the same amplitude, allowing for optimal retrieval performance globally. This cooperative dynamics marks a significant advancement in understanding emergent computational capabilities within disordered systems.

Title: Infinite-temperature thermostats by energy localization in a nonequilibrium setup
Authors: Michele Giusfredi, Stefano Iubini, Antonio Politi, Paolo Politi
Abstract: Some lattice models having two conservation laws may display an equilibrium phase transition from a homogeneous (positive temperature - PT) to a condensed (negative temperature) phase, where a finite fraction of the energy is localized in a few sites. We study one such stochastic model in an out-of-equilibrium setup, where the ends of the lattice chain are attached to two PT baths. We show that localized peaks may spontaneously emerge, acting as infinite-temperature heat baths. The number $N_b$ of peaks is expected to grow in time $t$ as $N_b \sim \sqrt{\ln t}$, as a consequence of an effective freezing of the dynamics. Asymptotically, the chain spontaneously subdivides into three intervals: the two external ones lying inside the PT region; the middle one characterized by peaks superposed to a background lying along the infinite-temperature line. In the thermodynamic limit, the Onsager formalism allows determining the shape of the whole profile.

Title: A microstructural model of transversely isotropic, fibre-reinforced hydrogels
Authors: Matthew G. Hennessy, Tom Shearer, Axel C. Moore
Abstract: Fibre-reinforced hydrogels are promising materials for biomedical applications due to their strength, toughness, and tunability. However, it remains unclear how to design fibre-reinforced hydrogels for use in specific applications due to the lack of a flexible modelling framework that can predict and hence optimise their behaviour. In this paper, we present a microstructural model for transversely isotropic fibre-reinforced hydrogels that captures the specific geometry of the fibre network. The model also accounts for slack in the initial fibre network that is gradually removed upon deformation. The mechanical model for the fibre network is coupled to a nonlinear poroelastic model for the hydrogel matrix that accounts for osmotic stress. By comparing the model predictions to data from load-controlled, unconfined compression experiments, we show that the model can capture J-shaped stress-strain curves and time-dependent creep responses. We showcase how the model can be used to guide the design of materials for artificial cartilage by exploring how to maximise interstitial fluid pressure. We find that fluid pressurisation can be increased by using stiffer fibres, removing slack from the fibre network, and reducing the Young's modulus of the hydrogel matrix. Finally, an open-source Python package has been developed for simulating unconfined compression experiments using the model.

Title: Accurate predictive model of band gap with selected important features based on explainable machine learning
Authors: Joohwi Lee, Kaito Miyamoto
Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of materials informatics, nonlinear machine learning models have demonstrated exceptional predictive capabilities for material properties. However, their black-box nature limits interpretability, and they may incorporate features that do not contribute to, or even deteriorate, model performance. This study employs explainable ML (XML) techniques, including permutation feature importance and the SHapley Additive exPlanation, applied to a pristine support vector regression model designed to predict band gaps at the GW level using 18 input features. Guided by XML-derived individual feature importance, a simple framework is proposed to construct reduced-feature predictive models. Model evaluations indicate that an XML-guided compact model, consisting of the top five features, achieves comparable accuracy to the pristine model on in-domain datasets while demonstrating superior generalization with lower prediction errors on out-of-domain data. Additionally, the study underscores the necessity for eliminating strongly correlated features to prevent misinterpretation and overestimation of feature importance before applying XML. This study highlights XML's effectiveness in developing simplified yet highly accurate machine learning models by clarifying feature roles.

Title: Tuning Magnetism of Metal-Organic Framework by Different Types of Pressure
Authors: Shuang Liu, Na Su, Huixia Fu, Yan Liu, Young Sun
Abstract: The properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are expected to be sensitive to external pressures because of their inherently flexible structures. Although pressure-driven structural transitions have been intensively studied, the influence of pressure on magnetism has been less exploited for MOFs. Especially, the efficiency of applied pressure may strongly depend on the pressure-transmitting medium (PTM) which may have a complex interaction with MOFs. Here, we report the distinctive effects of different types of pressure, including isotropic hydrostatic pressure, quasi-hydrostatic pressure, and uniaxial pressure, on the anisotropic magnetism of the perovskite MOF, [CH3NH3][Co(COOH)3]. It is found that the hydrostatic pressure has the minimal effect whereas the uniaxial pressure has the highest efficiency in tuning magnetization and magnetic anisotropy of the MOF. First-principles calculations reveal that the applied low pressures (less than 11 kbar) do not induce notable lattice distortion in the framework or the superexchange path. Instead, the modulation of hydrogen bonds is identified as a critical factor for pressure tuning of magnetization and anisotropy. These findings underscore the potential applications of directional pressure in precisely controlling the magnetic and electronic properties of MOFs.

Title: Detection of 2D SPT Order with Partial Symmetries
Authors: Alex Turzillo, Naren Manjunath, Jose Garre-Rubio
Abstract: A method of using partial symmetries to distinguish two dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of on-site, unitary symmetries is proposed. This novel order parameter takes a wavefunction, such as a ground state of a lattice model, and detects its SPT invariants as expectation values of finitely supported operators, without the need for flux insertion. The construction exploits the rotational symmetry of the lattice to extract on-site SPT invariants, building upon prior work on probing crystalline SPT phases with partial rotations. The method is demonstrated by computing the order parameter analytically on group cohomology models and numerically on a family of states interpolating between the CZX state and a trivial state. Its robustness is suggested by interpreting partial symmetries as generating the topological partition functions of lens spaces.

Title: Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT) and quantum beats
Authors: Daniel Boyanovsky
Abstract: In this article it is argued that synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate via a common two photon decay channel since they both couple to electromagnetic fields via a Chern-Simons term. We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed.

Title: Unraveling Antagonistic Collision-Controlled Reactivity in Energetic Molecular Perovskites with Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Ming-Yu Guo, Yun-Fan Yan, Pin Chen, Wei-Xiong Zhang
Abstract: The precise regulation of chemical decompositions in energetic materials, whether towards rapid ignition or stable endurance, requires atomic-scale principles governing reactivity, which remain elusive yet. Herein, we resolve this challenge through deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations, uncovering a universal collision-control principle in energetic molecular perovskites, $\text{(H}_{2}\text{dabco)B(ClO}_{4}\text{)}_{3}$, where $\text{H}_{2}\text{dabco}^{2+}$ = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1,4-diium, B = $\text{Na}^{+}$, $\text{K}^{+}$, $\text{Rb}^{+}$, $\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$ for DAP-1, DAP-2, DAP-3 and DAP-4, respectively. Atomic-scale simulation with Arrhenius fitting for over 100-ps trajectories reveals that increasing B-site ionic radius ($\text{Na}^{+} < \text{K}^{+} < \text{Rb}^{+}$) simultaneously reduces both activation energy $E_{a}$, which enhances reactivity, and pre-exponential factor $A$ which suppresses collision probabilities for hydrogen transfer between site $X$ and site $A$, with sharply opposing kinetic consequences. This duality well explains the peak stability and insensitivity in $\text{K}^{+}$-based DAP-2, which optimally balance thermal endurance and collision dissipation. For ammonium-based DAP-4, though the radius of $\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$ is close to $\text{K}^{+}$, the reactive B-site cation triggers proton transfer that promotes $\text{C-H}$ bond rupture. By linking static cation radii to dynamic $E_{a}$-ln$(A)$ coupling, we rationalize non-monotonic decomposition temperatures ($\text{K}^{+} > \text{NH}_{4}^{+} > \text{Rb}^{+} > \text{Na}^{+}$) macroscopic stability and establishes cornerstones for universal energetic material design.

Title: Reversal of tracer advection and Hall drift in an interacting chiral fluid
Authors: Erik Kalz, Shashank Ravichandir, Johannes Birkenmeier, Ralf Metzler, Abhinav Sharma
Abstract: Chiral fluids are defined by broken mirror or time-reversal symmetry, giving rise to tensorial transport coefficients with antisymmetric components. A key example is the odd mobility tensor, which governs the response of a chiral tracer to an applied force and induces a characteristic transverse drift. While this response is well understood in the infinite dilution limit, the impact of interparticle interactions on the tracer dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here, we conduct an analytical and computational study of a chiral fluid with interparticle interactions and show that, under an external driving force, a chiral tracer can undergo a complete reversal of both its transverse Hall drift and its advection along the force. This reversal emerges from the interplay between odd mobility and interaction-mediated forces, resulting in a phenomenon reminiscent of absolute negative mobility.

Title: Coexistence of distinct mobility edges in a 1D quasiperiodic mosaic model
Authors: Xu Xia, Weihao Huang, Ke Huang, Xiaolong Deng, Xiao Li
Abstract: We introduce a one-dimensional quasiperiodic mosaic model with analytically solvable mobility edges that exhibit different phase transitions depending on the system parameters. Specifically, by combining mosaic quasiperiodic next-nearest-neighbor hoppings and quasiperiodic on-site potentials, we rigorously demonstrate the existence of two distinct types of mobility edges: those separating extended and critical states, and those separating extended and localized states. Using Avila's global theory, we derive exact analytical expressions for these mobility edges and determine the parameter regimes where each type dominates. Our numerical calculations confirm these analytical results through fractal dimension analysis. Furthermore, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to realize this model using Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices with engineered momentum-state transitions. We also investigate the effects of many-body interactions under mean-field approximation. Our work provides a fertile ground for studying the coexistence of different types of mobility edges in quasiperiodic systems and suggests a feasible experimental platform to observe and control these transitions.

Title: The Bose polaron as thermometer of a trapped Bose gas: a quantum Monte Carlo study
Authors: Tomasz Wasak, Gerard Pascual, Gregory E. Astrakharchik, Jordi Boronat, Antonio Negretti
Abstract: Quantum impurities interacting with quantum environments offer unique insights into many-body systems. Here, we explore the thermometric potential of a neutral impurity immersed in a harmonically trapped bosonic quantum gas below the Bose-Einstein condensation critical temperature $T_c$. Using ab-initio Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations at finite temperatures, we analyze the impurity's sensitivity to temperature changes by exploiting experimentally accessible observables such as its spatial distribution. Our results, covering a temperature range of $-1.1 \leqslant T/T_c \leqslant 0.9$, reveal that the impurity outperforms estimations based on a one-species bath at lower temperatures, achieving relative precision of 3-4\% for 1000 measurement repetitions. While non-zero boson-impurity interaction strength $g_{BI}$ slightly reduces the accuracy, the impurity's performance remains robust, especially in the low-temperature regime $T/T_c \lesssim 0.45$ withing the analyzed interaction strengths $0 \leqslant g_{BI}/g \leqslant 5$, where $g$ is the boson-boson coupling. We confirm that quantum optical models can capture rather well the dependence of the temperature sensor on the impurity-gas interaction. Although our findings are in qualitative agreement with previous studies, our Monte Carlo simulations offer improved precision. We find that the maximum likelihood estimation protocol approaches the precision comparable to the limit set by the Quantum Fisher Information bound. Finally, using the Hellinger distance method, we directly extract the Fisher information and find that, by exploiting the extremum order statistics, impurities far from the trap center are more sensitive to thermal effects than those close to the trap center.

Title: Nonlinear electron-phonon interactions in Migdal-Eliashberg theory
Authors: Ingvar Zappacosta, Matthew Houtput, Jacques Tempere
Abstract: Superconducting systems based on attractive electron-phonon interactions are the ones which are best understood at a fundamental level. They are well described using Eliashberg theory, which, unlike BCS theory, explicitly takes into account phonon dynamics. It is most often assumed that only linear electron-phonon interactions are relevant. However, for some superconductors like MgB$_2$ or hydride based superconductors, nonlinear electron-phonon interactions are known to contribute significantly, which is not taken into account in conventional Eliashberg theory. We provide a modification to Eliashberg theory by introducing nonlinear electron-phonon interactions. We show that the Eliashberg equations remain unchanged apart from a nonlinear extension of the Eliashberg spectral function. This extended spectral function can be used as a baseline for future ab initio calculations. We use it to construct an analytical toy model and show that the nonlinear electron-phonon coupling affects the superconducting gap function on the imaginary and real axis and causes an increase in the superconducting critical temperature.

Title: Obstacle-Induced Gurzhi Effect and Hydrodynamic Electron Flow in Two-Dimensional Systems
Authors: A. D. Levin, G. M. Gusev, V. A. Chitta, Z. D. Kvon, A. S. Jaroshevich, D. E. Utkin, D. V. Dmitriev, A. K. Bakarov
Abstract: The viscous flow of electrons in a narrow channel requires both strong electron-electron interactions and no-slip boundary conditions. However, introducing obstacles within the liquid can significantly increase flow resistance and, as a result, amplify the effects of viscosity. Even in samples with smooth walls, the presence of an obstacle can strongly alter electron behavior, leading to pronounced hydrodynamic effects. We investigated transport in mesoscopic samples containing a disordered array of obstacles. In contrast to samples without obstacles, which do not show a decrease in resistivity with rising temperature, samples with obstacles exhibit a significant resistivity reduction as temperature increases (the Gurzhi effect). By measuring the negative magnetoresistance, we extracted shear viscosity and other parameters through comparison with theoretical predictions. Consequently, narrow-channel samples with a disordered obstacle array provide a valuable platform for studying hydrodynamic electron flow independently of boundary conditions.

Title: Numerical investigation of the Brownian $q=2$ Potts Model
Authors: Letian Chen, Gunnar Pruessner
Abstract: In active matter, such as the Vicsek Model of flocking, particles possesses an internal degree of freedom, such as their director, which is subject to interaction with other particles, provided they are within a certain range. In an effort to understand better the interplay between spatial and internal degrees of freedom, we study numerically a variation of the $q=2$ Potts Model on and off the lattice, where particles are additionally subject to Brownian motion. The lack of a feedback of the internal degrees of freedom to the spatial degrees of freedom renders this model generically non-equilibrium. We confirm previous work that showed that the static exponents of the phase transition are unaffected by the diffusion. In contrast to previous work, we show that the formation of ordered clusters is not undermined by diffusion, but should rather be thought of as an effective form of interaction. We demonstrate how our numerical findings can be understood on the basis of the well-established Model A, B and C: Off lattice, the Brownian $q=2$ Potts Model is Model C. On the lattice, it is Model A with an additional (irrelevant, conserved) Model B noise.

Title: Currernt Flow Mapping in Conducting Ferroelectric Domain Walls using Scanning NV-Magnetometry
Authors: Conor J. McCluskey, James Dalzell, Amit Kumar, J. Marty Gregg
Abstract: The electrical conductivity of parallel plate capacitors, with ferroelectric lithium niobate as the dielectric layer, can be extensively and progressively modified by the controlled injection of conducting domain walls. Domain wall-based memristor devices hence result. Microstructures, developed as a result of partial switching, are complex and so simple models of equivalent circuits, based on the collective action of all conducting domain wall channels acting identically and in parallel, may not be appropriate. Here, we directly map the current density in ferroelectric domain wall memristors in-situ, by mapping Oersted fields, using nitrogen vacancy centre microscopy. Current density maps were found to directly correlate with the domain microstructure, revealing that a strikingly small fraction of the total domain wall network is responsible for the majority of the current flow. This insight forces a two order of magnitude correction to the carrier densities, previously inferred from standard scanning probe or macroscopic electrical characterisation.

Title: Sign reversal of Berry curvature triple driven by magnetic phase transition in a ferromagnetic polar metal
Authors: Xuyang Sha, Xuejin Zhang, Hao Liu, Jin Cao, Ruohan Chen, Jinfeng Zhai, Dingfu Shao, Shiwei Wu, Cong Xiao, Shengyuan A. Yang, Pan He, Hangwen Guo, Jian Shen
Abstract: Nonlinear Hall effects have been observed in quantum materials where Berry curvature and its momentum-space derivatives, such as the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) and Berry curvature triple (BCT), play a central role. While inversion symmetry breaking is widely recognized as a key criterion, the impact of time-reversal symmetry breaking remains less explored. Here, we report an abrupt enhancement of nonlinear Hall conductivity in non-centrosymmetric SrRuO3 (111) thin films during the paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition. Scaling analysis reveals a sign reversal of the skew scattering contribution upon time-reversal symmetry breaking, which we attribute to the sign reversal of BCT at the Fermi surface. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support this interpretation, showing the spin-polarized band splitting shifts the Fermi level asymmetrically for different spin channels. Our findings establish SrRuO3 (111) thin films as a promising platform for exploring magnetically tunable nonlinear transport effects.

Cha
Abstract: Ongoing demands for smaller and more energy efficient electronic devices necessitate alternative interconnect materials with lower electrical resistivity at reduced dimensions. Despite the emergence of many promising candidates, synthesizing high quality nanostructures remains a major bottleneck in evaluating their performance. Here, we report the successful synthesis of Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires via thermomechanical nanomolding, achieving single crystallinity and controlled diameters as small as 40 nm. Our NbAs nanowires exhibit a remarkably low room-temperature resistivity of 9.7 +/- 1.6 microOhm-cm, which is three to four times lower than their bulk counterpart. Theoretical calculations corroborate the experimental observations, attributing this exceptional resistivity reduction to surface dominant conduction with long carrier lifetime at finite temperatures. Further characterization of NbAs nanowires and bulk single crystals reveals high breakdown current density, robust stability, and superior thermal conductivity. Collectively, these properties highlight the strong potential of NbAs nanowires as next-generation interconnects, which can surpass the limitations of current copper-based interconnects. Technologically, our findings present a practical application of topological materials, while scientifically showcasing the fundamental properties uniquely accessible in nanoscale platforms.

Title: Annihilation-limited Long-range Exciton Transport in High-mobility Conjugated Copolymer Films
Authors: Yuping Shi, Partha Roy, Naoki Higashitarumizue, Tsung-Yen Lee, Quanwei Li, Ali Javeye, Katharina Landfester, Iain McCullochh, Graham Fleming
Abstract: A combination of ultrafast, long-range and low-loss excitation energy transfer from the photo-receptor location to a functionally active site is essential for cost-effective polymeric semiconductors. Delocalized electronic wavefunctions along {\pi}-conjugated polymer backbone can enable efficient intrachain transport, while interchain transport is generally thought slow and lossy due to weak chain-chain interactions. In contrast to the conventional strategy of mitigating structural disorder, amorphous layers of rigid conjugated polymers, exemplified by highly planar poly(indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) (IDT-BT) donor-accepter copolymer, exhibit trap-free transistor performance and charge-carrier mobilities similar to amorphous silicon. Here we report long-range exciton transport in HJ-aggregated IDTBT thin-film, in which the competing exciton transport and exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) dynamics are spectroscopically separated using a phase-cycling-based scheme and shown to depart from the classical iffusion-limited and strong-coupling regime. In the thin film, we find an annihilation-limited mechanism with a per-encounter annihilation probability of much less than 100%, facilitating the minimization of EEA-induced excitation losses. In contrast, excitons on isolated IDTBT chains diffuse over 350 nm with 0.56 cm2 s-1 diffusivity, before eventually annihilating with unit probability on first contact. We complement the pump-probe studies with temperature dependent photocurrent and EEA measurements from 295 K to 77 K and find a remarkable correspondence of annihilation rate and photocurrent activation energies in the 140 K to 295 K temperature range.

Title: Quantum spin liquid ground state in a rare-earth triangular antiferromagnet SmTa$_7$O$_{19}$

Abstract: The rare-earth-based geometrically frustrated triangular magnets have attracted considerable attention due to the intricate interplay between strong spin-orbit coupling and the crystal electric field (CEF), which often leads to effective spin-1/2 degrees of freedom and therefore promotes strong quantum fluctuations at low temperatures, thus offering an excellent route to stabilize a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state. We have investigated the ground state magnetic properties of a polycrystalline sample of $\text{SmTa}_7\text{O}_{19}$ which we propose to have a gapless QSL ground state by employing powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), DC and AC-magnetic susceptibility, $M$ vs. $H$ isotherm, specific heat, and muon spin rotation/relaxation measurements ($\mu$SR) down to 30 mK. The combined structural and electronic studies reveal the formation of an edge-sharing equilateral triangular lattice of Sm$^{3+}$ ions in $ab$ plane. The DC, AC magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements reveal that $\text{SmTa}_7\text{O}_{19}$ does not exhibit any long-range magnetic ordering transition down to 50 mK. The zero-field (ZF)-$\mu$SR study strongly refutes the long-range magnetically ordered ground state and/or any partial spin-freezing down to at least 30 mK. The ZF-muon-spin relaxation rate is weakly temperature dependent between 50 and 20 K, rapidly increases below $\sim$20 K and saturates at low temperatures between 2 K and 30 mK, which has been attributed to a characteristic signature of QSL systems. Further, our longitudinal-field (LF)-$\mu$SR measurements at 0.1 K reveal a dynamic nature of the magnetic ground state. In addition, our high-field specific heat data suggest a gapless nature of spin excitations in this compound.

Title: Spin-strain interactions under hydrostatic pressure in $α$-RuCl$_3$
Authors: A. Hauspurg, Susmita Singh, T. Yanagisawa, V. Tsurkan, J. Wosnitza, Wolfram Brenig, Natalia B. Perkins, S. Zherlitsyn
Abstract: We investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressure on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, a prototypical material for the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice with a possible spin-liquid ground state. Using ultrasound measurements at pressures up to 1.16 GPa, we reveal significant modifications of the acoustic properties and the $H$-$T$ phase diagram of this material. Hydrostatic pressure suppresses the three-dimensional magnetic order and induces a dimerization transition at higher pressures. At low pressures, the sound attenuation exhibits a linear temperature dependence, while above 0.28 GPa, it becomes nearly temperature independent, suggesting a shift in the phonon scattering regime dominated by Majorana fermions. These findings provide new insights into spin-strain interactions in Kitaev magnets and deliver a detailed characterization of the $H$-$T$ phase diagram of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under hydrostatic pressure.

Title: Quench of the electronic order in a strongly-coupled charge-density-wave system by enhanced lattice fluctuations
Authors: Manuel Tuniz, Denny Puntel, Wibke Bronsch, Francesco Sammartino, Gian Marco Pierantozzi, Riccardo Cucini, Fulvio Parmigiani, Federico Cilento
Abstract: Charge-density-wave (CDW) materials having a strong electron-phonon coupling provide a powerful platform for investigating the intricate interplay between lattice fluctuations and a macroscopic quantum order. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES), we reveal that the CDW gap closure in VTe2 is dominated by an incoherent process evolving on a sub-picosecond timescale, challenging the conventional view that the gap dynamics is primarily governed by the excitation of the CDW amplitude modes. Our findings, supported by a three-temperature model, show that the CDW gap evolution can be described by considering the population of a subset of strongly-coupled optical phonon modes, which leads to an increase in the lattice fluctuations. This microscopic framework extends beyond VTe2, offering a universal perspective for understanding the light-induced phase transition in strongly-coupled CDW systems.

Title: Predicting Heteropolymer Phase Separation Using Two-Chain Contact Maps
Authors: Jessica Jin, Wesley Oliver, Michael A. Webb, William M. Jacobs
Abstract: Phase separation in polymer solutions often correlates with single-chain and two-chain properties, such as the single-chain radius of gyration, Rg, and the pairwise second virial coefficient, B22. However, recent studies have shown that these metrics can fail to distinguish phase-separating from non-phase-separating heteropolymers, including intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Here we introduce an approach to predict heteropolymer phase separation from two-chain simulations by analyzing contact maps, which capture how often specific monomers from the two chains are in physical proximity. Whereas B22 summarizes the overall attraction between two chains, contact maps preserve spatial information about their interactions. To compare these metrics, we train phase-separation classifiers for both a minimal heteropolymer model and a chemically specific, residue-level IDP model. Remarkably, simple statistical properties of two-chain contact maps predict phase separation with high accuracy, vastly outperforming classifiers based on Rg and B22 alone. Our results thus establish a transferable and computationally efficient method to uncover key driving forces of IDP phase behavior based on their physical interactions in dilute solution.

Title: QE-CONVERSE: An open-source package for the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution to compute non-perturbatively orbital magnetization from first principles, including NMR chemical shifts and EPR parameters
Authors: Simone Fioccola, Luigi Giacomazzi, Davide Ceresoli, Layla Martin-Samos, Anne Hemerick, Nicolas Richard
Abstract: Orbital magnetization, a key property arising from the orbital motion of electrons, plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic behavior of molecules and solids. Despite its straightforward calculation in finite systems, the computation in periodic systems poses challenges due to the ill-defined position operator and surface current contributions. The modern theory of orbital magnetization, implemented in the Density Functional Theory (DFT) framework, offers an accurate solution via the "converse approach." Here, we introduce QE-CONVERSE, a refactored, modular implementation of this method, replacing outdated routines from Quantum ESPRESSO (version 3.2). QE-CONVERSE integrates modern computational libraries like scaLAPACK and ELPA, enhancing scalability, especially for large supercell calculations. This work focuses on providing the community with a reliable, accurate orbital magnetization package for properties such as Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) g-tensors and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, particularly where perturbative methods fail. We demonstrate QE-CONVERSE's effectiveness with benchmark cases, including the NMR shifts of ${}^{27}$Al in alumina and ${}^{17}$O and ${}^{29}$Si in $\alpha$-quartz, as well as the EPR g-tensor for $_{ }^{n}\Sigma(n\geq 2)$ radicals and nitrogen defects in silicon. Results show excellent agreement with theoretical and experimental data, with improved accuracy in EPR calculations over linear response methods. QE-CONVERSE is fully compatible with recent Quantum ESPRESSO versions, enabling new possibilities for studying complex materials

Title: Integrability and charge transport in asymmetric quantum-circuit geometries
Authors: Chiara Paletta, Urban Duh, Balázs Pozsgay, Lenart Zadnik
Abstract: We revisit the integrability of quantum circuits constructed from two-qubit unitary gates $U$ that satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. A brickwork arrangement of $U$ typically corresponds to an integrable Trotterization of some Hamiltonian dynamics. Here, we consider more general circuit geometries which include circuits without any nontrivial space periodicity. We show that any time-periodic quantum circuit in which $U$ is applied to each pair of neighbouring qubits exactly once per period remains integrable. We further generalize this framework to circuits with time-varying two-qubit gates. The spatial arrangement of gates in the integrable circuits considered herein can break the space-reflection symmetry even when $U$ itself is symmetric. By analyzing the dynamical spin susceptibility on ballistic hydrodynamic scale, we investigate how an asymmetric arrangement of gates affects the spin transport. While it induces nonzero higher odd moments in the dynamical spin susceptibility, the first moment, which corresponds to a drift in the spreading of correlations, remains zero. We explain this within a quasiparticle picture which suggests that a nonzero drift necessitates gates acting on distinct degrees of freedom.

Title: Characterizing $S=3/2$ AKLT Hamiltonian with Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy
Authors: M. Ferri-Cortés, J. C. G. Henriques, J. Fernández-Rossier
Abstract: The AKLT Hamiltonian is a particular instance of a general class of model Hamiltonians defined in lattices with coordination $z$ where each site hosts a spins $S=z/2$, interacting both with linear and non-linear exchange couplings. In two dimensions, the AKLT model features a gap in the spectrum, and its ground state is a valence bond solid state; that is an universal resource for measurement based quantum computing, motivating the quest of physical systems that realize this Hamiltonian. Given a finite-size system described with a specific instance of this general class of models, we address the question of how to asses if such system is a realization of the AKLT model using inelastic tunnel spectroscopy implemented with scanning tunnel microscopy (IETS-STM). We propose two approaches. First, in the case of a dimer, we show how to leverage non-equilibrium IETS-STM to obtain the energies of all excited states, and determine thereby the magnitude of both linear and non-linear exchange interactions. Second, we explore how IETS can probe the in-gap excitations associated to edge spins. In the AKLT limit, spins $S=3/2$ at the edge of the lattice have coordination 2, giving rise to $S=1/2$ dangling spins that can be probed with IETS. We propose a $S=1/2$ effective Hamiltonian to describe the interactions between these dangling spins in the neighborhood of the AKLT point, where their degeneracy lifted.

Title: Capacitive response of biological membranes
Authors: Jafar Farhadi, Joshua B. Fernandes, Karthik Shekhar, Kranthi K. Mandadapu
Abstract: We present a minimal model to analyze the capacitive response of a biological membrane subjected to a step voltage via blocking electrodes. Through a perturbative analysis of the underlying electrolyte transport equations, we show that the leading-order relaxation of the transmembrane potential is governed by a capacitive timescale, ${\tau_{\rm C} =\dfrac{\lambda_{\rm D}L}{D}\left(\dfrac{2+\Gamma\delta^{\rm M}/L}{4+\Gamma\delta^{\rm M}/\lambda_{\rm D}}\right)}$, where $\lambda_{\rm D}$ is the Debye screening length, $L$ is the electrolyte width, $\Gamma$ is the ratio of the dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte to the membrane, $\delta^{\rm M}$ is the membrane thickness, and $D$ is the ionic diffusivity. This timescale is considerably shorter than the traditional RC timescale ${\lambda_{\rm D} L / D}$ for a bare electrolyte due to the membrane's low dielectric permittivity and finite thickness. Beyond the linear regime, however, salt diffusion in the bulk electrolyte drives a secondary, nonlinear relaxation process of the transmembrane potential over a longer timescale ${\tau_{\rm L} =L^2/4\pi^2 D}$. A simple equivalent-circuit model accurately captures the linear behavior, and the perturbation expansion remains applicable across the entire range of observed physiological transmembrane potentials. Together, these findings underscore the importance of the faster capacitive timescale and nonlinear effects on the bulk diffusion timescale in determining transmembrane potential dynamics for a range of biological systems.

Title: Origin and emergent features of many-body dynamical localization
Authors: Ang Yang, Zekai Chen, Yanliang Guo, Manuele Landini, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl, Lei Ying
Abstract: The question of whether interactions can break dynamical localization in quantum kicked rotor systems has been the subject of a long-standing debate. Here, we introduce an extended mapping from the kicked Lieb-Liniger model to an effective lattice model with long-range couplings and reveal two universal features: on-site pseudorandomness and rapidly decaying couplings in the center-of-mass momentum. For finite contact interactions, the long-range coupling between relative momenta obeys an algebraic decay behavior with a crossover of its decay exponent as the interaction increases. Similar behavior occurs in the Fock basis, underscoring the robustness and distinct many-body characteristics of dynamical localization. Analysis of the generalized fractal dimension and level-spacing ratio also supports these findings, highlighting the presence of near integrability and multifractality in different regions of parameter space. Our results offer an explanation for the occurrence of many-body dynamical localization, particularly in strongly correlated quantum gases, and are anticipated to generalize to systems of many particles.

Title: Restoring thermalization in long-range quantum magnets with staggered magnetic fields
Authors: Lucas Winter, Pietro Brighi, Andreas Nunnenkamp
Abstract: Quantum systems with strong long-range interactions are thought to resist thermalization because of their discrete energy spectra. We show that applying a staggered magnetic field to a strong long-range Heisenberg antiferromagnet restores thermalization for a large class of initial states by breaking permutational symmetry. Using self-consistent mean-field theory and exact diagonalization, we reveal that the energy spectrum, while composed of discrete subspaces, collectively forms a dense spectrum. The equilibration time is independent of system size and depends only on the fluctuations in the initial state. For initial states at low to intermediate energies, the long-time average aligns with the microcanonical ensemble. However, for states in the middle of the spectrum the long-time average depends on the initial state due to quantum scar-like eigenstates localized at unstable points in classical phase space. Our results can be readily tested on a range of experimental platforms, including Rydberg atoms or optical cavities.

Title: Evolution of a kink-antikink ensemble in a quantum vacuum
Authors: Mainak Mukhopadhyay, Kohta Murase, Atsushi Naruko, George Zahariade
Abstract: We study the $1+1$ flat spacetime dynamics of a classical field configuration corresponding to an ensemble of sine-Gordon kinks and antikinks, semi-classically coupled to a quantum field. This coupling breaks the integrability of the sine-Gordon model resulting in the background's decay into quantum radiation as kink-antikink pairs annihilate. We find evidence that, on average, the energy of the ensemble scales as $t^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha<1$ and independent of the coupling strength or the mass of the quantum field. The generalization of this result to domain wall networks in higher spacetime dimensions could be relevant to particle production in the early universe.

Title: Generalized toric codes on twisted tori for quantum error correction
Authors: Zijian Liang, Ke Liu, Hao Song, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gröbner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \leq 400$, yielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$, $[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, 22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the $[[360,12,24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.

Title: The Large-Scale Structure of Entanglement in Quantum Many-body Systems
Authors: Lauritz van Luijk, Alexander Stottmeister, Henrik Wilming
Abstract: We show that the thermodynamic limit of a many-body system can reveal entanglement properties that are hard to detect in finite-size systems -- similar to how phase transitions only sharply emerge in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting operational entanglement properties are in one-to-one correspondence with abstract properties of the local observable algebras that emerge in the thermodynamic limit. These properties are insensitive to finite perturbations and hence describe the \emph{large-scale structure of entanglement} of many-body systems. We formulate and discuss the emerging structures and open questions, both for gapped and gapless many-body systems. In particular, we show that every gapped phase of matter, even the trivial one, in $D\geq 2$ dimensions contains models with the strongest possible bipartite large-scale entanglement. Conversely, we conjecture the existence of topological phases of matter, where all representatives have the strongest form of entanglement.

Title: Emergent turbulence and coarsening arrest in active-spinner fluids
Authors: Biswajit Maji, Nadia Bihari Padhan, Rahul Pandit
Abstract: We uncover activity-driven crossover from phase separation to a new turbulent state in a two-dimensional system of counter-rotating spinners. We study the statistical properties of this active-rotor turbulence using the active-rotor Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model, and show that the vorticity $\omega \propto \phi$, the scalar field that distinguishes regions with different rotating states. We explain this intriguing proportionality theoretically, and we characterize power-law energy and concentration spectra, intermittency, and flow-topology statistics. We suggest biological implications of such turbulence.

Title: Mesostructural origins of the anisotropic compressive properties of low-density closed-cell foams: A deeper understanding
Authors: L. Liu, F. Liu, D. Zenkert, M. Åkermo, M. Fagerström
Abstract: Many closed-cell foams exhibit an elongated cell shape in the foam rise direction, resulting in anisotropic compressive properties. Nevertheless, the underlying deformation mechanisms and how cell shape anisotropy induces this mechanical anisotropy are not yet fully understood, in particular for the foams with a high cell face fraction and low relative density. Moreover, the impacts of mesostructural stochastics are often overlooked. This contribution conducts a systematic numerical study on the anisotropic compressive behaviour of low-density closed-cell foams, which accounts for cell shape anisotropy, cell structure and different mesostructural stochastics. Representative volume elements (RVE) of foam mesostructures are modeled, with cell walls described as Reissner-Mindlin shells in a finite rotation setting. A mixed stress-strain driven homogenization scheme is introduced, which allows for enforcing an overall uniaxial stress state. Quantitative analysis of the cell wall deformation behavior confirms the dominant role of membrane deformation in the initial elastic region, while the bending contribution gets important only after foam yielding. Following the identified deformation mechanisms, analytical models are developed that relates mechanical anisotropy to cell shape anisotropy. It is found that cell shape anisotropy translates into the anisotropy of compressive properties through three pathways, cell load-bearing area fraction, cell wall buckling stress and cell wall inclination angle. Besides, the resulting mechanical anisotropy is strongly affected by the cell shape anisotropy stochastics while almost insensitive to the cell size and cell wall thickness stochastics. The present findings provide deeper insights into the relationships between the anisotropic compressive properties and mesostructural features of close-cell foams.

Title: Multilayered Aspects of Casimir Energy
Authors: Kyohei Mukaida, Hideo Iizuka, Kazunori Nakayama
Abstract: We give a robust formulation to calculate the Casimir energy and Casimir force for plane-parallel multilayer setups with general dielectric constants. We derive recursion relations for multilayer reflection and transmission coefficients in the most general setups, which are essential ingredients for evaluating the Casimir energy. With the use of complex analysis techniques involving the argument principle, we carefully treat and subtract UV divergences and make clear the relation between the subtraction procedure and an actual physical setup. We also clarify the physical operational meaning of pole subtraction, which is required to utilize the argument principle in the calculation of the Casimir energy. Our formula is applicable to more general situations including chiral medium or Weyl semimetals.

Title: The mechanics of the squash nick shot
Authors: Mithun Ravisankar, Madeline Federle, Mina Bahadori, Asimanshu Das, Haneesh Kesari, Roberto Zenit
Abstract: Squash is a widely popular racket sport, practiced by millions of people worldwide, played inside a walled court. When played well, players can last for several minutes before the ball bounces twice on the floor. There is, however, an unanswerable shot. When the ball hits the nick between a vertical wall and the floor, under certain conditions, it rolls without any vertical bounce. We study this process experimentally. We determined that the ball must hit the vertical wall first at a narrow range of heights above the floor, but most importantly, it must touch the floor before finishing its rolling time on the vertical wall. When the rolling time is shorter than the contact time, the vertical momentum is canceled due to a mechanical frustration condition. This behavior is explained considering a contact model, which agrees with the experimental observations. We argue that this concept could be relevant to the design of rolling shock dampers with many possible practical applications.

Title: Hierarchical quantum embedding by machine learning for large molecular assemblies
Authors: Moritz Bensberg, Marco Eckhoff, Raphael T. Husistein, Matthew S. Teynor, Valentina Sora, William Bro-Jørgensen, F. Emil Thomasen, Anders Krogh, Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Gemma C. Solomon, Thomas Weymuth, Markus Reiher
Abstract: We present a quantum-in-quantum embedding strategy coupled to machine learning potentials to improve on the accuracy of quantum-classical hybrid models for the description of large molecules. In such hybrid models, relevant structural regions (such as those around reaction centers or pockets for binding of host molecules) can be described by a quantum model that is then embedded into a classical molecular-mechanics environment. However, this quantum region may become so large that only approximate electronic structure models are applicable. To then restore accuracy in the quantum description, we here introduce the concept of quantum cores within the quantum region that are amenable to accurate electronic structure models due to their limited size. Huzinaga-type projection-based embedding, for example, can deliver accurate electronic energies obtained with advanced electronic structure methods. The resulting total electronic energies are then fed into a transfer learning approach that efficiently exploits the higher-accuracy data to improve on a machine learning potential obtained for the original quantum-classical hybrid approach. We explore the potential of this approach in the context of a well-studied protein-ligand complex for which we calculate the free energy of binding using alchemical free energy and non-equilibrium switching simulations.

Title: Machine Learning Enhanced Calculation of Quantum-Classical Binding Free Energies

Abstract: Binding free energies are a key element in understanding and predicting the strength of protein--drug interactions. While classical free energy simulations yield good results for many purely organic ligands, drugs including transition metal atoms often require quantum chemical methods for an accurate description. We propose a general and automated workflow that samples the potential energy surface with hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations and trains a machine learning (ML) potential on the QM energies and forces to enable efficient alchemical free energy simulations. To represent systems including many different chemical elements efficiently and to account for the different description of QM and MM atoms, we propose an extension of element-embracing atom-centered symmetry functions for QM/MM data as an ML descriptor. The ML potential approach takes electrostatic embedding and long-range electrostatics into account. We demonstrate the applicability of the workflow on the well-studied protein--ligand complex of myeloid cell leukemia 1 and the inhibitor 19G and on the anti-cancer drug NKP1339 acting on the glucose-regulated protein 78.

Abstract: We report the successful resolution of the multiplet structure of the K{\alpha}1 x-ray emission in manganese (Mn) complexes through seeded stimulated X-ray emission spectroscopy (seeded S-XES). By employing a femtosecond pump pulse above the Mn K edge to generate simultaneous 1s core-holes, and a second-color tunable seed pulse to initiate the stimulated emission process, we were able to enhance individual lines within the K{\alpha}1 emission. This approach allows to resolve the fine multiplet features that are obscured by the life-time broadening in conventional Mn K{\alpha} XES. The work builds on our previous observation that S-XES from Mn(II) and Mn(VII) complexes pumped at high intensities can exhibit stimulated emission without sacrificing the chemical sensitivity to oxidation states. This technique opens the door to controlled high-resolution electronic structure spectroscopy in transition metal complexes beyond core hole life time broadening with potential applications in catalysis, inorganic chemistry, and materials science.

Title: Thermodynamic approach to quantum cooling limit of continuous Gaussian feedback
Authors: Kousuke Kumasaki, Toshihiro Yada, Ken Funo, Takahiro Sagawa
Abstract: Feedback cooling plays a critical role in stabilizing quantum systems and achieving low temperatures, where a key question is to determine the fundamental thermodynamic limits on cooling performance. We establish a fundamental bound on quantum feedback cooling in Gaussian systems, by deriving a generalized second law of thermodynamics involving the kinetic temperatures of the system and a measure of quantum information flow obtained by continuous measurement. In contrast to previously known bounds, the obtained bound can be saturated by experimentally feasible situations using the quantum Kalman filter with a large feedback gain, where the cooling efficiency approaches its maximum. Our theoretical result is numerically demonstrated using parameters from an experiment of levitated nanoparticles. Our theory provides a general framework for understanding the thermodynamic constraints on quantum feedback cooling.

Title: Quantum interference and occupation control in high harmonic generation from monolayer $WS_2$

Abstract: Two-dimensional hexagonal materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit valley degrees of freedom, offering fascinating potential for valley-based quantum computing and optoelectronics. In nonlinear optics, the K and K' valleys provide excitation resonances that can be used for ultrafast control of excitons, Bloch oscillations, and Floquet physics. Under intense laser fields, however, the role of coherent carrier dynamics away from the K/K' valleys is largely unexplored. In this study, we observe quantum interferences in high harmonic generation from monolayer $WS_2$ as laser fields drive electrons from the valleys across the full Brillouin zone. In the perturbative regime, interband resonances at the valleys enhance high harmonic generation through multi-photon excitations. In the strong-field regime, the high harmonic spectrum is sensitively controlled by light-driven quantum interferences between the interband valley resonances and intraband currents originating from electrons occupying various points in the Brillouin zone, also away from K/K' valleys such as $\Gamma$ and M. Our experimental observations are in strong agreement with quantum simulations, validating their interpretation. This work proposes new routes for harnessing laser-driven quantum interference in two-dimensional hexagonal systems and all-optical techniques to occupy and read-out electronic structures in the full Brillouin zone via strong-field nonlinear optics, advancing quantum technologies.

Title: Twisted heterobilayer photonic crystal based on stacking and selective etching of 2D materials
Authors: Qing Wang, Yuhang Li, Shaofeng Wang, Shuo Cao, Xiulai Xu, Chenjiang Qian
Abstract: Nanophotonic devices with moiré superlattice is currently attracting broad interest due to the unique periodicity and high efficiency control of photons. Till now, experimental investigations mainly focus on the single layer device, i.e., two or more layers of photonic crystal patterns are merged and etched in a single layer of material. By comparison, twisted photonic crystal with multilayer materials raises challenges in the nanofabrication technology, because the growth of upper layer material usually requires a smooth bottom layer without nanostructures. Hereby, we fabricate twisted heterobilayer photonic crystal in the graphite/Si$_3$N$_4$ heterostructure. We use dry transfer method to stack the graphite on top of bottom Si$_3$N$_4$ with pre-etched photonic crystal patterns. Selective dry etching recipes are used to etch two photonic crystal layers individually, which improves the quality and accuracy in alignment. The cavity photonic mode at the visible wavelength $\sim 700$ nm arsing from the moiré site is clearly observed in experiment. These results reveal the experimental diagram of heterobilayer nanophotonic devices and open the way to design flexibility and control of photons in new degrees of freedom.

Title: Magnetic Permeability Time-varying Metamaterials at Microwave Frequencies
Authors: Toshiyuki Kodama, Nobuaki Kikuchi, Takahiro Chiba, Seigo Ohno, Satoshi Okamoto, Satoshi Tomita
Abstract: We demonstrate magnetic permeability time-varying metamaterials at GHz frequencies using ferromagnetic permalloy (Ni80Fe20; Py). We observe frequency up and down conversion of 4 GHz microwaves through the metamaterials, which is caused by the temporal modulation of permeability in the Py layer. Moreover, the efficiency of the up-conversion to a higher frequency is much larger than that of the down conversion to a lower frequency. These experimental results are reproduced well via numerical calculation, verifying that the significant up-conversion efficiency is traced back to nonlinear magnetization dynamics in the metamaterials. The present study opens a door to microwave sources toward the 6th-generation mobile communication system, four-dimensional metamaterials with spatio-temporal modulation, and nonlinear spintronics.

Title: Anyon Theory and Topological Frustration of High-Efficiency Quantum LDPC Codes
Authors: Keyang Chen, Yuanting Liu, Yiming Zhang, Zijian Liang, Yu-An Chen, Ke Liu, Hao Song
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes present a promising route to low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet systematic strategies for their exploration remain underdeveloped. In this work, we establish a topological framework for studying the bivariate-bicycle codes, a prominent class of QLDPC codes tailored for real-world quantum hardware. Our framework enables the investigation of these codes through universal properties of topological orders. Besides providing efficient characterizations for demonstrations using Gröbner bases, we also introduce a novel algebraic-geometric approach based on the Bernstein--Khovanskii--Kushnirenko theorem, allowing us to analytically determine how the topological order varies with the generic choice of bivariate-bicycle codes under toric layouts. Novel phenomena are unveiled, including topological frustration, where ground-state degeneracy on a torus deviates from the total anyon number, and quasi-fractonic mobility, where anyon movement violates energy conservation. We demonstrate their inherent link to symmetry-enriched topological orders and offer an efficient method for searching for finite-size codes. Furthermore, we extend the connection between anyons and logical operators using Koszul complex theory. Our work provides a rigorous theoretical basis for exploring the fault tolerance of QLDPC codes and deepens the interplay among topological order, quantum error correction, and advanced mathematical structures.

Title: Erratum: Photovoltage from ferroelectric domain walls in BiFeO$_3$
Authors: Sabine Körbel, Stefano Sanvito
Abstract: In the original article a mistake in the methodology lead to an incorrect prediction of exciton delocalization below a critical exciton density. This unrealistic delocalized exciton state yielded a sizable domain-wall photovoltage. When done correctly, the simulations yield self-trapped (localized) excitons at all considered exciton densities, without any evidence for a transition to a delocalized exciton. This realistic self-trapped exciton state yields only a negligible domain-wall photovoltage. The original conclusion that ferroelectric domain walls could be responsible for the measured photovoltage if carrier lifetime and diffusion length are higher than expected is incorrect. Correct is: The domain-wall photovoltage in BiFeO3 is much too small to explain the measured photovoltage. The original analysis is meaningful for ferroelectrics without carrier self-trapping, not for BiFeO3.

Title: Persistent motion of a Brownian particle subject to repulsive feedback with time delay
Authors: Robin A. Kopp, Sabine H. L. Klapp
Abstract: Based on analytical and numerical calculations we study the dynamics of an overdamped colloidal particle moving in two dimensions under time-delayed, non-linear feedback control. Specifically, the particle is subject to a force derived from a repulsive Gaussian potential depending on the difference between its instantaneous position, $\mathbf{r}(t)$, and its earlier position $\mathbf{r}(t-\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the delay time. Considering first the deterministic case, we provide analytical results for both, the case of small displacements and the dynamics at long times. In particular, at appropriate values of the feedback parameters, the particle approaches a steady state with a constant, non-zero velocity whose direction is constant as well. In the presence of noise, the direction of motion becomes randomized at long times, but the (numerically obtained) velocity autocorrelation still reveals some persistence of motion. Moreover, the mean-squared displacement (MSD) reveals a mixed regime at intermediate times with contributions of both, ballistic motion and diffusive translational motion, allowing us to extract an estimate for the effective propulsion velocity in presence of noise. We then analyze the data in terms of exact, known results for the MSD of active Brownian particles. The comparison indeed indicates a strong similarity between the dynamics of the particle under repulsive delayed feedback and active motion. This relation carries over to the behavior of the long-time diffusion coefficient $D_\mathrm{eff}$ which, similarly to active motion, is strongly enhanced compared to the free case. Finally we show that, for small delays, $D_\mathrm{eff}$ can be estimated analytically.

Title: Jamming pair of general run-and-tumble particles: Exact results, symmetries and steady-state universality classes
Authors: Leo Hahn, Arnaud Guillin, Manon Michel
Abstract: While run-and-tumble particles are a foundational model for self-propelled particles as bacteria or Janus particles, the analytical derivation of their steady state from the microscopic details is still an open problem. By directly modeling the system at the continuous-space and -time level thanks to piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), we derive the conservation conditions which sets the invariant distribution and, more importantly, explicitly construct the two universality classes for the steady state, the detailed-jamming and the global-jamming classes. They respectively identify with the preservation or not in a detailed manner of a symmetry at the level of the dynamical internal states between probability flows entering and exiting jamming configurations. We call such symmetry active global balance, as it is the true nonequilibrium counterpart of the equilibrium global balance. Thanks to a spectral analysis of the tumble kernel, we give explicit expressions for the invariant measure in the general case. We show that the non-equilibrium features exhibited by the steady state include positive mass for the jammed configurations and, for the global-jamming class, exponential decay and growth terms, potentially modulated by polynomial terms. Interestingly, we find that the invariant measure follows, away from jamming configurations, a catenary-like constraint, which results from the interplay between probability conservation and the dynamical skewness introduced by the jamming interactions, seen now as a boundary constraint. This work shows the powerful analytical approach PDMP provide for the study of the stationary behaviors of RTP systems and motivates their future applications to larger systems, with the goal to derive microscopic conditions for motility-induced phase transitions.

Title: Gapless Fermionic Systems as Phase-space Topological Insulators: Non-perturbative Results from Anomalies
Authors: Taylor L. Hughes, Yuxuan Wang
Abstract: We present a theory unifying the topological responses and anomalies of various gapless fermion systems exhibiting Fermi surfaces, including those with Berry phases, and nodal structures, which applies beyond non-interacting limit. As our key finding, we obtain a general approach to directly relate gapless fermions and topological insulators in phase space, including first- and higher-order insulators. Using this relation we show that the low-energy properties and response theories for gapless fermionic systems can be directly obtained without resorting to microscopic details. Our results provide a unified framework for describing such systems using well-developed theories from the study of topological phases of matter.

Title: Interaction-induced strong zero modes in short quantum dot chains with time-reversal symmetry
Authors: A. Mert Bozkurt, Sebastian Miles, Sebastiaan L.D. ten Haaf, Chun-Xiao Liu, Fabian Hassler, Michael Wimmer
Abstract: We theoretically explore the emergence of strong zero modes in a two-site chain consisting of two quantum dots coupled due to a central dot that mediates electron hopping and singlet superconducting pairing. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry, the on-site Coulomb interaction leads to a three-fold ground-state degeneracy when tuning the system to a sweet spot as a function of the inter-dot couplings. This degeneracy is protected against changes of the dot energies in the same way as "poor man's'' Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains. In the limit of strong interactions, this protection is maximal and the entire spectrum becomes triply degenerate, indicating the emergence of a ''poor man's'' version of a strong zero mode. We explain the degeneracy and protection by constructing corresponding Majorana Kramers-pair operators and $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermion operators. The strong zero modes share many properties of Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains, including the stability of zero-bias peaks in the conductance and the behavior upon coupling to an additional quantum dot. However, they can be distinguished through finite-bias spectroscopy and the exhibit a different behavior when scaling to longer chains.

Title: Distinct charge and spin recovery dynamics in a photo-excited Mott insulator
Authors: Sankha Subhra Bakshi, Pinaki Majumdar
Abstract: Pump-probe response of the spin-orbit coupled Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ reveals a rapid creation of low energy optical weight and suppression of three dimensional magnetic order on laser pumping. Post pump there is a quick reduction of the optical weight but a very slow recovery of the magnetic order - the difference is attributed to weak inter-layer exchange in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ delaying the recovery of three dimensional magnetic order. We demonstrate that the effect has a very different and more fundamental origin. Combining spatio-temporal mean field dynamics and Langevin dynamics on the photoexcited Mott-Hubbard insulator we show that the timescale difference is not a dimensional effect but is intrinsic to charge dynamics versus order reconstruction in a correlated system. In two dimensions itself we obtain a short, almost pump fluence independent, timescale for charge dynamics while recovery time of magnetic order involves domain growth and increases rapidly with fluence. Apart from resolving the iridate Mott problem our approach can be used to analyse phase competition and spatial ordering in superconductors and charge ordered systems out of equilibrium.

Title: Fermion-Vortex Interactions in Axion Electrodynamics
Authors: Saurav Kantha, Amitabha Lahiri
Abstract: A relativistic action for scalar condensate-fermion mixture is considered where both the scalar boson and the fermion fields are coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The dynamics of the gauge field is governed by a linear combination of the Maxwell term, and the Lorentz invariant $\mathbf{E\cdot B}$ term with a constant coefficient $\theta$. We obtain an effective action describing an emergent fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-vortex tube interaction by using the particle-string duality, and find that the $\theta$ term can significantly affect the interaction of fermions and vortices. We also perform a dimensional reduction to show a $\theta$ dependent flux attachment to the itinerant fermions.

Title: Exact finite-size corrections in the dimer model on a cylinder
Authors: Vladimir V. Papoyan
Abstract: The exact finite-size corrections to the free energy $F$ of the dimer model on lattice $\mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{N}$ with cylindrical boundary conditions have been derived for three cases where the lattice is completely covered by dimers: $\mathcal{M} = 2M$, $\mathcal{N} = 2N$; $\mathcal{M} = 2M - 1$, $\mathcal{N} = 2N$; and $\mathcal{M} = 2M$, $\mathcal{N} = 2N - 1$. For these types of cylinders, ratios $r_p(\rho)$ of the $p$th coefficient of $F$ have been calculated for the infinitely long cylinder (${\mathcal M} \rightarrow \infty$) and infinitely long strip (${\mathcal N} \rightarrow \infty$) at varying aspect ratios. As in previous studies of the dimer model on the rectangular lattice with free boundary conditions and for the Ising model with Brascamp-Kunz boundary conditions, the limiting values $p \to \infty$ exhibit abrupt anomalous behaviour of ratios $r_p(\rho)$ at certain values of $\rho$. These critical values of $\rho$ and the limiting values of the finite-size expansion coefficient ratios vary between the different models.

Title: Heat production in a stochastic system with nonlinear time-delayed feedback
Authors: Robin A. Kopp, Sabine H. L. Klapp
Abstract: Using the framework of stochastic thermodynamics we study heat production related to the stochastic motion of a particle driven by repulsive, nonlinear, time-delayed feedback. Recently it has been shown that this type of feedback can lead to persistent motion above a threshold in parameter space [Physical Review E 107, 024611 (2023)]. Here we investigate, numerically and by analytical methods, the rate of heat production in the different regimes around the threshold to persistent motion. We find a nonzero average heat production rate, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$, already below the threshold, indicating the nonequilibrium character of the system even at small feedback. In this regime, we compare to analytical results for a corresponding linearized delayed system and a small-delay approximation which provides a reasonable description of $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ at small repulsion (or delay time). Beyond the threshold, the rate of heat production is much larger and shows a maximum as function of the delay time. In this regime, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ can be approximated by that of a system subject to a constant force stemming from the long-time velocity in the deterministic limit. The distribution of dissipated heat, however, is non-Gaussian, contrary to the constant-force case.

Title: Why gauge invariance applies to statistical mechanics
Authors: Johanna Müller, Florian Sammüller, Matthias Schmidt
Abstract: We give an introductory account of the recently identified gauge invariance of the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical many-body systems [J. Müller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 217101 (2024)]. The gauge transformation is a non-commutative shifting operation on phase space that keeps the differential phase space volume element and hence the Gibbs integration measure conserved. When thermally averaged any observable is an invariant, including thermodynamic and structural quantities. Shifting transformations are canonical in the sense of classical mechanics. They also form an infinite-dimensional group with generators of infinitesimal transformations that build a non-commutative Lie algebra. We lay out the connections with the underlying geometry of coordinate displacement and with Noether's theorem. Spatial localization of the shifting yields differential operators that satisfy commutator relationships, which we describe both in purely configurational and in full phase space setups. Standard operator calculus yields corresponding equilibrium hyperforce correlation sum rules for general observables and order parameters. Using Monte Carlos simulations we demonstrate explicitly the gauge invariance for finite shifting. We argue in favour of using the gauge invariance as a statistical mechanical construction principle for obtaining exact results and for formulating smart sampling algorithms.

Title: Symmetry requirements for current-induced spin magnetization specific to chiral crystals: Multipole analysis and the hidden spin glide symmetry
Authors: Ryosuke Hirakida, Masaki Kato, Masao Ogata
Abstract: Current-induced spin magnetization (CISM) specific to chiral crystals is microscopically analyzed using multipole theory to identify the necessary hopping and spin-orbit couplings (SOCs). Tight-binding models capturing the essence of chiral crystals are introduced to investigate the multipole degrees of freedom possessed by the Hamiltonian. The results reveal that chiral SOC has a multipole degree of freedom specific to chiral crystals. Subsequently, the CISM is evaluated numerically and analytically. The results show that in addition to the chiral SOC, hopping along the $z$-axis, which is irrelevant from a multipole perspective, is crucial for CISM. This hopping is required to break the combined symmetry of wavevector translation and spin flipping, which we refer to as spin glide symmetry. This confirms that hopping irrelevant to chirality can play a crucial role in physical properties arising from chirality without contradicting the framework of multipole theory.

Title: Magnetic-field dependence of spin-phonon relaxation and dephasing due to g-factor fluctuations from first principles
Authors: Joshua Quinton, Mayada Fadel, Junqing Xu, Adela Habib, Mani Chandra, Yuan Ping, Ravishankar Sundararaman
Abstract: The electron spin decay lifetime in materials can be characterized by relaxation (T1) and irreversible (T2) and reversible (T2*) decoherence processes. Their interplay leads to a complex dependence of spin relaxation times on the direction and magnitude of magnetic fields, relevant for spintronics and quantum information applications. Here, we use real-time first-principles density matrix dynamics simulations to directly simulate Hahn echo measurements, disentangle dephasing from decoherence, and predict T1, T2 and T2* spin lifetimes. We show that g-factor fluctuations lead to non-trivial magnetic field dependence of each of these lifetimes in inversion-symmetric crystals of CsPbBr3 and silicon, even when only intrinsic spin-phonon scattering is present. Most importantly, fluctuations in the off-diagonal components of the g-tensor lead to a strong magnetic field dependence of even the T1 lifetime in silicon. Our calculations elucidate the detailed role of anisotropic g-factors in determining the spin dynamics even in simple, low spin-orbit coupling materials such as silicon.

Title: Thermoelectric transport of strained CsK$_2$Sb: The role of electron velocities and scattering within extended Fermi surfaces
Authors: Øven A. Grimenes, G. Jeffrey Snyder, Ole M. Løvvik, Kristian Berland
Abstract: In this first-principles study, we investigated the thermoelectric properties of the full-Heusler compound CsK$_2$Sb at different compressive strains. This material exhibits a valence band structure with significant effective mass anisotropy, forming tube-like energy isosurfaces below the band edge, akin to that of two-dimensional (2D) systems. Such systems can have a large number of high-mobility charge carriers and a beneficial density of states profile. In the calculations, we predicted a maximum p-type figure of merit ($zT$) of 2.6 at 800 K, in line with previous predictions of high $zT$. This high $zT$ arises from the low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.35 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ and the beneficial electronic band structure. The high density of states significantly increased the electron-scattering space, but this effect was largely compensated by reduced scattering rates of electrons with large momentum ${\mathbf{q}}$. We further explored the effect of enhancing the low-dimensionality through compressive strain. This increased the p-type power factor by up to 66 %; partly due to more strongly pronounced 2D features of the valence band, but primarily due to increased Fermi velocities. However, compressive strain also increased phonon velocities and hence the lattice thermal conductivity. The maximum p-type $zT$ thus only increased slightly, to 2.7 at 1 % compressive strain. In the conduction band, strain aligned the $\Gamma$- and X-centered valleys, resulting in the optimal n-type $zT$ increasing from 0.9 to 2.3 at 2 % compressive strain. Thus, highly strained CsK$_2$Sb has the potential for both good p- and n-type thermoelectricity.

Title: Valley polarization dynamics of photoinjected carriers at the band edge in room-temperature silicon studied by terahertz polarimetry
Authors: Ami M. Shirai, Yuta Murotani, Tomohiro Fujimoto, Natsuki Kanda, Jun Yoshinobu, Ryusuke Matsunaga
Abstract: Sixfold-degenerate valleys in Si have attracted considerable attention for valleytronics application. Using optical pump-terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy, we study the dynamics of valley polarization in bulk Si(001) at room temperature. Linearly polarized pump pulses excite electrons and holes with asymmetric distributions in momentum space, leading to in-plane anisotropic conductivity. By varying the polarization directions of the pump light relative to the in-plane crystalline axes, the valley polarization of electrons and the momentum asymmetry of holes are separately probed through observing the polarization rotation of THz pulses. We demonstrate that the valley relaxation time of electrons near the conduction band minimum exceeds 1.5 ps at room temperature, in good agreement with theoretically calculated intervalley phonon scattering with f process. This work paves the way for Si-based room-temperature valleytronics.

Title: Quantum Electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels in a deep-subwavelength hyperbolic phonon polariton cavity
Authors: Gian Marcello Andolina, Matteo Ceccanti, Bianca Turini, Riccardo Riolo, Marco Polini, Marco Schiró, Frank H.L. Koppens
Abstract: The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.

Title: Observation of transverse Thomson effect
Authors: Atsushi Takahagi, Takamasa Hirai, Abdulkareem Alasli, Sang Jun Park, Hosei Nagano, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: The thermoelectric Thomson effect, predicted in the 1850s by William Thomson, produces volumetric heating/cooling in a conductor due to the concerted action of the Seebeck and Peltier effects. Recently, transverse thermoelectrics studies on the Nernst and Ettingshausen effects have progressed rapidly to enable versatile thermal management technologies and to explore topological transport properties. However, a transverse Thomson effect, arising from the concerted action of the Nernst and Ettingshausen effects, has not yet been observed. Here, we report the observation of the transverse Thomson effect in a conductor. We observed volumetric heating/cooling in a semimetallic Bi$_{88}$Sb$_{12}$ alloy induced by a charge current, temperature gradient, and magnetic field applied orthogonally to each other using thermoelectric imaging techniques. We found that the heating/cooling can be switched by the field direction. Our experiments and analyses reveal the essential difference between the conventional and transverse Thomson effects; the former depends sorely on the temperature derivative of the Seebeck coefficient, while the latter depends not only on the temperature derivative of the Nernst coefficient but also on its magnitude. The observation of the transverse Thomson effect fills a missing piece in the history of thermoelectrics and provides a new principle for active thermal management technologies.

Title: First-principles study of surface structure estimation in $L1_0$-FePd(001)/graphene heterojunction
Authors: Ryusuke Endo, Naohiro Matsumoto, Samuel Vergara, Masaki Kobayashi, Hikari Shinya, Hiroshi Naganuma, Tomoya Ono, Mitsuharu Uemoto
Abstract: In this paper, we present a theoretical and computational investigations of the atomic scale structure of the heterointerface formed between the (001) surface of $L1_0$-ordered iron palladium (FePd) alloy and graphene (Gr), namely, $L1_0$-FePd(001)/Gr. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the topmost surface layer consisting of Pd (Pd-terminated surface) becomes more energetically stable than Fe, and Pd-terminated surfaces are not conducive to Gr adsorption. On the other hand, under oxygen atmosphere conditions, our calculation suggests the presence of Fe-terminated surfaces with Gr-covered structures reproducing recent experimental observations. Moreover, the finding of Fe--O bonds formed by oxidizated surface is also consistent with those of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These findings are crucial for understanding the fabrication processes of interfaces in Fe-based $L1_0$ alloy materials.

Title: Realization of discretized response in rare-earth vanadates accessed by AC susceptibility and magnetocaloric methods
Authors: Yuntian Li, Linda Ye, Mark P. Zic, Matthias S. Ikeda, Arkady Shekhter, Ian R. Fisher
Abstract: This report presents a new technique to probe the quantitative dynamical response of the magnetic field induced heating/cooling process in rare-earth vanadium materials. The approach combines AC susceptibility and AC caloric measurements to reveal the intrinsic timescale associated with the magnetic relaxation process of rare-earth ions at low temperatures. Utilizing the well-known crystal field effect in YbVO4, we prove and demonstrate a discretized thermal analysis through a common spin-lattice relaxation phenomenon. The demonstration experiment presented in this study provides a general approach to quantitatively address multiple measured quantities in one unified discretized thermal circuit analysis. It can be extended to study other magnetic, dielectric, and elastic materials exhibiting a complex response to an external driving field in the presence of intrinsic interactions and fluctuations, particularly when an energy dissipation process is within an accessible frequency regime.

Title: Tunable Thermal Conductivity and Mechanical Properties of Metastable Silicon by Phase Engineering
Authors: Yubing Du, Guoshuai Du, Zhixi Zhu, Jiaohui Yan, Jiayin Li, Tiansong Zhang, Lina Yang, Ke Jin, Yabin Chen
Abstract: The extensive applications of cubic silicon in flexible transistors and infrared detectors are much hindered by its intrinsic properties. Metastable silicon phases, such as Si-III, IV and XII prepared using extreme pressure method, provide a unique "genetic bank" with diverse structures and exotic characteristics, however, exploration on their inherent physical properties remains immature. Herein, we demonstrate the phase engineering strategy to modulate the thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of metastable silicon. The thermal conductivity obtained via Raman optothermal approach presents the broad tunability across various Si-I, III, XII and IV phases. The hardness and Young's modulus of Si-IV are remarkably greater than those of Si-III/XII mixture, confirmed by nanoindentation technique. Moreover, it was found that the pressure-induced structural defects can substantially degrade the thermal and mechanical properties of silicon. This systematic investigation can offer feasible route to design novel semiconductors and further advance their desirable applications in advanced nanodevices and mechanical transducers.

Title: Incompatible observables in classical physics: A closer look at measurement in Hamiltonian mechanics
Authors: David Theurel
Abstract: Quantum theory famously entails the existence of incompatible measurements; pairs of observables which cannot be simultaneously measured to arbitrary precision. Incompatibility is widely regarded to be a uniquely quantum phenomenon, linked to failure to commute of quantum operators. Even in the face of deep parallels between quantum commutators and classical Poisson brackets, no connection has been established between the Poisson algebra and any intrinsic limitations to classical measurement. Here I examine measurement in classical Hamiltonian physics as a process involving the joint evolution of an object-system and a finite-temperature measuring apparatus. Instead of the ideal measurement capable of extracting information without disturbing the system, I find a Heisenberg-like precision-disturbance relation: Measuring an observable leaves all Poisson-commuting observables undisturbed but inevitably disturbs all non-Poisson-commuting observables. In this relation the role of h-bar is played by an apparatus-specific quantity, q-bar. While not a universal constant, q-bar takes a finite positive value for any apparatus that can be built. I show that a classical version of Ozawa's model of quantum measurement, originally proposed as a means to violate the Heisenberg relation, does not violate the classical relation. Hence, incompatibility may prove to be a feature not only of quantum, but of classical physics too. This approach points the way to studying the Bayesian epistemology of classical physics, which was until now assumed to be trivial. It now seems possible that it is non-trivial and bears a resemblance to the quantum formalism. These findings may be of interest to researchers working on foundations of quantum mechanics, particularly for psi-epistemic interpretations. And there may be applications in the fields of precision measurement, nanoengineering and molecular machines.

Title: Dicke superradiant enhancement of the heat current in circuit QED
Authors: Gian Marcello Andolina, Paolo Andrea Erdman, Frank Noé, Jukka Pekola, Marco Schirò
Abstract: Collective effects, such as Dicke superradiant emission, can enhance the performance of a quantum device. Here, we study the heat current flowing between a cold and a hot bath through an ensemble of $N$ qubits, which are collectively coupled to the thermal baths. We find a regime where the collective coupling leads to a quadratic scaling of the heat current with $N$ in a finite-size scenario. Conversely, when approaching the thermodynamic limit, we prove that the collective scenario exhibits a parametric enhancement over the non-collective case. We then consider the presence of a third uncontrolled {\it parasitic} bath, interacting locally with each qubit, that models unavoidable couplings to the external environment. Despite having a non-perturbative effect on the steady-state currents, we show that the collective enhancement is robust to such an addition. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of realizing such a Dicke heat valve with superconducting circuits. Our findings indicate that in a minimal realistic experimental setting with two superconducting qubits, the collective advantage offers an enhancement of approximately $10\%$ compared to the non-collective scenario.

Title: Landscapes of integrable long-range spin chains
Authors: Rob Klabbers, Jules Lamers
Abstract: We clarify how the elliptic integrable spin chain recently found by Matushko and Zotov (MZ) relates to various other known long-range spin chains. The limit $q\to1$ gives the elliptic spin chain of Sechin and Zotov (SZ), whose trigonometric case is due to Fukui and Kawakami. At finite size, only the latter is U(1)-symmetric. We compare the resulting (vertex-type) landscape of the MZ chain with the (face-type) landscape containing the Heisenberg XXX and Haldane--Shastry (HS) chains, as well as the Inozemtsev chain and its recent q-deformation. We find that the two landscapes only share a single point: the rational HS chain. Using wrapping we show that the SZ chain is the anti-periodic version of the Inozemtsev chain in a precise sense, and expand both chains around their nearest-neighbour limits to facilitate their interpretations as long-range deformations.

Title: An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Peng Zhang, Jing-Yuan Chen
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by Lüscher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.

Title: Information scrambling and entanglement dynamics in Floquet Time Crystals
Authors: Himanshu Sahu, Fernando Iemini
Abstract: We study the dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and entanglement of entropy as quantitative measures of information propagation in disordered many-body systems exhibiting Floquet time-crystal (FTC) phases. We find that OTOC spreads in the FTC with different characteristic timescales due to the existence of a preferred ``quasi-protected'' direction - denoted as $\ell$-bit direction - along which the spins stabilize their period-doubling magnetization for exponentially long times. While orthogonal to this direction the OTOC thermalizes as an usual MBL time-independent system (at stroboscopic times), along the $\ell$-bit direction the system features a more complex structure. The scrambling appears as a combination of an initially frozen dynamics (while in the stable period doubling magnetization time window) and a later logarithmic slow growth (over its decoherence regime) till full thermalization. Interestingly, in the late time regime, since the wavefront propagation of correlations has already settled through the whole chain, scrambling occurs at the same rate regardless of the distance between the spins, thus resulting in an overall envelope-like structure of all OTOCs, independent of their distance, merging into a single growth. Alongside, the entanglement entropy shows a logarithmic growth over all time, reflecting the slow dynamics up to a thermal volume-law saturation.

Title: Staggered Fermions with Chiral Anomaly Cancellation
Authors: Ling-Xiao Xu
Abstract: We investigate the implications of the quantized vectorial and axial charges in the lattice Hamiltonian of multi-flavor staggered fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions. These lattice charges coincide with those of the $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$ global symmetries of Dirac fermions in the continuum limit, whose perturbative chiral anomaly matches the non-Abelian Onsager algebra on the lattice. In this note, we focus on the lattice models that flow to continuum quantum field theories of Dirac fermions that are free from the perturbative chiral anomaly between $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$. In a lattice model that flows to two Dirac fermions, we identify quadratic Hamiltonian deformations that can gap the system while fully preserving both the vectorial and axial charges on the lattice. These deformations flow to the usual symmetry-preserving Dirac mass terms in the continuum. Additionally, we propose a lattice model that flows to the chiral fermion $3-4-5-0$ model in the continuum by using these lattice charges, and we discuss the multi-fermion interactions that can generate a mass gap in the paradigm of symmetric mass generation.

Title: Geometrical frustration, power law tunneling and non-local gauge fields from scattered light
Authors: Pavel P. Popov, Joana Fraxanet, Luca Barbiero, Maciej Lewenstein
Abstract: Designing the amplitude and range of couplings in quantum systems is a fundamental tool for exploring a large variety of quantum mechanical effects. Here, we consider off-resonant photon scattering processes on a geometrically shaped molecular cloud. Our analysis shows that such a setup is properly modeled by a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian where the range, amplitude and sign of the tunneling processes of the scattered photonic modes can be accurately tuned. Specifically, by varying the molecular distribution, we demonstrate that different configurations characterized by geometrical frustration, long-range power law hopping processes, and non-local gauge fields can be achieved. Our results thus represent a powerful and alternative approach to perform an accurate Hamiltonian engineering of quantum systems with non trivial coupling structures.

Title: The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter
Authors: Romuald A. Janik
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields interacting with the BTZ black hole and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.

Title: Particle Trajectory Prediction in Discrete Element Simulations using a Graph-Based Interaction-Aware Model
Authors: Abhishek Setty, Lukas Morand, Poojitha Ramachandra, Claas Bierwisch
Abstract: This study explores the applicability of a graph-based interaction-aware trajectory prediction model, originally developed for the transportation domain, to forecast particle trajectories in three-dimensional discrete element simulations. The model and our enhancements are validated at two typical particle simulation use cases: (i) particle flow in a representative unit cell with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) in combination with sinusoidal velocity profile and (ii) shear flow in a representative unit cell with Lees-Edwards boundary conditions (LEBCs). For the models to learn the particle behavior subjected to these boundary conditions requires additional data transformation and feature engineering, which we introduce. Furthermore, we introduce and compare two novel training procedures for the adapted prediction model, which we call position-centric training (PCT) and velocity-centric training (VCT). The results show that the models developed for the transportation domain can be adapted to learn the behavior of particles in discrete element simulations.

Title: When Can You Get Away with Low Memory Adam?
Authors: Dayal Singh Kalra, John Kirchenbauer, Maissam Barkeshli, Tom Goldstein
Abstract: Adam is the go-to optimizer for training modern machine learning models, but it requires additional memory to maintain the moving averages of the gradients and their squares. While various low-memory optimizers have been proposed that sometimes match the performance of Adam, their lack of reliability has left Adam as the default choice. In this work, we apply a simple layer-wise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis to quantify when second-moment tensors can be effectively replaced by their means across different dimensions. Our SNR analysis reveals how architecture, training hyperparameters, and dataset properties impact compressibility along Adam's trajectory, naturally leading to $\textit{SlimAdam}$, a memory-efficient Adam variant. $\textit{SlimAdam}$ compresses the second moments along dimensions with high SNR when feasible, and leaves when compression would be detrimental. Through experiments across a diverse set of architectures and training scenarios, we show that $\textit{SlimAdam}$ matches Adam's performance and stability while saving up to $98\%$ of total second moments. Code for $\textit{SlimAdam}$ is available at this https URL.
