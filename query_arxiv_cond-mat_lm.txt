Title: Quench spectroscopy of amplitude modes in a one-dimensional critical phase
Authors: Hyunsoo Ha, David A. Huse, Rhine Samajdar
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of an amplitude (Higgs-like) mode in the gapless phase of the $(1+1)$D XXZ spin chain. Unlike conventional settings where amplitude modes arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking, here, we identify a symmetry-preserving underdamped excitation on top of a Luttinger-liquid ground state. Using nonequilibrium quench spectroscopy, we demonstrate that this mode manifests as oscillations of U(1)-symmetric observables following a sudden quench. By combining numerical simulations with Bethe-ansatz analyses, we trace its microscopic origin to specific families of string excitations. We further discuss experimental pathways to detect this mode in easy-plane quantum magnets and programmable quantum simulators. Our results showcase the utility of quantum quenches as a powerful tool to probe collective excitations, beyond the scope of linear response.

Title: Hidden localization transitions in generalized Aubry-André models
Authors: Pasquale Marra
Abstract: Anderson localization is a phase transition between a metallic phase, where wavefunctions are extended and delocalized in space, and an insulating phase, where wavefunctions are completely localized. These transitions are driven by uncorrelated disorder or quasiperiodic disorder, e.g., in the case of the Aubry-André model. Here, I consider a family of Hamiltonians that generalizes the Aubry-André model obtained when position and momentum operators are replaced by an arbitrary couple of canonically conjugate operators. In these models, a hidden localization transition occurs between metallic/insulating phases with wavefunctions delocalized/localized with respect to one of the two canonically conjugate operators. If the canonically conjugate operators coincide with a linear combination of position and momentum, the phase transition is signaled by a zero in the normalized participation ratio in the usual position space. Surprisingly, I found that at the phase transition, this model Hamiltonian coincides with the lattice Hamiltonian of a massless Dirac fermion in a curved spacetime background, indicating an unexpected relation between many-body localization and analog gravity.

Title: When does a lattice higher-form symmetry flow to a topological higher-form symmetry at low energies?
Authors: Ruizhi Liu, Pok Man Tam, Ho Tat Lam, Liujun Zou
Abstract: We study the lattice version of higher-form symmetries on tensor-product Hilbert spaces. Interestingly, at low energies, these symmetries may not flow to the topological higher-form symmetries familiar from relativistic quantum field theories, but instead to non-topological higher-form symmetries. We present concrete lattice models exhibiting this phenomenon. One particular model is an $\mathbb{R}$ generalization of the Kitaev honeycomb model featuring an $\mathbb{R}$ lattice 1-form symmetry. We show that its low-energy effective field theory is a gapless, non-relativistic theory with a non-topological $\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry. In both the lattice model and the effective field theory, we demonstrate that the non-topological $\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry is not robust against local perturbations. In contrast, we also study various modifications of the toric code and their low-energy effective field theories to demonstrate that the compact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice 1-form symmetry does become topological at low energies unless the Hamiltonian is fine-tuned. Along the way, we clarify the rules for constructing low-energy effective field theories in the presence of multiple superselection sectors. Finally, we argue on general grounds that non-compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ 1-form symmetries) in lattice systems generically remain non-topological at low energies, whereas compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and $U(1)$ 1-form symmetries) generically become topological.

Title: Protection of Unconventional Superconductivity from Disorder
Authors: Sofie Castro Holbæk, Morten H. Christensen, Andreas Kreisel, Brian M. Andersen
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity is a desirable state of matter due to its potential for high transition temperatures $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and associated favorable superconducting properties. However, the sign-changing nature of the order parameter of unconventional superconductors renders their condensates fragile to disorder, an inevitability in real materials. We uncover the generic properties of electronic band structures and associated Bloch weights able to support robust unconventional superconductivity. We demonstrate this property in several case studies of the kagome and Lieb lattices, showing how unconventional superconductors exhibit unusually weak $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ suppression by disorder, despite featuring fully compensated sign-changing order parameters. We contrast these results with those for unconventional superconductivity on the square and honeycomb lattices, which are unable to protect the condensates from disorder. Finally, we discuss material candidates for which this effect may be realized.

Title: Self-dual Higgs transitions: Toric code and beyond
Authors: Wenjie Ji, Ryan A. Lanzetta, Zheng Zhou, Chong Wang
Abstract: The toric code, when deformed in a way that preserves the self-duality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry exchanging the electric and magnetic excitations, admits a transition to a topologically trivial state that spontaneously breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Numerically, this transition was found to be continuous, which makes it particularly enigmatic given the longstanding absence of a continuum field-theoretic description. In this work we propose such a continuum field theory for the transition dubbed the $SO(4)_{2,-2}$ Chern-Simons-Higgs (CSH) theory. We show that our field theory provides a natural "mean-field" understanding of the phase diagram. Moreover, it can be generalized to an entire series of theories, namely the $SO(4)_{k,-k}$ CSH theories, labeled by an integer $k$. For each $k>2$, the theory describes an analogous transition involving different non-Abelian topological orders, such as the double Fibonacci order ($k=3$) and the $S_3$ quantum double ($k=4$). For $k=1$, we conjecture that the corresponding CSH transition is in fact infrared-dual to the $3d$ Ising transition, in close analogy with the particle-vortex duality of a complex scalar.

Title: Spin angular momentum transfer in the Einstein-de Haas effect
Authors: Xin Nie, Wenhao Luo, Kun Cao, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: We investigate spin angular momentum transfer in the Einstein-de Haas effect within prototypical magnetic crystals, focusing on its partition between phonons and rigid-body rotation. Using the Eckart frame to decouple local vibrations (phonons) from rigid-body rotation, we demonstrate that spin angular momentum is simultaneously transferred into both phonons and rigid-body rotation in an asymmetric way: rigid-body rotation acquires the dominant share of angular momentum, while phonons absorb most of the resulting kinetic energy. This divergent transfer of angular momentum and energy identifies phonons as direct and indispensable participants in the Einstein-de Haas dynamics. Furthermore, we find that pseudo-dipolar anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction exert distinct control over the angular momentum transfer. Stronger pseudo-dipolar anisotropy increases the total amount of transferred angular momentum, whereas stronger Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction accelerates the transfer rate and increases the proportion of phonon angular momentum. Our work clarifies the microscopic picture of the Einstein-de Haas effect and enables targeted angular-momentum control in magneto-mechanical devices.

Title: Topological Acoustic Diode
Authors: Ashwat Jain, Wojciech J. Jankowski, M. Mehraeen, Robert-Jan Slager
Abstract: We show that certain three-dimensional topological phases can act as acoustic diodes realizing nonlinear odd acoustoelastic effects. Beyond uncovering topologically-induced anomalous acoustic second-harmonic generation and rectification, we demonstrate how such nonlinear responses are uniquely captured by the momentum-space nonmetricity tensor in the quantum state Hilbert-space geometry. In addition to completing the classification of quantum geometric observables in the quadratic response regime, our findings reveal unexplored avenues for experimental realizations of acoustic diodes using effective $\theta$ vacua of axion insulators adaptable for topological engineering applications.

Title: Spin-orbit-induced Instability and Finite-Temperature Stabilization of a Triangular-lattice Supersolid
Authors: Seongjun Park, Sung-Min Park, Yun-Tak Oh, Hyun-Yong Lee, Eun-Gook Moon
Abstract: Geometrically frustrated triangular-lattice magnets provide fertile ground for realizing intriguing quantum phases such as spin supersolids. A common expectation is that spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which breaks continuous spin rotational symmetry, destabilizes these phases by gapping their low-energy modes. Revisiting this assumption, we map out the SOC-field phase diagram of a frustrated triangular-lattice magnet using spin-wave theory and infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations. We find that while infinitesimally weak SOC indeed drives a zero-temperature instability of the supersolid by opening a gap, certain supersolid states remain thermodynamically stable at non-zero temperatures. This reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism in which thermal fluctuations counteract SOC to stabilize supersolidity. The resulting finite-temperature supersolids retain key responses, including a giant magnetocaloric effect, highlighting their potential relevance to real materials. At larger SOC, the system transitions into distinct magnetic orders, including a skyrmion lattice, completing a unified phase diagram.

Title: Competing Ordering Modes in the Distorted Quantum Kagome Material Clinoatacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$
Authors: L. Stödter, C. Kastner, H. O. Jeschke, M. Reehuis, K. Beauvois, B. Ouladdiaf, E. Chan, F. Yokaichiya, F. Bert, T. J. Hicken, J. A. Krieger, H. Luetkens, J. L. Allen, R. Feyerherm, M. Tovar, D. Menzel, A. U. B. Wolter, B. Büchner, K. C. Rule, F. J. Litterst, U. K. Rößler, S. Süllow
Abstract: We have studied the magnetic properties of clinoatacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$, the parent compound of the quantum spin liquid candidate herbertsmithite and a longstanding puzzle among frustrated quantum magnets. As we reveal using density-functional theory, clinoatacamite belongs to the class of distorted kagome antiferromagnets with the kagome plane being embedded into a low-symmetry crystal structure. By means of thermodynamic measurements, muon spin rotation/relaxation as well as neutron diffraction on single crystals, we find a complex sequence of phases/regions below 18.1 K in zero magnetic field. We propose this complexity in multicritical clinoatacamite to arise from the competition of antiferromagnetic ordering modes from the underconstrained manifold of modes, which can lead to a metamagnetic texture in zero magnetic field.

Title: Ultrafast Decoherence of Charge Density Waves in K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$

Winkler, Larissa Boie, Yunpei Deng, Matteo Savoini, Serhane Zerdane, Abhishek Nag, Sabina Gurung, Davide Soranzio, Tim Suter, Vladimir Ovuka, Janine Zemp, Elsa Abreu, Simone Biasco, Roman Mankowsky, Edwin J. Divall, Alexander R. Oggenfuss, Mathias Sander, Christopher Arrell, Danylo Babich, Henrik T. Lemke, Urs Staub, Jure Demsar, Steven L. Johnson
Abstract: Recent works have suggested that transient suppression of a charge density wave (CDW) by an ultra-short excitation can lead to an inversion of the CDW phase. We experimentally investigate the dynamics of the CDW in K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$ by time resolved x-ray diffraction after excitation with optical pulses. Our results indicate a transient inversion of the CDW phase close to the surface that evolves into a highly disordered state in less than one picosecond. Numerical simulations solving the Ginzburg-Landau equation including disorder from strong pinning defects reproduce our main observations. Our findings highlight the critical role of disorder in schemes for coherent control in condensed matter systems.

Title: Towards the discovery of high critical magnetic field superconductors
Authors: Benjamin Geisler, Philip M. Dee, James J. Hamlin, Gregory R. Stewart, Richard G. Hennig, P.J. Hirschfeld
Abstract: Superconducting materials are of significant technological relevance for a broad range of applications, and intense research efforts aim at enhancing the critical temperature $T_{c}$. Intriguingly, while numerous studies have explored different computational and machine-learning routes to predict $T_{c}$, the fundamental role of the critical magnetic field has so far been overlooked. Here we open a new frontier in superconductor discovery by presenting a consistent computational database of critical fields $H_{c}$, $H_{c1}$, and $H_{c2}$ for over 7300 electron-phonon-paired superconductors covering distinct materials classes. A theoretical framework is developed that combines $\alpha^2F(\omega)$ spectral functions and highly accurate Fermi surfaces from density functional theory with clean-limit Eliashberg theory to obtain the coherence lengths, London penetration depths, and Ginzburg-Landau parameters. We discover an unexpectedly large number of Type-I superconductors and show that larger unit cells generically support higher critical fields and Type-II behavior. We identify the importance of going beyond BCS theory by including strong-coupling corrections to the superconducting gap and electron-phonon renormalizations of the effective mass for predictions of critical fields across materials. These results provide a framework for foundational AI models that realize the concept of inverse materials design for high-$T_{c}$ and high-critical-field superconductors.

Title: Classification of non-Fermi liquids and universal superconducting fluctuations
Authors: Shubham Kukreja, Dawson M. Willerton, Sung-Sik Lee
Abstract: In quantum critical metals, a plethora of different non-Fermi liquids arises depending on the nature of critical fluctuations coupled to Fermi surfaces. In this paper, we classify non-Fermi liquids that arise from q=0 critical fluctuations and characterize their universal superconducting fluctuations. The essential tool is the projective fixed points, which generalizes the notion of fixed points to fixed trajectories that take into account the incessant running of the Fermi momentum under the renormalization group flow. Based on the topology of bundles of projective fixed points, non-Fermi liquids are first grouped into seven superuniversality classes. Each superuniversality class includes multiple universality classes, which are further classified by the universal pairing interactions and emergent symmetries. Despite the pairing interaction generated by critical fluctuations, some non-Fermi liquids remain stable down to zero temperature due to the incoherence of excitations and the lack of scale invariance caused by Fermi momentum. Depending on the strength and span of the universal pairing interaction in momentum space, the emergent symmetry of non-Fermi liquids may or may not be lower than that of Fermi liquids. In non-Fermi liquids that become superconductors at low temperatures, the universal data of the parent metal determine the lower bound for the superconducting transition temperature and the associated pairing symmetry. In superuniversality classes that contain non-Fermi liquids prone to non-s-wave superconducting instabilities, the critical angular momentum above which pairing instability becomes inevitable is sensitive to the Fermi momentum, and the associated superconducting transition temperature oscillates as a function of the density. We use physical examples, as well as a toy model, to elucidate the universal low-energy physics of all superuniversality classes.

Title: Field-Induced Ferroelectric Phase Transition Dynamics in PMN-PT compositions near the Morphotropic Phase Boundary
Authors: Shivjeet Chanan, Joseph Kerchenfaut, Eduard Illin, Eugene V. Colla
Abstract: The dynamical behavior of field-induced ferroelectric phase transitions in compositions of PbMg_{1/3}Nb_{2/3}O3(1-x)-PbTiO3(x), called PMN-PT, near the Morphotropic Phase Boundary (MPB) was investigated through several different external electrical field application protocols. Our results indicate that the phase transitions in PMN-PT compositions near the MPB behave differently than in compositions far below the MPB. We show that the electrical-field history has a notable impact on the field-induced transition temperature T_c, ZFC delay time tau_{ZFC}, and induced polarization P_c, gained/lost during field-induced phase transition. Moreover, we demonstrate that under certain field-temperature conditions PMN-PT can retain its electrical field history and use it to kinetically accelerate its ferroelectric ordering. An explanation for the key difference between the phase transition dynamics in compositions near and far from the MPB is proposed and contextualized within prior publications.

Title: Rocket-like dynamics of ferrimagnetic domain walls in graded materials
Authors: P. Diona, S. Artyukhin, L. Maranzana
Abstract: Domain wall motion underpins emerging spintronic technologies, such as high-speed racetrack devices and THz logic. Spatially non-uniform magnetic exchange and anisotropy in ferromagnets can pin or accelerate domain walls. In ferrimagnets, where Walker breakdown is suppressed, walls can approach the magnon speed. Here, we show that in non-uniform ferrimagnets such gradients not only exert a net force on the wall, but also modify its effective mass, enabling an entirely new acceleration mechanism. As a wall traverses regions of varying exchange or anisotropy, it can shed or gain mass leading to a "rocket effect" as in variable-mass systems. This phenomenon becomes increasingly pronounced as the wall approaches the magnon velocity, providing a natural route to ultrafast domain wall propulsion. The findings establish variable-mass domain walls as a new paradigm for efficient, high-velocity spintronics and THz-frequency magnetic technologies.

Title: Accelerated Inorganic Electrides Discovery by Generative Models and Hierarchical Screening
Authors: Shuo Tao, Qiang Zhu
Abstract: Electrides are exotic compounds in which excess electrons occupy interstitial regions of the crystal lattice and serve as anions, exhibiting exceptional properties such as low work function, high electron mobility, and strong catalytic activity. Although they show promise for diverse applications, identifying new electrides remains challenging due to the difficulty of achieving energetically favorable electron localization in crystal cavities. Here, we present an accelerated materials discovery framework that combines physical principles, diffusion-based materials generation with hierarchical thermodynamic and electronic structure screening. Using this workflow, we systematically explored 1,510 binary and 6,654 ternary chemical compositions containing excess valence electrons from electropositive alkaline, alkaline-earth, and early transition metals, and then filtered them with a high throughput validation on both thermodynamical stability and electronic structure analysis. As a result, we have identified 264 new electron rich compounds within 0.05 eV/atom above the convex hull at the density functional theory (DFT) level, including 13 thermodynamically stable electrides. Our approach demonstrates a generalizable strategy for targeted materials discovery in a vast chemical space.

Title: Influence of Markovianity and self-consistency on time-resolved spectral functions of driven quantum systems
Authors: Thomas Blommel, M. Rey Lambert, Michael A. Kurniawan, Annabelle Canestraight, Vojtech Vlcek
Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of the real-time Dyson expansion (RTDE) with established non-equilibrium Green's function approaches for simulating driven, interacting quantum systems. Focusing on density matrix dynamics, time-off-diagonal Green's functions, and time-resolved photoemission spectra, we benchmark RTDE against fully self-consistent Kadanoff-Baym equation (KBE) calculations, the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA), and exact diagonalization for small systems using second order many-body perturbation theory. Using a driven two-band Hubbard model, we show that mean-field single particle density matrix trajectories provide a reliable baseline for RTDE across a broad range of interaction strengths and excited-carrier populations. Further, RTDE accurately captures correlation effects in the Green's functions, including long-lived oscillations and revivals that are strongly suppressed by the overdamping inherent to self-consistent KBE schemes. As a consequence, RTDE resolves rich non-equilibrium spectral structure in time-resolved photoemission, such as interaction- and population-dependent quasiparticle splittings and bandgap renormalization, which are largely washed out in self-consistent approaches, yet are present in the exact solutions. Our results demonstrate that RTDE bridges the gap between mean-field propagation and full two-time KBE simulations, retaining favorable linear scaling while capturing essential dynamical correlations relevant for ultrafast spectroscopy.

Title: Extraction of a structural short-range order descriptor from nanobeam electron diffraction patterns using a transfer learning approach
Authors: Junjie Wu, Timothy J. Rupert
Abstract: Amorphous solids exhibit structural short-range order despite lacking long-range crystalline order, with this structural descriptor found to be important for determining mechanical properties. Nanobeam electron diffraction offers a potential route for experimental characterization of structural short-range order, yet efforts to date have been primarily qualitative in nature. In this work, machine learning approaches based on transfer learning are used to enable quantitative analysis of nanobeam electron diffraction data from amorphous solids. A ResNet-18 model is trained on virtual diffraction patterns taken from different locations within simulated metallic glasses and amorphous grain boundary complexions in the Cu-Zr alloy system that were created with hybrid molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The disorder parameter is found to be a superior target structural descriptor compared to traditional Voronoi indices for this task. The model achieves a low validation mean absolute error across diffraction patterns corresponding to different interaction volumes, demonstrating excellent performance and potential transferability. Testing was performed using other simulated nanobeam electron diffraction data as well as experimental nanobeam electron diffraction patterns, showing that the model can reliably capture spatial variations in local structural state. As a whole, this framework is able to overcome the challenges in the quantitative experimental characterization of structural short-range order, enabling improved characterization of amorphous solids and the exploration of structure-property relationships.

Title: Interacting type-II semi-Dirac quasiparticles
Authors: Mohamed M. Elsayed, Taras I. Lakoba, Valeri N. Kotov
Abstract: Type-II semi-Dirac fermions in two dimensions have been proposed to describe topologically nontrivial low energy excitations in titanium/vanadium oxide heterostructures. These quasiparticles appear at the merger of three Dirac cones, resulting in a non-zero Berry phase. We find, by employing Hartree-Fock, renormalization group and RPA techniques, that the spectrum is very sensitive to long-range electron-electron interactions and can undergo a profound transformation. Specifically the quasiparticle spectrum evolves, driven by interactions, from anisotropic Dirac dispersion at the lowest energies, towards the characteristic type-II semi-Dirac boomerang shape as the energy increases. The corresponding density of states varies between linear and power one third ($\rho(\varepsilon) \sim |\varepsilon| \rightarrow |\varepsilon|^{1/3}$). The crossover scale is controlled by the interaction strength $\alpha = e^2/(\hbar v)$, and the specifics of the effective interacting Hamiltonian. Our results imply that various physical characteristics exhibit critical behavior with continuously varying 'critical exponents'; for example Landau levels in a magnetic field vary with the energy scale: $|\varepsilon_n(B)|\sim (nB)^{1/2} \rightarrow (nB)^{3/4}, n=0,1,2,...$, and similarly for other observables.

Title: The First Switch Effect in Ferroelectric Field-Effect Transistors
Authors: Priyankka Ravikumar, Prasanna Venkatesan, Chinsung Park, Nashrah Afroze, Mengkun Tian, Winston Chern, Suman Datta, Shimeng Yu, Souvik Mahapatra, Asif Khan
Abstract: In this work, a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FEFET) is systematically characterized and compared with an equivalent standard MOSFET with an equivalent oxide thickness. We show that these two devices, with a silicon channel, exhibit similar pristine state transfer characteristics but starkly different endurance characteristics. In contrast to the MOSFET, the FEFET shows a significant increase in sub-threshold swing in the first write pulse. Based on this, we reveal that this first write pulse (cycle 1) generates more than half of the total traps generated during the fatigue cycling in FEFETs. We call this the 'First Switch Effect'. Further, by polarizing a pristine FEFET step by step, we demonstrate a direct correlation between the switched polarization and interface trap density during the first switch. Through charge pumping measurements, we also observe that continued cycling generates traps more towards the bulk of the stack, away from the Si/SiO2 interface in FEFETs. We establish that: (1) the first switch effect leads to approximately 50% of the total trap density (Nit) near the Si/SiO2 interface until memory window closure; and (2) further bipolar cycling leads to trap generation both at and away from Si/SiO2 interface in FEFETs.

Title: A matter-wave Fabry-Pérot cavity in the ultrastrong driving regime
Authors: Jeremy L. Tanlimco, Eber Nolasco-Martinez, Xiao Chai, S. Nicole Halawani, Eric Zhu, Ivar Martin, David M. Weld
Abstract: When the length of an optical cavity is modulated, theory predicts exponential concentration of energy around particular space-time trajectories. Viewed stroboscopically, photons in such a driven cavity propagate as if in a curved spacetime, with black hole and white hole event horizons corresponding to unstable and stable fixed points of the evolution. Such phenomena have resisted direct experimental realization due to the difficulty of relativistically accelerating massive cavity mirrors. We report results of an experiment which overcomes this limitation by exchanging the roles of light and matter. A matter wave endowed with quasi-relativistic dispersion is confined between two barriers made of light, one of which is periodically translated at speeds comparable to the matter wave group velocity. In this strongly-modulated cavity we observe the emergence of the predicted bright and dark fixed point trajectories, and demonstrate that changing the modulation waveform can vary the number of fixed points and exchange their stability character. We observe signatures of nontrivial dynamics beyond those predicted for photons, and attribute them to residual curvature in the dispersion relation. In addition to experimentally realizing and characterizing cavity dynamics in the ultra-strong driving regime, these results point the way to implementations of related dynamics in electro-optic materials, with potential applications in pulse generation and signal compression.

Title: Continuum mechanics of entanglement in noisy interacting fermion chains
Authors: Tobias Swann, Adam Nahum
Abstract: We develop an effective continuum description for information scrambling in a chain of randomly interacting Majorana fermions. The approach is based on the semiclassical treatment of the path integral for an effective spin chain that describes "two-replica" observables such as the entanglement purity and the OTOC. This formalism gives exact results for the entanglement membrane and for operator spreading in the limit of weak interactions. In this limit there is a large crossover lengthscale between free and interacting behavior, and this large lengthscale allows for a continuum limit and a controlled saddle-point calculation. The formalism is also somewhat different from that known from random unitary circuits. The entanglement membrane emerges as a kind of bound state of two travelling waves, and shows an interesting unbinding phenomenon as the velocity of the entanglement membrane approaches the butterfly velocity.

Title: Generating persistent-current superpositions in Bose-Einstein condensates using dynamic optical potentials
Authors: Renzo Testa, Donatella Cassettari
Abstract: Precise and flexible manipulation of the motional state of ultracold atoms is a fundamental enabling technology for diverse applications such as quantum sensing and quantum computation. In this paper we propose a general, simple and highly efficient method to engineer the motional state of a Bose-Einstein condensate with time-dependent optical fields, which can be realized experimentally with existing light sculpting techniques. We demonstrate numerically how to engineer superpositions of persistent currents in a toroidal trap, achieving very high fidelity. We also study in detail the stability of the state over time, and we present an analytical two-state model that approximates well the evolution of the state in presence of self-interactions.

Title: Tunneling probe-based identification of the sp${}^3$ dangling bond on the H-C(100):$2\times1$ surface
Authors: Lachlan Oberg, Yi-Ying Sung, Cedric Weber, Marcus W. Doherty, Christopher I. Pakes
Abstract: The sp${}^3$ dangling bond on the diamond surface plays a critical role in the performance and fabrication of diamond quantum technologies. For the former, the magnetic and electric properties of this defect can impede the performance of quantum sensors and computers. For the latter, the chemical properties of the dangling bond are integral to proposed methods for bottom-up fabrication of scalable diamond quantum devices. In pursuit of high performance and scalable diamond quantum technology, tunneling probe-based techniques offers the ability to create and modify the sp${}^3$ dangling bond with atomic-scale precision. However, these capabilities cannot be realised either deterministically or at scale without a means for identifying the sp${}^3$ dangling bond amidst the myriad of other defects on the diamond surface. Consequently, in this work we provide a comprehensive experimental and theoretical framework for STS-based characterisation of the sp${}^3$ defect on the H-terminated (100) diamond surface. This capability provides the foundation for future tunneling probe studies in the modification of dangling bonds.

Title: Magnonic Quantum Spin Hall Effect with Chiral Magnon Transport in Bilayer Altermagnets
Authors: Bo Yuan, Yingxi Bai, Ying Dai, Baibiao Huang, Chengwang Niu
Abstract: Altermagnetism has attracted considerable interest, yet its associated spintronic phenomena have so far been largely confined to electronic systems. In this work, we uncover a universal symmetry-based strategy for realizing topological altermagnets with the magnonic quantum spin Hall effect, as evidenced by a nonzero spin Chern number and protected helical edge states. Moreover, we demonstrate that chiral magnon splitting in altermagnets gives rise to an intrinsically anisotropic, momentum-resolved thermal Hall response, sharply contrasting with those in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, thus offering enhanced flexibility for selective manipulation. As a concrete material realization, first-principles calculations and Heisenberg-DM model analysis reveal that V$_2$WS$_4$ bilayer exhibits $d$-wave altermagnetism, integer spin Chern number with helical magnon edge states, and the nonzero momentum-locked thermal Hall conductivity. Our results establish a direct link between topological magnons and altermagnetism, opening new avenues for dissipationless magnonic devices.

Title: Imperfect Turing Patterns: Diffusiophoretic Assembly of Hard Spheres via Reaction-Diffusion Instabilities
Authors: Siamak Mirfendereski, Ankur Gupta
Abstract: Turing patterns are stationary, wave-like structures that emerge from the nonequilibrium assembly of reactive and diffusive components. While they are foundational in biophysics, their classical formulation relies on a single characteristic length scale that balances reaction and diffusion, making them overly simplistic for describing biological patterns, which often exhibit multi-scale structures, grain-like textures, and inherent imperfections. Here, we integrate diffusiophoretically-assisted assembly of finite-sized cells, driven by a background chemical gradient in a Turing pattern, while also incorporating intercellular interactions. This framework introduces key control parameters, such as the Péclet number, cell size distribution, and intercellular interactions, enabling us to reproduce strikingly similar structural features observed in natural patterns. We report imperfections, including spatial variations in pattern thickness, packing limits, and pattern breakups. Our model not only deepens our understanding but also opens a new line of inquiry into imperfect Turing patterns that deviate from the classical formulation in significant ways.

Title: One-Dimensional Electronic States in a Moiré Superlattice of Twisted Bilayer WTe2

Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) moiré superlattices provide a new route to engineering reduced-dimensional electronic states in van der Waals materials, yet their electronic structure and microscopic origin remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a 1D moiré superlattice formed in twisted bilayer 1T$'$-WTe$_2$ using density functional theory calculations, complemented by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. We show that lattice relaxation strongly reconstructs the moiré stripes, leading to stacking-dependent stripe widths that are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The relaxed structure hosts quasi-one-dimensional electronic bands near the Fermi level, characterized by strong dispersion along the stripe direction and nearly flat dispersion in the perpendicular direction. By comparing the full bilayer with isolated relaxed layers, we establish that these 1D electronic states are governed predominantly by an intralayer moiré potential induced by in-plane lattice relaxation, rather than by interlayer hybridization. We extract this position-dependent moiré potential directly from DFT calculations and construct an effective tight-binding model that reproduces both the band dispersion and the real-space localization of the electronic wave functions. Our results identify lattice relaxation as the key mechanism underlying 1D electronic states in 1D moiré superlattices. %and establish twisted bilayer WTe$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring emergent one-dimensional moiré physics. The framework developed here provides a unified theoretical basis for realizing and exploring one-dimensional moiré physics in a broad class of anisotropic two-dimensional materials.

Title: Model-free Analysis of Scattering and Imaging Data with Escort-Weighted Shannon Entropy and Divergence Matrices
Authors: Jared Coles, Arthur R. C. McCray, Yue Li, Bryan T. Fichera, Yan Wu, Yiqing Hao, Daniel Phelan, Yue Cao, Raymond Osborn, C. Phatak, Stephan Rosenkranz, Yu Li
Abstract: We demonstrate a model-free data analysis framework that leverages escort-weighted Shannon Entropy and several divergence matrices to detect phase transitions in scattering and imaging datasets. By establishing a connection between physical entropy and informational entropy, this approach provides a sensitive method for identifying phase transitions without an explicit physical model or order parameter. We further show that pairwise divergence matrices, including Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jeffrey Divergence, Jensen-Shannon Divergence and antisymmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence, provide more comprehensive measures of statistical changes than scalar entropy alone. Our approach successfully detects the onset of both long- and short-range order in neutron and X-ray scattering data, as well as a non-trivial phase transition in magnetic skyrmion lattices observed through Lorentz-transition electron microscopy. These results establish a framework for automated, model-free analysis of experimental data with broad applications in materials science and condensed matter physics.

Title: Metal Halide Perovskites for Violet and Ultraviolet Light Emission
Authors: Sebastian Fernández, Manchen Hu, Tyler K. Colenbrander, Divine Mbachu, Daniel N. Congreve
Abstract: Emissive metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as excellent candidates for next-generation optoelectronics due to their sharp color purity, inexpensive processing, and bandgap tunability. However, the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs has lagged behind due to challenges related to material and device stability, charge carrier transport, tunability into the ultraviolet spectrum, toxicity, and scalability. Here, we review the progress of both violet and ultraviolet MHP nanomaterials and light-emitting diodes, including materials synthesis and device fabrication across various crystal structures and dimensions (e.g., bulk thin films, 2D thin films, nanoplatelets, colloidal nanocrystals, and more) as well as lead-free platforms (e.g., rare-earth metal halide perovskites). By highlighting several pathways to continue the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs while also proposing tactics to overcome their outstanding challenges, we demonstrate the potential of state-of-the-art violet and ultraviolet MHP materials and devices for important applications in public health, 3D printing, nanofabrication, and more.

Title: Efficient high-harmonic generation in van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI$_2$ crystals
Authors: Tianchen Hu, Feng Li, Junhan Huang, Chen Qian, Ruoxuan Ding, Hao Wang, Qiaomei Liu, Qiong Wu, Ruifeng Lu, Chunmei Zhang, Nanlin Wang
Abstract: Layered NbOX$_2$ ($X=\mathrm{Cl,\,Br,\,I}$), a member of the van der Waals ferroelectric family, exhibits intrinsic ferroelectricity and pronounced nonlinear optical responses, making it a promising candidate for integrated nanophotonics applications. While previous studies have emphasized the material's strong second-order nonlinear responses, higher-order nonlinear responses are still mostly unexplored. This work systematically investigates NbOI$_2$ using high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy. Driven by an intense mid-infrared laser field centered at $\sim4~\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength, highly anisotropic odd- and even-order harmonics up to the 16th order are generated at a low peak intensity of $0.4~\mathrm{TW\,cm^{-2}}$, extending beyond the material's bandgap. Both bulk and flake forms of NbOI$_2$ display pronounced harmonic emission from the near-infrared to the deep-ultraviolet spectral region, with a notably high overall conversion efficiency compared to other known materials. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that even-order harmonics remain aligned with the crystal polar axis regardless of the driving-field orientation, whereas odd-order harmonics are dynamically affected. First-principles calculations suggest that the flat valence band associated with Peierls dimerization enhances HHG efficiency through electron correlation. These findings provide fresh perspectives on HHG in van der Waals ferroelectric materials and facilitate the development of compact and tunable quantum light sources.

Title: Dynamically training machine-learning-based force fields for strongly anharmonic materials
Authors: Martin Callsen, Tai-Ting Lee, Mei-Yin Chou
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) force fields have emerged as a powerful tool for computing materials properties at finite temperatures, particularly in regimes where traditional phonon-based perturbation theories fail or cannot be extended beyond the harmonic approximation. These approaches offer accuracy comparable to ab initio molecular dynamics (MD), but at a fraction of the computational cost. However, their reliability critically depends on the quality and representativeness of the training data. In particular, static training datasets often lead to failure when the force field encounters previously unseen atomic configurations during MD simulations. In this work, we present a framework for dynamically training ML force fields and demonstrate its effectiveness across materials with varying degrees of anharmonicity, including cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs), silicon (Si), and tin selenide (SnSe). Our method builds on the conventional lattice dynamics expansion of total energy and incorporates Bayesian error estimation to guide adaptive data acquisition during simulation. Specifically, we show that trajectory-averaged Bayesian errors enable efficient and targeted exploration of the configuration space, significantly enhancing the robustness and transferability of the resulting force fields. We further demonstrate how Bayesian error estimation can be applied to determine the convergence of the dynamic training without requiring additional ab initio data. This proposed framework offers a practical and easily implementable scheme to improve the training process, which is the most critical step in developing reliable ML force fields.

Title: Transferable mechanism of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy switching by hole doping in V$X_2$ ($X$=Te, Se, S) monolayers
Authors: John Lawrence Euste, Maha Hsouna, Nataša Stojić
Abstract: The ability to tune and switch magnetic anisotropy to a perpendicular orientation is a key challenge for implementing 2D magnets in spintronic devices. H-phase vanadium dichalcogenides V$X_2$ ($X$=Te, Se, S) are promising ferromagnetic semiconductors with large magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). Recent work has shown that hole doping can switch their easy axis to out-of-plane, though the microscopic origin of this perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) remains unclear. Using density-functional-theory calculations, we demonstrate that the PMA enhancement arises from first-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC) acting on topmost degenerate valence states with nonzero orbital angular momentum projection ($m_l\ne 0$). In this case, the $\hat{L}_z\hat{S}_z$ term dominates for perpendicular magnetization, while in-plane orientations involve only weaker, second-order SOC contributions. The increased valence bandwidth leads to depletion of higher-energy states upon hole doping, stabilizing PMA. From this mechanism, we identify two transferable design principles for enhancing MAE under weak hole doping: (i) orbital degeneracy at the valence-band edge protected by point-group symmetry and (ii) finite SOC in the degenerate manifold. Notably, we identify multiple magnetic semiconductors that meet these criteria and display enhanced MAE under hole doping. Furthermore, we show that band engineering can strategically place these degenerate orbitals at the valence band edge, significantly boosting PMA when hole-doped. We also examine trends in VTe$_2$, VSe$_2$, and VS$_2$ to determine the influence of crystal-field splitting, exchange interaction, and orbital hybridization on the valence band edges. These results provide both a fundamental understanding of PMA switching upon hole doping and a transferable strategy for tuning magnetic anisotropy, essential for designing high-performance spintronic materials.

Title: Numerical Diagonalization Study of the Phase Boundaries of the S=2 Heisenberg Antiferromagnet on the Orthogonal Dimer Lattice
Authors: Hiroki Nakano, Toru Sakai, Yuko Hosokoshi
Abstract: The S=2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the orthogonal dimer lattice is studied. The edges of the exact dimer and Neel-ordered phases in the ground state of the system are examined by the numerical diagonalization method. Our present results are discussed by combining them with previously obtained estimates for smaller-S cases. We find that an intermediate region between the exact dimer and Neel-ordered phases gradually widens as spin S is increased up to S=2.

Title: NMR/NQR and AC-susceptibility Studies in the Weyl Semimetal Superconductor 1T-MoTe$_2$ under Pressure
Authors: Takuto. Fujii, Hiroshi Yasuoka, Mukkattu Omanakuttan Ajeesh, Marcus. Schmidt, Takeshi Mito, Yu Liu, Cedomir Petrovic, Michael Baenitz
Abstract: We performed the Te-nuclear magnetic resonance, the Mo-nuclear quadrupole resonance, and the AC susceptibility in the Weyl semimetal superconductor 1T-MoTe$_2$ at pressures up to 2.17~GPa. From the temperature and pressure dependence of the AC susceptibility, the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and the upper critical field $H_{\mathrm{c2}}$ were estimated. The results deviate from the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model but are well described by $H_{\mathrm{c2}}(T)=H_{\mathrm{c2}}(0)[1-T/T_{\mathrm{c}}]^{\alpha}$. The latter fit yields $H_{\mathrm{c2}}(0)=1.50$~T, $T_{\mathrm{c}}=3.81$K, and $\alpha=1.1$ at 2.17GPa, suggesting that the superconductivity lies in a strong-coupling regime. Since the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature, $1/T_1T$, follows the Korringa relation at ambient pressure, the increase in $1/T_1T$ with pressure up to approximately 0.7~GPa indicates an increase in the density of states (DOS), $N(E_\mathrm F)$. This trend mirrors the pressure dependence of $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in the low-pressure region, consistent with the BCS mechanism. Above 0.7~GPa, however, $N(E_\mathrm F)$ slightly decreases while $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ continues to rise, suggesting an additional pairing contribution beyond the conventional BCS picture. In the 1T$^{\prime}$ phase at 2.17~GPa, the absence of a coherence peak in $1/T_1T$ around $T_{\mathrm c}$, accompanied by a two-step decrease just below $T_{\mathrm c}$, was observed, which may be a signature of unconventional superconductivity.

Title: Stimulated Magnonic Frequency Combs
Authors: Xueyu Guo, Tianci Gong, Guibin Lan, Mengying Guo, Xiufeng Han, Guoqiang Yu, Peng Yan, Qi Wang
Abstract: Magnonic frequency combs, characterized by a series of discrete frequency lines, have emerged as a promising frontier in magnon spintronics, with potential applications in advanced information processing and sensing technologies. Although the three-magnon scattering process is widely recognized as a fundamental mechanism for generating these combs, its experimental realization has remained challenging due to the high threshold power and strict conservation of momentum and energy. In this work, we propose a novel mechanism for the stimulated generation of magnonic frequency combs that overcomes these limitations. Our approach offers precise and efficient control over key comb properties, including spacing between spectral lines and the number of lines, marking a significant advancement in the field. We substantiate this mechanism through a robust combination of theoretical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and experimental validation. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility of our method but also opens new pathways for integrating magnonic frequency combs into practical spintronic devices.

Title: High-Pressure Torsion-Induced Transformation of Adenosine Monophosphate: Insights into Prebiotic Chemistry of RNA by Astronomical Impacts
Authors: Kaveh Edalati, Jacqueline Hidalgo-Jimenez, Thanh Tam Nguyen
Abstract: The origin of life is yet a compelling scientific mystery that has sometimes been attributed to high-pressure impacts by small solar system bodies such as comets, meteoroids, asteroids, and transitional objects. High-pressure torsion (HPT) is an innovative method with which to simulate the extreme conditions of astronomical impacts and offers insights relevant to prebiotic chemistry. In the present study, we investigated the polymerization and stability of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), a key precursor to ribonucleic acid (RNA), in dry and hydrated conditions (10 wt% water) under 6 GPa at ambient and boiling water temperatures. Comprehensive analyses with the use of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed no evidence of polymerization, while AMP partly transformed to other organic compounds such as nucleobase-derived fragments of adenine, phosphoribose fragments, dehydrated adenosine, protonated adenosine, and oxidized adenosine. The torque measurements during HPT further highlight the mechanical behavior of AMP under extreme conditions. These findings suggest that, while HPT under the conditions tested does not facilitate polymerization, the formation of various compounds from AMP confirms the significance of astronomical impacts on the prebiotic chemistry of RNA on early Earth.

Title: Screening 39 billion protostructures for materials discovery
Authors: Abhijith S Parackal, Florian Trybel, Felix Andreas Faber, Rickard Armiento
Abstract: Large-scale computational surveys are increasingly used to map the landscape of stable crystalline materials. We report a high-throughput energy screening of inorganic crystals that enumerates binary and ternary compositions up to a specified unit-cell complexity, yielding 39 billion protostructures. Candidates predicted to lie on or near the convex hull are retained, and their degrees of freedom are explored via Latin hypercube sampling followed by relaxation with machine-learned interatomic potentials. The resulting dataset contains 81 million locally relaxed crystal structures spanning 4495 ternary phase diagrams constructed from elements ranging from lithium to bromine and contains 88,498 crystal prototypes not present in existing crystal-structure databases. The methods are validated both for three well-explored materials systems, Zr-Zn-N, Ti-Zn-N, and Hf-Zn-N, and by comparing with known data for structures resulting from the larger screening. The work provides a systematic map of low-energy compositional-structural space and a large, structured pool of candidates for downstream property evaluation and materials design.

Title: High-precision Dynamic Monte Carlo Study of Rigidity Percolation
Authors: Mingzhong Lu, Yufeng Song, Qiyuan Shi, Ming Li, Youjin Deng
Abstract: Rigidity percolation provides an important basis for understanding the onset of mechanical stability in disordered materials. While most studies on the triangular lattice have focused on static properties at fixed bond~(site) occupation probabilities, the dynamics of the rigidity transition remain less explored. In this work, we formulate a dynamic pebble game algorithm that monitors how rigid clusters emerge and evolve as bonds are added sequentially to an empty lattice, with computational efficiency comparable to the standard static pebble game. We uncover a previously overlooked temporal self-similarity exhibited in multiple quantities, including the cluster size changes and merged cluster sizes during bond addition, as well as the number of simultaneously merging clusters. We identify large-scale cascade events in which a single bond addition triggers the merger of an extensive number of clusters that scales with system size with inverse correlation-length exponent. Using an event-based ensemble approach, we obtain high-precision estimates of the critical point $p_c = 0.660\,277\,8(10)$, the inverse correlation-length exponent $1/\nu = 0.850(3)$, and the fractal dimension $d_f = 1.850(2)$, representing substantial improvements over existing values.

Title: Features distinguishing the flow behavior of polyelectrolytes with opposite charges in aqueous solutions
Authors: Suresha P. Ranganath, Manohar V. Badiger, Bernhard A. Wolf
Abstract: Solution viscosities of a polycation and a polyanion in NaCl-water: HSAB-guided rheology The zero-shear viscosities of poly(3-acrylamido-propyl-trimethyl-ammonium-chloride) (PAPTMAC-Cl, M ~ 7.8 kDa) and poly(styrene-sulfonate sodium) (PSS-Na, M ~ 75.6 kDa) were measured in aqueous NaCl solutions at 25 degrees C over a wide range of salt concentrations. Extrapolation to zero polymer concentration yields an intrinsic viscosity of 4 460 mL g^-1 for the polycation, i.e. roughly three times larger than that of the polyanion, although the polycation's molar mass is only one-tenth of the polyanion's. At low salinities the shear-overlap parameter S as a function of polymer concentration c exhibits a pronounced maximum for PAPTMAC-Cl, whereas PSS-Na shows a clear inflection point. With increasing NaCl concentration both curves become linear, indicating that the system has entered a regime where the solute dominates the flow behavior. The crossover concentrations (S_crov) of the polycation are systematically larger than those of the polyanion. By applying Pearson's Hard-Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) concept we find that the observed differences are not a simple consequence of opposite polymer charges. Rather they arise from the specific ion-pairing: the soft NR4+ group of PAPTMAC pairs with the hard Cl-, whereas the hard RSO3- units of PSS-Na interact with the hard Na+. This insight suggests that the rheological response of polyelectrolyte solutions can be deliberately tuned by choosing counter-ions of appropriate hardness/softness. Keywords: intrinsic viscosity, shear-overlap, polyelectrolytes, sodium chloride, HSAB theory, rheology, soft-matter.

Title: Finite-size corrections to the crosscap overlap in the two-dimensional Ising model
Authors: Yiteng Zhang, Li-Ping Yang, Hong-Hao Tu, Yueshui Zhang
Abstract: We analyze the finite-size corrections to the crosscap overlap in the two-dimensional classical Ising model along its self-dual critical line. Using a fermionic formulation, we express the lattice crosscap overlap in terms of Bogoliubov angles and develop a contour-integral approach by analytically continuing the lattice momentum to the complex plane. This leads to a remarkably simple expression for the crosscap overlap, which demonstrates that the finite-size corrections decay exponentially with system size. We further derive an exact analytical formula for the corresponding decay constant and show that it is determined by the complex singularity structure of the Bogoliubov angle.

Title: Six-loop renormalization group analysis of the $ϕ^4 + ϕ^6$ model
Authors: L. Ts. Adzhemyan, M. V. Kompaniets, A. V. Trenogin
Abstract: We investigate the $\lambda\ph^4+g\ph^6$ model using the renormalization group method and the $\ep$ expansion. This model is used in a situation where the coefficients $\lambda$, $g$ and the coefficient $\tau$ of the term $\tau \ph^2$ depend on two parameters $T$ and $P$, and there is a point ($T_c,P_c$) at which $\tau$ and $\lambda$ are zero. This point is named the tricritical point. The description of a system depends on a trajectory that leads to the tricritical point on the plane ($T,P$). In the trajectories, when $\lambda$ goes to zero fast enough, the description is defined by the $\ph^6$ interaction and then the $\ph^4$ term can be considered as a composite operator. In this case, the logarithmic dimension is $d=3$, and the $\ep$ expansion is carried out in the dimension $d=3-2\ep$. The main exponents of the \textit{tricritical} model have been calculated in the third order of the $\ep$ expansion. Taking into account the $\ph^4$ interaction, we were able to calculate the value of the parameter that determines the required decrease rate in $\lambda$ to implement the tricritical behavior. The tricritical dimensions of the composite operators $\ph^k$ for $k=1, 2, 4, 6$ have been computed. The resulting values are compared to those known from a conformal field theory and non-perturbative renormalization group.

Title: Sustainable Materials Discovery in the Era of Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Sajid Mannan, Rupert J. Myers, Rohit Batra, Rocio Mercado, Lothar Wondraczek, N. M. Anoop Krishnan
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed materials discovery, enabling rapid exploration of chemical space through generative models and surrogate screening. Yet current AI workflows optimize performance first, deferring sustainability to post synthesis assessment. This creates inefficiency by the time environmental burdens are quantified, resources have been invested in potentially unsustainable solutions. The disconnect between atomic scale design and lifecycle assessment (LCA) reflects fundamental challenges, data scarcity across heterogeneous sources, scale gaps from atoms to industrial systems, uncertainty in synthesis pathways, and the absence of frameworks that co-optimize performance with environmental impact. We propose to integrate upstream machine learning (ML) assisted materials discovery with downstream lifecycle assessment into a uniform ML-LCA environment. The framework ML-LCA integrates five components, information extraction for building materials-environment knowledge bases, harmonized databases linking properties to sustainability metrics, multi-scale models bridging atomic properties to lifecycle impacts, ensemble prediction of manufacturing pathways with uncertainty quantification, and uncertainty-aware optimization enabling simultaneous performance-sustainability navigation. Case studies spanning glass, cement, semiconductor photoresists, and polymers demonstrate both necessity and feasibility while identifying material-specific integration challenges. Realizing ML-LCA demands coordinated advances in data infrastructure, ex-ante assessment methodologies, multi-objective optimization, and regulatory alignment enabling the discovery of materials that are sustainable by design rather than by chance.

Title: Quantum Otto cycle in the Anderson impurity model
Authors: Salvatore Gatto, Alessandra Colla, Heinz-Peter Breuer, Michael Thoss
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic performance of a periodic quantum Otto cycle operating on the single-impurity Anderson model. Using a decomposition of the time-evolution generator based on the principle of minimal dissipation, combined with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we analyze the operating regimes of the quantum thermal machine and investigate effects of Coulomb interactions, strong system-reservoir coupling, and energy level alignments. Our results show that Coulomb interaction can change the operating regimes and may lead to an enhancement of the efficiency.

Title: Deeply nonlinear magnon-photon hybrid excitation
Authors: Dinesh Wagle, Anish Rai, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch
Abstract: We investigate the microwave-power dependence of magnon-photon coupling in a yttrium iron garnet-sphere/split-ring-resonator hybrid system at room temperature and demonstrate that nonlinear spin-wave interactions suppress the coupling through power-induced dissipation of magnetostatic modes. At low microwave power, the modes exhibit pronounced level repulsion, evidencing strong coupling to the microwave field. As the power increases, however, magnon linewidth broadening progressively weakens the coupling and ultimately suppresses it entirely below a threshold external magnetic field. We show that this behavior originates from Suhl's first-order instability: magnetostatic modes, which couple to the resonator, parametrically excites two counter-propagating magnons at half its frequency, causing modes below the threshold external magnetic field to vanish. In contrast, magnon modes above the threshold field remain robust even at high power, as the instability criterion is not satisfied in that regime. These results reveal a well-defined nonlinear boundary for magnon-photon coupled systems and highlight a favorable regime for exploiting nonlinear magnonics for frequency conversion, switching, and other functional magnonic devices.

Title: The roles of bulk and surface thermodynamics in the selective adsorption of a confined azeotropic mixture
Authors: Katie L. Y. Zhou, Anna T. Bui, Stephen J. Cox
Abstract: Fluid mixtures that exhibit an azeotrope cannot be purified by simple bulk distillation. Consequently, there is strong motivation to understand the behavior of azeotropic mixtures under confinement. We address this problem using a machine-learning-enhanced classical density functional theory applied to a binary Lennard-Jones mixture that exhibits azeotropic phase behavior. As proof-of-principle of a "train once, learn many" strategy, our approach combines a neural functional trained on a single-component repulsive reference system with a mean-field treatment of attractive interactions, derived within the framework of hyperdensity functional theory (hyper-DFT). The theory faithfully describes capillary condensation and results from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, by taking advantage of a known accurate equation of state, the theory we present well-describes bulk thermodynamics by construction. Exploiting the computational efficiency of hyper-DFT, we systematically evaluate adsorption selectivity across a wide range of compositions, pressures, temperatures, and wall-fluid affinities. In cases where the wall-fluid interaction is the same for both species, we find that the pore becomes completely unselective at the bulk azeotropic composition. Strikingly, this unselective point persists far from liquid-vapor coexistence, including in the supercritical regime. Analysis of the bulk equation of state across a wide range of thermodynamic state points shows that the azeotropic composition coincides with equal partial molar volumes and an extremum in the isothermal compressibility. A complementary thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that unselective adsorption corresponds to an aneotrope (a point of zero relative adsorption) and an extremum in the interfacial free energy. We also find that the two interfaces of the slit pore behave independently down to remarkably small slits.

Title: Microstructure-controlled vortex phases and two-phase superconductivity in (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 revealed by ac magnetostrictive coefficients
Authors: Mengju Yuan, Yuze Xu, Bin Zhang, Jun-Yi Ge, Aifeng Wang, Mingquan He, Yanpeng Qi, Yisheng Chai
Abstract: We investigate flux dynamics in the high-entropy alloy superconductor (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 after annealing (as-cast, 500 °C, 550 °C, and 1000 °C) using a sensitive ac composite magnetoelectric method that measures the complex ac magnetostrictive coefficient (d{\lambda}/dH)ac. The resulting vortex phase diagrams show that intermediate annealing (500-550 °C) induces nanoscale clustering, enhances pinning, and produces a pronounced fishtail effect with successive elastic- and plastic-vortex-glass regimes. Flux-jump instabilities appear at 550 °C and persist at 1000 °C, indicating strong pinning and thermomagnetic instability in the low-temperature, low-field regime. Remarkably, the 1000 °C sample exhibits a two-step superconducting response-a double plateau or drop in d{\lambda}'/dH and two dissipation peaks in d{\lambda}''/dH-demonstrating the coexistence of two superconducting phases with distinct irreversibility and critical-field value. We further show that the resolvability of the two-step (d{\lambda}/dH)ac signature is governed by the topological connectivity of the phase-separated microstructure, which controls magnetic shielding between the TaNb-rich network and the (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 parent phase. These results establish a direct microstructure-vortex-state correlation and provide a route to tailoring flux pinning in chemically complex superconductors via thermal processing.

Title: Non-invertible translation from Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly
Authors: Tsubasa Oishi, Takuma Saito, Hiromi Ebisu
Abstract: Symmetry provides powerful non-perturbative constraints in quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly -- a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between internal and translational symmetries that forbids a trivial symmetric gapped phase. In this work, we investigate lattice translation operators in systems with an LSM anomaly. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and show that, after gauging the full internal symmetry, translation becomes non-invertible and fuses into defects of the internal symmetry. The result is supported by the anomaly-inflow in view of topological field theory. Our work extends earlier one-dimensional observations to a unified higher-dimensional framework and clarifies their origin in mixed anomalies and higher-group structures, highlighting a coherent interplay between internal and crystalline symmetries.

Title: Pattern Formation in Excitable Neuronal Maps
Authors: Divya D. Joshi, Trupti R. Sharma, Prashant M. Gade
Abstract: Coupled excitable systems can generate a variety of patterns. In this work, we investigate coupled Chialvo maps in two dimensions under two types of nearest-neighbor couplings. One coupling produces ringlike patterns, while the other produces spirals. The rings expand with increasing coupling, whereas spirals evolve into turbulence and dissipate at stronger coupling. To quantify these patterns, we introduce an analogue of the discriminant of the velocity gradient tensor and examine the persistence of its sign. For ring-type patterns, the persistence decays more slowly than exponentially, often following a power law or stretched exponential. When spiral structures remain intact, persistence saturates asymptotically and can exhibit superposed periodic oscillations, suggesting complex exponents at early times. These behaviors highlight deep connections with the underlying dynamics.

Title: Impact of hydrogen incorporation on electronic and magnetic structure of X2CrNi18-9 stainless steel
Authors: Torben Tappe, Louis Becker, Gaurav Kanu, Thomas F. Headen, Dirk Honecker, Gabi Schierning, Santiago Benito, Sebastian Weber, Klara Lünser, Sabrina Disch
Abstract: Hydrogen absorption significantly alters the mechanical properties of steel. However, absorbed hydrogen also influences its electronic and magneto-structural properties, helping to interpret how hydrogen is incorporated. This study therefore investigates the influence of hydrogen incorporation on the electronic and magneto-structural properties of X2CrNi18-9 stainless steel in different microstructural states. Microstructural characterization included analytic electron microscopy mapping, X-ray diffraction and thermodynamic stability maps to evaluate grain size, dislocation density and chemical homogeneity. The electronic properties were characterized using the Seebeck coefficient, while the magneto-structural properties were investigated using diffuse neutron scattering and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Hydrogen incorporation showed clear changes in the Seebeck coefficients. Magnetic SANS in conjunction with diffuse neutron scattering indicates the existence of nanoscale inhomogeneities with the same fcc structure as the bulk, but with correlation lengths of a few nanometres. The size of these inhomogeneities increased with hydrogen incorporation, suggesting that hydrogen preferentially accumulates in their vicinity. However, no direct correlation between the electronic and magneto-structural properties and the dislocation density could be demonstrated. We suggest that studies such as these will lead in the medium term to the development of guidelines for material design to make steels more resistant to hydrogen.

Title: Ultra-complex conductivity diagrams in the nearly free electron approximation
Authors: A.Ya. Maltsev
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of the emergence of ultra-complex conductivity diagrams in the nearly free electron approximation for metals with cubic symmetry. Estimates show that the emergence of such diagrams requires the Fermi level to fall into very narrow energy intervals within the conduction band. In our view, this circumstance is mostly due to the high symmetry and the simplest analytical form of the dispersion relations $\epsilon ({\bf p})$ under consideration.

Authors: Marta Perego, Peter Koopmann, Clara Galante Agero, Alexandra Mestre Tora', Artem O. Denisov, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Vadim Geshkenbein, Gianni Blatter, Thomas Ihn, Klaus Ensslin
Abstract: Twisted graphene provides a tunable platform for studying superconductivity in two dimensions. In the presence of electric currents and magnetic fields, vortices determine the phenomenological properties of the material. Related studies usually address bulk properties averaging over ensembles of vortices. Here, we employ a gate-defined Josephson junction as a single-vortex sensor, enabling direct access to individual vortex dynamical events. Our measurements reveal that, at elevated temperatures (T > 100 mK), vortices enter the superconducting leads via classical thermal activation over energy barriers. At lower temperatures (T < 90 mK), we observe macroscopic quantum tunneling through these barriers. The data are consistent with a sharp, first-order type quantum-to-classical transition. From our measurements, we extract vortex entry and exit energy barriers on the order of a few Kelvin and estimate the barrier thickness to be approximately 100 nm, corresponding to about one tenth of the device width.

Title: Model density approach to Ewald summations
Authors: Chiara Ribaldone, Jacques Kontak Desmarais
Abstract: The evaluation of the electrostatic potential is fundamental to the study of condensed phase systems. We discuss the calculation of the relevant lattice summations by Ewald-type techniques. A model charge density is introduced, that cancels multipole moments of the crystalline charge distribution up to a desired order, for accelerating convergence of the Ewald sums. The method is applicable to calculations of bulk systems, employing arbitrary unit cells in a classical or quantum context, and with arbitrary basis functions to represent the charge density. The approach clarifies a decades-old implementation in the CRYSTAL code.

Title: Synthetic control over marcasite-pyrite polymorph formation in the Fe1-xCoxSe2 series
Authors: Luqman Mustafa, Susanne Kunzmann, Martin Kostka, Jill Fortmann, Aurelija Mockute, Alan Savan, Alfred Ludwig, Anna Grünebohm, Andreas Kreyssig, Anna E. Böhmer
Abstract: Transition-metal dichalcogenides of the pyrite-marcasite family are model systems of crystal chemistry. A few of these show polymorphism. The theoretical ground state of CoSe2 is marcasite, but the material is typically synthesized in the pyrite structure. Polymorphism has been observed in nanoparticles and synthetic control of the polymorphs of CoSe2 has not been achieved. We have synthesized material libraries of the Fe1-xCoxSe2 series by combining combinatorial deposition and ex-situ selenization. The approach allows to efficiently explore substitution ranges and crystal structures that form for different synthesis conditions. We find that higher levels of Co content x within the marcasite structure are possible when synthesizing at low temperatures. At a synthesis temperature of only 250° C, we have successfully synthesized marcasite CoSe2 as the majority phase. Density functional theory simulations reveal that the two isomorphs of CoSe2 are extremely close in energy and that the orthorhombic phase is the energetic ground state. Our experimental and theoretical data show that the marcasite structure is the equilibrium phase of Fe1-xCoxSe2 in the entire composition range.

Title: Rate Equation for the Transfer of Interstitials across Interfaces between Equilibrated Crystals
Authors: Jörg Weissmüller
Abstract: This work inspects the thermally activated transfer of solute particles across the interface between two interstitial solid solution phases that equilibrate internally by fast diffusion on conserved arrays of sites. When each phase is considered as an ergodic ensemble of particles, statistical mechanics predicts the occupancy of the transition states at equilibrium to depend on the barrier energy and on the chemical potentials and vacancy fractions in each of the phases. A rate law for the non-equilibrium interfacial transfer, based on a constant transition probability between activated states, naturally satisfies the principle of detailed balance. Contrary to Butler-Volmer-type laws, values of the particle chemical potentials enter explicitly rather than through their difference. This, along with the dependency on the vacancy fractions, implies here an exchange flux density that depends explicitly on the compositions at equilibrium. The results can explain experimental observations of a drastic slow-down in the charging of metal hydrides near phase transformations or miscibility-gap critical points.

Title: Watching Polarons Form in Real Time
Authors: Victor Garcia-Herrero, Christoph Emeis, Zhenbang Dai, Jon Lafuente-Bartolome, Feliciano Giustino, Fabio Caruso
Abstract: Polaron formation in pump-probe experiments is an inherently non-equilibrium phenomenon, driven by the ultrafast coupled dynamics of electrons and phonons, and culminating in the emergence of a localized quasiparticle state. In this work, we present a first-principles quantum-kinetic theory of polaron formation that captures the real-time evolution of electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in presence of electron-phonon coupling. We implement this framework to investigate the ultrafast polaron formation in the prototypical polar insulator MgO. This approach allows us to determine the characteristic timescales of polaron localization and to identify its distinctive dynamical fingerprint. Our results establish clear and experimentally accessible criteria for identifying polaron formation in pump-probe experiments.

Abstract: We propose a method to suppress collisional loss in strongly dipolar, rotationally excited ultracold molecules using a combination of static (dc) and microwave (ac) electric fields. By tuning two excited pair molecular rotational states into a Förster resonance with a dc field, simultaneously driving excited rotational transitions with an ac field removes all long-range bound states, allowing near complete suppression of all two- and three-body collisional loss channels. While permitting tunable dipolar and anti-dipolar interactions, this bound-state-free ac/dc scheme is not subject to photon-changing collisions that are the primary source of two-body loss in shielding with two microwave fields, used to achieve the first molecular Bose-Einstein condensate [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Using NaCs as a representative example for strongly dipolar molecules, close-coupling calculations are performed to show that bound-state-free shielding can achieve ratios of elastic-to-loss rates $\gtrsim 10^{6}$ at 100 nK, with currently accessible ac and dc field generation technologies. This work opens new opportunities for realizing large, long-lived samples of strongly interacting degenerate molecular gases with tunable long-range interactions.

Title: Fabrication effects on Niobium oxidation and surface contamination in Niobium-metal bilayers using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
Authors: Tathagata Banerjee, Maciej W. Olszewski, Valla Fatemi
Abstract: Superconducting resonators and qubits are limited by dielectric losses from surface oxides. Surface oxides are mitigated through various strategies such as the addition of a metal capping layer, surface passivation, and acid processing. In this study, we demonstrate the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as a rapid characterization tool to study the effectiveness cap layers for niobium for further device fabrication. We non-destructively evaluate 17 capping layers to characterize their ability to prevent oxygen diffusion, and the effects of standard fabrication processes -- annealing, resist stripping, and acid cleaning. We downselect for resilient capping layers and test their microwave resonator performance.

Title: Superconducting properties of transition metal dichalcogenides in proximity to a conventional superconductor
Authors: Florian Kayatz, Annica M. Black-Schaffer, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) hold relevance for spin-triplet superconducting phases due to their inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling, but the majority of studies have so far focused on oversimplified models. In this work, we consider a TMD monolayer using a three-orbital model with anisotropic couplings and investigate the emergent superconducting properties when it is placed in proximity to a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor. We find that the multiorbital nature of the TMDs lead to superconducting gaps not only at zero energy, but also at higher energies, so-called hybridization gaps, which exhibit a complex structure due to the anisotropic couplings, challenging their spectral measurement. Moreover, we find that the inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling induces a spin splitting and a spin polarization along the $z$-direction, which correlates with the emergence of mixed spin-triplet superconducting pairs. These spin-triplet pair correlations appear in the monolayer as a proximity-induced effect due to the impact of the Ising spin-orbit field on conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity. Taking realistic parameters for a $\text{MoS}_2$ monolayer, we show that the Ising field is strong enough to induce spin-triplet pair correlations of the same magnitude as their spin-singlet counterparts. We also include Rashba spin-orbit coupling, naturally emerging in a heterostructure and find that it induces equal spin-triplet superconducting pairs that compete with the mixed spin-triplet pairs induced by the Ising spin-orbit coupling. Our findings help understand the superconducting properties of TMDs in proximity to conventional superconductors.

Title: MEIDNet: Multimodal generative AI framework for inverse materials design
Authors: Anand Babu, Rogério Almeida Gouvêa, Pierre Vandergheynst, Gian-Marco Rignanese
Abstract: In this work, we present Multimodal Equivariant Inverse Design Network (MEIDNet), a framework that jointly learns structural information and materials properties through contrastive learning, while encoding structures via an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN). By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods. Our inverse design framework demonstrates both scalability and adaptability, paving the way for the universal learning of chemical space across diverse modalities.

Title: Intrinsic Nonlinear Gyrotropic Magnetic Effect Governed by Spin-Rotation Quantum Geometry
Authors: Neelanjan Chakraborti, Snehasish Nandy, Sudeep Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: Nonlinear magnetic response driven by time-periodic magnetic fields offers a distinct route to probe spin-resolved quantum geometry beyond conventional electric-field-driven nonlinear effects. While linear magnetic responses depend on the Zeeman quantum geometric tensor, the influence of generalized spin-rotation quantum geometries on nonlinear responses has not been established. Here, we develop a microscopic quantum-kinetic framework to elucidate how the Zeeman and spin-rotation quantum geometric tensors govern nonlinear gyrotropic magnetic transport in two-dimensional systems. We derive second-order gyrotropic magnetic currents and reveal a distinct geometric separation: the off-diagonal sector is controlled by the Zeeman symplectic and metric connections, whereas the diagonal sector is dictated by the spin-rotation quantum metric and Berry curvature. This identifies the spin-rotation quantum geometric tensor as a fundamental geometric quantity unique to the nonlinear regime. Applying our theory to massless Dirac fermions, hexagonally warped topological insulator surface states, tilted massive Dirac fermions, and parity-time symmetric CuMnAs, we demonstrate how specific symmetries selectively activate conduction and displacement channels. Our findings link spin-resolved quantum geometry to nonlinear magnetic transport, offering design principles for engineering tailored nonlinear magnetic responses in optoelectronic and spintronic devices.

Title: Magnetic texture modulated superconductivity in superconductor/ferromagnet shells of semiconductor nanowires
Authors: Nabhanila Nandi, Juan Carlos Estrada Saldaña, Alexandros Vekris, Michelle Turley, Irene P. Zhang, Yu Liu, Mario Castro, Martin Bjergfelt, Sabbir A. Khan, Sebastián Allende, Peter Krogstrup, Kathryn Ann Moler, Kasper Grove-Rasmussen, Jesper Nygård
Abstract: In a one-dimensional ferromagnet-superconductor nanowire, magnetism can suppress superconductivity except where the Zeeman field is suppressed, for example domain wall superconductivity (DWS) near magnetic domain walls or multi-domain-averaged superconductivity (MDAS) in multi-domain states where the net magnetization over the coherence length averages to nearly zero. Here we study full-shell InAs/EuS/Al nanowires using scanning SQUID magnetometry and transport, and find superconductivity in the Al shell only when the EuS is in a multi-domain state, consistent with both DWS and MDAS, and absent in the saturated single-domain state. Scanning SQUID magnetometry further shows that the EuS magnetic texture is position dependent and reconfigurable by small changes in external magnetic field, including moving a well-defined domain wall at $\approx$5.5 $\mu$m/mT with sub-mT fields, implying that any associated localized superconducting region would likewise be movable. Such magnetic texture controlled superconductivity along a nanowire may be useful for topological qubits, Andreev spin qubits, superconducting logic, and memory devices.

Title: Emergent Spatial Textures from Interaction Quenches in the Hubbard Model
Authors: Sankha Subhra Bakshi, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: Interaction quenches in strongly correlated electron systems provide a powerful route to probe nonequilibrium many-body dynamics. For the Hubbard model, nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory has revealed coherent post-quench oscillations, dynamical crossovers, and long-lived transient regimes. However, these studies are largely restricted to spatially homogeneous dynamics and therefore neglect the role of spatial structure formation during ultrafast evolution. Here we investigate interaction quenches in the half-filled Hubbard model using a real-space time-dependent Gutzwiller framework. We show that homogeneous nonequilibrium dynamics is generically unstable: even arbitrarily weak spatial fluctuations grow dynamically and drive the system toward intrinsically inhomogeneous states. Depending on the interaction strength, the post-quench evolution exhibits spatial differentiation, nucleation, and slow coarsening of Mott-like domains. Our results establish spatial self-organization as a generic feature of far-from-equilibrium correlated matter and reveal a fundamental limitation of spatially homogeneous nonequilibrium theories.

Title: Translational and Rotational Temperature Difference in Coexisting Phases of Inertial Active Dumbbells
Authors: Subhasish Chaki, Hartmut Löwen
Abstract: We investigate the effect of translational and rotational inertia on motility-induced phase separation in underdamped active dumbbells and identify the emergence of four distinct kinetic temperatures across the coexisting phases-unlike in overdamped systems. We find that the dilute, gas-like phase consistently exhibits a higher translational kinetic temperature than the dense, liquid-like phase, with this difference amplified by increasing the rotational inertia. Rotational kinetic temperatures display a similar trend, with the dense phase remaining colder than the dilute phase; however, in this case the temperature difference grows with translational inertia and activity, while becoming practically independent of rotational inertia. This counterintuitive behavior arises from the interplay of activity-driven collisions with both translational and rotational inertia in the coexisting phases. Our results highlight the critical role of translational and rotational inertia in shaping the kinetic temperature landscape of motility-induced phase separation and offer new insights into the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of active matter.

Title: Universal Multifractality at the Topological Anderson Insulator Transition
Authors: Ksenija Kovalenka, Ahmad Ranjbar, Sam Azadi, Rodion Vladimirovich Belosludov, Thomas D. Kühne, Mohammad Saeed Bahramy
Abstract: Disorder is ubiquitous in quantum materials, and its interplay with topology can generate phases absent in the clean limit. Using the Haldane model as a minimal setting, we show that disorder not only shifts topological boundaries but also stabilizes a topological Anderson insulator (TAI) between trivial and Chern insulating regimes. Employing the local Chern marker as a real-space topological probe, we map the full phase diagram and demonstrate that the TAI forms a finite domain bounded by trivial and Anderson insulators. Multifractal analysis of low-energy eigenstates at the boundary reveals universal critical spectra, independent of whether disorder generates or destroys topology. These results place topology, localization, and criticality within a unified framework and provide clear benchmarks for real-space diagnostics of disordered topological phases.

Title: Inverted anisotropy of the partially screened magnetic impurity
Authors: Krzysztof P. Wójcik, Michał P. Kwasigroch
Abstract: We investigate a single magnetic impurity in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling and single-ion anisotropy. We show that at sufficiently strong coupling there exists a finite temperature window, before the moment is completely screened, where the magnetic anisotropy of the system flips: the hard-axis becomes the easy-axis or vice versa. We derive this rigorously for a single impurity using numerical renormalization group calculations as well as Nozieres' strong-coupling limit and discuss its relevance to heavy-fermion compounds which order magnetically along the hard-direction. We show that the coexistence of Curie-like response and Kondo fluctuations is stabilized along the initially hard direction leading to the anisotropy switch.

Title: Fast, accurate, and predictive method for atom detection in site-resolved images of microtrap arrays
Authors: Marc Cheneau, Romaric Journet, Matthieu Boffety, François Goudail, Caroline Kulcsár, Pauline Trouvé-Peloux
Abstract: We introduce a new method, rooted in estimation theory, to detect individual atoms in site-resolved images of microtrap arrays, such as optical lattices or optical tweezers arrays. Using labelled test images, we demonstrate drastic improvement of the detection accuracy compared to the popular method based on Wiener deconvolution when the inter-site distance is comparable to the radius of the point spread function. The runtime of our method scales approximately linearly with the number of sites, and remains well below 100 ms for an array of 100 x 100 sites on a desktop computer. It is therefore fully compatible with a real-time usage. Finally, we propose a rigorous definition for the signal-to-noise ratio of the problem, and show that it can be used as a predictor for the detection error rate. Our work opens the prospect for future experiments with increased array sizes, or reduced inter-site distances.

Title: Tree tensor network states represent low-energy states faithfully
Authors: Thomas Barthel
Abstract: Extending corresponding results for matrix product states [Verstraete and Cirac, PRB 73, 094423 (2006); Schuch et al. PRL 100, 030504 (2008)], it is shown how the approximation error of tree tensor network states (TTNS) can be bounded using Schmidt spectra or Rényi entanglement entropies of the target quantum state. Conversely, one obtains bounds on TTNS bond dimensions needed to achieve a specific approximation accuracy. For tree lattices, the result implies that efficient TTNS approximations exist if $\alpha<1$ Rényi entanglement entropies for single-branch cuts obey an area law, as in ground and low-energy states of certain gapped systems.

Title: Single-Nodal Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in NLP Models
Authors: Shalom Rosner, Ronit D. Gross, Ella Koresh, Ido Kanter
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in statistical mechanics primarily occurs during phase transitions at the thermodynamic limit where the Hamiltonian preserves inversion symmetry, yet the low-temperature free energy exhibits reduced symmetry. Herein, we demonstrate the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in natural language processing (NLP) models during both pre-training and fine-tuning, even under deterministic dynamics and within a finite training architecture. This phenomenon occurs at the level of individual attention heads and is scaled-down to its small subset of nodes and also valid at a single-nodal level, where nodes acquire the capacity to learn a limited set of tokens after pre-training or labels after fine-tuning for a specific classification task. As the number of nodes increases, a crossover in learning ability occurs, governed by the tradeoff between a decrease following random-guess among increased possible outputs, and enhancement following nodal cooperation, which exceeds the sum of individual nodal capabilities. In contrast to spin-glass systems, where a microscopic state of frozen spins cannot be directly linked to the free-energy minimization goal, each nodal function in this framework contributes explicitly to the global network task and can be upper-bounded using convex hull analysis. Results are demonstrated using BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel classification task.

Title: A generative machine learning model for designing metal hydrides applied to hydrogen storage
Authors: Xiyuan Liu, Christian Hacker, Shengnian Wang, Yuhua Duan
Abstract: Developing new metal hydrides is a critical step toward efficient hydrogen storage in carbon-neutral energy systems. However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.

Title: Resource-Theoretic Quantifiers of Weak and Strong Symmetry Breaking: Strong Entanglement Asymmetry and Beyond
Authors: Yuya Kusuki, Sridip Pal, Hiroyasu Tajima
Abstract: Quantifying how much a quantum state breaks a symmetry is essential for characterizing phases, nonequilibrium dynamics, and open-system behavior. Quantum resource theory provides a rigorous operational framework to define and characterize such quantifiers of symmetry-breaking. As a starter, we exemplify the usefulness of resource theory by noting that second-Rényi entanglement asymmetry can increase under symmetric operations, and hence is not a resource monotone, and should not solely be used to capture Quantum Mpemba effect. More importantly, motivated by mixed-state physics where weak and strong symmetries are inequivalent, we formulate a new resource theory tailored to strong symmetry, identifying free states and strong-covariant operations. This framework systematically identifies quantifiers of strong symmetry breaking for a broad class of symmetry groups, including a strong entanglement asymmetry. A particularly transparent structure emerges for U(1) symmetry, where the resource theory for the strong symmetry breaking has a completely parallel structure to the entanglement theory: the variance of the conserved quantity fully characterizes the asymptotic manipulation of strong symmetry breaking. By connecting this result to the knowledge of the geometry of quantum state space, we obtain a quantitative framework to track how weak symmetry breaking is irreversibly converted into strong symmetry breaking in open quantum systems. We further propose extensions to generalized symmetries and illustrate the qualitative impact of strong symmetry breaking in analytically tractable QFT examples and applications.

Title: Double-Bracket Master Equations: Phase-Space Representation and Classical Limit
Authors: Ankit W. Shrestha, Budhaditya Bhattacharjee, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: We investigate the classical limit of quantum master equations featuring double-bracket dissipators. Specifically, we consider dissipators defined by double commutators, which describe dephasing dynamics, as well as dissipators involving double anticommutators, associated with fluctuating anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The classical limit is obtained by formulating the open quantum dynamics in phase space using the Wigner function and Moyal products, followed by a systematic $\hbar$-expansion. We begin with the well-known model of energy dephasing, associated with energy diffusion. We then turn to master equations containing a double anticommutator with the system Hamiltonian, recently derived in the context of noisy non-Hermitian systems. For both classes of double-bracket equations, we provide a gradient-flow representation of the dynamics. We analyze the classical limit of the resulting evolutions for harmonic and driven anharmonic quantum oscillators, considering both classical and nonclassical initial states. The dynamics is characterized through the evolution of several observables as well as the Wigner logarithmic negativity. We conclude by extending our analysis to generalized master equations involving higher-order nested brackets, which provide a time-continuous description of spectral filtering techniques commonly used in the numerical analysis of quantum systems.

Title: Non-Equilibrium Phase Transition in a Boundary-Driven Dissipative Fermionic Chain
Authors: Hao Chen, Wucheng Zhang, Manas Kulkarni, Abhinav Prem
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary-localized periodic (Floquet) drive can induce nontrivial long-range correlations in a non-interacting fermionic chain which is additionally subject to boundary dissipation. Surprisingly, we find that this phenomenon occurs even when the corresponding isolated bulk is in a trivial gapped phase with exponentially decaying correlations. We argue that this boundary-drive induced non-equilibrium transition (as witnessed through the correlation matrix) is driven by a resonance mechanism whereby the drive frequency bridges bulk energy gaps, allowing boundary-injected particles and holes to propagate and mediate long-range correlations into the bulk. We also numerically establish that when the drive bridges a particle-hole gap, the induced long-range order scales as a power law with the bulk pairing potential ($\chi \sim \gamma^2$). Our results highlight the potential of localized coherent driving for generating macroscopic order in open quantum systems.

Title: Universal Topological Gates from Braiding and Fusing Anyons on Quantum Hardware
Authors: Chiu Fan Bowen Lo, Anasuya Lyons, Dan Gresh, Michael Mills, Peter E. Siegfried, Maxwell D. Urmey, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Henrik Dreyer, Ashvin Vishwanath, Ruben Verresen, Mohsin Iqbal
Abstract: Topological quantum computation encodes quantum information in the internal fusion space of non-Abelian anyonic quasiparticles, whose braiding implements logical gates. This goes beyond Abelian topological order (TO) such as the toric code, as its anyons lack internal structure. However, the simplest non-Abelian generalizations of the toric code do not support universality via braiding alone. Here we demonstrate that such minimally non-Abelian TOs can be made universal by treating anyon fusion as a computational primitive. We prepare a 54-qubit TO wavefunction associated with the smallest non-Abelian group, $S_3$, on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor. This phase of matter exhibits cyclic anyon fusion rules, known to underpin universality, which we evidence by trapping a single non-Abelian anyon on the torus. We encode logical qutrits in the nonlocal fusion space of non-Abelian fluxes and, by combining an entangling braiding operation with anyon charge measurements, realize a universal topological gate set and read-out, which we further demonstrate by topologically preparing a magic state. This work establishes $S_3$ TO as simple enough to be prepared efficiently, yet rich enough to enable universal topological quantum computation.

Title: MADE: Benchmark Environments for Closed-Loop Materials Discovery
Authors: Shreshth A Malik, Tiarnan Doherty, Panagiotis Tigas, Muhammed Razzak, Stephen J. Roberts, Aron Walsh, Yarin Gal
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for computational materials discovery primarily evaluate static predictive tasks or isolated computational sub-tasks. While valuable, these evaluations neglect the inherently iterative and adaptive nature of scientific discovery. We introduce MAterials Discovery Environments (MADE), a novel framework for benchmarking end-to-end autonomous materials discovery pipelines. MADE simulates closed-loop discovery campaigns in which an agent or algorithm proposes, evaluates, and refines candidate materials under a constrained oracle budget, capturing the sequential and resource-limited nature of real discovery workflows. We formalize discovery as a search for thermodynamically stable compounds relative to a given convex hull, and evaluate efficacy and efficiency via comparison to baseline algorithms. The framework is flexible; users can compose discovery agents from interchangeable components such as generative models, filters, and planners, enabling the study of arbitrary workflows ranging from fixed pipelines to fully agentic systems with tool use and adaptive decision making. We demonstrate this by conducting systematic experiments across a family of systems, enabling ablation of components in discovery pipelines, and comparison of how methods scale with system complexity.

Title: StochasticGW-GPU: rapid quasi-particle energies for molecules beyond 10000 atoms
Authors: Phillip S. Thomas, Minh Nguyen, Dimitri Bazile, Tucker Allen, Barry Y. Li, Wenfei Li, Daniel Neuhauser, Mauro Del Ben, Jack Deslippe
Abstract: $\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ is a code for computing accurate Quasi-Particle (QP) energies of molecules and material systems in the GW approximation. $\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ utilizes the stochastic Resolution of the Identity (sROI) technique to enable a massively-parallel implementation with computational costs that scale semi-linearly with system size, allowing the method to access systems with tens of thousands of electrons. We introduce a new implementation, $\mathtt{StochasticGW-GPU}$, for which the main bottleneck steps have been ported to GPUs and which gives substantial performance improvements over previous versions of the code. We showcase the new code by computing band gaps of hydrogenated silicon clusters ($\textrm{S}\textrm{i}_{\textrm{x}}\textrm{H}_{\textrm{y}}$) containing up to 10001 atoms and 35144 electrons, and we obtain individual QP energies with a statistical precision of better than $\pm0.03$ eV with times-to-solution on the order of minutes.

Title: Better without U: Impact of Selective Hubbard U Correction on Foundational MLIPs
Authors: Thomas Warford, Fabian L. Thiemann, Gábor Csányi
Abstract: The training of foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (fMLIPs) relies on diverse databases with energies and forces calculated using ab initio methods. We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems. Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets. For existing datasets, our post-hoc correction provides a low-cost improvement.

Title: Polaron-Polaritons in Subwavelength Arrays of Trapped Atoms
Authors: Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen, Lukas Wangler, David Castells-Graells, J. Ignacio Cirac, Ana Asenjo-Garcia, Daniel Malz, Cosimo C. Rusconi
Abstract: Subwavelength arrays of atoms trapped in optical lattices or tweezers are inherently susceptible to deformations: Optomechanical forces produce lattice distortions, which, in turn, modify the optical response of the array. We show that this coupling hybridizes collective atomic excitations (polaritons) with phonons, forming polaron-polaritons -- the fundamental quasiparticles governing light-matter interactions in arrays of trapped atoms. Using analytical polaron theory and numerical simulations, we show that: (1) phonons can strongly enhance the decay of subradiant states, but also enable their efficient excitation; (2) transport of dark excitations remains remarkably robust even at low trap frequencies, except when a polariton can resonantly scatter phonons; and (3) motion reduces the reflectivity of a two-dimensional atomic mirror, however, we identify mechanisms that mitigate this degradation and restore reflectivity above 99% in some cases. Our findings lay the foundation for analyzing motional effects in key applications and suggest new ways to harness them in state-of-the-art experiments.

Title: Building Holographic Entanglement by Measurement
Authors: Jonathan Jeffrey, Lucien Gandarias, Monika Schleier-Smith, Brian Swingle
Abstract: We propose a framework for preparing quantum states with a holographic entanglement structure, in the sense that the entanglement entropies are governed by minimal surfaces in a chosen bulk geometry. We refer to such entropies as holographic because they obey a relation between entropies and bulk minimal surfaces, known as the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, that is a key feature of holographic models of quantum gravity. Typically in such models, the bulk geometry is determined by solving Einstein's equations. Here, we simply choose a bulk geometry, then discretize the geometry into a coupling graph comprising bulk and boundary nodes. Evolving under this graph of interactions and measuring the bulk nodes leaves behind the desired pure state on the boundary. We numerically demonstrate that the resulting entanglement properties approximately reproduce the predictions of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in the chosen bulk geometry. We consider graphs associated with hyperbolic disk and wormhole geometries, but the approach is general. The minimal ingredients in our proposal involve only Gaussian operations and measurements and are readily implementable in photonic and cold-atom platforms.

Title: Reviving the Suspension Balance Model
Authors: Mu Wang, Tingtao Zhou, John F. Brady
Abstract: The Suspension Balance Model (SBM) [J. Fluid Mech. \textbf{275}, 157 (1994)] for two-phase flows uses the momentum balance of the particle phase as a closure for the particle flux, showing that particle migration is driven by the divergence of the particle-phase stress. The underlying basis of this model was challenged by Nott~et~al.\ [Phys. Fluids \textbf{23}, 043304 (2011)] where the authors argued that the hydrodynamic contributions to the suspension stress should not appear in the particle-phase momentum balance, being replaced by a different particle-phase stress. The particle-phase stress proposed by Nott~et~al., while mathematically correct, involves the partitioning of the (non-pairwise-additive) hydrodynamic forces, and care is needed to understand how the force on a chosen particle is affected by a second particle. We show by a simple two-particle calculation what is the proper partitioning, and show that it is consistent thermodynamically and gives the correct equilibrium osmotic pressure of Brownian colloids. Using Stokesian Dyanmics suspension rheology, we quantitatively demonstrate that the hydrodynamic contribution to the suspension stress is virtually identical to particle-phase stress; the only difference is that the isolated single-particle hydrodynamic stress contribution -- the Einstein viscosity correction -- must be removed from the suspension stress when used to predict particle flux. Our results validate a key assumption of the SBM and therefore revive its physical foundation.

Title: Accurate Thermophysical Properties of Water using Machine-Learned Potentials
Authors: Tobias Hilpert, Georg Kresse
Abstract: Simulating water from first principles remains a significant computational challenge due to the slow dynamics of the underlying system. Although machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can accelerate these simulations, they often fail to achieve the required level of accuracy for reliable uncertainty quantification. In this study, we use MACE - an equivariant graph neural network architecture that has been trained using an extensive RPBE-D3 database - to predict density isobars, diffusion constants, radial distribution functions, and melting points. Although equivariant MACE models are computationally more expensive than simpler architectures, such as kernel-based potentials (KbPs), their significantly lower total energy errors allow for reliable thermodynamic reweighting with minimal bias. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies using KbPs; however, equivariant models can be validated against the ground-truth density functional theory (DFT) ensemble, providing a critical advantage. These findings establish equivariant MLPs as robust and reliable tools for investigating the thermophysical properties of water with DFT-level accuracy.

Title: Electric birefringence in Euler-Heisenberg pseudo-electrodynamics
Authors: M. J. Neves
Abstract: The fermion sector of the pseudo-quantum electrodynamics is integrated functionally to generate a non-linear electrodynamics, that it is called Euler-Heisenberg pseudo-electrodynamics. A non-local Chern-Simons topological term is added to the original lagrangian of the pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in which a most complete electrodynamics gauge invariant in 1+2 dimensions is proposed. As consequence of the fermionic sector, we obtain a non-linear contribution in the electromagnetic fields that breaks the Lorentz symmetry due to Fermi velocity. From the Euler-Heisenberg pseudo-electrodynamics, we study the properties of the plane wave propagating in a planar medium under an uniform and constant electromagnetic background field. The properties of the planar material are discussed through the electric permittivity tensor and magnetic permeability, that are functions of the frequency, wavelength and of the background fields. The dispersion relations and the refractive index are calculated in the presence of a uniform magnetic field, and also in the case only of an electric background field. The birefringence phenomenon emerges only when the electric background field is considered.

Title: Soft Quantization: Model Compression Via Weight Coupling
Authors: Daniel T. Bernstein, Luca Di Carlo, David Schwab
Abstract: We show that introducing short-range attractive couplings between the weights of a neural network during training provides a novel avenue for model quantization. These couplings rapidly induce the discretization of a model's weight distribution, and they do so in a mixed-precision manner despite only relying on two additional hyperparameters. We demonstrate that, within an appropriate range of hyperparameters, our "soft quantization'' scheme outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10. Soft quantization provides both a new pipeline for the flexible compression of machine learning models and a new tool for investigating the trade-off between compression and generalization in high-dimensional loss landscapes.

Title: Vanishing of power-law corrections to Kubo's formula for the Hall current at incommensurate magnetic fields
Authors: Gabriele Mazzini, Domenico Monaco
Abstract: We consider a non-interacting electron gas confined to a two-dimensional crystal by the action of a perpendicular magnetic field; in the one-particle approximation, the dynamics of the system is modelled by a spectrally gapped Bloch-Landau Hamiltonian. No commensurability condition is assumed between the magnetic flux per unit cell and the quantum of magnetic flux. We construct a non-equilibrium almost-stationary state (NEASS) which "dresses" the equilibrium Fermi projection on states below the spectral gap, and models the state of the system after the addition of a weak external electric field of strength $\varepsilon \ll 1$. Having in mind applications to the integer quantum Hall effect, we probe the response of a current operator in the direction transverse to that of the applied electric field, and show that the resulting current density in the NEASS is linear in $\varepsilon$, with no power-law corrections. The linear response coefficient, namely the Hall conductivity, is computed in terms of the equilibrium Fermi projection via the double-commutator formula, in accordance with the prediction from Kubo's linear response theory. Our results generalize the methods and findings of [Lett. Math. Phys. 112 (2022), 91] to the setting of uniform magnetic fields with incommensurate magnetic flux per unit cell, and to lattice-periodic perturbation of such magnetic fields.

Title: Hybrid Barium Titanate Waveguide Designs For Efficient Nonlinear Frequency Conversion
Authors: Trevor G. Vrckovnik, D. Arslan, F. Eilenberger, Sebastian W. Schmitt
Abstract: Barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$) is emerging as a powerful integrated photonic material, combining strong $X^{(2)}$ and electro-optic nonlinearities with rapidly improving thin-film waveguide quality. Recent demonstrations of low-loss BaTiO$_3$ waveguides and high-Q resonators have established BaTiO$_3$-on-insulator as a promising platform for next-generation frequency-conversion and quantum photonic technologies. However, while BaTiO$_3$ electro-optic modulators are now well developed, nonlinear BaTiO$_3$ waveguide engineering remains comparatively immature. Techniques widely used in lithium niobate, such as periodic poling for quasi-phase-matching, are poorly suited to BaTiO$_3$ because epitaxial thin films exhibit high coercive fields, strong strain-clamping effects, multivariant domain structures, and slow, complex switching dynamics. These factors make accurate periodic poling challenging and hinder the development of efficient $X^{(2)}$ frequency converters. Here, we introduce a fabrication-robust alternative based on linear-nonlinear hybrid waveguides, where TiO$_2$ is selectively incorporated into BaTiO$_3$ ridge waveguides to enhance nonlinear mode overlap while relying solely on modal phase-matching. Using coupled-mode-theory simulations, we identify phase-matched geometries and show that the hybrid design achieves a 2.75x increase in normalized second harmonic generation efficiency over monolithic BaTiO$_3$ waveguides. The uniform, lithographically defined cross-section makes the approach highly scalable. These results position hybrid BaTiO$_3$-TiO$_2$ waveguides as a practical route to CMOS-compatible, high-efficiency $X^{(2)}$ devices for integrated quantum photonics.

Title: Optically reconfigurable canalization of exciton-polaritons in a non-hyperbolic perovskite
Authors: Jiahao Ren, Olha Bahrova, Feng Jin, Hao Zheng, Dmitry Solnyshkov, Cheng-Wei Qiu, Guillaume Malpuech, Rui Su
Abstract: The ability to steer polariton flow on-demand holds significant promise towards nanophotonic applications and photonic circuitry. Polariton canalization, exhibiting intrinsic collimation and diffractionless transport, emerges as a promising solution without guiding structures. However, earlier demonstrations have been restricted to certain crystal surfaces with intrinsic hyperbolic responses and operated in the linear regime. Here, we experimentally demonstrate canalization of nonlinear exciton polariton condensates with optical reconfigurability in a birefringent CsPbBr3 perovskite crystal without intrinsic hyperbolic response. By embedding the birefringent perovskite crystal into a planar microcavity, the interplay between cavity transverse-electric-transverse-magnetic splitting and crystalline birefringence produces an anisotropic band geometry with a hyperbolic-flat-parabolic evolution of polaritonic isofrequency contours (IFCs). Nonresonant pumping drives exciton polariton condensation onto flat far-field contours with nonlinear emission amplification, leading to coherent canalized flows with over twentyfold collimation with respect to arc-shaped contours. Reconfiguring the optical pumping-spot size allows switching the nonlinear polariton condensates into hyperbolic and parabolic IFC regimes, leading to divergent propagation behaviour with collimating reconfiguration. Our study reveals a distinct canalization framework for shaping the nonlinear exciton-polariton condensate flows, opening opportunities for all-optical polaritonic logic circuits based on stabilized nonlinear quantum interconnects.

Title: More Bang for the Buck: Improving the Inference of Large Language Models at a Fixed Budget using Reset and Discard (ReD)
Authors: Sagi Meir, Tommer D. Keidar, Noam Levi, Shlomi Reuveni, Barak Hirshberg
Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.

Title: Non-secular polariton leakage and dark-state protection in hybrid plasmonic cavities
Authors: Marco Vallone
Abstract: A major issue in exploiting plasmonic cavities as key components in nanotechnology is the effect of radiative and absorption losses on their electrodynamic behavior. Treating them as open-systems, we derive a time-local, completely positive master equation that retains non-secular interference between decay pathways and reduces to the standard secular description when the environment resolves polariton splitting. When it does not, the theory predicts order-one deviations from secular leakage dynamics, including bath-induced coherences and stabilization of dark polaritons, and provides a simple design criterion based on the ratio of polariton splitting to reservoir linewidth. A time-resolved leakage measurement, such as transmission, reflectivity, or photoluminescence, can be used to observe these effects.

Title: Holographic Entanglement Propagation Through Wormholes
Authors: Kazuki Doi, Liang Li, Ung Nguyen, Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We study how energy and quantum entanglement are transferred when two identical CFTs are entangled locally. This is probed by considering a local operator insertion in one of the CFTs. When the CFTs have holographic duals via the AdS/CFT correspondence, the transfer happens through an AdS wormhole that allows signal propagation even beyond the horizon from one AdS boundary to the other; we demonstrate this in explicit CFT calculations. We argue that this transmission is possible because the insertion of a local operator is not a unitary process but a regularized version of projection measurement, and that this is interpreted as quantum teleportation. We also find that this leads to a phenomenon opposite to scrambling, where mutual information, instead of being suppressed, gets enhanced by the insertion of a local operator excitation.

Title: Third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon from first-principles calculations
Authors: Robert Hellmann, Giovanni Garberoglio
Abstract: The third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon were determined at temperatures between 10 and 5000 K from first principles employing the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach. For these calculations, we used the pair potential of Hellmann $\textit{et al.}$ [J. Chem. Phys. 154, 164304 (2021)], which is based on supermolecular $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with basis sets of up to octuple-zeta quality and levels of theory up to coupled cluster with single, double, triple, quadruple, and perturbative pentuple excitations [CCSDTQ(P)]. The potential also accounts for relativistic, retardation, and post-Born$-$Oppenheimer effects and is provided with reliable uncertainty estimates. To incorporate nonadditive interactions, we developed a nonadditive three-body potential based on extensive supermolecular CCSD(T), CCSDT, and CCSDT(Q) calculations with basis sets of up to sextuple-zeta quality. This potential also accounts for relativistic effects. The very small nonadditive four-body contributions to the fourth virial coefficients were considered using a relatively simple nonadditive four-body potential based on supermolecular CCSD(T) calculations. We calculated the third and fourth density and third acoustic virial coefficients directly by PIMC and the fourth acoustic virial coefficient indirectly using thermodynamic relations between the density and acoustic virial coefficients. The uncertainties of the pair potential and those estimated for our nonadditive three-body potential were rigorously propagated in the PIMC calculations into uncertainties for the virial coefficients. These uncertainties are distinctly smaller than those of almost all of the corresponding experimental virial coefficient data.

Title: Defect Relative Entropy
Authors: Mostafa Ghasemi
Abstract: We introduce the concept of \textit{defect relative entropy} as a measure of distinguishability within the space of defects. We compute the defect relative entropy for conformal/topological defects, deriving a universal formula in conformal field theories (CFTs) on a circle. This formula reduces to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the defect relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific topological defect choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the \textit{ defect sandwiched Rényi relative entropy} and the \textit{defect fidelity}. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{k}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero defect relative entropy between reduced density matrices associated with certain topological defect. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{defect relative sector}, representing the set of topological defects with zero defect relative entropy.

Title: Rapid high-temperature initialisation and readout of spins in silicon with 10 THz photons
Authors: Aidan G. McConnell, Nils Dessmann, Wojciech Adamczyk, Benedict N. Murdin, Lorenzo Amato, Nikolay V. Abrosimov, Sergey G. Pavlov, Gabriel Aeppli, Guy Matmon
Abstract: Each cycle of a quantum computation requires a quantum state initialisation. For semiconductor-based quantum platforms, initialisation is typically performed via slow microwave processes and usually requires cooling to temperatures where only the lowest quantum level is occupied. In silicon, boron atoms are the most common impurities. They bind holes in orbitals including an effective spin-3/2 ground state as well as excited states analogous to the Rydberg series for hydrogen. Here we show that initialisation temperature demands may be relaxed and speeds increased over a thousand-fold by importing, from atomic physics, the procedure of optical pumping via excited orbital states to preferentially occupy a target ground state spin. Spin relaxation within the orbital ground state of unstrained silicon is too fast to measure for conventional pulsed microwave technology, except at temperatures below 2 K, implying a need not only for fast state preparation but also fast state readout. Circularly polarised ~10 THz photon pulses from a free electron laser meet both needs at temperatures above 3 K: a 9 ps pulse enhances the population of one spin eigenstate for the "1s"-like ground state orbital, and the second interrogates this imbalance in spin population. Using parameters given by our data, we calculate that it should be possible to initialise 99% of spins for boron in strained silicon within 250 ps at 3 K. The speedup of both state preparation and measurement gained for THz rather than microwave photons should be explored for the many other solid state quantum systems hosting THz excitations potentially useful as intermediate states.

Title: Dependence of Equilibrium Propagation Training Success on Network Architecture
Authors: Qingshan Wang, Clara C. Wanjura, Florian Marquardt
Abstract: The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.

Title: Molecular structure, binding, and disorder in TDBC-Ag plexcitonic assemblies
Authors: J. Baños-Gutiérrez, R. Bercy, Y. García Jomaso, S. Balci, G. Pirruccio, J. Halldin Stenlid, M.J. Llansola-Portoles, D. Finkelstein-Shapiro
Abstract: Plexcitonic assemblies are hybrid materials composed of a plasmonic nanoparticle and molecular or semiconducting emitters whose electronic transitions are strongly coupled to the plasmonic mode. This coupling hybridizes the system modes into upper and lower polariton branches. The strength of the interaction depends on the number of emitters and on their orientation and spatial arrangement relative to the metallic surface. These structural factors have profound consequences for the ensuing photoexcited dynamics. Despite the extensive spectroscopic work on plexcitonic systems, direct understanding of the molecular geometry at the metal interface remains limited. In this work, we present a comprehensive structural characterization of one of the most widely studied plexcitons formed by the cyanine dye 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1'-diethyl-3,3'-di(4-sulfobutyl)-benzimidazolocarbocyanine (TDBC) and silver nanoprisms using a combination of NMR, THz-Raman spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. By comparing the signals from the monomeric and aggregated forms of TDBC with that of the plexciton, we identify shared spectral fingerprints that reveal how molecular packing is modified when the aggregate adsorbs on the silver surface. We observe Raman modes specific to plexciton systems, and identify NOESY cross-peaks in the aliphatic region, that along with THz-Raman modes in the 10-400 cm$^{-1}$ region are sensitive indicators of aggregation geometry and adsorption. We find that isolated TDBC monomers adopt an asymmetric conformation in which both sulfobutyl chains lie on the same side of the chromophore, while J-aggregates adopt a symmetric up-down alternation of the chains from molecule to molecule. This work establishes the molecular geometry of a prototypical TDBC-silver plexciton, providing a structural benchmark for understanding geometry-dependent photophysics in hybrid exciton-plasmon systems.

Title: Designing quantum technologies with a quantum computer
Authors: Juan Naranjo, Thi Ha Kyaw, Gaurav Saxena, Kevin Ferreira, Jack S. Baker
Abstract: Interacting spin systems in solids underpin a wide range of quantum technologies, from quantum sensors and single-photon sources to spin-defect-based quantum registers and processors. We develop a quantum-computer-aided framework for simulating such devices using a general electron spin resonance Hamiltonian incorporating zero-field splitting, the Zeeman effect, hyperfine interactions, dipole-dipole spin-spin terms, and electron-phonon decoherence. Within this model, we combine Gray-encoded qudit-to-qubit mappings, qubit-wise commuting aggregation, and a multi-reference selected quantum Krylov fast-forwarding (sQKFF) hybrid algorithm to access long-time dynamics while remaining compatible with NISQ and early fault-tolerant hardware constraints. Numerical simulations demonstrate the computation of autocorrelation functions up to $\sim100$ ns, together with microwave absorption spectra and the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence, achieving 18-30$\%$ reductions in gate counts and circuit depth for Trotterized time-evolution circuits compared to unoptimized implementations. Using the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond as a testbed, we benchmark the framework against classical simulations and identify the reference-state selection in sQKFF as the primary factor governing accuracy at fixed hardware cost. This methodology provides a flexible blueprint for using quantum computers to design, compare, and optimize solid-state spin-qubit technologies under experimentally realistic conditions.

Title: Quantum fluctuations in hydrodynamics and quantum long-time tails
Authors: Akash Jain
Abstract: We construct a quantum Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective field theory for the diffusive hydrodynamics of a conserved scalar field. Quantum corrections within the SK framework are guided by fluctuation-dissipation relations, enforced via a dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry. We find that the KMS symmetry necessarily generates fluctuation contributions in the SK effective action at all orders in the noise field, thereby giving rise to intrinsically non-Gaussian noise. We use our results to compute one-loop quantum corrections to the two-point density-density retarded correlation function, leading to a quantum generalization of hydrodynamic long-time tails. Our results apply at arbitrarily high orders in $\hbar$. The one-loop results for retarded correlation functions have been expressed in terms of a family of polynomials. We also provide a closed-form expression for the one-loop results at leading order in the wavevector expansion.

Title: Potential of monolayer charge
Authors: Heigo Ers, Ritums Cepitis, Vladislav B. Ivaništšev
Abstract: In this letter, we develop the concept of the potential of monolayer charge (PMC). Its main purpose is to serve as the fundamental reference potential for studying charged interfaces. We estimate PMC values for interfaces between Au(111) surface and frisbee-shaped ions. Density functional theory calculations suggest that increasing ion area shifts the PMC to an experimentally measurable potential range. To guide experimental verification, we have derived an analytical expression, which relates ion area, surface--ion distance, ionic charge, and the corresponding PMC value. Further exploration of the PMC can enrich interfacial electrochemistry and reveal interfacial electrophysics as an independent field.

Title: Impurity screening by defects in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical systems
Authors: Ying-Hai Wu, Yueshui Zhang, Hong-Hao Tu, Meng Cheng
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism of impurity screening in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical states described by conformal field theories (CFTs). An impurity can be screened if it has the same quantum numbers as some gapless degrees of freedom of the CFT. The common source of these degrees of freedom is the chiral primary fields of the CFT, but we uncover that topological defect lines of the CFT may also take this role. Theoretical analysis relies on the insight that the impurities can be interpreted as edge modes of certain symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. By stacking a SPT state with a CFT, one or two interfaces on which the SPT edge modes reside are created. If screening occurs due to topological defect lines, a symmetry-enriched CFT with exotic boundary states are obtained. The boundary conditions that appear in these cases are difficult to achieve using previously known methods. As a concrete example, we consider a spin-1 chain whose bulk is described by the SU(3)$_{1}$ CFT and edges are coupled to spin-1/2 impurities. We demonstrate that both the low-energy eigenstates and the extracted Affleck-Ludwig entropy are in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions.

Title: A universal black-box quantum Monte Carlo approach to quantum phase transitions
Authors: Nic Ezzell, Lev Barash, Itay Hen
Abstract: We derive exact, universal, closed-form quantum Monte Carlo estimators for finite-temperature energy susceptibility and fidelity susceptibility, applicable to essentially arbitrary Hamiltonians. Combined with recent advancements in Monte Carlo, our approach enables a black-box framework for studying quantum phase transitions--without requiring prior knowledge of an order parameter or the manual design of model-specific ergodic quantum Monte Carlo update rules. We demonstrate the utility of our method by applying a single implementation to the transverse-field Ising model, the XXZ model, and an ensemble of models related by random unitaries.

Title: Non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states at filling factor 3/4
Authors: Kai-Wen Huang, Ying-Hai Wu
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states have been observed at filling factor $\nu=3/4$ in GaAs hole system and bilayer graphene. In theoretical bootstrap analysis, it was revealed that non-Abelian topological orders with Ising anyons can be realized at $\nu=3/4$, which exhibit $12$ fold ground state degeneracy on the torus. The properties of $\nu=3/4$ states can be analyzed using two complementary approaches. In the first one, they are treated as particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=1/4$ Moore-Read types states. In the second one, they are mapped to composite fermions with reverse flux attachment at effective filling factor $3/2$, whose integral part realizes an integer quantum Hall state and the fractional part realizes $\nu=1/2$ Moore-Read type states. For bilayer graphene with appropriate Landau level mixing, numerical calculations found $12$ quasi-degenerate ground states on the torus at $\nu=3/4$. Chiral graviton spectral functions of these states have one low energy peak with negative chirality and one high energy peak with positive chirality. This points to a specific member of the Moore-Read type states and agrees with the deduction based on daughter states.

Title: Interaction potentials for mutually induced dipoles in uniform fields
Authors: Lucas H. P. Cunha
Abstract: Dipolar interactions govern the structure and dynamics of many soft-matter systems, from molecular to colloids assemblies. When dipole moments are induced by an external field, mutual interactions lead to a many-body magnetization response that cannot be described by fixed-dipole models. Here, we derive the interaction potential for a system of mutually interacting induced dipoles in a uniform external field using a force-based approach. By accounting for the displacement-induced variation of the dipole moments, we obtain an interaction potential consisting of the classical dipole-dipole term supplemented by two- and three-body corrections arising from mutual induction. Comparisons with simplified models that neglect mutual magnetization reveal significant errors in the interaction potential, particularly in anisotropic particle assemblies. We also discuss an efficient $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ iterative scheme for computing the mutual magnetization, enabling accurate simulations of large dipolar systems.

Title: A Multi-agent Framework for Physical Laws Discovery
Authors: Bo Hu, Siyu Liu, Beilin Ye, Yun Hao, Yanhui Liu, Yang Lu, Ju Li, David J. Srolovitz, Tongqi Wen
Abstract: Discovering explicit physical laws has traditionally depended on human intuition and domain expertise. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), offer a new route to accelerate this process by automating key steps from hypothesis generation to interpretable model construction. Here we develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework for physical-law discovery that integrates literature-guided variable selection, hypothesis formulation, symbolic regression, formula derivation, and mechanistic explanation. We validate the framework on three representative materials problems: the glass-forming ability (GFA) of metallic glasses, the Vickers hardness of compounds, and the Young's modulus of multi-component alloys. Using physically and chemically meaningful descriptors as inputs, the discovered formulas achieve strong agreement with reference data, with correlation coefficients up to 0.94 (GFA), 0.86 (hardness), and 0.94 (Young's modulus), while remaining compact and interpretable. Beyond fitting, the Young's modulus formula generalizes to quaternary and quinary alloys, improving prediction accuracy by up to 78.8% relative to the classical rule of mixtures. By integrating cross-disciplinary knowledge, reflection mechanisms, and expert-like reasoning ability into symbolic regression, our AI-centric framework offers a robust and extensible platform for automated physical laws discovery, demonstrating that AI can increasingly serve as an essential role in modern scientific research by thinking and acting like field experts.

Title: Revealing Higher-Order Topological Bulk-boundary Correspondence in Bismuth Crystal with Spin-helical Hinge State Loop and Proximity Superconductivity
Authors: D.M.Zhao, Y. Zhong, T. Yuan, H.T. Wang, T.X. Jiang, Y. Qi, H.J. Xiang, X.G. Gong, D.L. Feng, T. Zhang
Abstract: Topological materials are typically characterized by gapless boundary states originated from nontrivial bulk band topology, known as topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Recently, this fundamental concept has been generalized in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs). E.g., a second-order three-dimensional (3D) TI hosts one-dimensional (1D) topological hinge states winding around the crystal. However, a complete verification of higher-order topology is still lacking as it requires probing all the crystal boundaries. Here we studied a promising candidate of second-order TI, bismuth (Bi), in the form of mesoscopic crystals grown on superconducting V3Si. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we directly observed dispersive 1D states on various hinges of the crystal. Upon introducing magnetic scatterers, new scattering channels emerged selectively on certain hinges, revealing their spin-helical nature. Combining first-principle calculation and global symmetry analysis, we find these hinge states are topological and formed a closed loop encircling the crystal. This provides direct evidence on the higher-order topology in Bi. Moreover, proximity superconductivity is observed in the topological hinge states, enabling HOTI as a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana quasiparticles.

Title: Real-Space Switching of Local Moments Driven by Quantum Geometry in Correlated Graphene Heterostructures
Authors: Niklas Witt, Siheon Ryee, Lennart Klebl, Jennifer Cano, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Tim O. Wehling
Abstract: Graphene-based multilayer systems serve as versatile platforms for exploring the interplay between electron correlation and topology, thanks to distinctive low-energy bands marked by significant quantum metric and Berry curvature from graphene's Dirac bands. Here, we investigate Mott physics and local spin moments in Dirac bands hybridized with a flat band of localized orbitals in functionalized graphene. Via hybridization control, a topological transition is realized between two symmetry-distinct site-selective Mott states featuring local moments in different Wyckoff positions, with a geometrically enforced metallic state emerging in between. We find that this geometrically controlled real-space switching of local moments and associated metal-insulator physics may be realized through proximity coupling of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with group IV intercalants, where the Mott state faces geometrical obstruction in the large-hybridization limit. Our work shows that chemically functionalized graphene provides a correlated electron platform, very similar to the topological heavy fermions in graphene moiré systems but at significantly enhanced characteristic energy scales.

Title: Anomalous lattice anharmonicity and spin-lattice coupling in spin orbit coupled halide K2IrBr6

Sen (1) ((1) Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi, India (2) Institute of Condensed Matter Physics, Technische Universität Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany (3) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi, India)
Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions, magnetism, and spin-orbit coupling in 5d transition-metal halides offers a fertile platform for exploring correlated spin-lattice dynamics. Here, we investigate the impact of structural symmetry breaking on lattice vibrations and local spin environments in the antifluorite compound K2IrBr6 using temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. K2IrBr6 undergoes successive cubic-to-tetragonal and tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transitions at 170 K and 122 K, respectively, driven by cooperative distortions of the IrBr6 octahedra. Raman spectroscopy reveals anomalous phonon linewidth broadening and unconventional temperature dependence of phonon energies near these transitions, indicating that dynamic spin-phonon coupling is significant well above the Neel temperature (16 K). First-principles phonon calculations support the mode assignments and demonstrate that symmetry-lowering distortions significantly renormalize vibrational modes, consistent with the experimental observations. Complementary EPR measurements detect anisotropic g-factors, resonance field shifts, and linewidth narrowing across the structural transitions, reflecting the emergence of static spin-lattice correlations mediated by spin-orbit entanglement. These findings establish K2IrBr6 as a model system where halide ligand fields, octahedral distortions, and SOC collaboratively govern spin-lattice coupling, providing chemical pathways to engineer quantum materials with tunable magnetic and lattice responses.

Title: Quantum Geometric Helical Superconductivity
Authors: Aaron Dunbrack, Pauli Virtanen, Tero T. Heikkilä
Abstract: Several physical phenomena in superconductors, such as helical superconductivity and the diode effect, rely on breaking time-reversal symmetry. This symmetry-breaking is usually accounted for via the Lifshitz invariant, a contribution to the free energy which is linear in the phase gradient of the order parameter. In dispersive single-band superconductors with conventional pairing, the Lifshitz invariant can be computed from the asymmetries of the spectrum near the Fermi surface. We show that in multi-band superconductors, the quantum geometry also contributes to the Lifshitz invariant, and this is the dominant contribution when the low-energy bands are flat. We also analogously demonstrate quantum-geometry-driven commensurate-incommensurate transitions in charge and pair density waves.

Title: Observation of dislocation bound states and skin effects in non-Hermitian Chern insulators
Authors: Jia-Xin Zhong, Bitan Roy, Yun Jing
Abstract: The confluence of non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding an edge dislocations-antidislocation pair in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. We experimentally identify the emergence of bulk exceptional points (EPs) via spectral coalescence and phase rigidity analysis. We demonstrate that the NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states driven by these EPs under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings, therefore, pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.

Title: Advanced measurement techniques in quantum Monte Carlo: The permutation matrix representation approach
Authors: Nic Ezzell, Itay Hen
Abstract: In a typical finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, estimators for simple static observables such as specific heat and magnetization are known. With a great deal of system-specific manual labor, one can sometimes also derive more complicated non-local or even dynamic observable estimators. Within the permutation matrix representation (PMR) flavor of QMC, however, we show that one can derive formal estimators for arbitrary static observables. We also derive exact, explicit estimators for general imaginary-time correlation functions and non-trivial integrated susceptibilities thereof. We demonstrate the practical versatility of our method by estimating various non-local, random observables for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.

Title: Soft-X-ray momentum microscopy of nonlinear magnon interactions below 100-nm wavelength
Authors: Steffen Wittrock, Christopher Klose, Salvatore Perna, Korbinian Baumgaertl, Andrea Mucchietto, Michael Schneider, Josefin Fuchs, Victor Deinhart, Tamer Karaman, Dirk Grundler, Stefan Eisebitt, Bastian Pfau, Daniel Schick
Abstract: Magnons are quantised collective excitations of long-range ordered spins. At nanometre wavelengths, exchange interactions increasingly govern their dynamics, giving rise to a largely unexplored regime of couplings between magnons and other quasiparticles. Yet, detecting such short-wavelength spin waves has remained a key experimental challenge. Here, we introduce Magnon Momentum Microscopy (MMM) -- a quasi-elastic, resonant magnetic soft-X-ray scattering technique that directly images magnon populations across two-dimensional momentum space. Owing to its remarkable sensitivity, MMM can capture nonlinear magnon--magnon interactions over large regions of the dispersion plane. Applying MMM to the prototypical magnonic material yttrium iron garnet (YIG), we uncover a rich variety of previously unobserved nonlinear magnon interactions. With its element specificity, bulk sensitivity, as well as intrinsic access to nanometre-scale wavelengths without frequency limitation, soft-X-ray MMM establishes a powerful and versatile platform for exploring short-wavelength and nonlinear magnonics.

Title: A Unified Framework for the Non-Hermitian Localization: Boundary-Insensitive Modes and Electric-Magnetic Analogy
Authors: Zheng Wei, Ji-Yao Fan, Kui Cao, Xin-Ran Ma, Cui-Xian Guo, Xue-Ping Ren, Su-Peng Kou
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is fundamentally characterized by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, reflected in changes to the energy spectrum and boundary-localized eigenstates. Here, we demonstrate that a spatially inhomogeneous imaginary scalar potential field induces a skin effect that is insensitive to boundary conditions. Both the spectrum and eigenstate distribution remain invariant, a behavior not captured by existing theories. We attribute this anomaly to translational symmetry breaking induced by spatially varying imaginary potentials in finite systems. We further formulate a theory that universally predicts localization in single-particle non-Hermitian systems. This framework classifies skin effects into two fundamental types: electric, driven by imaginary scalar potentials, and magnetic, driven by imaginary vector potentials, and reveals a phase transition between them, where eigenstates become fully delocalized. Our work provides a unified theory for non-Hermitian localization, allowing full control over skin modes via potential engineering in various platforms like photonic crystals and cold-atom systems.

Title: Gaplessness from disorder and quantum geometry in gapped superconductors
Authors: Omri Lesser, Sagnik Banerjee, Xuepeng Wang, Jaewon Kim, Ehud Altman, Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: It is well known that disorder can induce low-energy Andreev bound states in a sign-changing, but fully gapped, superconductor at $\pi-$junctions. Generically, these excitations are localized. Starting from a superconductor with a sign-changing and nodeless order parameter in the clean limit, here we demonstrate a mechanism for increasing the localization length associated with the low-energy Andreev bound states at a fixed disorder strength. We find that the Fubini-Study metric associated with the electronic Bloch wavefunctions controls the localization length and the hybridization between bound states localized at distinct $\pi-$junctions. We present results for the inverse participation ratio, superfluid stiffness, site-resolved and disorder-averaged spectral functions as a function of increasing Fubini-Study metric, which indicate an increased tendency towards delocalization. The low-energy properties resemble those of a dirty nodal superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov excitations. We place these results in the context of recent experiments in moire graphene superconductors.

Title: Chern insulators in two and three dimensions: A global perspective
Authors: Jason G. Kattan, J. E. Sipe
Abstract: We introduce a second-quantized field theory for Chern insulators in which the Hamiltonian features a static vector potential that has the periodicity of the crystal's lattice and spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry in the system's ground state. Such a vector potential generates a magnetic field at the microscopic level that may be thought of as arising from local moments associated with one or more magnetic ions in each unit cell. Considering spinor electrons, we study the Chern invariants characterizing the topology of the occupied valence bands of Chern insulators in both two and three dimensions - the Chern number and the Chern vector, respectively - and we derive novel expressions for these topological invariants that are globally defined across the Brillouin zone and involve the full band structure of the system. We also study the long-wavelength response of a Chern insulator to electromagnetic fields at finite frequency, generalizing the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the static limit to the optical regime.

Title: An ac strain-based thermodynamic criterion for vortex lattice in type-II superconductors
Authors: Peipei Lu, Mengju Yuan, Jing Zhang, Qiang Gao, Shuang Liu, Yugang Zhang, Shipeng Shen, Long Zhang, Jun Lu, Xiaoyuan Zhou, Mingquan He, Aifeng Wang, Yang Li, Wenshan Hong, Shiliang Li, Huiqian Luo, Xingjiang Zhou, Xianhui Chen, Young Sun, Yisheng Chai
Abstract: In type-I superconductors, zero electrical resistivity and perfect diamagnetism define two fundamental criteria for superconducting behavior. In contrast, type-II superconductors exhibit more complex mixed state physics, where magnetic flux penetrates the material above the lower critical field Hc1 in the form of quantized vortices, each carrying a single flux quantum. These vortices form a two dimensional lattice which persists up to another irreversible field (Hirr) and then melts into a dissipative liquid phase. The vortex lattice is fundamental to the magnetic and electrical properties of type II superconductors, ac strain susceptibility-a thermodynamic criterion-for identifying this phase has remained elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a dynamic magnetostrictive effect, wherein the geometry of the superconductor oscillates only under an applied alternating magnetic field due to the disturbance of the vortex lattice. This effect is detected by a thin piezoelectric transducer, which converts the excited geometric deformation into an in-phase ac voltage. Notably, we find a direct and nearly linear relationship between the signal amplitude and the vortex density in lattice across several representative type-II superconductors. In the vortex liquid phase above Hirr, the signal amplitude rapidly decays to zero near the upper critical field (Hc2), accompanied by a pronounced out-of-phase component due to enhanced dissipation. This dynamic magnetostrictive effect not only reveals an unexplored magnetoelastic property of the vortex lattice but also establishes a fundamental criterion for identifying the type-II superconductors.

Title: Solitonic Andreev spin qubits from Andreev states in Corbino Josephson junctions
Authors: Pablo San-Jose, Elsa Prada
Abstract: We study a novel type of solitonic Andreev bound state (ABS) in a Corbino-geometry Josephson junction created on a 2DEG. The Josephson junction is subjected to a weak magnetic flux that induces a fluxoid mismatch between the inner disk and outer ring superconductors. The mismatch produces a Josephson vortex (phase soliton) that binds unconventional spinful but chargeless ABSs, analogous to Jackiw-Rebbi solitonic states. The position around the Josephson junction of the trapped ABSs can be controlled externally by a junction phase bias. As the solitonic ABSs are shuttled around the Josephson junction, the 2DEG spin-orbit coupling induces a geometric precession of their spin. We argue that these solitonic ABSs constitute a natural candidate for a novel type of superconducting Andreev spin qubit, dubbed solitonic Andreev spin qubit (SASQ), that combines features of Andreev spin qubits and geometric spin qubits. Holonomic single-qubit SASQ operations are induced through soliton shuttling, with the resulting SU(2) trajectories densely covering the qubit Bloch sphere. Effects of disorder, non-holonomic SASQ dynamics and other aspects of qubit operation are also analyzed.

Title: Odd-even parity dependent transport in an annular Kitaev chain
Authors: Wei Wang, Zhen-Gang Zhu, Gang Su
Abstract: We investigate the impact of magnetic flux and the odd-even parity of lattice points $N$ on electron transport in an annular Kitaev chain, with an explanation provided from the energy band perspective. Three transport mechanisms including direct transmission (DT), local Andreev reflection (LAR) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) are considered. In particular, the connection configuration of electrodes to different lattice sites is studied, where the case that the two electrodes connected to the sites are aligned along a diameter is called as symmetric connection and otherwise as asymmetric connections. For even $N$ and asymmetric connection, the vanished LAR and CAR in symmetric connection will emerge as peaks. A more prominent observation is that the symmetry of the two resonant peaks due to DT processes located at $\Phi = N\pi/3$ and $\Phi = 2N\pi/3$ for symmetric connection will be broken, and the peak at $\Phi = N\pi/3$ will be largely reduced, where $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux. Moreover, the peaks around $\Phi = N\pi/3$ due to LAR and CAR processes grows drastically even larger than that from DT. For LAR and CAR processes, there is no peak around $\Phi = 2N\pi/3$ and transmission due to these two processes are completely suppressed for $\Phi>N\pi/2$. Moreover, it is found that the energy bands vary with $\Phi$ in a period of $N\pi$ and $2N\pi$ for even or odd $N$. We finally systematically analyze the influence of weak disorder on transport and demonstrate that these parity-dependent effects are robust in the presence of disorder. These behaviors reflect a complicated competition from DT, LAR and CAR processes and the parity of the lattice number in the Kitaev ring, which will be interested for the quantum device based on Kitaev chain.

Title: Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov States and Topological Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Altermagnets: an Analytical Study
Authors: Zhao Liu, Hui Hu, Xia-ji Liu
Abstract: We present an analytical study of the ground-state phase diagram for dilute two-dimensional spin-1/2 Fermi gases exhibiting $d$-wave altermagnetic spin splitting under $s$-wave pairing. Within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field framework, four distinct phases are identified: a Bardeen-Schrieffer-Cooper-type superfluid, a normal metallic phase, a nodal superfluid with topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (TBFSs), and Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states with finite center-of-mass momentum. Among these, the FFLO states and TBFSs exemplify two unconventional forms of superconductivity. Considering the simplicity of this model, with only one band, zero net magnetization, and $s$-wave paring, the emergence of both unconventional phases underscores the pivotal role of altermagnetic spin splitting in enabling exotic pairing phenomena. This analytical study not only offers a valuable benchmark for future numerical simulations, but also provides a concrete experimental roadmap for realizing FFLO states and TBFSs in altermagnets.

Title: Local magnetic structure in fully and partially ordered V$_2$$X$Al Heusler alloys ($X$=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)
Authors: Zhenyang Xie, Jitong Song, Yuntao Wu, Yuanji Xu, Fuyang Tian
Abstract: Multicomponent Heusler alloys exhibit various magnetic properties arising from their diverse atomic compositions and crystal structures. Identifying the general physical principles that govern these behaviors is essential for advancing their potential in spintronic applications. In this work, we combine density functional theory with atomistic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the magnetic ground states, finite-temperature magnetic transitions, and electronic structures of fully-ordered $L2_1$-, $XA$-type, and partially-ordered V$_2X$Al ($X=$ Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) Heusler alloys. We propose the concept of magnetic motifs, defined as V-$X$-V triangular pathway connected by the nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange interactions $J_{\mathrm{V-}X}$. Within this framework, the magnetic ground states and transition temperatures across the V$_2X$Al family can be consistently understood. The magnetic order is primarily governed by the NN $J_{\mathrm{V-}X}$ interactions in the triangular motifs, while the transition temperatures are additionally influenced by $J_{X-X}$ couplings. Furthermore, the magnetic motifs are still proven to be effective in our calculations on partially-ordered V$_2$$X$Al alloys from $L2_1$ to $XA$-type structures. Our results suggest that the concept of magnetic motifs provides a unifying principle for understanding magnetic ordering in V-based Heusler alloys and could serve as a candidate guide for exploring magnetism and designing advanced spintronic materials in a broader class of Heusler systems.

Title: Shape-specific fluctuations of an active colloidal interface
Authors: Arvin Subramaniam, Tirthankar Banerjee, Rajesh Singh
Abstract: Motivated by a recently synthesizable class of active interfaces formed by linked self--propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto--translational coupling. We enumerate all steady--state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic ''C--shaped'' topology, along with persistent self--propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family--Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.5$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super--ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.7$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady--state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings point towards a unique non--equilibrium universality class associated with self--propelled interfaces of non--standard shape.

Title: Radial Rashba spin-orbit fields in commensurate twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers
Authors: Thomas Naimer, Paulo E. Faria Junior, Klaus Zollner, Jaroslav Fabian
Abstract: In commensurate twisted homobilayers, purely radial Rashba spin-orbit fields can emerge. We employ first-principles calculations to investigate the band structures and the spin-orbit fields close to the high-symmetry points $K$ and $\Gamma$ of several commensurate twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers: WSe$_2$, NbSe$_2$, and WTe$_2$. The observed in-plane spin textures are mostly radial, and the main features are successfully reproduced using a model Hamiltonian based on two effective mass models including spin-orbit coupling, and a general (spin-conserving) interlayer coupling. Extracting the model Hamiltonian parameters through fitting of several twisted supercells, we find a twist angle dependency of the magnitude of the radial Rashba field, which is symmetric not only around the untwisted cases ($\Theta=0^\circ$ and $\Theta=60^\circ$), but also around $\Theta=30^\circ$. Furthermore, we observe that the interlayer coupling between the $K/K'$-points of the two layers decreases with the increase of the size of the commensurate supercells. Hence, peaks of high interlayer coupling can occur only for twist angles, where small commensurate supercells are possible. Exploring different lateral displacements between the layers, we confirm that the relevant symmetry protecting the radial Rashba is an in-plane 180$^\circ$ rotation axis. We additionally investigate the effects of atomic relaxation and modulation of the interlayer distance. Our calculations on WTe$_2$ bilayers show that their lack of $C_3$ symmetry results in spin textures that are neither radial nor tangential. Our results offer fundamental microscopic insights that are particularly relevant to engineering spin-charge conversion schemes based on twisted layered materials.

Title: Interacting-cluster spin liquids with robust flat bands evolving into higher-rank half-moon phases and topological Lifshitz transitions
Authors: Naïmo Davier, Ludovic D.C. Jaubert
Abstract: Classical spin liquids are disordered magnetic phases, governed by local constraints that often give rise to flat-band ground states. When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface can be interpreted as an effective Fermi surface in the spectrum of the parent system, acting as a tunable energy selector despite the absence of particle filling. This effective Fermi surface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.

Title: Living Droplets with Mesoscale Swimmers
Authors: L. Malik, N. Sharadhi, M. Lamminmäki, R. A. Lara, V. Jokinen, M. Backholm
Abstract: We study the activity of "living" droplets, which confine 1-6 mesoswimmers in 3D using a superhydrophobic substrate. The swimmers induce oscillations of the droplets at their inherent resonant frequencies, regardless of swimmer size and number. In contrast, the droplet oscillation amplitude is strongly affected by crowding, which we successfully model with a new scaling law and show that crowding reduces the speed of the swimmers. These fundamental living matter physics results reveal mechanisms for bio-inspired droplet actuation with implications for mesoscale robotics, fluidics, and sensing.

Title: Aging in the Flow Dynamics of Dense Suspensions of Contactless Microparticles
Authors: Jesús Fernández, Loïc Vanel, Antoine Bérut
Abstract: This study demonstrates that the free-surface flow dynamics of dense piles of contactless silica microparticles depend on the resting period prior to flow. Microfluidic rotating drum experiments reveal that longer resting times lead to delayed flow onsets and reduced flow velocities, both evolving logarithmically with the resting time. These aging-like effects are more pronounced for thermally driven creep flows in piles with initial tilting angle below the athermal angle of repose, in contrast to piles initially tilted above this repose angle, where gravity-driven flows tend to gradually erase aging effects. Moreover, we show that the packing fraction does not change during the resting period, and that aging occurs in both monodisperse and polydisperse piles, indicating that crystallization is not required for the time-dependent behavior to appear. Remarkably, vigorous agitation that re-disperses the particles fully restores the piles to their initial state, demonstrating that the observed effects are not due to sample degradation. These findings evidence a form of aging in quiescent suspensions intermediate between colloidal and granular media, where thermal fluctuations, still significant relative to particle weight, progressively stabilize the system, making it more resistant to flow and deformation.

Title: Phase-Rotated Altermagnets as Chern Valves for Topological Transport
Authors: Carlos Caro, Francisco Gamez
Abstract: Motivated by the emerging control of Berry-curvature textures in altermagnets, we explore a two-terminal configuration where a topological-insulator film is interfaced with two altermagnetic electrodes whose crystalline phases can be rotated independently. The proximity coupling imprints each momentum-dependent of the altermagnet spin texture onto the Dirac surface states, giving rise to an angular mass whose sign follows the lattice orientation. Adjusting the phase of one electrode redefines this mass pattern, thereby tuning the number and spatial distribution of chiral edge channels. This results in discrete conductance steps and a reversible inversion of the thermoelectric coefficient-achieved without external magnetic fields or net magnetization. A compact Dirac model captures both the quantized switching and its resilience to moderate disorder. Overall, this symmetry-driven mechanism provides a practical and low-dissipation route to programmable topological transport via lattice rotation.

Title: When Normality Tests Detect Equilibrium Distributions of Finite N-Body Systems
Authors: Jae Wan Shim
Abstract: The particle number $N$ can be used as a quantitative gauge of non-Gaussianity. This idea extends to systems that are not literally finite by assigning them a notional $N$ that captures the same deviation. For an ideal gas with $N$ insufficiently large for the thermodynamic limit, the velocity distribution that maximises Havrda-Charvát entropy departs markedly from the Maxwell--Boltzmann (Gaussian) form obtained in that limit. We explore how five standard normality tests -- Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cramér--von Mises, Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilk -- respond to samples drawn from this finite-$N$ equilibrium distribution. A large-scale Monte Carlo study maps the tests' statistical power across system size $N$ and sample size $n$, providing practical reference tables and a heuristic scaling law, visualised as a contour plot, that together indicate when finite-size effects remain detectable.

Title: Quantum Hall correlations in tilted extended Bose-Hubbard chains
Authors: Hrushikesh Sable, Subrata Das, Vito W. Scarola
Abstract: We demonstrate characteristics of a bosonic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state in a one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model (eBHM) with a static tilt. In the large tilt limit, quenched kinetic energy leads to emergent dipole moment conservation, enabling mapping to a model generating FQH states. Using exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, and an analytical transfer matrix approach, we analyze energy and entanglement properties to reveal FQH correlations. Our findings set the stage for the use of quenched kinetics in simple time-reversal invariant eBHMs to explore emergent phenomena.

Title: Novel Transformations of PbTiO3 with Pressure and Temperature
Authors: Husam Farraj, Stefano Racioppi, Gaston Garbarino, Muhtar Ahart, Anshuman Mondal, Samuel G. Parra, Jesse S. Smith, R. E. Cohen, Eva Zurek, Jordi Cabana, Russell J. Hemley
Abstract: We investigated the behavior of lead titanate (PbTiO3) up to 100 GPa, both at room temperature and upon laser heating, using synchrotron X ray diffraction combined with density functional theory (DFT) computations. At the high pressure temperature (PT) conditions produced in laser heated diamond anvil cells, PbTiO3 dissociates into PbO and TiO2, consistent with our DFT computations showing that decomposition becomes enthalpically favored above 65 GPa. In contrast, on room temperature compression, PbTiO3 persists in the tetragonal I4mcm phase up to at least 100 GPa. Laser heating produces distinct PbO phases: a compressed form of alpha PbO and a previously unreported delta PbO polymorph, both of which transform to beta PbO on decompression. The calculations predict that alpha PbO undergoes pressure-induced band gap closure, metallizing above 70 GPa, whereas the delta and beta phases remain semiconducting with a band gap above 1 eV even at megabar pressures. The experimental and confirming theoretical results reveal an unanticipated dimension of the behavior of PbTiO3, showing that distinct equilibrium and metastable phases can be stabilized along different PT synthesis paths.

Title: Confinement-induced collective motion in suspensions of run-and-tumble particles
Authors: José Martín-Roca, Daniel Escobar Ortiz, Chantal Valeriani, Horacio Serna
Abstract: Collective motion is ubiquitous in active systems at all length and time scales. The mechanisms behind such collective motion usually are alignment interactions between active particles, effective alignment after collisions between agents or symmetry-breaking fluctuations induced by passive species in active suspensions. In this article, we introduce a new type of collective motion in the shape of a traveling band induced purely by confinement, where no explicit or effective alignment are prescribed among active agents. We study a suspension of run-and-tumble particles confined in microchannels comprising asymmetric boundaries: one flat wall and one array of funnel-like obstacles. We study the phase behavior of the confined active suspension upon changes in the packing fraction and the persistence length to define the stability region of the traveling band. We characterize the traveling band structurally and dynamically and study its stability with respect to the tilt angle of the obstacles. Lastly, we describe the mechanism of motion of the band, which resembles the tracked locomotion of some heavy vehicles like tractors, finding that a counter-flux of active particles in the lower part of the band, explained in terms of source-sink and vacancy diffusion mechanisms, is the facilitator of the traveling band and sustains its motion. We name this new collective phenomenon confinement-induced tracked locomotion

Title: Tunneling in multi-site mesoscopic quantum Hall circuits
Authors: D. B. Karki
Abstract: Transport properties of single- and two-site mesoscopic quantum Hall (QH) circuits at high transparencies can be described in terms of the lowest-order backscattering processes, enabling a mapping to the boundary sine-Gordon model. We show that this description breaks down in circuits with four or more sites, where higher-order backscattering processes become relevant and qualitatively modify the low-energy physics, while remaining exactly marginal in three-site geometries. Focusing on the four-site circuit, we derive an effective low-energy theory that captures the resulting interaction-driven physics and reveal the emergence of unique quantum-critical points. In the vicinity of these critical points, we obtain universal conductance and scaling behavior and establish the robustness of the associated non-Fermi liquid physics. We further introduce tunneling in multichannel multi-site QH circuits and propose a promising route for realizing diverse quantum-critical phenomena. We show that a boundary sine-Gordon description can be restored in multichannel multi-site QH circuits by appropriately looping selected edge channels, a procedure that is experimentally feasible. Finally, we analyze the non-equilibrium heating effects relevant to transport measurements in QH circuits. Altogether, our results establish multi-site QH circuits as a versatile and highly controllable platform for simulating interaction-driven quantum critical phenomena.

Title: A path to superconductivity via strong short-range repulsion in a spin-polarized band
Authors: Zhiyu Dong, Patrick A. Lee
Abstract: We predict that the spin-polarized electrons in a two-dimensional triangular lattice with strong electron-electron repulsion gives rise to f-wave pairing. The key point is that the first-order interaction, which is usually pair-breaking, vanishes or nearly vanishes in certain f-wave channels due to symmetry constraints. As a result, these f-wave pairing channels are governed by the subleading-order processes which enable pairing when the perturbation theory is controlled. We illustrate this using the Hubbard model on the triangular lattice with on-site and nearest-neighbor repulsion, where we find a $T_c\sim 1\% $ of electron's bandwidth. For a general screened interaction, the same idea works asymptotically, but a third-order calculation is needed to fully determine the strength of f-wave pairing.

Title: Collapse of the superconducting order parameter in Ising superconductors with Rashba spin-orbit coupling
Authors: J. S. Harms, M. Hein, W. Belzig
Abstract: Ising superconductors have attracted quite some attention recently, due to their resilience against magnetic fields way beyond the Pauli-paramagnetic limit. Their protection against external magnetic field relies on strong Ising spin-orbit coupling, which originates from in-plane inversion symmetry breaking. Due to the heavy atom nature of Ising SCs, a smaller but sizable Rashba SOC could be present through gating or interfacial effects. Here, we consider the effect of Rashba SOC in a two valley model of Ising superconductors with an attractive $s$-wave interaction. We show that Rashba SOC gives a critical magnetic field, above which the superconducting order parameter collapses at low temperatures. This effect, however, disappears at high temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the low- and high temperature physics of Ising SCs is quantitatively and qualitatively different in our two-valley model, and may lead to new ways to determine the strength of the Rashba SOC in Ising SCs.

Title: Phonon-assisted tunneling in Jahn-Teller E$ \times $e impurity centers in crystals
Authors: V. Hizhnyakov
Abstract: Tunnel transitions between various distorted states of impurity centers in crystals with the E$ \times $e Jahn-Teller effect are considered, taking into account changes in the dynamics of phonons caused by this effect. Both linear and quadratic vibrational interactions are taken into account. It was found that phonon scattering accompanying tunneling leads not only to a broadening of the energy spectrum of the transitions, but also to a deterioration in resonance. The results obtained are consistent with measurements of ultrasonic attenuation in Al2O3:Ni, GaAs:Mn and in GaAs:Cu doped crystals. A notable feature of E$ \times $e tunneling is the existence of a range of values for quadratic vibration interaction, in which the tunneling remains coherent at sufficiently high temperatures.

Title: CO on a Rh/Fe3O4 single-atom catalyst: high-resolution infrared spectroscopy and near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy

Abstract: Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) offers a powerful route to bridging the materials and pressure gaps between surface science and powder catalysis. Using a newly developed IRAS setup optimised for dielectric single crystals, we investigate CO adsorption on the model single-atom catalyst Rh/Fe3O4(001). IRAS resolves three species: monocarbonyls at isolated, twofold-coordinated Rh adatoms, monocarbonyls at fivefold-coordinated Rh atoms embedded in the surface, and gem-dicarbonyls at isolated, twofold-coordinated Rh adatoms. Under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, RhCO monocarbonyl species at adatom sites dominate. Rh(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl formation is kinetically hindered and occurs predominantly through CO-induced dissociation of Rh dimers rather than sequential adsorption of two CO molecules at an isolated, twofold Rh adatom. The sequential-adsorption pathway to Rh(CO)2 becomes accessible at millibar CO pressures as evidenced by near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy (NAP-STM). These findings link the UHV behaviour to that expected under realistic reaction conditions. Assignments of the vibrational frequencies to individual species rely on isotopic labelling, thermal treatments, and a review of previous SPM, XPS, and TPD data, supported by density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. While theory provides qualitative insight, such as the instability of dicarbonyls on fivefold-coordinated Rh atoms, it does not yet reproduce experimental frequencies quantitatively and is sensitive to the computational parameters, highlighting the need for robust experimental benchmarks. The spectroscopic fingerprints established here provide a reliable foundation for identifying Rh coordination environments in oxide-supported single-atom catalysts.

Title: Quantum quenches across continuous and first-order quantum transitions in one-dimensional quantum Ising models
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto, Davide Rossini, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics generated by quantum quenches (QQs) of the Hamiltonian parameters in many-body systems, focusing on protocols that cross first-order and continuous quantum transitions, both in finite-size systems and in the thermodynamic limit. As a paradigmatic example, we consider the quantum Ising chain in the presence of homogeneous transverse ($g$) and longitudinal ($h$) magnetic fields. This model exhibits a continuous quantum transition (CQT) at $g=g_c$ and $h=0$, and first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) driven by $h$ along the line $h=0$ ($g<g_c$). In the integrable limit $h=0$, the system can be mapped onto a quadratic fermionic theory; however, any nonvanishing longitudinal field breaks integrability and the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian is generally expected to enter a chaotic regime. We analyze QQs in which the longitudinal field is suddenly changed from a negative value $h_i < 0$ to a positive value $h_f>0$. We focus on values of $h_f$ such that the spectrum of the post-QQ Hamiltonian $H(g,h_f)$ lies in the chaotic regime, where thermalization may emerge at asymptotically long times. We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics for different values of $g$, finding qualitatively distinct behaviors for $g > g_c$ (where the chain is in the disordered phase), for $g = g_c$ (QQ across the CQT), and for $g<g_c$ (QQ across the FOQT line).

Title: Run-and-Tumble Dynamics and Zeno--Anti-Zeno Transition in Biased Quantum Trajectories
Authors: Aritra Kundu
Abstract: We identify the transition from the oscillatory Rabi regime to the localized Zeno/Anti-Zeno regime in continuous measurement and feedback of a qubit as a quantum analogue of Motility-Induced Phase Separation (MIPS). A mapping between a biased monitored qubit and a classical ``Run-and-Tumble" active particle is studied. We demonstrate that the competition between coherent Rabi driving (analogous to active motility) and measurement-induced feedback bias (analogous to persistence) mimics the behavior of biological swimmers. This framework provides a picture of measurement-induced phase transitions using the language of active matter and offering a novel pathway for designing dissipative noisy quantum systems.

Title: Noncommuting zero-noise and zero-frequency limits in particle-hole symmetric fluids
Authors: Ewan McCulloch, Romain Vasseur, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: In charged fluids obeying particle-hole symmetry, such as the Dirac fluid in graphene, charge transport is diffusive despite the presence of ballistically propagating sound waves: sound waves "hydrodynamically decouple" from the slower charge fluctuations. For quasi-one-dimensional fluids, we show that this symmetry-protected charge diffusion is not smoothly connected to the normal diffusion that arises when momentum conservation is broken by noise (or static impurities). Instead, the charge diffusion constant is a discontinuous function of noise, which (in the weak-noise limit) depends only on the ratio of momentum and energy relaxation rates. In the special limit of momentum-conserving noise (e.g., spatially uniform fluctuations of the Hamiltonian), the diffusion constant diverges in the presence of noise. We describe the resulting superdiffusion in terms of coupled Burgers equations. We present a general mechanism--hydrodynamic recoupling--by which weak noise can induce singular changes in transport coefficients. Our results highlight the limits of zero-noise extrapolation for predicting dynamical quantities like diffusion constants.

Title: Phase Frustration Induced Intrinsic Bose Glass in the Kitaev-Bose-Hubbard Model
Authors: Yi-fan Zhu, Shi-jie Yang
Abstract: We report an intrinsic "Bubble Phase" in the two-dimensional Kitaev-Bose-Hubbard model, driven purely by phase frustration between complex hopping and anisotropic pairing. By combining Inhomogeneous Gutzwiller Mean-Field Theory with a Bogoliubov-de Gennes stability analysis augmented by a novel Energy Penalty Method, we demonstrate that this phase spontaneously fragments into coherent islands, exhibiting the hallmark Bose glass signature of finite compressibility without global superfluidity. Notably, we propose a unified framework linking disorder-driven localization to deterministic phase frustration, identifying the Bubble Phase as a pristine, disorder-free archetype of the Bose glass. Our results provide a theoretical blueprint for realizing glassy dynamics in clean quantum simulators.

Title: PFT: Phonon Fine-tuning for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Teddy Koker, Abhijeet Gangan, Mit Kotak, Jaime Marian, Tess Smidt
Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.

Title: Charge Transport and Multiplication in Lateral Amorphous Selenium Devices Under Cryogenic Conditions
Authors: M. Rooks, S. Abbaszadeh, J. Asaadi, V. A. Chirayath, M. Á. García-Peris, E. Gramellini, K. Hellier, B. Sudarsan, I. Tzoka
Abstract: Cryogenic photon sensing for high-energy physics motivates photosensor technologies that combine large-area scalability with internal gain and stable operation at low temperature. Amorphous selenium is a promising photoconductor, yet its field- and temperature-dependent transport and avalanche response in lateral geometries have not been systematically established. This work reports field-resolved photocurrent measurements of lateral a-Se devices from 93 K to 297 K under 401 nm excitation at fields up to 120 V/um. Below avalanche onset, the external quantum efficiency was described by the Onsager model, yielding effective post-thermalization separations that decrease with decreasing temperature. The field-assisted detrapping region was evaluated using several transport models, with the data favoring field-assisted hopping and thermally-assisted tunneling as the mechanisms that best capture the temperature evolution of the photocurrent. The boundaries between field-assisted detrapping, transport-limited conduction, and avalanche shift with temperature; at 93 K the response transitions directly from detrapping into avalanche. Avalanche multiplication was analyzed using the Lucky-drift model. These results provide the first systematic characterization of cryogenic avalanche behavior in lateral a-Se detectors and establish quantitative trends relevant to low-temperature, high-gain photodetector design.

Title: Establishing Atomic Coherence in Twisted Oxide Membranes Containing Volatile Elements
Authors: Young-Hoon Kim, Reza Ghanbari, Min-Hyoung Jung, Young-Min Kim, Ruijuan Xu, Miaofang Chi
Abstract: Twisted oxide membranes represent a promising platform for exploring moire physics and emergent quantum phenomena. However, the presence of amorphous interfacial dead layers in conventional oxide heterostructures impedes coherent coupling and suppresses moire-induced interactions. While high-temperature thermal treatments can facilitate interfacial bonding, additional care is needed for materials containing volatile elements, where elevated temperatures may cause elemental loss. This study demonstrates the realization of atomically coherent, chemically bonded interface in twisted NaNbO3 heterostructures through controlled oxygen-annealing treatment. Atomic-resolution imaging and spectroscopy reveal ordered perovskite registry accompanied by systematic lattice contraction and modified electronic structure at the twisted interface, providing signatures of chemical reconstruction rather than physical adhesion. This reconstructed interface mediates highly asymmetric strain propagation in which the bottom membrane remains nearly relaxed while the top membrane accommodates substantial shear strain, thereby establishing a strain gradient that enables long-range electromechanical coupling throughout the twisted oxide membranes. By resolving the nature of the reconstructed interface, these findings establish a robust pathway for achieving coherent and strain-tunable oxide moire superlattices, opening pathways to engineer emergent ferroic and electronic functionalities.

Title: Non-equilibrium active noise enhances generative memory in diffusion models
Authors: Agnish Kumar Behera, Alexandra Lamtyugina, Aditya Nandy, Daiki Goto, Carlos Floyd, Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for sampling high-dimensional distributions, yet they typically rely on white gaussian noise and noise schedules to destroy and reconstruct information. Here, we demonstrate that driving the generative process out of equilibrium using active, temporally correlated noise sources fundamentally alters the information thermodynamics of the system. We show that coupling the data to an active non-Markovian bath creates a `memory effect' where high-level semantic information (such as class identity or molecular metastability) is stored in the temporal correlations of auxiliary degrees of freedom. Using Fisher information analysis, we prove that this active mechanism significantly retards the rate of information decay compared to passive Brownian motion. Crucially, this memory effect facilitates an earlier and more robust symmetry breaking (speciation) during the reverse generative process, allowing the system to resolve multi-scale structures, reminiscent of metastable states in molecular configurations that are washed out in the typical noising processes. Our results suggest that non-equilibrium protocols, inspired by active matter physics, offer a thermodynamically distinct and potentially advantageous pathway for recovering high-dimensional energy landscapes using generative diffusion.

Title: Statistics of Abelian topological excitations
Authors: Hanyu Xue
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel theory that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics to Abelian topological excitations of any dimension. We axiomatize excitations as a selected collection of states and operators satisfying the configuration axiom and the locality axiom, purely based on many-body quantum mechanics. Upon these axioms, we define a rigorous and self-contained theory of statistics using only basic algebra and can be implemented on a computer. While our theory is developed independently, the results align with existing physical theories.

Title: Geometric quantum drives and topological dynamical responses: hyperbolically-driven quantum systems and beyond
Authors: Jihong Wu, Chuan Liu, Daniel Bulmash, Wen Wei Ho
Abstract: We introduce a geometrical framework to construct a large class of time-dependent quantum systems, in which the position of a classical particle moving autonomously on a smooth connected manifold is used to steer a quantum Hamiltonian over time. This results in quantum drives with structured temporal profiles and properties dependent on the local and global nature of the underlying choice of manifold. We show that our construction recovers the well-known classes of periodically-driven and quasiperiodically-driven quantum systems, but also unveils fundamentally new classes of quantum dynamics: by utilizing a compact 2d hyperbolic Bolza surface and a nonorientable Klein-bottle surface, we demonstrate examples of a hyperbolically-driven quantum system and a nonorientably-driven quantum system respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these driven systems exhibit unusual quantized dynamical responses reflecting their different underlying topologies, under the condition of being fully gapped and in the adiabatic limit, and which have interpretations as quantized crystalline electromagnetic responses in certain exotic effective tight-binding lattice models. We envision geometric quantum driving as a general framework to chart the landscape of time-dependent quantum systems and investigate the universal phase structures they exhibit, as well as a useful tool to enhance the capabilities of modern day quantum simulators.

Title: Nonlinear dynamics of air invasion in one-dimensional compliant fluid networks
Authors: Ludovic Jami, François-Xavier Gauci, Céline Cohen, Xavier Noblin, Ludovic Keiser
Abstract: Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem, where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure, we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales (the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$) governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When $\tau_\mathrm{diff} \sim \tau_\mathrm{pv}$, we uncover a nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.

Title: Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation
Authors: Kazuki Ikeda
Abstract: We establish a novel quantum protocol called Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation (TQET) between two separated parties $A$ and $B$, designed for transporting quantum energy across spacetime. The amount of energy gained through TQET is always greater than or equal to that obtained via natural time evolution for any spin chain where $A$ and $B$ are distinguishable. This protocol uses temporal and spatial quantum correlations between agents separated by space and time. The energy supplier injects energy into the system by measuring the ground state of a many-body system that evolves over time, while the distant recipient performs a conditional operation using feedback from the supplier. When Bob acts immediately after receiving Alice's outcome, the protocol reduces to conventional QET. We present a proof-of-concept demonstration in the Ising model using quantum simulations. TQET increases energy efficiency from approximately 3\% to around 40\%, representing over a 13-fold improvement compared to QET. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between entanglement in time and TQET, validating the role of temporal correlations in energy activation between agents across spacetime.

Title: Quantum Time Crystal Clock and its Performance
Authors: Ludmila Viotti, Marcus Huber, Rosario Fazio, Gonzalo Manzano
Abstract: Understanding different aspects of time is at the core of many areas in theoretical physics. Minimal models of continuous stochastic and quantum clocks have been proposed to explore fundamental limitations on the performance of timekeeping devices. Owing to the level of complexity in the clock structure and its energy consumption, such devices show trade-offs whose characterization remains an open challenge. Indeed, even conceptual designs for thermodynamically efficient quantum clocks are not yet well understood. In condensed matter theory, time-crystals were found as an exciting new phase of matter, featuring oscillations in (pseudo)-equilibrium with first experimental observations appearing recently. This naturally prompts the question: can time crystals be used as quantum clocks and what is their performance from a thermodynamic perspective? We answer this question and find that quantum time crystals are indeed genuine quantum clocks with a performance enhanced by the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry.

Title: Structure and dynamics jointly stabilize the international trade hypergraph
Authors: Jung-Ho Kim, Sudo Yi, Sang-Hwan Gwak, K.-I. Goh, D.-S. Lee
Abstract: To understand how fluctuations arise and are distributed in international trade, a question crucial for economic risk assessment and policymaking, we analyze strong adverse fluctuations-collapsed trades-defined as individual trades with sharp annual volume declines. Adopting a hypergraph framework for a fine-scale trade-centric representation of international trade, we find that collapsed trades (hyperedges) are clustered and their occurrence decays algebraically with trade volume (weight), which suggests inhomogeneous, epidemic-like spreading of collapse in the international trade hypergraph. Modeling collapse propagation as a contagion process and analyzing its dynamics, we show that a positive degree-weight correlation and a volume-decaying collapse rate synergistically suppress the onset of global collective collapse. Notably, the degree-weight correlation persisted but the volume-decay of the collapse rate weakened during the 2008-2009 global economic recession, resulting in a broader collapse spread. Our study shows how the interplay between structure and dynamics stabilizes complex systems.

Title: The neural networks with tensor weights and emergent fermionic Wick rules in the large-width limit
Authors: Guojun Huang, Kai Zhou
Abstract: In this paper, we study complex-valued neural network (CVNNs) with tensor-valued hidden-to-output weights within the framework of neural-network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). For standard CVNNs with scalar weights, we derive the generating functional and identify the exact Gaussian process that arises in the infinite-width limit, together with its associated effective quantum state. When the last-layer weights are promoted to Clifford-algebra-valued tensors, the network output becomes complex matrix-valued, and a fermion-like sign structure in the large-width correlation functions of the network output is induced. We show that, in the infinite-width limit, correlators with equal numbers of $f^†$ and $f$ obey fermionic Wick rules and can be written as determinants built from a scalar Euclidean kernel $S(x,y)=\langle f^†(x)f(y)\rangle$. This provides a sign-structured extension of NN-QFT at the level of Euclidean correlators and Feynman rules, even though a microscopic Grassmann path integral representation for the network parameters has not yet been constructed. Our analysis thus pushes the NN-QFT correspondence beyond purely bosonic Gaussian fields and suggests a possible route to encoding fermion-like symmetries in neural architectures for QFT correspondence.

Title: Anyonic membranes and Pontryagin statistics
Authors: Yitao Feng, Hanyu Xue, Yuyang Li, Meng Cheng, Ryohei Kobayashi, Po-Shen Hsin, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5{+}1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.

Title: On the six-loop scaling dimensions of the $(ϕ^2)^n$ operators in $d=3$
Authors: A.V. Bednyakov, M.V. Kompaniets, A.V. Trenogin
Abstract: We consider a class of singlet operators $(\phi^2)^n$ in the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model with $\lambda^2 \phi^6$ interaction. Recently, the corresponding anomalous dimensions $\gamma_{2n}$ were computed by semiclassical methods and the all-loop result for the leading-$n$ corrections in the small $\lambda$ limit was found. In this paper, we obtain the six-loop expressions not only for the leading-$n$ contribution but also for the subleading one. While the leading correction confirms the predictions of recent semiclassical calculation, the subleading one is a new result and will serve as a future welcome check for all-loop expressions. As an important by-product of our calculation, we provide a full dependence on $n$ of the four-loop $\gamma_{2n}$ in the $O(N)$ case.

Title: Exact Thermal Stabilizer Eigenstates at Infinite Temperature
Authors: Akihiro Hokkyo
Abstract: Understanding how microscopic few-body interactions give rise to thermal behavior in isolated quantum many-body systems remains a central challenge in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. While individual energy eigenstates are expected to reproduce thermal equilibrium values, analytic access to highly entangled thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable Hamiltonians remains scarce. In this Letter, we construct exact infinite-temperature eigenstates of generically nonintegrable two-body Hamiltonians using stabilizer states. These states can fully reproduce thermal expectation values for all spatially local observables, extending previously known Bell-pair-based constructions to a broader class. At the same time, we prove a sharp no-go theorem: stabilizer eigenstates of two-body Hamiltonians cannot satisfy microscopic thermal equilibrium for all four-body observables. This bound is tight, as we explicitly construct a translationally invariant Hamiltonian whose stabilizer eigenstate is thermal for all two-body and three-body observables as well as all spatially local observables. Our results suggest that reproducing higher-order thermal correlations requires nonstabilizer degrees of freedom, providing analytic insight into the interplay between interaction locality, microscopic thermal equilibrium, and quantum computational complexity.

Title: General-order degenerate coupled-cluster theory
Authors: So Hirata
Abstract: A size-extensive, converging, black-box, ab initio coupled-cluster ($\Delta$CC) ansatz is introduced that computes the energies and wave functions of stationary states from any degenerate or nondegenerate Slater-determinant references with any numbers of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-spin electrons, and any patterns of orbital occupancy. For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference coupled-cluster ansatz. For a degenerate multireference, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate perturbation ($\Delta$MP) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, which may be useful for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A new, size-extensive, converging, general-model-space state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory is also proposed, to which $\Delta$CC theory is directly related. Determinant-based, general-order algorithms of $\Delta$CC and SUMRCC theories are implemented, which are compared with configuration-interaction (CI) and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) theories through octuple excitations and with $\Delta$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm of $\Delta$CC theory is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitation ($\Delta$CCS) and of single and double excitations ($\Delta$CCSD). The order of performance is: SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $>$ EOM-CC $>$ CI at the same order or SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $>$ $\Delta$MP $>$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.
