Title: Symmetry constrained field theories for chiral spin liquid to spin crystal transitions
Authors: Anjishnu Bose, Andrew Hardy, Naren Manjunath, Arun Paramekanti
Abstract: We consider the spin rotationally invariant Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (CSL) in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry and explore symmetry constraints on possible conventional spin crystal states accessible via a direct transition. These constraints provide a framework to identify topological invariants of the magnetically ordered state. We show that the existence of a direct transition from a CSL requires a precise compatibility condition between the topological invariants of the ordered state and the anomaly of the CSL. The lattice symmetries also constrain the functional form of the low-energy theory to describe these transitions. This allows us to construct explicit Chern-Simons-matter field theories for the transition into a class of noncoplanar orders identified as candidates directly accessible from the CSL, including the octahedral spin crystal on the kagomé lattice, and the tetrahedral order on the triangular and honeycomb lattice. These transitions can either be described using coupled fractionalized $ \mathbb{CP}^1 $ theories or fractionalized matrix principal chiral models. We also discuss extensions to more general magnetic ordering transitions out of the CSL.

Title: Fractionalized fermionic multicriticality in anisotropic Kitaev spin-orbital liquids
Authors: Max Fornoville, Lukas Janssen
Abstract: We study the low-temperature phase diagram of quantum Kitaev-Heisenberg spin-orbital models with XXZ anisotropy on the honeycomb lattice. Within a parton mean-field theory, we identify three different quantum phases, distinguished by their symmetries. Besides a disordered spin-orbital liquid with unbroken U(1) x Z2 spin rotational symmetry, there are two orbital liquid phases characterized by spin long-range order. In these phases, the spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken down to residual U(1) and Z2 symmetries, respectively. The symmetric spin-orbital liquid features three flavors of linearly dispersing gapless Majorana fermions. In the symmetry-broken phases, one of the three Majorana excitations remains gapless, while the other two acquire a band gap. The transitions from the symmetric to the symmetry-broken phases are continuous and fall into the fractionalized Gross-Neveu-Z2* and Gross-Neveu-SO(2)* universality classes, respectively. The transition between the ordered phases is discontinuous. Using a renormalization group analysis based on the epsilon expansion, we demonstrate that the triple point in the phase diagram features fractionalized fermionic multicriticality with emergent SO(3) symmetry.

Title: Observing two-electron interactions with correlation-ARPES
Authors: A.F. Kemper, F. Goto, H.A. Labib, N. Gauthier, E.H. da Silva Neto, F. Boschini
Abstract: Identifying and studying the underlying two-electron interactions that give rise to emergent phenomena is a key step in developing a holistic understanding of quantum materials. This step is hindered by the lack of an experiment that can directly interrogate the interactions and the specific quasiparticles involved in the interaction simultaneously. We introduce correlation-ARPES (C-ARPES) as a new experimental method that overcomes this difficulty and directly measures the interactions between specific, chosen quasiparticles by measuring the correlations between two electrons photoemitted from the same pulse (but not the same photon). We illustrate how this technique can extract the underlying interactions, and demonstrate this with an example of phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions, such as those that give rise to charge density waves through the Kohn anomaly mechanism.

Title: Driven Non-Unitary Dynamics of Quantum Critical Systems
Authors: Bastien Lapierre, Pietro Pelliconi, Shinsei Ryu, Julian Sonner
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between unitary and non-unitary driven many-body dynamics in (1+1)-dimensional quantum critical systems described by conformal field theory (CFT). By formulating a coherent state approach, we demonstrate that the growth of entanglement entropy and energy can be found analytically for a class of non-unitary driven CFTs, where the evolution alternates between real and imaginary time evolution, the latter corresponding to postselected weak measurements. We find that non-unitary evolution leads to the emergence of steady states at infinite times for the cases of periodic, quasiperiodic, and random drives. In a special class of drives, for mixed initial states, we uncover purification phase transitions that arise as a result of the competition between unitary evolution and weak measurements. We compare the CFT evolution with the corresponding non-unitary dynamics of critical lattice models, finding remarkable agreement.

Title: Spin liquid phase in the Hubbard model: Luttinger-Ward analysis of the slave-rotor formalism
Authors: Xia-Ming Zheng, Mehdi Kargarian
Abstract: We propose an approach for studying the spin liquid phase of the Hubbard model on the triangular lattice by combining the Baym--Kadanoff formalism with the slave rotor parton construction. This method enables the computation of a series of two-body Feynman diagrams for the Luttinger--Ward (LW) functional using a one-loop truncation. This approach enables us to study the U(1) quantum spin liquid phase characterized by a spinon Fermi surface and to derive the Green's functions for spinons, chargons, and electrons. Our findings extend beyond the standard mean-field approximation by accounting for the effects of gauge field this http URL spatial components of the U(1) gauge field are equivalently represented by interactions that incorporate corrections from the spinon-chargon two-particle random phase approximation. This framework effectively captures the long-range correlations inherent to the U(1) quantum spin liquid and combines non-perturbative quantum field theory with the projective construction, providing new insights into the study of quantum spin liquids and other strongly correlated electron systems. We demonstrate that our approach correctly reprodues the anomalous low-temperature behavior of specific heat -- namely, the upturn in $C_V/T$ as a function of $T^2$-- in agreement with recent measurments on 1$T$ - TaS$_2$. Moreover, this approach reproduces the resonant peaks in the Mott gap, as observed in cobalt atoms on single-layer 1$T$-TaSe$_{2}$

Title: Trivalent network model for d3 transition metal dichalcogenides in the 1T structure: Distortions from an effective boundary theory
Authors: Ashland Knowles, R. Ganesh
Abstract: Dimer models are well known as prototypes for locally constrained physics. They describe systems where every site on a lattice must be attached to one dimer. Loop models are an extension of this idea, with the constraint that two dimers must touch at each site. Here, we present a further generalization where every site must have three dimers attached -- a trivalent network model. As concrete physical realizations, we discuss d$^3$ transition metal dichalcogenides in the 1T structure -- materials with the structural formula MX$_2$ (M = Tc, Re) or AM$'$X$_2$ (A = Li or Na; M$'$ = Mo, W), where X is a chalcogen atom. These materials have a triangular layer of transition metal atoms, each with three valence electrons in $t_{2g}$ orbitals. Each atom forms valence bonds with three of its nearest neighbours. The geometry of the 1T structure imbues each bond with sharp orbital character. We argue that this enforces a `bending constraint' where two dimers attached to the same site cannot be parallel. This leads to a highly structured space of configurations, with alternating bonds along each line of the underlying triangular lattice. There is no dynamics, as constraints forbid local rearrangements of dimers. We construct a phase diagram, identifying configurations that minimize potential energy. We find a rhombus-stripe phase in a wide region of parameter space that explains a distortion pattern seen across several materials. Remarkably, this model can be recast as an effective boundary theory, in terms of three Ising chains that are coupled by mutual long-range interactions. As a testable prediction, we propose that a single impurity will generate long-ranged domain walls.

Title: Emergent heavy-fermion physics in a new family of topological insulators RAsS (R = Y, La, and Sm)
Authors: Iñigo Robredo, Yuan Fang, Lei Chen, Nazar Zaremba, Yurii Prots, Mitja Krnel, Markus König, Thomas Doert, Jeroen van den Brink, Claudia Felser, Qimiao Si, Eteri Svanidze, Maia G. Vergniory
Abstract: Realizing topological phases in strongly correlated materials has become a major impetus in condensed matter physics. Although many compounds are now classified as topological insulators, $f$-electron systems (with their strong electron correlations) provide an especially fertile platform for emergent heavy-fermion phenomena driven by the interplay of topology and many-body effects. In this study, we examine the crystalline topology of a new RAsS series (R = Y, La, Sm), revealing a structural variant from previous reports. We demonstrate that YAsS and SmAsS host hourglass fermions protected by glide symmetry. SmAsS notably exhibits a strong effective-mass enhancement, placing it alongside SmB${}_6$ and YbB${}_{12}$ as a material that couples topological surface states with emergent Kondo physics, yet distinguished by its crystalline symmetry constraints and $f$-$p$ orbital hybridization. To capture these features, we construct a minimal model incorporating $f$-electron degrees of freedom, which reproduces the observed topological properties and predicts that the surface states survive in the correlated regime, albeit shifted in energy. Our work thus introduces a new family of correlated topological materials and forecasts the robustness of their surface states under Kondo correlations.

Title: Engineering frustrated Rydberg spin models by graphical Floquet modulation
Authors: Mingsheng Tian, Rhine Samajdar, Bryce Gadway
Abstract: Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.

Title: Observation of Half-Quantum Vorticity in an Iron-based Superconductor
Authors: Mohammad Javadi Balakan, Genda Gu, Qiang Li, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ji Ung Lee
Abstract: Half-quantum vortices -- topological excitations carrying half the superconducting flux quantum -- are predicted to emerge in spin-triplet superconductors, where the spin component of order parameter enables fractional flux quantization. We present direct transport signatures of half-quantum vorticity in single-crystal Fe(Te,Se), an iron-based superconductor with helical Dirac surface states. Using mesoscopic superconducting ring devices, we observe half-integer quantum oscillations arising from the splitting of quantized fluxoid states, further supported by distinct signatures of trapped half-integer fluxoids. The quantum oscillations are modulated by a background symmetry, set by the relative orientation of the DC bias current and perpendicular magnetic field, consistent with strong spin-orbit coupling. These findings demonstrate the long-sought half-quantum vorticity in spin-polarized superconductors and open new directions toward non-Abelian excitations in quantum materials and scalable topological qubits.

Title: Ferroelasticity, shear modulus softening, and the tetragonal-cubic transition in davemaoite
Authors: Tianqi Wan, Chenxing Luo, Zhen Zhang, Yang Sun, Renata M. Wentzcovitch
Abstract: Davemaoite (Dm), the cubic phase of CaSiO3-perovskite (CaPv), is a major component of the Earth's lower mantle. Understanding its elastic behavior, including its dissolution in bridgmanite (MgSiO3-perovskite), is crucial for interpreting lower mantle seismology. Using machine-learning interatomic potentials and molecular dynamics, we investigate CaPv's elastic properties across the tetragonal-cubic transition. Our equations of state align well with experimental data at 300 K and 2,000 K, demonstrating the predictive accuracy of our trained potential. We simulate the ferroelastic hysteresis loop in tetragonal CaPv, which has yet to be investigated experimentally. We also identify a significant temperature-induced shear modulus softening near the phase transition, characteristic of ferroelastic-paraelastic transitions. Unlike previous elasticity studies, our softening region does not extend to slab geotherm conditions. We suggest that ab initio-quality computations provide a robust benchmark for shear elastic softening associated with ferroelasticity, a challenging property to measure in these materials.

Title: Super-Universal Behavior of Outliers Diffusing in a Space-Time Random Environment
Authors: Jacob Hass
Abstract: I characterize the extreme location and extreme first passage time of a system of $N$ particles independently diffusing in a space-time random environment. I show these extreme statistics are governed by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation and derive their mean and variance. I find the scalings of the statistics depend on the moments of the environment. Each scaling regime forms a universality class which is controlled by the lowest order moment which exhibits random fluctuations. When the first moment is random, the environment plays the role of a random velocity field. When the first moment is fixed but the second moment is random, the environment manifests as fluctuations in the diffusion coefficient. As each higher moment is fixed, the next moment determines the scaling behavior. Since each scaling regime forms a universality class, this model for diffusion forms a super-universality class. I confirm my theoretical predictions using numerics for a wide class of underlying environments.

Title: A Unified Simulation Framework for Correlated Driven-Dissipative Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Thomas Blommel, Enrico Perfetto, Gianluca Stefanucci, Vojtěch Vlček
Abstract: Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy provides a unique and direct way to explore the real-time nonequilibrium dynamics of electrons and holes. The formal theory of the spectral function evolution requires inclusion of electronic correlations and dissipation, which are challenging due to the associated long simulation timescales which translate to a high computational cost. Recent methodological developments, namely the Real-Time Dyson Expansion, as well as theoretical developments of many-body perturbation theory for dissipative systems, have allowed for the study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems. In this work, we implement the hitherto unrealized study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems which includes driven dynamical correlations and utilizes these new methods and perturbative expansions. We illustrate the combined formalism on a prototypical two-band semiconductor model with long-range density-density Coulomb interactions. We show that the intraband thermalization of conduction band electrons induces nontrivial time-dependent changes in the system's bandstructure and a time-evolving band-gap renormalization (with a reduction by up to 10\%). We show that the qualitative features are preserved for a variety of parameters, discuss the corresponding spectral dynamics, and provide an outlook on the newly introduced simulation framework, which enables treating electron-electron scattering and dissipation effects on equal footing.

Title: Robust electro-mechanical actuation in hydrogenated Xenes leading to reversible topological transition
Authors: Sujith Nedungattil Subrahmanian, Nabendu Mondal, Joydeep Bhattacharjee
Abstract: We report from first principles, the possibility of reversible onset of topological insulator(TI) phase in heavier hydrogenated Xenes (Xane), namely, germanane and stanane, exclusively through in-plane electro-mechanical actuation. It is found possible to systematically induce robust uniaxial strain through non-uniform application of electric field in the plane of monolayers, as possible through application of in-homogeneous bias at gates of realizable length-scales embedded underneath. Electrically induced strain causes substantial lowering of band-gap across all Xanes, eventually evolving through weak followed by strong topologically insulating phases beyond a threshold degree of bias in-homogeneity in heavier Xanes, promisingly within the range of bias sustained by the monolayers. In case of nano-ribbons of these Xanes, bias applied in-homogeneously across width promises switchable emergence of TI phase over a fraction of width and topologically protected interface states localizable anywhere across the half-width of the ribbon. The demonstrated electro-mechanical actuation and the associated topological tuning of band-structure, thematically verified in gapped graphene based representative systems within the Kane-Mele model at half-filling, should be possible in the broader class of two dimensional covalent networks made of elements of the p-block.

Title: Ultraviolet/infrared mixing-driven suppression of Kondo screening in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal
Authors: Francisco Borges, Peter Lunts, Sung-Sik Lee
Abstract: We study a magnetic impurity immersed in the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal (AFQCM). Critical spin fluctuations represented by a bosonic field compete with itinerant electrons to couple with the impurity through the spin-spin interaction. At long distances, the antiferromagnetic electron-impurity (Kondo) coupling dominates over the boson-impurity coupling. However, the Kondo screening is weakened by the boson with an increasing severity as the hot spots connected by the magnetic ordering wave-vector are better nested. For $v_{0,i} \ll 1$, where $v_{0,i}$ is the bare nesting angle at the hot spots, the temperature $T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}$ below which Kondo coupling becomes $O(1)$ is suppressed as $\frac{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}}{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}} \sim \frac{g_{f,i}}{v_{0,i} \log 1/v_{0,i} }$, where $T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}$ is the Kondo temperature of the Fermi liquid with the same electronic density of states, and $g_{f,i}$ is the boson-impurity coupling defined at UV cutoff energy $\Lambda$. The remarkable efficiency of the single collective field in hampering the screening of the impurity spin by the Fermi surface originates from a ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing: bosons with momenta up to a UV cutoff actively suppress Kondo screening at low energies.

Title: Probing fractional quantum Hall effect by photoluminescence
Authors: Aamir A. Makki, Mytraya Gattu, J. K. Jain
Abstract: The recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states - fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states realized without an external magnetic field - in twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers represents a significant development in condensed matter physics. Notably, these states were first observed via photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Surprisingly, a general theoretical understanding of PL is not available even for the standard FQH states. For an ideal two-dimensional system, the energy of the emitted photon is predicted to be independent of the correlations, but we show that the PL intensity contains valuable information. Specifically, we predict that at finite temperatures, the PL intensity peaks at the Jain fillings \nu = n/(2n \pm 1), and away from these fillings, the binding energies of the composite-fermion excitons and trions can be deduced from the temperature dependence of the intensity. We discuss implications for PL experiments in semiconductor quantum wells and twisted TMD bilayers.

Title: Analytical Gradient-Based Optimization of CALPHAD Model Parameters
Authors: Courtney Kunselman, Brandon Bocklund, Richard Otis, Raymundo Arroyave
Abstract: The calibration of CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) models involves the solution of a very challenging high-dimensional multiobjective optimization problem. Traditional approaches to parameter fitting predominantly rely on gradient-free methods, which while robust, are computationally inefficient and often scale poorly with model complexity. In this work, we introduce and demonstrate a generalizable framework for analytic gradient-based optimization of the parameters of the CALPHAD model enabled by the recently formalized Jansson derivative technique. This method allows for efficient evaluation of gradients of thermodynamic properties at equilibrium with respect to model parameters, even in the presence of arbitrarily complex internal degrees of freedom. Leveraging these semi-analytic gradients, we employ the conjugate gradient (CG) method to optimize thermodynamic model parameters for four binary alloy systems: Cu-Mg, Fe-Ni, Cr-Ni, and Cr-Fe. Across all systems, CG achieves comparable or superior optimality relative to Bayesian ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with improvements in computational efficiency ranging from one to three orders of magnitude. Our results establish a new paradigm for CALPHAD assessments in which high fidelity data-rich model calibration becomes tractable using deterministic gradient-informed algorithms.

Title: Effect of interatomic repulsion on a Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots
Authors: Clara Palacios ana Armando A. Aligia
Abstract: We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a "sweet spot" hosting "poor man's Majorana" states can still be achieved in the presence of $V$ by appropriately tuning the system parameters. This adjustment allows the extension of previous results to the case of finite Coulomb repulsion $V \neq 0$. However, we observe modifications in the microwave spectrum, due to the presence of previously overlooked states. Additionally, we find that at the sweet spot of both DQDs, all eigenstates of the transmon system exhibit exact double degeneracy.

Title: Leakage Suppression Across Temperature in Al1-xScxN Thin Film Ferroelectric Capacitors through Boron Incorporation
Authors: Pedram Yousefian, Xiaolei Tong, Jonathan Tan, Dhiren K. Pradhan, Deep Jariwala, Roy H. Olsson III
Abstract: This paper presents high-temperature ferroelectric characterization of 40~nm Al$_{1-x-y}$B$_x$Sc$_y$N (AlBScN) thin film capacitors grown by co-sputtering Al$_{0.89}$B$_{0.11}$ and Sc targets onto Pt(111)/Ti(002)/Si(100) substrates. Structural analysis confirmed a c-axis-oriented wurtzite structure with a low surface roughness of 1.37~nm. Ferroelectric switching, characterized by positive-up-negative-down (PUND) measurements up to 600~$^\circ$C, exhibited a linear decrease in coercive fields from 6.2~MV/cm at room temperature to 4.2~MV/cm at 600~$^\circ$C, while remanent polarization remained stable with temperature. Direct current I-V measurements highlight a significant suppression of leakage currents, over two orders of magnitude lower compared to AlScN capacitors fabricated under similar conditions. These results position AlBScN thin films as strong candidates for ferroelectric applications in extreme environments.

Title: Topological Quantum Statistical Mechanics and Topological Quantum Field Theories
Authors: Zhidong Zhang
Abstract: In this work, we first focus on the mathematical structure of the three-dimensional (3D) Ising model. In the Clifford algebraic representation, many internal factors exist in the transfer matrices of the 3D Ising model, which are ascribed to the topology of the 3D space and the many-body interactions of spins. They result in the nonlocality, the nontrivial topological structure, as well as the long-range entanglement between spins in the 3D Ising model. We review briefly the exact solution of the ferromagnetic 3D Ising model at the zero magnetic field, which was derived in our previous work. Then, the framework of topological quantum statistical mechanics is established, with respect to the mathematical aspects (topology, algebra, and geometry) and physical features (the contribution of topology to physics, Jordan-von Neumann-Wigner framework, time average, ensemble average, and quantum mechanical average). This is accomplished by generalizations of our findings and observations in the 3D Ising models. Finally, the results are generalized to topological quantum field theories, in consideration of relationships between quantum statistical mechanics and quantum field theories. It is found that these theories must be set up within the Jordan-von Neumann-Wigner framework, and the ergodic hypothesis is violated at the finite temperature. It is necessary to account the time average of the ensemble average and the quantum mechanical average in the topological quantum statistical mechanics and to introduce the parameter space of complex time (and complex temperature) in the topological quantum field theories. We find that a topological phase transition occurs near the infinite temperature (or the zero temperature) in models in the topological quantum statistical mechanics and the topological quantum field theories, which visualizes a symmetrical breaking of time inverse symmetry.

Title: Room-Temperature Pauli Spin Blockade and Current Rectification in 15-13-15 Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon Heterostructures
Authors: David M T Kuo
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structures and charge transport properties of 13-11-13 and 15-13-15 armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) superlattices using a tight-binding model. The conduction and valence subbands of the 15-13-15 AGNR superlattice are found to be accurately described by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, with topologically protected interface states forming at the junctions between 15- and 13-AGNR segments. We demonstrate that these interface states function as robust tunneling channels, behaving as a serial double quantum dot (SDQD) system under appropriate electrode coupling. Utilizing the two-site Anderson model with electron-electron interactions and Keldysh Green function formalism, we analyze nonlinear charge transport and reveal Coulomb blockade phenomena and charge stability diagrams consistent with experimental observations. Particular attention is given to temperature-dependent current rectification in the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) regime, where significant rectification is preserved under weak orbital offset conditions but suppressed under strong offset, replaced by thermally activated tunneling at room temperature. The tunability and resilience of SDQDs based on 15-13-15 AGNR heterostructures highlight their potential for spin-current conversion applications, with advantages in fabrication and parameter control offered by bottom-up synthesis techniques.

Title: Vortex States and Coherence Lengths in Flat-Band Superconductors
Authors: Chuang Li, Fu-Chun Zhang, Lun-Hui Hu
Abstract: Superconductivity in flat-band systems, governed by quantum metric of Bloch states rather than the BCS framework, exhibits unique phenomena due to the vanishing electron group velocity. Here, we propose the vortex states and vortex size as direct probes to explore the quantum geometry effects in flat-band superconductors. We show that flat-band vortex bound states are sharply localized near the vortex core, and the energy gap between the lowest two bound states is on the order of the bulk superconducting gap. Both the spatial spread and energy scales of bound states are controlled by the flat-band's quantum metric length. Moreover, the vortex size at zero temperature, set by the quantum metric length, is atomic in scale and independent of interaction strength. Near $T_c$, the vortex size corresponds to the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length, diverges as $\xi\sim \sqrt{T_c/(T_c-T)}\xi_0$, where $\xi_0$ depends linearly on the quantum metric length. Thus, the quantum metric serves as the lower bound for vortex state spread and vortex size. We also introduce perturbations to make the flat band dispersive, and distinguish flat-band vortices from BCS-like vortices. Our results establish vortices as universal probes of quantum geometry in flat-band superconductors.

Title: Myosin-driven advection and actin reorganization control the geometry of confined actomyosin gel
Authors: Archit Negi, Ryota Sakamoto, Makito Miyazaki, Yusuke T. Maeda
Abstract: Harnessing nanoscale motor proteins to actively control material shape is a promising strategy in nanotechnology and material science. One notable system is the actomyosin network, composed of actin filaments and myosin motor proteins, providing a natural platform for constructing contractile, shape-adaptive materials. While the role of actomyosin in shaping cells has been extensively studied, the reverse question - how boundary shape affects the actomyosin system - remains poorly understood. Here, we present a microfabricated system that reveals how geometrical confinement directs the organization of actomyosin networks within microwells. By combining experimental and numerical analysis, we show that the asymmetric shape of the microwells is transferred to contracted actomyosin gels via myosin-driven actin flow. Furthermore, tuning myosin contractility and actin polymerization rate allows control over the size and shape of actomyosin gels. Our findings provide a bottom-up framework for integrating molecular motors and cytoskeletons into confined architectures to create responsive biomaterials.

Title: Transition from near-field to extreme near-field radiative heat transfer
Authors: Fridolin Geesmann, Philipp Thurau, Sophie Rodehutskors, Till Ziehm, Ludwig Worbes, Svend-Age Biehs, Achim Kittel
Abstract: The radiative heat transfer in the extreme near-field regime, i.e. for distances below 10 nm, remains poorly understood. There are competing experimental results in this regime, with some in good agreement with theoretical predictions, while others report drastically elevated heat fluxes, orders of magnitude larger than what theory suggests. Whether the theory of fluctuational electrodynamics can predict the radiative heat transfer in this extreme near-field regime or not remains a matter of active debate. In this study, a radiative heat transfer measurement is presented between a gold-coated sphere and a gold film sample in the transition regime between the near-field and the extreme near-field regime just before contact. The radiative heat flux measurement is made by using a near-field scanning thermal microscope equipped with a temperature sensor at a sharp tip as a heat flux sensor. We find an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions of fluctuational electrodynamics in the near-field regime. In the extreme near-field regime however, a highly increased radiative heat flux is observed with values about 100 times larger than the theoretical predictions, indicating that fluctuational electrodynamics fails to capture the radiative heat flux in this regime.

Title: Polarization-Driven Charge Frustration and Emergent Phases in the One-Dimensional Extended Hubbard Model
Authors: Sourabh Saha, Jeroen van den Brink, Manoranjan Kumar, Satoshi Nishimoto
Abstract: Frustration is a key driver of exotic quantum phases, yet its role in charge dynamics remains largely unexplored. We show that charge frustration - induced by electronic polarization effects - stabilizes unconventional insulating states in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model. Using exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group, we uncover a charge-disordered phase that remains insulating despite lacking long-range order and possessing an effectively attractive on-site interaction - a behavior reminiscent of gapful spin liquids in frustrated spin systems. We also identify a fragile ferroelectric phase and a charge-density-wave state with emergent eight-site periodicity. These findings establish charge frustration, driven by charge-dipole interactions, as a robust mechanism for realizing exotic phases in low-dimensional correlated systems, with implications for organic conductors, transition-metal oxides, and ultracold polar molecules.

Title: Unveiling the interplay of magnetic order and electronic band structure on the evolution of anomalous Hall effect in MnPtGa single crystal
Authors: Gourav Dwari, Shovan Dan, Bishal Baran Maity, Sitaram Ramakrishnan, Achintya Lakshan, Ruta Kulkarni, Vikash Sharma, Suman Nandi, Partha Pratim Jana, Andrzej Ptok, A. Thamizhavel
Abstract: The recent studies on the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) have revealed an intrinsic relationship between the topological band structure and the experimentally observed transverse conductivity. Consequently, this has led to a heightened focus on examining the topological aspects of AHE. Here we have studied sign reversal of anomalous Hall conductivity with temperature in the single crystalline MnPtGa (space group: $P6_3/mmc$). From the interdependence of the linear resistance, we claim that the origin of such behavior is intrinsic. By systematically studying the electronic band structure and Berry curvature of MnPtGa using first principle calculations supported by magnetic susceptibility and isothermal magnetization measurements we demonstrate that the temperature dependent complex magnetic structure plays a significant role and leads to the sign reversal of anomalous Hall conductivity. We proposed a continuous evolution of the magnetic structure, supported by the ab initio calculations, which is consistent with the experimental data. Our studies have established that the critical temperature ($\approx$110 K), where the sign reversal appears is associated with the magnetic structure and the magnitude of Mn moments.

Title: Landau levels in Weyl semimetal under uniaxial strain
Authors: Shivam Yadav, Andrzej Ptok
Abstract: The external strain can lead to the similar effect to the external applied magnetic field. Such pseudomagnetic field can be larger than typical magnetic fields, what gives the opportunity to experimentally study the Landau levels. In this paper we study the effects of uniaxial strain on the Weyl nodes, using continuum and lattice model. In the continuum model we show that the uniaxial strain leads to magnetic field renormalization, which in practice corresponds to the shift of the Landau levels to higher energy. We also investigate type-I and type-II Weyl nodes using lattice model. In this case, the magnetic field is introduced by the Pierels substitution, while uniaxial strain by the direction dependence of hopping integrals. This allowed us to probe the Landau level and system spectrum which takes form of Hofstadter butterfly. We show that the renormalization of magnetic field, similar to this observed in the continuum model, emerges.

Title: Ferroelectrically Switchable Chirality in Topological Superconductivity: Bilayer-MnBi2Te4/Fe(Se,Te) Heterostructure
Authors: Kai-Zhi Bai, Bo Fu, Shun-Qing Shen
Abstract: The interplay between ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity provides a rich platform for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we propose a heterostructure composed of an antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi2Te4 coupled with the s-wave superconductor Fe(Se,Te), enabling the realization of chiral topological superconductivity (CTSC) with switchable chirality. The chirality of the CTSC is controlled by the direction of spontaneous polarization, which arises from interlayer sliding-induced ferroelectricity or charge transfer in the bilayer MnBi2Te4. This sliding mechanism breaks the MzT and PT symmetries, leading to the anomalous Hall effect in the spin-polarized metallic Dirac band and drives the emergence of CTSC when the s-wave superconductivity appears. Our work not only provides a new pathway to achieve and control topological superconductivity but also opens avenues for experimental exploration of Majorana physics and topological quantum computation.

Title: Tunable Chern Insulators in Moiré-Distant and Moiré-Proximal Rhombohedral Pentalayer Graphene
Authors: Chushan Li, Zheng Sun, Kai Liu, Lei Qiao, Yifan Wei, Chuanqi Zheng, Chenyu Zhang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Hao Yang, Dandan Guan, Liang Liu, Shiyong Wang, Yaoyi Li, Hao Zheng, Canhua Liu, Bingbing Tong, Li Lu, Jinfeng Jia, Zhiwen Shi, Jianpeng Liu, Guorui Chen, Tingxin Li, Xiaoxue Liu
Abstract: Rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as an excellent platform for investigating exotic quantum states arising from the interplay between electron correlations and topology. Here, we report the electrical transport properties of a rhombohedral pentalayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride moiré device with a twist angle of 1.02° and a moiré period of approximately 10.1 nm. In this device, we observe anomalous Hall effects and integer Chern insulators in both moiré-proximal and moiré-distant regimes. Specifically, in the moiré-distant regime, an integer Chern insulator with Chern number C = 1 emerges at moiré filling {\nu} = 1 under a moderate magnetic field. In the moiré-proximal regime, we identify a rich set of topological and correlated phases near {\nu} = 1, including integer Chern insulator states with C = \pm 1 and trivial insulators, and they are highly sensitive to both the applied displacement field and magnetic field. Moreover, at {\nu} = 2 in the moiré-proximal regime, Chern insulators with C = \pm 1 has also been observed. Our results underscore the sensitivity of topological quantum states to the moiré potential strength and highlight the importance of twist-angle engineering in exploring novel quantum states in rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene moiré systems.

Title: Decoding Vibrational Signatures of Molybdenum Sulphide Molecular Catalysts for Solar Hydrogen Evolution
Authors: Pardis Adams, Jan Bühler, Angel Labordet Alvarez, David Tilley, and Mirjana Dimitrievska
Abstract: Molybdenum sulfide clusters, [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, have emerged as key molecular models for understanding active sites in Mo-S-based catalysts and as promising candidates for energy conversion applications. Despite their importance, comprehensive vibrational characterization of these clusters remains limited. Here, we present a detailed Raman and infrared spectroscopic analysis of both clusters, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. High-quality crystalline samples were synthesized and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to confirm morphology and stoichiometry. Raman spectra, acquired using 488 nm and 532 nm laser excitation, were deconvoluted using Lorentzian fitting. Vibrational mode assignments were made through direct comparison with DFT predictions. For [Mo3S4]4+, major Raman bands appear near 200 cm^-1, 350 cm^-1, and 450 cm^-1, corresponding to Mo-S-Mo bending, Mo-S stretching, and terminal sulfur vibrations. [Mo3S13]2- shows two distinct spectral regions: 100-400 cm^-1 for Mo-S and S-S bending and stretching, and 450-550 cm^-1 for terminal disulfide (S-S) stretching. Complementary IR spectra calculations reveal additional vibrational features, yielding a more complete fingerprint for each cluster. Finally, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy offers greater sensitivity than X-ray diffraction (XRD) in detecting these clusters on supporting materials. This work provides a detailed vibrational reference for [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, establishing Raman and IR spectroscopy as powerful tools for characterizing Mo-S molecular clusters in both fundamental and applied contexts.

Title: Enhancing atomic-resolution in electron microscopy: A frequency-domain deep learning denoiser
Authors: Ivan Pinto-Huguet, Marc Botifoll, Xuli Chen, Martin Borstad Eriksen, Jing Yu, Giovanni Isella, Andreu Cabot, Gonzalo Merino, Jordi Arbiol
Abstract: Atomic resolution electron microscopy, particularly high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, has become an essential tool for many scientific fields, when direct visualization of atomic arrangements and defects are needed, as they dictate the material's functional and mechanical behavior. However, achieving this precision is often hindered by noise, arising from electron microscopy acquisition limitations, particularly when imaging beam-sensitive materials or light atoms. In this work, we present a deep learning-based denoising approach that operates in the frequency domain using a convolutional neural network U-Net trained on simulated data. To generate the training dataset, we simulate FFT patterns for various materials, crystallographic orientations, and imaging conditions, introducing noise and drift artifacts to accurately mimic experimental scenarios. The model is trained to identify relevant frequency components, which are then used to enhance experimental images by applying element-wise multiplication in the frequency domain. The model enhances experimental images by identifying and amplifying relevant frequency components, significantly improving signal-to-noise ratio while preserving structural integrity. Applied to both Ge quantum wells and WS2 monolayers, the method facilitates more accurate strain quantitative analyses, critical for assessing functional device performance (e.g. quantum properties in SiGe quantum wells), and enables the clear identification of light atoms in beam sensitive materials. Our results demonstrate the potential of automated frequency-based deep learning denoising as a useful tool for atomic-resolution nano-materials analysis.

Title: Landau theory description of autferroicity
Authors: Jun-Jie Zhang, Boris I. Yakobson, Shuai Dong
Abstract: Autferroics, recently proposed as a sister branch of multiferroics, exhibit strong intrinsic magnetoelectricity, but ferroelectricity and magnetism are mutually exclusive rather than coexisting. Here, a general model is considered based on the Landau theory, to clarify the distinction between multi and autferroics by qualitative change-rotation in Landau free energy landscape and in particular phase mapping. The TiGeSe$_3$ exemplifies a factual material, whose first-principles computed Landau coefficients predict its autferroicity. Our investigations pave the way for an alternative avenue in the pursuit of intrinsically strong magnetoelectrics.

Title: Friedel Oscillations in a Two-Dimensional Electron Gas and Monolayer Graphene with a Non-Coulomb Impurity Potential
Authors: Levente Máthé, Ioan Grosu
Abstract: We study Friedel oscillations in a two-dimensional non-interacting electron gas and in a monolayer graphene in the presence of a single impurity. The potential generated by the impurity is modeled using a non-Coulomb interaction ($\sim r^{-\eta}$). The charge carrier density deviation as a function of distance from the impurity is calculated within the linear response theory. Our results show that, in both a two-dimensional non-interacting electron gas and graphene, the phase of charge carrier density oscillations remains unaffected by the parameter $\eta$, which characterizes the non-Coulomb nature of the interaction, at large distances from the impurity. The parameter $\eta$ influences only the amplitude of the oscillations in this regime. The results for an impurity modeled by Coulomb-like potential ($\eta = 1$) are recovered in both cases.

Title: Strain-Balanced Low-Temperature-Grown Beryllium-Doped InGaAs/InAlAs Superlattices for High-Performance Terahertz Photoconductors under 1550 nm Laser Excitation
Authors: Milad Entezami, Seyed Ali Hosseini Farahabadi, Man Chun Alan Tam, Andree Coschizza, Jan Kycia, Zbigniew R. Wasilewski
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the photoconductive properties of low-temperature-grown Beryllium (Be)-doped InGaAs/InAlAs strain-balanced superlattices (SLs) grown by molecular beam epitaxy under stationary growth conditions on semi-insulating InP:Fe substrates. The stationary growth approach enabled precise control over lateral gradients in layer strain, composition, and thickness across a single wafer, while strain-balancing facilitated pseudomorphic growth to explore a wide range of structural parameters, providing a robust platform to study their influence on photoconductive performance. Structural characterization confirmed high crystalline quality and smooth surface morphology in all samples. Time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy revealed subpicosecond carrier lifetimes, validating the effectiveness of strain balancing and Be doping in tuning ultrafast recombination dynamics. Hall effect measurements supported by 8-band k.p modeling revealed enhanced carrier mobility in strain-balanced SLs compared to lattice-matched structures, primarily due to reduced electron and hole effective masses and stronger quantum confinement. Additionally, optical absorption under 1550 nm excitation showed improved absorption coefficients for the strain-balanced structure, consistent with the reduction in bandgap energy predicted by theoretical modeling, thereby enhancing photon-to-carrier conversion efficiency. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy provided first-time evidence of significant Be-induced interdiffusion at the strained SL interfaces, an important factor influencing carrier transport and dynamics. These findings position low-temperature-grown Be-doped InGaAs/InAlAs strain-balanced SLs as promising materials for high-performance broadband THz photoconductive detectors operating at telecom-compatible wavelengths.

Title: Braided mixing in confined chiral active matter
Authors: Yue Wang, Jonas Berx
Abstract: Efficient mixing of fluids is essential in many practical applications to achieve homogeneity. For microscopic systems, however, both diffusion and turbulence are ineffective methods to achieve chaotic mixing due to the low Reynolds number, hence either active stirring or inducing turbulence through geometric boundary effects are generally implemented. Here, we study a modified chiral Vicsek model, where active microswimmers act as moving rods, stirring the surrounding substrate. We study the degree of mixing in the patterns formed by interplay between confinement, chiral motion and alignment interactions. This mixing is computed by considering the entanglement of spacetime trajectories of the particles, which forms a braid. Optimising the finite-time braiding exponent of this braid then yields a set of constituent parameters of the system, showing that a pattern consisting of a local stable vortex droplet and an ordered oscillating phase achieves the highest degree of mixing.

Title: Parameter Sensitivity Analysis in Zinc-Ion Batteries: A Study on Ionic Conductivity, Current Density, and Electrode Properties
Authors: Roya Rajabi, Shichen Sun, Booker Wu, Jamil Khan, Kevin Huang
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive Multiphysics model for zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), incorporating electrochemical aspects. The model integrates the mass transport of Zn2+ ions, charge transfer, and solid diffusion to predict performance parameters like cell potential, and energy density. Significant research has focused on enhancing battery performance by optimizing components of battery to improve parameters such as ionic conductivity and exchange current density and capacity. In this study, we present a model-based investigation of zinc-ion batteries, examining the impact of these parameters. Our findings reveal that at low current densities, raising of ionic conductivity beyond 1.3 S/m and exchange current density above 0.13 mA/cm2 do not yield substantial improvements in capacity. These insights underscore the importance of identifying performance thresholds in the development of next-generation batteries.

Title: Towards Sustainable Energy Storage: Evaluating Polymer Electrolytes for Zinc Ion Batteries
Authors: Roya Rajabi, Shichen Sun, Booker Wu, Jamil Khan, Kevin Huang
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes present a promising solution to the challenges posed by aqueous electrolytes in energy storage systems, offering the flexibility needed for wearable electronics. Despite the increasing interest in polymer electrolyte-based zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), their development is still in its early stages due to various challenges. In this study, we fabricated three promising polymer electrolytes: CSAM (carboxyl methyl chitosan with acrylamide monomer), PAM (polyacrylamide monomer hydrogel electrolyte), and p-PBI (Phosphoric acid (PA)-doped polybenzimidazole) with Zn(ClO4)2 and Zn(OTf)2, for their application in zinc ion batteries. Our results demonstrated that PAM hydrogel electrolyte exhibited very low LDH formation after a long cycle, demonstrating effective protection for zinc foil, and the high mechanical stability of the p-PBI membrane provided prolonged durability against short circuits through the formation of LDH. The presence of carboxyl groups in CSAM and the formation of O-H bonding facilitated ion movement, resulting in enhanced ionic conductivity, and preventing dendrite formation. Incorporating these hydrogels with high-performance zinc salts, such as zinc triflate (Zn(OTf)2), resulted in impressive stability, with the symmetric cell demonstrating over 4000 hours of uniform and stable voltage profile under 1 mA/cm2 and low overpotential of around 53 mV cycling with CSAM. The full-cell battery with PBI-T membrane showed the highest durability and capacity compared to CSAM-T and PAM-T, due to the greater availability of free protons for storing zinc in the cathode.

Title: Atomistic insight into the effects of solute and pressure on phase transformation in titanium alloys
Authors: Huicong Chen, Chenwei Shao, Zhuocheng Xie, Jun Song, Yu Zou
Abstract: The phase stability and transformation between hexagonal close-packed (hcp) {\alpha}-phase and body-centered cubic (bcc) \b{eta}-phase in titanium (Ti) alloys are critical to their mechanical properties and manufacturing processes for engineering applications. However, many factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic (e.g., solute elements and external pressures, respectively), may govern their phase transformations dynamically, which is crucial to the design of new Ti alloys with desirable properties. In this work, we study the effects of various solute elements and external hydrostatic pressures on the solid-state phase transformations in Ti alloys using density functional theory (DFT) and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations. The results show that both alloying and applied pressure reduce transformation barriers, with Al and Mo being most effective under ambient conditions, while Nb, V, Zr, and Sn show enhanced transformation kinetics under stress. Solute-induced modifications to the local electronic structure and bonding environment, particularly under pressure, contribute to variations in phase stability. We identify a synergistic interaction between solute effects and external stress, which facilitates phase transitions that are unachievable under static conditions. These findings provide atomistic insights into the coupled chemical-mechanical mechanisms underlying phase transformations in Ti alloys with improved phase stability and mechanical performance.

Title: Polar Indirect Valley as a Limiting Factor for Radiative Efficiency in Gold-Based Mixed-Valence Double Perovskites
Authors: Ange B. Chambissie Kameni, Alexandre Py-Renaudie, Damien Garrot, Baptiste Berenguier, Guillaume Bouchez, Davide Raffaele Ceratti, Philip Schulz, Jean-François Guillemoles, Géraud Delport
Abstract: Double perovskites have emerged as promising alternatives to lead halide perovskites, aiming to mitigate challenges related to toxicity and chemical instability. Among them, mixed-valence gold halides such as Cs2Au+Au3+Cl6, which contain only a single type of metal cation in two oxidation states, stand out due to their unique structural and electronic properties. These materials exhibit strong absorption in the near-infrared range, making them attractive candidates for optoelectronic applications such as photovoltaics. In this work, we employ temperature-dependent optical spectroscopy techniques to demonstrate that these compounds exhibit particularly strong polar electron-phonon coupling, which has a profound impact on their optoelectronic properties. In particular, this coupling gives rise to a temperature-dependent absorption tail that reshapes the global spectral spectrum. We show that this tail leads to a forbidden band-egde recombination, which explains the reported difficulties in detecting a photoluminescence signal from this class of double perovskites.

Title: Ferroelectric Switching in Hybrid Molecular Beam Epitaxy-Grown BaTiO3 Films
Authors: Anusha Kamath Manjeshwar, Zhifei Yang, Chin-Hsiang Liao, Jiaxuan Wen, Steven J. Koester, Richard D. James, Bharat Jalan
Abstract: Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a promising synthesis technique for both heterostructure growth and epitaxial integration of ferroelectric BaTiO3. However, a direct measurement of the remnant polarization (P_r) has not been previously reported in MBE-grown BaTiO3 films. We report the in-situ growth of an all-epitaxial SrRuO3/BaTiO3/SrRuO3 heterostructure on Nb-doped SrTiO3 (001) substrates by hybrid MBE using metal-organic precursors. This capacitor structure consisting of 16 nm SrRuO3/40 nm BaTiO3/16 nm SrRuO3 shows hysteretic polarization-electric field (P-E) curves with P_r = 15 {\mu}C cm-2 at frequencies ranging from 500 Hz to 20 kHz, after isolating the intrinsic ferroelectric response from non-ferroelectric contributions using the Positive-Up-Negative-Down (PUND) method. We hypothesize that the asymmetry in switching behavior and current leakage has origins in structural defects.

Title: New quantum state formed by highly concentrated protons in superconducting palladium hydride
Authors: Ryoma Kato, Ten-ichiro Yoshida, Riku Iimori, Tai Zizhou, Masanobu Shiga, Yuji Inagaki, Takashi Kimura, Koichiro Ienaga, Tatsuya Kawae
Abstract: Hydrogen exhibits quantum phenomena, such as tunneling in materials. According to theory, the quantum properties of hydrogen change significantly in superconductors due to the emergence of an energy gap on the Fermi surface, which reduces the interaction between hydrogen nucleus (i.e., proton) and conduction electrons. This reduction is predicted to enhance the tunneling probability of protons. Here, we report the double transitions of the electrical resistivity in high-quality palladium hydride (PdHx) and deuteride (PdDx) prepared by low-temperature absorption below T = 180 K. After a sharp drop in the resistivity at T ~ 2 K owing to the superconducting transition of PdH(D)x, a large residual resistivity remained. Additionally, the resistivity dropped to zero below T = 1 K. The experimental results suggest that the quantum tunneling of highly concentrated protons (deuterons) in the superconducting state is responsible for the observed features: the residual resistivity arises from the weakening of the global coherence of superconductivity owing to the tunneling motion of protons (deuterons), while the zero resistivity is caused by long-range ordering of the protons (deuterons). This system offers a new platform for investigating the quantum many-body properties of tunneling particles.

Title: Altermagnetic type-II Multiferroics with Néel-order-locked Electric Polarization
Authors: Wen-Ti Guo, Junqi Xu, Huaiqiang Wang, Haijun Zhang
Abstract: Altermagnetism, an emergent magnetic phase featuring compensated collinear magnetic moments and momentum-dependent spin splittings, has recently garnered widespread interest. A pivotal issue concerns whether the unconventional spin structures can generate spontaneous electric polarization in altermagnets, thereby achieving type-II multiferroicity. Here, with the combination of symmetry analysis and microscopic theory, we explicitly demonstrate the generation of electric polarization by altermagnetic Néel order, and establish a microscopic mechanism of Néel-order-locked electric polarization in altermagnetic multiferroics. We further reveal these pronounced magnetoelectric coupling behaviors and classify them into eight distinct categories for two-dimensional altermagnets governed by layer group symmetries. Then we take monolayer MgFe$_2$N$_2$ as a prototypical example of altermagnetic multiferroics by first-principles calculations. We also propose to identify the Néel order orientation and accompanying electric polarization in altermagnetic multiferroics by magneto-optical microscopy. Bridging type-II multiferroics and altermagnets, our work could pave the way for altermagnetic multifunctional spintronics.

Title: Quasi-BICs due to symmetry mismatch in architected elastic plates
Authors: Adib Rahman, Sean Perkins, Raj Kumar Pal
Abstract: We report the existence of quasi-bound modes in the continuum (quasi-BICs) in architected elastic plates based on a square lattice. The structure consists of topologically trivial and nontrivial lattices, forming an interface and maintaining C2 symmetry. Carefully engineered interface gives rise to center quasi-BICs. We show how the mismatch in symmetry between the Bloch modes of the lattice and the defect modes confine them at the defect center, resulting in quasi-BICs. Our analysis begins with a square lattice-based spring-mass system. Finite element simulations on an architected plate comprising of slender curved and straight beams to achieve the desired stiffness variation predict quasi-BICs analogous to those in the discrete model. These predictions are validated with Laser Doppler vibrometry based experiments, confirming the presence of a quasi-BIC in the structure. The concept of quasi-BICs arising from modal symmetry mismatch paves the way for achieving localized modes in elastic structures, with potential applications as resonators.

Title: Probing quantum geometric capacitance via photonic spin Hall effect
Authors: Yahir Fernández-Méndez, Ramón Carrillo-Bastos, Jesús A. Maytorena
Abstract: The non-dissipative quasistatic longitudinal optical response of insulators is characterized by an intrinsic geometric capacitance, determined by the ratio of the quantum metric to the energy gap, as recently stablished. We study the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in this low-frequency regime, induced by reflection from an atomically thin material serving as the interface between two dielectrics. As a function of the magnitude of this geometric capacitance, covering values typical of graphene-family systems and for incidence close to the Brewster angle, the calculated in-plane and transverse beam shifts become comparable to the wavelength and thus detectable. At sufficiently low frequencies, we derive linear and quadratic approximations that allow the geometric capacitance to be extracted from measurements of the beam displacements. We provide an upper bound for the beam shifts. The results suggest that THz PSHE might be a useful probe of the quantum geometric capacitance of two-dimensional insulators.

Title: Nonlinear spin and orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects induced by a femtosecond laser pulse: Simulations for Au(001)
Authors: Oliver Busch, Franziska Ziolkowski, Börge Göbel, Ingrid Mertig, Jürgen Henk
Abstract: Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling gives rise to distinctive surface and interface phenomena, such as spin-momentum locking and spin splitting. In nonequilibrium settings, one of the key manifestations is the (Rashba-)Edelstein effect, where an electric current generates a net spin or orbital polarization perpendicular to the current direction. While the steady-state behavior of these effects is well studied, their dynamics on ultrafast timescales remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of the ultrafast spin and orbital Edelstein effects on an Au(001) surface, triggered by excitation with a femtosecond laser pulse. These effects are intrinsic and inherently nonlinear. Using a real-space tight-binding model combined with time evolution governed by the von Neumann equation, we simulate the electron dynamics in response to the pulse. Our results reveal pronounced differences between the spin and orbital responses, offering detailed insights into their distinct temporal profiles and magnitudes. We further explore the associated charge, spin, and orbital currents, including the emergence of laser-induced spin and orbital Hall effects. Finally, we quantify the angular momentum transfer mediated by the light-matter interaction. These findings shed light on the intricate ultrafast dynamics driven by spin-orbit coupling and offer guidance for the design of next-generation spintronic and orbitronic devices.

Title: Exact diagonalization study of triangular Heisenberg model with four-spin ring-exchange interaction
Authors: Yuchao Zheng, Muwei Wu, Dao-Xin Yao, Han-Qing Wu
Abstract: Using Lanczos exact diagonalization (ED), we study the spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model with the four-spin ring-exchange interaction $J_r$ on triangular lattice. We mainly use the level spectroscopic technique of two 36-site tori to investigate the ground-state phase diagram, and further characterize phases by spin, dimer and chiral correlation functions. The ground state has rich phases including several magnetic ordered phases like zigzag phase and tetrahedral phase, as well as several novel nonmagnetic phases, some of which exhibit valence bond solid behavior in their dimer correlation functions. However, we do not find direct evidence of a quantum spin liquid phase with spinon Fermi surface in this model. Our results can give a better understanding of the ground-state properties of the triangular Heisenberg model with ring-exchange interaction, and help to understand the relevant triangular materials.

Title: Dynamical dimerization and subdiffusive transport of strongly correlated neutral-ionic systems coupled to lattices
Authors: Yuta Sakai, Chisa Hotta
Abstract: We study the Monte Carlo dynamics of strongly correlated classical particles coupled to lattice degrees of freedom that exhibit the neutral-ionic transitions in one dimension, relevant to the organic compounds TTF-CA and TTF-BA. The particles carrying up and down spins suffer strong Coulomb interactions and undergo a neutral-to-ionic transition when the alternating site potentials become small, accompanying the charge transfer to the higher energy sites. The model is already shown to exhibit the enhancement of conductivity near the neutral-to-ionic crossover, which is carried by the neutral-ionic domain walls (NIDWs) that show diffusive character. Here, by incorporating local lattice dimerization effects, the motion of NIDWs becomes subdiffusive, and the conductivity is enhanced by one order of magnitude. When the ionic and dimerized states coexist, the strong fluctuation of dimer configuration supports the antiferromagnetic spin correlation, suppresses Pauli blocking, and subsequently enhances the motion of NIDWs. Our results highlight the crucial role of local and fluctuating dimerization in governing transport and ferroelectric properties near neutral-ionic transitions.

Title: Nonvolatile Cryogenic Phase Slip Memory with Single-Shot Readout
Authors: Lukas Nulens, Davi A. D. Chaves, Stijn Reniers, Ruben Dillemans, Ivo P. C. Cools, Kristiaan Temst, Bart Raes, Margriet J. Van Bael, Joris Van de Vondel
Abstract: The demand for cryogenic memory components is driven by the need for ultra-fast, low-power, and highly reliable computing systems. Phase slip-based devices promise to fulfill all these requirements, with potential applications in both classical and quantum information processing. However, previous implementations have faced challenges due to inefficient writing and readout schemes. In this work, we address these limitations with a simple device design and measurement techniques inspired by circuit quantum electrodynamics. We present a memory element that stores information in the winding of a high-kinetic inductance superconducting loop, inductively coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator. Using single-shot measurements, we achieve a readout fidelity of 99.698\% with an active measurement time of just 25 ns.

Title: Three types of condensation in open wedges
Authors: Jiří Janek, Alexandr Malijevský
Abstract: Condensation in linear wedges formed by semi-infinite walls is a well-established critical phenomenon characterized by the continuous growth of an adsorbed liquid layer as bulk two-phase coexistence is approached. In this study, we investigate condensation in finite-length wedges open at both ends, demonstrating that the process becomes first-order. The open boundaries and finite geometry induce a remarkably rich phase behavior of the confined fluid, exhibiting three distinct types of condensation, reentrant phenomena, and continuous higher-order transitions between condensation states. Through a detailed macroscopic analysis, we derive the conditions for each type of condensation, classify the global phase diagrams, and explore asymptotic behavior in specific limiting cases. The asymptotic predictions are confirmed by a detailed comparison with the numerical solutions of the governing equations.

Title: How to Train an Oscillator Ising Machine using Equilibrium Propagation
Authors: Alex Gower
Abstract: We show that Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) are prime candidates for use as neuromorphic machine learning processors with Equilibrium Propagation (EP) based on-chip learning. The inherent energy gradient descent dynamics of OIMs, combined with their standard CMOS implementation using existing fabrication processes, provide a natural substrate for EP learning. Our simulations confirm that OIMs satisfy the gradient-descending update property necessary for a scalable Equilibrium Propagation implementation and achieve 97.2(1)% test accuracy on the MNIST dataset without requiring any hardware modifications. Importantly, OIMs maintain robust performance under realistic hardware constraints, including moderate phase noise and 10-bit parameter quantization. These results establish OIMs as a promising platform for fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, potentially enabling energy-based learning algorithms that have been previously constrained by computational limitations.

Title: Translational-Symmetry-Broken Magnetization Plateaux of the $S=3/2$ Anisotropic Antiferromagnetic Chain
Authors: Tomohide Kawatsu, Haruto Suzuki, Masaru Hashimoto, Koki Doi, Tomoki Houda, Rito Furuchi, Hiroki Nakano, Kiyomi Okamoto, Tôru Sakai
Abstract: The magnetization process of the $S=3/2$ quantum spin chain with the $XXZ$ anisotropy and the single-ion anisotropy $D$ is investigated using the numerical diagonalization of finite-size clusters and the level spectroscopy analysis. We obtain the phase diagrams at 1/3 and 2/3 of the saturation magnetization to find that the translational-symmetry-broken magnetization plateau appears for the first time. The similarity and the difference between the phase diagrams of the present model and the related models are discussed by use of the discrete parameters of the models. In addition several typical magnetization curves are presented.

Title: Diffuson-Dominated Thermal Transport Crossover from Ordered to Liquid-like Cu$_3$BiS$_3$:The Negligible Role of Ion Hopping
Authors: Jincheng Yue, Jiongzhi Zheng, Xingchen Shen, Chun-Chuen Yang, Shuyao Lin, Yanhui Liu, Tian Cui
Abstract: Fundamentally understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport behavior in liquid-like, partially occupied compounds remains a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we investigate the microscopic mechanisms underlying the ultralow thermal conductivity in ordered/liquid-like Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ by combining experimental methods with first-principles calculations. We first experimentally synthesize and characterize the ordered structure and liquid-like, partially Cu-atom occupied Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ structure with increasing temperature. We then combine self-consistent phonon calculations, including bubble-diagram corrections, with the Wigner transport equation, considering both phonon propagation and diffuson contributions, to evaluate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal conductivity in phase-change Cu$_3$BiS$_3$. Our theoretical model predicts an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.34 W/m/K at 400 K, dominated by diffuson contributions, which accurately reproduces and explains the experimental data. Importantly, the machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations not only reproduced the partially Cu-atom occupied Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ structure with the space group $\mathrm{P2_12_12_1}$ but also successfully replicated the thermal conductivity obtained from experiments and Wigner transport calculations. This observation highlights the negligible impact of ionic mobility arising from partially occupied Cu sites on the thermal conductivity in diffuson-dominated thermal transport compounds. Our work not only sheds light on the minimal impact of ionic mobility on ultralow thermal conductivity in phase-change materials but also demonstrates that the Wigner transport equation accurately describes thermal transport behavior in partially occupied phases with diffuson-dominant thermal transport.

Title: Construction of First Principle Based Adiabatic and Diabatic Hamiltonian for TiO$_6^{8-}$ unit of BaTiO$_3$ Crystal: Photoemission Spectra and Ferroelectricity
Authors: Mantu Kumar Sah, Soumya Mukherjee, Satyam Ravi, Satrajit Adhikari
Abstract: The ferroelectric property of BaTiO$_3$ crystal arises from the strong Pseudo Jahn-Teller (PJT) interactions between the non-degenerate ground electronic state, $^1A_{1g}$ and the degenerate $^1T_{1u}$ symmetry states through the nuclear distortions of $t_{1u}$ modes in TiO$_6^{8-}$ unit. In a $d^0$ electronic configuration of $Ti^{4+}$ ion, the PJT interaction leads to a stabilization effect, which has been explored using Beyond Born-Oppenheimer (BBO) theory. The $^1T_{1u}$ excited states form a three-state degeneracy, exhibiting feeble Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions over the $t_{2g}$ planes. For the first time, we compute \textit{ab initio} adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) and non-adiabatic coupling terms (NACTs), and thereafter, diabatic PESs and couplings for the perovskite unit, TiO$_6^{8-}$. Using a Time-Dependent Discrete Variable Representation (TDDVR) approach, the theoretical photoemission spectra exhibit good agreement with the experimental ones. Moreover, the experimental observation on order parameter associated with ferroelectric properties of BaTiO$_3$ crystal show close resemblance with present and other theoretical predictions.

Title: Optimizing proximitized magnetic topological insulator nanoribbons for Majorana bound states
Authors: Eduárd Zsurka, Daniele Di Miceli, Julian Legendre, Llorenç Serra, Detlev Grützmacher, Thomas L. Schmidt, Kristof Moors
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulator (MTI) nanoribbons proximitized by an $s$-wave superconductor (PNRs) are a potential platform for the practical realization of Majorana bound states (MBSs). As with all MBS platforms, disorder and device imperfections can be detrimental to the formation of robust and well-separated MBSs that are suitable for fusion and braiding experiments. Here, we identify the optimal conditions for obtaining a topological superconducting gap that is robust against disorder, with spatially separated stable MBSs in PNRs, and introduce a figure of merit that encompasses these conditions. Particular attention is given to the thin-film limit of MTIs, where the hybridization of the surface states cannot be neglected, and to the role of electron-hole asymmetry in the low-energy physics of the system. Based on our numerical results, we find that (1) MTI thin films that are normal (rather than quantum spin Hall) insulators for zero magnetization are favorable, (2) strong electron-hole asymmetry causes the stability and robustness of MBS to be very different for chemical potentials above or below the Dirac point, and (3) the magnetization strength should preferably be comparable to the hybridization or confinement energy of the surface states, whichever is largest.

Title: Topological Surface States of 3D Topological Insulator on Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Yoonkang Kim
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the topological surface states (TSS) of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a 3D topological insulator, epitaxially grown on twisted bilayer graphene (tBG). The moiré potential induced by tBG folds the TSS Dirac cone into the moiré Brillouin zone (MBZ), resulting in mini-gap openings, band flattening, and the potential emergence of secondary Dirac points. Using effective field theory, symmetry analysis, and higher-order perturbation theory, we analyze both commensurate and incommensurate twist angles, revealing significant band structure reconstruction in periodic systems and quasi-periodic effects in incommensurate ones.

Title: Unraveling the storage mechanism of Na$_{3}$V$_{2-x}$Ni$_x$(PO$_4$)$_2$F$_3$/C cathodes for sodium-ion batteries through electrochemical, {\it operando} X-ray diffraction and microscopy studies
Authors: Simranjot K. Sapra, Jeng-Kuei Chang, Rajendra S. Dhaka
Abstract: The storage mechanism and diffusion kinetics of Na$_{3}$V$_{2-x}$Ni$_{x}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{2}$F$_{3}$/C ($x=$ 0--0.07) cathodes are investigated through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). All the samples are prepared through the facile pH-assisted sol-gel route and crystallize in the P4$_{2}$/mnm symmetry. The optimal doping of Ni ($x=$ 0.05) exhibits superior specific capacities of 119 and 100 mAh g$^{-1}$ at 0.1 C and 10 C rates, respectively, along the excellent capacity retention of 78\% after 2000 cycles at 10 C rate with nearly 100\% Coulombic efficiency. The apparent diffusion coefficient values are found to be in the range of 10$^{-9}$--10$^{-10}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$ through detailed analysis of CV and GITT. Moreover, we report the reversible structural evolution and morphological changes during charging and discharging under non-equilibrium conditions through the {\it operando} X-ray diffraction and the {\it in-situ} synchrotron based transmission X-ray microscopy, respectively. Further, to understand the stability mechanism and obtain precise polarization values, we performed the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis using the EIS data. The structure and morphology are found to be stable after long cycling.

Title: Impurity dynamics in a zero-temperature gas
Authors: Umesh Kumar, Abhishek Dhar, P. L. Krapivsky
Abstract: If energy is suddenly released in a localized region of space uniformly filled with identical stationary hard spheres of radii $a$, the outcome is a blast with an asymptotically spherical shock wave separating moving and stationary hard spheres. The radius of the region filled with the moving spheres grows as $R\sim (E t^2/n_\infty)^{1/(d+2)}$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension, $n_\infty$ the number density of stationary spheres and $E$ is the total energy injected. The simplest way to inject energy is to kick a few `impurity' particles. Using hydrodynamics and kinetic theory, we argue that the typical displacement of an impurity scales as $R_{\rm imp} \sim \lambda (R/\lambda)^{(4+3d^2)/(8+3d^2)}$, where $\lambda\sim 1/(n_\infty a^{d-1})$ is the mean-free path in the initial state. The number of collisions experienced by each impurity is $(R/\lambda)^{(8+2d^2)/(8+3d^2)}$, while its average speed decreases as $t^{-d(8-2d+3d^2)/[(2+d)(8+3d^2)]}$. In $2D$, the predictions for impurity displacement, collision numbers, and speed are $t^{2/5},~t^{2/5}$ and $t^{-2/5}$, respectively. These predictions are in reasonable agreement with the results of molecular dynamics simulations.

Title: Many-body critical phase in a quasiperiodic chain and dynamical Widom lines in Fock space properties
Authors: Nilanjan Roy, Subroto Mukerjee, Sumilan Banerjee
Abstract: We study a quasiperiodic model in one dimension, namely the extended Aubry-André-Harper (EAAH) chain, that realizes a critical phase comprising entirely single-particle critical states in the non-interacting limit. In the presence of short-range interactions, the non-interacting critical phase transforms to a many-body critical (MBC) phase, separated by lines of MBC-ergodic, MBC-many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic-MBL phase transitions that meet at a triple point. We elucidate the unusual characteristics of the MBC phase compared to the ergodic and MBL phases through the localization properties of the excitations in real space and Fock space (FS), and eigenstate inverse participation ratio (IPR). We show that the MBC phase, like the MBL phase, is well described by a multifractal scaling of the IPR and a linear finite-size scaling ansatz near the transition to the ergodic and MBL phases. However, the MBC phase, at the same time, exhibits delocalization of all single-particle excitations and a system-size dependent Fock-space localization length, analogous to the ergodic phase. Remarkably, we find evidence of unusual Widom lines on the phase diagram in the form of lines of pronounced peaks or dips in the FS localization properties inside the MBC and MBL phases. These Widom lines either emerge as a continuation of the precursor phase transition line, terminating at the triple point, or originate from a phase boundary.

Title: Comparing the performance of direct and parametric drives for piezoelectric MEMS actuators
Authors: Samer Houri, Veronique Rochus
Abstract: This work investigates and compares the response of piezoelectrically actuated nonlinear microelectromechanical devices (MEMS) to direct and to degenerate parametric drives. We describe the regime of degenerate parametric amplification in piezoelectric Duffing-type nonlinear MEMS devices using a single mode expansion, we then explore the existence of regions in parameter space where parametric excitation maybe advantageous compared to direct drive, which we label "parametric advantage". Analytical, experimental, and numerical verification demonstrates that parametric advantage can not exist if both pump and signal voltages are accounted for in the total voltage budget. This work determines non-dimensional scaling rules that can act as guidelines for selecting an optimal operating regime for degenerate parametric amplification.

Title: Two-dimensional M2X2 family with emerging semiconducting, semimetallic, and magnetic properties
Authors: Yasin Yekta, Hamidreza Ramezani, Hanif Hadipour, Seyed Akbar Jafari
Abstract: The exploration for novel two-dimensional (2D) materials with diverse electronic characteristics has attracted growing interest in recent years. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have predicted a new family of 2D transition-metal (TM) based compounds under the nomenclature M_2X_2 (where M represents TMs, and X denotes chalcogen elements like S, Se, and Te). Our investigation delves into the examination of the formation energies, dynamical/thermal stabilities, mechanical properties, electronic structures, and magnetic properties of various systems within this family. Through our computational analyses, we have discovered a total of 35 thermodynamically and dynamically stable M_2X_2 monolayer materials that exhibit remarkable diversity in terms of their electronic and magnetic properties. Our findings will pave the way for the experimental realization of various M_2X_2 structures in the near future. In particular, among the predicted compounds, M_2X_2(M=Zn, Cd; X=S, Se, Te) are a direct band-gap semiconductor with band gaps between 0.9 to 2.6 eV (1.3 to 3.7 eV) by DFT+PBE (hybrid functional HSE) calculations. M_2X_2(M=Ti, Zr, Hf, Tc, Re) are zero-gap semiconductor (semimetals) in standard DFT+PBE calculation. Inclusion of spin-orbit coupling leads to a gap opening of 0.1 eV. Notably, our analysis has also unveiled the magnetic nature of certain materials, such as Mn_2X_2(X=S, Se), Fe_2X_2(X=Se, Te), and Ti_2Te_2. The prediction of semiconducting (magnetic) M_2X_2 materials not only offers valuable insights into the underlying electronic properties (magnetism) of 2D systems but also positions these materials as promising candidates for the development of advanced electronic (spintronic) devices.

Title: Time-Reversal Symmetry Protected Transport at Correlated Oxide Interfaces
Authors: Mengke Ha, Qing Xiao, Zhiyuan Qin, Dawei Qiu, Longbing Shang, Xinyi Liu, Pu Yan, Changjian Ma, Danqing Liu, Chengyuan Huang, Zhenlan Chen, Haoyuan Wang, Chang-Kui Duan, Zhaoliang Liao, Wei-Tao Liu, Yang Gao, Kecheng Cao, Jiangfeng Du, Guanglei Cheng
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry (TRS) protection is core to topological physics, yet its role in correlated oxides-typically non-topological-remains underexplored. This limit hampers the potential in engineering exotic quantum states by fusing TRS protection and the rich emergent phenomena in the oxide platform. Here, we report evidence of a TRS-protected subband at oxygen vacancy-free LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces. This subband causes a low-field quantum oscillation with anomalous characters: exceptionally light electron mass, aperiodicity, and susceptibility to magnetic fields. All findings align with a Rashba model in which TRS-protected transport occurs along quasi-1D ferroelastic domain walls, which possess a Dirac band topology and a giant Rashba spin-orbit coupling, two orders stronger than the 2D interface. Our results deepen the understanding of SrTiO3-based electron systems, unveiling an appealing new platform for quantum engineering.

Title: Simple scaling rules governing work functions of two-dimensional materials
Authors: James C. Ellenbogen, Sahasra Yellepeddi, Zev Goldhaber-Gordon
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that values of work functions W for a variety of planar and buckled two-dimensional (2D) materials scale linearly as a function of the quantity 1/r_{WS}, where r_{WS} is the Wigner-Seitz radius for a 2D material. Simple procedures are prescribed for estimating r_{WS}. Using them, this linear scaling relation, which is founded in electrostatics, provides a quick and easy method for calculating values of W from basic, readily available structural information about the materials. These easily determined values of W are seen to be very accurate when compared to values from the literature. Those derive from experiment or from challenging, computationally intensive density-functional-theory calculations. Values from those sources also conform to the linear scaling rules. Since values of W predicted by the rules so closely match known values of W, the simple scaling methods described here also are applied to predict W for 2D materials (TiN, BSb, SiGe, and GaP) for which no values have appeared previously in the literature.

Title: Half-Ice, Half-Fire Driven Ultranarrow Phase Crossover in 1D Decorated q-State Potts Ferrimagnets: An AI-Co-Led Discovery
Authors: Weiguo Yin
Abstract: OpenAI's reasoning model o3-mini-high was used to carry out an exact analytic study of one-dimensional ferrimagnetic decorated $q$-state Potts models. We demonstrate that the finite-temperature ultranarrow phase crossover (UNPC), driven by a hidden "half-ice, half-fire" state in the $q=2$ Potts (Ising) model, persists for $q>2$. We identify novel features for $q>2$, including the dome structure in the field-temperature phase diagram and for large $q$ a secondary high-temperature UNPC to the fully disordered paramagnetic state. The ice-fire mechanism of spin flipping can be applied to higher-dimensional Potts models. These results establish a versatile framework for engineering controlled fast state-flipping switches in low-dimensional systems. Our nine-level AI-contribution rating assigns AI the meritorious status of AI-co-led discovery in this work.

Title: Interfacial superconductivity in Cu/Cu$_{\rm{2}}$O and its effect on shielding ambient electric fields
Authors: Dale R. Harshman, Anthony T. Fiory
Abstract: A model is presented for two-dimensional superconductivity at semiconductor-on-metal interfaces mediated by Coulomb interactions between electronically-active interface charges in the semiconductor and screening charges in the metal. The junction considered is native Cu$_{\rm{2}}$O on Cu in which an interfacial double charge layer of areal density $n$, comprising superconducting holes in Cu$_{\rm{2}}$O and mediating electrons in Cu, is induced in proportion to a sub-monolayer of adsorbed $^{\rm{4}}\rm{He}$ atoms. Evidence for superconductivity on copper with prior air exposure is revealed in new analysis of previously published work function data. Based on a theory developed for layered superconductors, the intrinsic transition temperature $T_{\rm{C}}$ = $\beta$ $n$$^{\rm{1/2}}$/$\zeta$ is determined by $n$ and transverse distance $\zeta$ $\simeq$ 2.0 $\rm{Å}$ between the charge layers; $\beta$ = 1.933(6) $e$$^{\rm{2}}$$\bar{\lambda}$$_{\rm{C}}$/k$_{\rm{B}}$ = 1247.4(3.7) K-$\rm{Å}$$^{\rm{2}}$ is a universal constant involving the reduced Compton wavelength of the electron $\bar{\lambda}$$_{\rm{C}}$. This model is applied to understanding the shielding of copper work-function patch and gravitational compression electric fields reported in the Witteborn-Fairbank gravitational electron free fall experiment. Interfacial superconductivity with $n$ $\simeq$ 1.6 $\times$ 10$^{\rm{12}}$ $\rm{cm}^{\rm{-2}}\rm{,}$ $T_{\rm{C}}$ $\simeq$ 7.9 K and Berezinskiĭ-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature $T_{\rm{BKT}}$ $\simeq$ 4.4 K accounts for the shielding observed at temperature $T$ $\simeq$ 4.2 K. Helium desorption and concomitant decreases in $n$ and $T_{\rm{C}}$ replicate the temperature transition in ambient electric fields on falling electrons, as observed by Lockhart et al., and the vanishing of superconductivity above $T$ $\simeq$ 4.8 K.

Title: A universal scaling law for active diffusion in complex media
Authors: Qun Zhang, Yuxin Tian, Xue Zhang, Xiaoting Yu, Hongwei Zhu, Ning Zheng, Luhui Ning, Ran Ni, Mingcheng Yang, Peng Liu
Abstract: Using granular experiments and computer simulations, we investigate the long-time diffusion of active tracers in a broad class of complex media composed of frozen obstacles of diverse structures. By introducing a dimensionless persistence length $Q = v_d \tau_r / d_t$, we propose a modified scaling relation that independently collapses experimental and simulation results across active and passive particles, diverse media, and distinct propulsion mechanisms. Our results reveal a universal active diffusion-structure relation that holds across both equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes, providing a simple predictive framework for active diffusion in complex environments.

Title: 2D van der Waals magnets: from fundamental physics to applications
Authors: Je-Geun Park, Kaixuan Zhang, Hyeonsik Cheong, Jae Hoon Kim, Carina Belvin, David Hsieh, Honglie Ning, Nuh Gedik
Abstract: Magnetism has played a central role in the long and rich history of modern condensed matter physics, with many foundational insights originating from theoretical studies of two-dimensional (2D) spin systems. The discovery of 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets has revolutionized this area by providing real, atomically thin magnetic systems for experimental investigation. Since the first experimental reports of antiferromagnetic vdW insulators in 2016 - followed by studies on ferromagnetic vdW systems in 2017 - the field has witnessed rapid and expansive growth, with more than two dozen vdW magnetic materials now identified, including both ferro- and antiferromagnets. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the major scientific and technological developments in this rapidly evolving field. These include experimental realizations of various 2D spin Hamiltonians as well as unexpected phenomena such as magnetic excitons, Floquet-engineered states, and light-induced metastable magnetic phases. In parallel, 2D vdW magnets have shown significant promise in spintronics and related applications, offering a new platform for engineering quantum functionalities. We organize this review by tracing the historical development of the field, synthesizing key milestones, and highlighting its broader impact across condensed matter physics and materials science. We conclude with an Outlook section that outlines several promising directions for future research, aiming to chart a path forward in this vibrant and still rapidly growing area.

Title: Electrical generation of surface plasmon polaritons in plasmonic heterostructures
Authors: Maxim Trushin
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) can be understood as two-dimensional light confined to a conductor-dielectric interface via plasmonic excitations. While low-energy SPPs behave similarly to photons, higher-frequency SPPs resemble surface plasmons. Generating mid-range SPPs is particularly challenging due to their momentum mismatch with photons and energy mismatch with plasmons. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that graphene's ability to sustain a high bias and support a strongly non-equilibrium steady-state electron-hole population enables near-infrared SPP generation in plasmonic van der Waals heterostructures composed of undoped monolayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and silver (Ag). We show that this mechanism requires neither optical gratings nor electron tunneling to produce non-thermal, bias-tunable SPP emission, which is uniform along the Ag-hBN interface and achieves an internal conversion efficiency of up to $10^{-3}$ with the Purcell factor of up to 100. These findings pave the way for integrating photonic and electronic functionalities within a single two-dimensional heterostructure.

Title: Learning simple heuristic rules for classifying materials based on chemical composition
Authors: Andrew Ma, Marin Soljačić
Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant interest in the use of machine learning approaches in materials science research. Conventional deep learning approaches that rely on complex, nonlinear models have become increasingly important in computational materials science due to their high predictive accuracy. In contrast to these approaches, we have shown in a recent work that a remarkably simple learned heuristic rule -- based on the concept of topogivity -- can classify whether a material is topological using only its chemical composition. In this paper, we go beyond the topology classification scenario by also studying the use of machine learning to develop simple heuristic rules for classifying whether a material is a metal based on chemical composition. Moreover, we present a framework for incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias based on the structure of the periodic table. For both the topology classification and the metallicity classification tasks, we empirically characterize the performance of simple heuristic rules fit with and without chemistry-informed inductive bias across a wide range of training set sizes. We find evidence that incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias can reduce the amount of training data required to reach a given level of test accuracy.

Title: Translational Symmetry Broken Magnetization Plateau of the $S={{1}\over{2}}$ Anisotropic Spin Ladder with Ferromagnetic Rung Interaction
Authors: Tôru Sakai, Koki Doi, Kiyomi Okamoto, Kouichi Okunishi, Masaru Hashimoto, Tomoki Houda, Rito Furuchi, Hiroki Nakano
Abstract: The magnetization process of the $S=1/2$ anisotropic spin ladder with the ferromagnetic rung interaction is investigated using the numerical diagonalization of finite-size clusters. It is found that the translational symmetry broken magnetization plateau would appear at half the saturation magnetization, when the competing anisotropies are sufficiently large. The phase diagram with respect to the anisotropies and several magnetization curves are presented.

Title: Magnetization Plateau of the $S={1 \over 2}$ Distorted Diamond Spin Chain with Ferromagnetic Interaction
Authors: Masaru Hashimoto, Koki Doi, Tomoki Houda, Rito Furuchi, Hiroki Nakano, Kiyomi Okamoto, Tôru Sakai
Abstract: The magnetization process of the $S=1/2$ distorted diamond spin chain with ferromagnetic interactions is investigated using the numerical diagonalization of finite-size clusters. The level spectroscopy analysis applied for the model with the spin anisotropy indicates that two different magnetization plateau phases appear at 1/3 of the saturation magnetization. The phase diagrams for some typical interaction parameters are presented. In addition the magnetization curves for several typical parameters are obtained.

Title: A Unified Theory of Unusual Anisotropic Magnetoresistance and Unidirectional Magnetoresistance in Nanoscale Bilayers
Authors: X. R. Wang
Abstract: Nanoscale bilayers containing at least one magnetic layer exhibit universal unusual anisotropic magnetoresistance (UAMR) and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR). They are currently understood through various mechanisms related to the interconversion of charge current and spin current, giant magnetoresistance, thermal magnonic effects, thermoelectric effects, and diverse spindependent scattering processes. This raises a fundamental question: do the universal behaviors observed in a wide range of systems stem from underlying general principles? We demonstrate here that both UAMR and UMR arise from electron transport influenced by the magnetization vector present in the magnetic material and the interfacial potential inherent in heterostructures. Specifically, UAMR represents current-independent resistance (resistivity) of bilayers. UMR is the resistance proportional to the current although electron transports of the bilayers are the linear response to high current densities and their induced thermal gradients. Our theory introduces a novel approach that considers the interplay between the magnetization vector, thermal gradients, and the effective internal electric field at the interface. This framework provides a unified explanation for both UMR and UAMR, effectively capturing key experimental features such as dependence on current direction, magnetization orientation, film thickness, and magnetic field strength. Furthermore, it offers a universal perspective that bridges UMR and UAMR effects, enhancing our understanding of spin-dependent transport phenomena in bilayers.

Title: Field Theory of Superconductor and Charged Vortex
Authors: Yoonbai Kim, SeungJun Jeon, Hanwool Song
Abstract: A Lagrangian of a Schrödinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral scalar field of acoustic phonon with constant background charge density is proposed for an effective field theory of conventional superconductivity. We find static charged vortex solutions of finite energy and, for the critical couplings of the quartic self-interaction coupling of complex scalar field and the cubic Yukawa type coupling between neutral and complex scalar field, these charged vortices saturate the BPS (Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield) bound, that guarantees the nonperturbative classification of type I and II superconductors.

Title: Non-equilibrium transport and phonon branch-resolved size effects based on a multi-temperature kinetic model
Authors: Chuang Zhang, Houssem Rezgui, Meng Lian, Hong Liang
Abstract: Non-equilibrium transport and phonon branch-resolved size effects in single-layer graphene materials are studied under a multi-temperature kinetic model, which is developed for capturing the branch-dependent electron-phonon coupling. Compared with typical macroscopic multi-temperature models, the assumption of diffusive phonon transport is abandoned in this model and replaced by the free migration and scattering of particles. The phonon branch- and size-dependent effective thermal conductivity is predicted in nanosized graphene as well as the temperature slips near the boundaries. Compared with other phonon branches, the ZA branch contributes the most to thermal conduction regardless of system sizes. Furthermore, in nanosized homogeneous graphene with a hotspot at the center, the branch-dependent thermal conductivity increases from the inside to the outside even if the system size is fixed. The thermal conductivity of ZA branch is even higher than the lattice thermal conductivity when the system size is hundreds of nanometers.

Title: High-Throughput GW Calculations via Machine Learning
Authors: Ragab. A.Abdelghany, Chih-En Hsu, Hung-Chung Hsueh, Yuan-Hong Tsai, Ming-Chiang Chung
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) framework that predicts $G_0W_0$ quasiparticle energies across molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories with high accuracy and efficiency. Using only DFT-derived mean-field eigenvalues and exchange-correlation potentials, the model is trained on 25\% of MD snapshots and achieves RMSEs below 0.1 eV. It accurately reproduces k-resolved quasiparticle band structures and density of states, even for BN polymorphs excluded from the training data. This approach bypasses the computational bottlenecks of $G_0W_0$ simulations over dynamic configurations, offering a scalable route to excited-state electronic structure simulations with many-body accuracy.

Title: Molecular-sized bubbles in a liquid: free energy of formation beyond the capillarity approximation
Authors: J. Puibasset
Abstract: We investigate the transient bubbles that spontaneously appear in a simple liquid using molecular simulations. The objective is to deduce the free-energy of formation of the bubbles $W(s)$ from the bubble size distribution $p(s)$ through the hypothesis of a Boltzmann distribution: $W(s) = -kT \ln p(s)$. The bubbles are detected and characterized using a method based on a grid superimposed on the liquid, efficient for bubbles larger than the grid mesh. We first investigate how the results are affected by the mesh choice, and show that using several mesh values allows to detect bubbles in a wide range of sizes with minimal computing cost. The free-energy of formation of a bubble can then be deduced for a large range of sizes, with particular emphasis in the region of vanishing bubbles scarcely investigated in previous works. We first show that the usual Boltzmann relation has to be modified when the bubble size is characterized by its volume. In particular, the bubble volume distribution diverges for a vanishing bubble, which should be taken into account before calculating its free-energy of formation from the above formula. An analytical expansion, valid for any interacting spherical molecules, confirms this observation. We then show that the capillarity approximation fails for small bubbles: an extra contribution, linear with the bubble radius, has to be added to the usual quadratic (surface) and cubic (volume) contributions to the free-energy. This extra term most probably relates to the irregular shape of the tiny bubbles.

Title: Hole-spin qubits in germanium beyond the single-particle regime
Authors: Andrea Secchi, Gaia Forghieri, Paolo Bordone, Daniel Loss, Stefano Bosco, Filippo Troiani
Abstract: The intense simulation activity on hole-spin qubits in Ge has focused so far on singly occupied quantum dots. Here, we theoretically investigate three-hole qubits in germanium and show that their performances compare well with those of their single-hole counterparts, both in strained and unstrained systems. In particular, enhancements of the gating times by two orders of magnitude are obtained in slightly elongated quantum dots. We show that, depending on the confinement anisotropy, such an enhancement is driven either by the occupation of excited spin-orbitals (Pauli principle), or by a Coulomb-induced charge rearrangement.

Title: Characterizing spin ordering via maximal row correlation in classical spin models
Authors: Yong-Yi Tang, Yin Zhong, Hantao Lu
Abstract: An order parameter, termed the maximal row correlation, is proposed for classical spin systems. Monte Carlo simulations on various Potts models suggest that this order parameter is applicable to a broad range of spin systems, including those defined on irregular lattices, systems with frustration, and systems exhibiting partial orders, provided some degree of spin ordering is present. This approach offers a unified framework for investigating phase transitions in such complex systems. The associated critical exponents are estimated via finite-size scaling analysis and show good agreement with established values.

Title: Electron density modulation in monolayer $MoS_{2}$ along the phase transition of a relaxor ferroelectric substrate
Authors: D. Hernández-Pinilla, D. Cachago, Y. A. Xia, G. López-Polín, M. O Ramírez, L. E. Bausá
Abstract: The integration of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with ferroelectric substrates is a powerful strategy to modulate their electronic and optical properties. However, the use of relaxor ferroelectrics for this purpose remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a reversible photoluminescence (PL) and charge density modulation of monolayer $MoS_{2}$ on a $Sr_{0.61}Ba_{0.39}Nb_{2}O_{6}$ (SBN) substrate, a prototypical relaxor ferroelectric. The smearing of the phase transition in SBN enables continuous tuning of $MoS_{2}$ electronic properties over a broad temperature range ($30-90°C$). A pronounced PL enhancement occurs as the substrate transitions from ferro-to-paraelectric phase due to the vanishing spontaneous polarization and the consequent change in charge balance at the $MoS_{2}-SBN$ interface. Moreover, thermal hysteresis in the electron density modulation is observed during heating and cooling cycles. These findings highlight the potential of relaxor ferroelectrics as reconfigurable platforms for electron doping and light-emission control in 2D materials, opening avenues for temperature-responsive optoelectronic and nanophotonic applications.

Title: Interaction-Driven Intervalley Coherence with Emergent Kekulé Orbitons
Authors: Hua Chen
Abstract: The $p$-orbital doublet in a honeycomb lattice is concretely studied with interacting spinless fermions at half filling. The Dirac fermions with linear dispersion at $\pm K$ valleys govern the non-interacting low-energy physics. In the weak-coupling regime, the Dirac fermions are gaped due to the spontaneous generation of mass terms through a uniform axial orbital ordering, rendering the system into the quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase with a nonzero Chern number. Surprisingly, the intermediate many-particle interaction produces the intervalley coherence between $\pm K$ valleys by developing complex polar orbital orderings in a tripled Wigner-Seitz cell. This phase is shown to have a deep connection with the low-energy physical behavior described by the orbital exchange model in the Mott insulating phase. The classical ground-state manifold in the Mott regime enjoys a continuous symmetry characterized by the intervalley coherent phase. Finally, the quantum fluctuation selects a unique ground state with emergent Kekulé orbitons through the order-by-disorder mechanism. Our findings provide insights for a direction of searching for Kekulé distortion in correlated multi-orbital systems.

Title: Theoretical limits of electron and hole doping in single layer graphene from DFT calculations
Authors: Dawid Ciszewski, Wojciech Grochala
Abstract: Density functional theory calculations suggest a pronounced hole electron doping asymmetry in a single layer graphene. It turns out that a single graphene sheet can sustain doping levels up to 0.1 holes or up to a remarkably large 1.9 electrons per atom while maintaining dynamical [phonon] stability. Estimates of the superconducting critical temperature in the electron doped regime based on McMillans formula reveal two local maxima in the function of doping level which correlate with the local maxima of the electron phonon coupling constant.

Title: Electrons as intermediate charge carriers in ion transport through nanoscale channels
Authors: Baptiste Coquinot, Mathieu Lizée, Lydéric Bocquet, Nikita Kavokine
Abstract: The ionic conductivity of a nanofluidic channel is one of its most basic properties, which is systematically characterized in experiments. While most studies to date have focused on the DC conductivity, there has recently been a surge of interest in the behavior of nanochannels under AC voltages. Here, we show that in nanochannels with electrically conducting walls, electrons can contribute to transporting ionic current through the channel. We identify a critical frequency and lengthscale above which electrons in the channel walls become the main charge carriers, resulting in a strongly increased conductivity. Our findings open the way to the engineering of nanofluidic functionalities based on ion-electron coupling.

Title: Machine-learning interatomic potentials from a users perspective: A comparison of accuracy, speed and data efficiency
Authors: Niklas Leimeroth, Linus C. Erhard, Karsten Albe, Jochen Rohrer
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have massively changed the field of atomistic modeling. They enable the accuracy of density functional theory in large-scale simulations while being nearly as fast as classical interatomic potentials. Over the last few years, a wide range of different types of MLIPs have been developed, but it is often difficult to judge which approach is the best for a given problem setting. For the case of structurally and chemically complex solids, namely Al-Cu-Zr and Si-O, we benchmark a range of machine learning interatomic potential approaches, in particular, the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP), high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNP), moment tensor potentials (MTP), the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) in its linear and nonlinear version, neural equivariant interatomic potentials (NequIP), Allegro, and MACE. We find that nonlinear ACE and the equivariant, message-passing graph neural networks NequIP and MACE form the Pareto front in the accuracy vs. computational cost trade-off. In case of the Al-Cu-Zr system we find that MACE and Allegro offer the highest accuracy, while NequIP outperforms them for Si-O. Furthermore, GPUs can massively accelerate the MLIPs, bringing them on par with and even ahead of non-accelerated classical interatomic potentials (IPs) with regards to accessible timescales. Finally, we explore the extrapolation behavior of the corresponding potentials, probe the smoothness of the potential energy surfaces, and finally estimate the user friendliness of the corresponding fitting codes and molecular dynamics interfaces.

Title: Compositional disorder in a multicomponent non-reciprocal mixture: stability and patterns
Authors: Laya Parkavousi, Suropriya Saha
Abstract: The mean compositions of individual components can be tuned to control phase behavior in number-conserving passive mixtures. In this work, we investigate the role of variable average density in a system of infinitely many non-reciprocally interacting scalar densities, within the framework of the multi-species non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. Rather than focusing on specific parameter choices, we study ensembles of systems where the inter-species interaction coefficients and average densities are sampled from probability distributions. We show that non-reciprocity stabilizes the homogeneous mixed state even in the presence of compositional disorder. Using random matrix theory, we derive a general condition for the onset of spinodal instability, which we verify through simulations. Finally, we illustrate the connection between the statistics of the most unstable eigenvalue and the emergent nonlinear dynamics.

Title: Efficient Computation of the Long-Range Exact Exchange using an Extended Screening Function
Authors: Sebastian Kokott, Volker Blum, Matthias Scheffler
Abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient screening for the Coulomb potential that also allows calculating approximated long-range exact exchange contributions with an accuracy similar to an explicit full-range evaluation of the exact exchange. Starting from the screening function of the HSE functional, i.e., the complementary error function, as zeroth order, a first-order Taylor expansion in terms of the screening parameter {\omega} is proposed as an approximation of the long-range Coulomb potential. The resulting extended screening function has a similar spatial extend as the complementary error function leading to a computational speed comparable to screened hybrid functionals such as HSE06, but with long-range exact exchange contributions included. The approach is tested and demonstrated for prototypical semiconductors and organic crystals using the PBE0 functional. Predicted energy band gaps, total energies, cohesive energies, and lattice energies from the first-order approximated PBE0 functional are close to those from the unmodified PBE0 functional, but are obtained at significantly reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Here, we have studied the temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient (S) of the NaCo$_2$O$_4$ (NCO) by using experimental and computational methods. The range of experimentally obtained S is $\sim$55 to 103 $\mu$V/K in the temperature range of 300-600 K, which confirms the p-type behaviour of NCO. The electronic structure of this compound is obtained via DFT+U formalism. The band dispersion and partial density of states confirms the magnetic and half metallic nature. Furthermore, in the transport properties, the obtained S using a U = 4 eV gives the best match with experimental data. The temperature and chemical potential dependent S$^{2}$$\sigma$$/$$\tau$ is calculated using the obtained electronic transport properties, in which the maximum value obtained for p(n)-type doping is $\sim$22(61)$\times$10$^1$$^4$ $\mu$WK$^{-2}$cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. The possibility of enhancing the ZT is identified, and it is calculated in temperature range 300-1200 K. The maximum calculated value of ZT is 0.64 for p-type and 1.8 for n-type doping at 1200 K. The calculated carrier concentration obtained for p(n) type doping at 1200 K is $\sim$1.17 (1.6)$\times$10$^2$$^2$ cm$^-$$^3$. This study suggests that the careful doping of p and n type can enhance the applicability of this compound in thermoelectric for high temperature application.

Title: Hidden Quantum State and Signature of Mott Transition in Two-dimensional 1T-TaS2
Authors: Vivek Kumar, Birender Singh, Pradeep Kumar
Abstract: Here we report a comprehensive inelastic light scattering studies on 1T-TaS2 with different thickness. This compound is well known for its rich charge density wave phases. Along with that it has been one of the promising candidates for a quantum spin liquid state as the spins reside on a triangular lattice and it does not show any signature of magnetic ordering. We performed a thickness dependent Raman measurement in a regime of completely commensurate charge density wave (C-CDW) to a nearly commensurate charge density wave (NC-CDW) with varying temperature (4K-330K) and polarization direction of the incident light. We observed the signature of CDW transition and in addition to that we have also found the signature of a well sought hidden quantum CDW state at low temperature around TH ~ 80K. The emergence of CDW, both normal and hidden one, is marked by the emergence of new phonon modes and distinct renormalized phonon self-energy parameters for the most prominent modes. A transition from metallic to the Mott insulating state is gauged via the Raman response using low frequency slope , reflected in the renormalized slope below TCDW and TH.

Title: Anomalous valley Hall effect in monolayer chromium-based triple-Q magnets
Authors: Xiu-Cai Jiang, Li-Ya Qiao, Yu-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: Using the density functional theory calculations, we predict that several monolayer chromium-based materials exhibit a triple-Q tetrahedral magnetic insulating ground state. By studying the effect of biaxial strain on monolayer CrSi$\rm{_2}$P$\rm{_4}$ under various on-site Coulomb interactions, we reveal that this magnetic insulating state, sandwiched between the itinerant $120^{\circ}$ coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states, originates from the competition between antiferromagnetic exchange and double exchange interactions of Cr 3$d$ electrons which can also be applied to account for the ground states in other chromium-based materials. Remarkably, anomalous valley Hall effect with giant valley splitting is discovered in the magnetic states of these inversion-asymmetric systems without requiring spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization. Our findings open a new avenue towards exploring monolayer materials for valleytronics.

Title: Statistics within UV-Visible Absorption Spectrum of Ethanolic Azobenzene
Authors: Eemeli A. Eronen, Johannes Niskanen
Abstract: We report a statistical simulation of the UV-visible absorption spectrum of trans-azobenzene in ethanol solution. Due to intermolecular interactions, the used explicit solvent environment necessitates accounting for numerous transitions for a spectrum covering the two energetically lowest lines, S1 and S2. Furthermore, the spectrum manifests vast variation as a function of the underlying local structure, in conjunction with previous observations for spectra of liquids in the X-ray regime. We disentangle the complex structure-spectrum relationship using a machine learning-based method known as the emulator-based component analysis. This structural decomposition outperforms commonly used principal component analysis in explained spectral variation and reveals a small subset of latent structural variables responsible for the total spectral variance. Among other structural characteristics, blueshifting of the S2 line occurs with fewer hydrogen bonds with the ethanol solvent, and a contracted N-N bond within the C-N=N-C bridge. The observed structural dependence of the absorption spectrum thus implies an overrepresentation of certain structural classes after a photoexcitation, potentially significant for the subsequent nuclear dynamics, photophysics, and photochemistry.

Title: Can An Uncertainty Relation Generate A Plasma?
Authors: A. Gholamhosseinian, R. W. Corkery, I. Brevik, Mathias Bostrom
Abstract: We explore the fundamental idea that there may be a role for the Casimir effect, via an uncertainty relation, in the generation of electron-positron and quark-gluon plasmas. We investigate this concept, reviewing the possible contribution of semi-classical electrodynamics to nuclear interactions, specifically focusing on the Casimir effect at sub-Fermi length scales. The main result is a temperature distance relation, derived from the time-energy uncertainty relation, which can have observable consequences at these extreme scales. From a more general perspective, since the energy-time uncertainty relation appears to be a significant physical quantity, we also provide a brief overview of recent developments in this direction in Sec. 3.2.

Title: Ferroelectric Properties and Topological Textures in PbTiO$_\mathrm{3}$ from a Second-Principles Open-Source interatomic potential
Authors: Louis Bastogne, Philippe Ghosez
Abstract: We introduce an open-source, fully atomistic second-principles interatomic potential for lead titanate (PbTiO3), a benchmark ferroelectric material known for its strong polarization and high temperature phase transitions. While density functional theory excels at capturing atomic-scale behavior, it remains computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations required to explore complex phenomena. Our model addresses this limitation by accurately reproducing key properties of PbTiO3, including domain wall dynamics and skyrmion formation, which are known as key features to next-generation memory and energy-efficient technologies. Validated against DFT data, the model remains predictive across a wide range of conditions. It offers an accessible and efficient framework for high-accuracy large-scale simulations, allowing deeper insights into PbTiO3 and its potential applications.

Title: Giant Gate Response of the Charge in an Electron-Lattice Condensate
Authors: Maedeh Taheri, Jordan Teeter, Topojit Debnath, Nicholas Sesing, Tina Salguero, Roger K. Lake, Alexander A. Balandin
Abstract: Efficient electrical capacitive control is important for the next generation of ultra-low-power and ultra-fast electronics and energy-storage devices. Correlated electronic phases offer a powerful route to enhancing field-effect control beyond the limits of conventional capacitive gating. In such systems, modest gate voltages can couple to an order parameter, producing responses far larger than expected from the electrostatics of non-interacting carriers. It was demonstrated that electron-electron interactions, in which the exchange and correlation energies among electrons lower the chemical potential of an electron system as the electron density increases, can significantly increase the effective capacitance over its geometric capacitance value. Here, we show that the electron-lattice or electron-phonon correlations in charge density wave (CDW) condensate can lead to a giant gate response with the corresponding capacitance enhancement. This unusual phenomenon is demonstrated in the quasi-one-dimensional CDW material, where the gate-induced change in CDW charge density exceeds predictions based on geometrical gate capacitance by one to two orders of magnitude. This "giant gating" effect arises from the coupling of the electric field to the CDW electron-lattice condensate, demonstrating a mechanism for massively amplifying gate response via collective electronic behavior. We quantify the effect by determining the quantum capacitance of the CDW charge and by constructing a band diagram for the gated CDW device. The obtained results can lead to an alternative strategy for continuing the downscaling of the transistor feature size in electronic technology.

Title: Role of Noise on Defect Formation and Correlations in a Long-Range Ising Model Under Adiabatic Driving
Authors: Santanu Dhara, Suhas Gangadharaiah
Abstract: We study an exactly solvable long-range (LR) transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with a power-law decaying interaction characterized by a decay exponent {\alpha}. In the thermodynamic limit, the system is adiabatically driven in the presence of noise, from a paramagnetic phase with all spins down to one with all spins up. Our study examines the role of long-range interactions on the defect density, its distribution, and spin correlations, comparing noisy and noiseless scenarios. In the noiseless case, within the long-range regime, the steady-state properties are primarily influenced by modes near the k = {\pi} region. However, in the presence of noise, the dominant contributions shift to the modes near k = 0. This differs from the SR model, where previous studies have shown that modes around k = {\pi}/2 play a significant role under noisy conditions. In the absence of noise, defect density scales as $n\propto \tau_Q^{-1/2}$, implying scaling exponent independent of decay exponent. However, we find that decreasing the value of {\alpha} (i.e., increasing the range) enhances the defect density, whereas in the presence of noise, it is suppressed. In the LR regime, two-point fermionic correlators initially exhibit Gaussian decay, followed by quadratic suppression instead of power-law decay for both noisy and noiseless scenarios. Meanwhile, spin correlators, expressed as a string of fermionic operators, undergo purely exponential decay with no crossover behavior. Furthermore, our analysis of defect formation reveals the influence of LR interaction on the kink-number distribution and its cumulants.

Title: Escaping the Krylov space during finite precision Lanczos
Authors: J. Eckseler, M. Pieper, J. Schnack (Bielefeld University)
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm, introduced by Cornelius Lanczos, has been known for a long time and is widely used in computational physics. While often employed to approximate extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectores of an operator, recently interest in the sequence of basis vectors produced by the algorithm rose in the context of Krylov complexity. Although it is generally accepted and partially proven that the procedure is numerically stable for approximating the eigenvalues, there are numerical problems when investigating the Krylov basis constructed via the Lanczos procedure. In this paper, we show that loss of orthogonality and the attempt of reorthoganalization fall short of understanding and addressing the problem. Instead, the numerical sequence of eigenvectors in finite precision arithmetic escapes the true vector space spanned by the exact Lanczos vectors. This poses the real threat to an interpretation in view of the operator growth hypothesis.

Title: Partons from stabilizer codes
Authors: Rafael A. Macedo, Carlo C. Bellinati, Weslei B. Fontana, Eric C. Andrade, Rodrigo G. Pereira
Abstract: The Gutzwiller projection of fermionic wave functions is a well-established method for generating variational wave functions describing exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We investigate the conditions under which a projected wave function constructed from fermionic partons can be rigorously shown to possess topological order. We demonstrate that these conditions can be precisely determined in the case of projected Majorana stabilizer codes. We then use matrix product states to study states that interpolate between two distinct Majorana fermion codes, one yielding a $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquid and the other a trivial polarized state upon projection. While the free-fermion states are adiabatically connected, we find that the projected states undergo a phase transition detected by the topological entanglement entropy. Our work underscores the profound impact of the Gutzwiller projection and cautions against inferring properties of quantum spin liquids solely from their unprojected counterparts.

Title: Magnetic Manipulation of Spatially Confined Multiferroic Heuslers by Martensitic Microstructure Engineering
Authors: Milad Takhsha, Vipin Kumar Singh, Julian Ledieu, Simone Fabbrici, Francesca Casoli, Francesco Mezzadri, Michal Horký, Vincent Fournée, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Franca Albertini
Abstract: Magnetic shape-memory (MSM) Heuslers show a strong coupling between magnetic and structural characteristics, evidencing a correlation between magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties through a magnetostructural martensitic transformation. This functional aspect makes MSM Heuslers promising for integration into smart micro/nanodevices, including sensors, energy harvesters, and actuators. Controlling the martensitic microstructure, which determines the magnetic characteristics, is among the key points for optimization of the magnetic functional properties of these materials at different length scales. Here, we report a strategy for manipulating the magnetic properties of spatially confined epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films grown on Cr(001)//MgO(001) by twinning configuration engineering in the low-temperature ferromagnetic (martensitic) phase. We show how the twinning configurations in the continuous films and the micropatterned structures can be switched from Y-type (showing negligible magnetic stray field) into X-type (presenting significant magnetic stray field) by a post-annealing process. Advanced characterization techniques enable us to analyze the atomic structure and the surface quality of the annealed samples and to disentangle the twin-switching phenomenon. The martensitic microstructure engineering reported in this study introduces a simple method for promoting the magnetic stray-field contribution at the surface of Ni-Mn-Ga epitaxial thin films and micropatterns initially showing a negligible magnetic stray field.

Title: Signatures of Kondo-lattice behavior in the two-dimensional ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$
Authors: Carmen Rubio-Verdú, Katharina J. Franke
Abstract: Fe$_2$GeTe$_3$ is a paradigmatic van der Waals magnet with the full microscopic picture of magnetic interactions still under debate. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at 1.1 K to map out the low-energy physics on the surface. In agreement with previous works, we observe a spatially varying Fano lineshape that has been ascribed to a Kondo resonance. In addition, we identify a small gap of $\approx$ 5 meV width on top of the larger-energy Fano resonance. We suggest that this gap is the signature of a coherent Kondo lattice that has been proposed to originate from hybridization of a strongly dispersing and a flat band both derived from $d$ electrons of the Fe atoms in the lattice. Adding magnetic adatoms on the surface hardly influences the magnetic signatures of the substrate, indicating the robustness of the intralayer Kondo correlations against magnetic adsorbates.

Title: Fermi surface nesting driven anomalous Hall effect in magnetically frustrated Mn_2PdIn
Authors: Afsar Ahmed, Arnab Bhattacharya, Prashant Singh, Ajay Kumar, Tukai Singha, Anis Biswas, Yaroslav Mudryk, Indranil Das
Abstract: Noncollinear magnets with near-zero net magnetization and nontrivial bulk electronic topology hold significant promise for spintronic applications, though their scarcity necessitates purposeful design strategies. In this work, we report a topologically nontrivial electronic structure in metallic Mn_2PdIn, which crystallizes in the inverse Heusler structure and exhibits a spin-glassy ground state with quenched magnetization. The system features Weyl-type band crossings near the Fermi level and reveals a novel interplay among momentum-space nesting, orbital hybridization, and spin-orbit coupling. Comprehensive transport measurements uncover a pronounced anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in Mn_2PdIn. The observed quadratic relationship between the longitudinal and anomalous Hall resistivities highlights the intrinsic Berry curvature contribution to AHE. These findings establish inverse Heusler alloys as compelling platforms for realizing noncollinear magnets that host Weyl-type semimetallic or metallic phases-combining suppressed magnetization with robust electronic transport-thereby offering a promising route toward their seamless integration into next-generation spintronic devices.

Title: Non-Hermitian topology and skin modes in the continuum via parametric processes
Authors: Markus Bestler, Alexander Dikopoltsev, Oded Zilberberg
Abstract: We demonstrate that Hermitian, nonlocal parametric pairing processes can induce non-Hermitian topology and skin modes, offering a simple alternative to complex bath engineering. Our model, stabilized by local dissipation and operating in the continuum limit, reveals exceptional points that spawn a tilted diabolical line in the dispersion. Local dissipation prevents instabilities, while a bulk anomaly signals unscreened current response. Upon opening the boundaries, we observe a non-Hermitian skin effect with localized edge modes. Through bulk winding indices and non-Bloch theory, we establish a robust bulk-boundary correspondence, highlighting parametric drives as a scalable route to non-Hermitian topology in bosonic systems.

Title: Particles, trajectories and diffusion: random walks in cooling granular gases
Authors: Santos Bravo Yuste, Rubén Gómez González, Vicente Garzó
Abstract: We study the mean-square displacement (MSD) of a tracer particle diffusing in a granular gas of inelastic hard spheres under homogeneous cooling state (HCS). Tracer and granular gas particles are in general mechanically different. Our approach uses a series representation of the MSD where the $k$-th term is given in terms of the mean scalar product $\langle \mathbf{r}_1\cdot\mathbf{r}_k \rangle$, with $\mathbf{r}_i$ denoting the displacements of the tracer between successive collisions. We find that this series approximates a geometric series with the ratio $\Omega$. We derive an explicit analytical expression of $\Omega$ for granular gases in three dimensions, and validate it through a comparison with the numerical results obtained from the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Our comparison covers a wide range of masses, sizes, and inelasticities. From the geometric series, we find that the MSD per collision is simply given by the mean-square free path of the particle divided by $1-\Omega$. The analytical expression for the MSD derived here is compared with DSMC data and with the first- and second-Sonine approximations to the MSD obtained from the Chapman-Enskog solution of the Boltzmann equation. Surprisingly, despite their simplicity, our results outperforms the predictions of the first-Sonine approximation to the MSD, achieving accuracy comparable to the second-Sonine approximation.

Title: Van-Hove singularities and competing instabilities in an altermagnetic metal
Authors: Peng Rao, Johannes Knolle, Laura Classen
Abstract: Van-Hove (VH) singularities in the single-particle band spectrum are important for interaction-driven quantum phases. Whereas VH points are usually spin-degenerate, in newly proposed altermagnets VH singularities can become spin-dependent, due to momentum-dependent spin polarization of the Fermi surfaces arising from combined rotation and time-reversal symmetry. We consider two altermagnetic models ($d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave) on a square lattice with spin-polarized VH points, and study their stable fixed-point solutions indicating interaction-induced instabilities using parquet renormalization group. In particular, for the $d_{xy}$-wave model, we find new stable fixed-point solutions of the renormalization group equations which are not connected to the solution in the spin-degenerate limit. This implies that on the square lattice, the system with VH singularities is unstable with respect to altermagnetic perturbations. The leading instability for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-model is real transverse spin density wave. For the $d_{xy}$-wave model, it is found to be real transverse spin density wave at large altermagnetic splitting. At small altermagnetic splitting both imaginary charge density wave and real longitudinal spin density waves are dominant.

Title: Coexistence of Nodal and Nodeless Pairing Symmetry in Superconducting 6R-SnNbSe2
Authors: K. Yadav, M. Lamba, S. Patnaik
Abstract: Majorana fermions, a fundamental idea to fault-tolerant quantum computing, can emerge in systems where superconductivity coexists with nontrivial band topology. One promising route to realizing such topological superconductors (TSCs) involves inducing superconductivity in topological materials, particularly in systems lacking inversion symmetry. In this study, we report the synthesis and detailed characterization of Sn-intercalated NbSe2, forming a new polytype, 6R-SnNbSe2. This compound crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space group R3m and exhibits bulk superconductivity below Tc around 4 K. Structural, electronic, and magnetic measurements confirm the emergence of a superconducting phase derived from Sn intercalation into the non-superconducting 3R-NbSe2. Temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth and superfluid density measurements down to 1.5 K are performed using the tunnel diode oscillator technique. The findings suggest the mixing of nodal and nodeless superconductivity in 6R-SnNbSe2. Given the non-centrosymmetric nature of the crystal structure and the theoretical prediction of topological nodal-line features in SnNbSe2, it is an interesting candidate to investigate unconventional pairing mechanisms. Our findings highlight the potential of this material to host nontrivial superconducting states among the transition-metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Statistical mechanical theory of liquid water
Authors: Lakshmanji Verma, Ken A. Dill
Abstract: Water is an unusual liquid. Its thermophysical properties are non-monotonic with temperature T and pressure p. It's not been known how water's behaviors are encoded in its molecules. We give a statistical physics model, Cage Water, which assumes three bonding states: van der Waals, pairwise hydrogen bonding, and multi-body cooperative caging hydrogen bonds. The model is analytical, so very fast to compute, yet it gives excellent agreement with extensive pT experiments. Through readily interpretable substates, Cage Water explains water's liquid anomalies -- including its controversial liquid-liquid supercooling transition -- as simple switchovers among the three bonding types.

Title: Pauli crystal superradiance
Authors: Daniel Ortuño-Gonzalez, Rui Lin, Justyna Stefaniak, Alexander Baumgärtner, Gabriele Natale, Tobias Donner, R. Chitra
Abstract: Pauli crystals are unique geometric structures of non-interacting fermions, resembling crystals, that emerge solely from Fermi statistics and confinement. Unlike genuine quantum crystals that arise from interparticle interactions, Pauli crystals do not break translation symmetry but nonetheless exhibit nontrivial many-body correlations. In this Letter, we explore Pauli crystal formation in a cavity-fermion setup. We analytically show that when coupled to a cavity, degeneracy in Pauli crystals can trigger zero-threshold transitions to superradiance. This superradiance is accompanied by the emergence of a genuine quantum crystalline state, wherein the atomic density is periodically modulated. We substantiate our findings using state-of-the-art numerical simulations. The combined interplay between statistics, confinement geometry and interactions mediated by light thus facilitates a novel pathway to quantum crystallization.

Title: Global Stress Generation and Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator under Dynamic Loading for Two-Phase Random Materials
Authors: Tengfei Xing, Xiaodan Ren, Jie Li
Abstract: Material stress analysis is a critical aspect of material design and performance optimization. Under dynamic loading, the global stress evolution in materials exhibits complex spatiotemporal characteristics, especially in two-phase random materials (TRMs). Such kind of material failure is often associated with stress concentration, and the phase boundaries are key locations where stress concentration occurs. In practical engineering applications, the spatiotemporal resolution of acquired microstructural data and its dynamic stress evolution is often limited. This poses challenges for deep learning methods in generating high-resolution spatiotemporal stress fields, particularly for accurately capturing stress concentration regions. In this study, we propose a framework for global stress generation and spatiotemporal super-resolution in TRMs under dynamic loading. First, we introduce a diffusion model-based approach, named as Spatiotemporal Stress Diffusion (STS-diffusion), for generating global spatiotemporal stress data. This framework incorporates Space-Time U-Net (STU-net), and we systematically investigate the impact of different attention positions on model accuracy. Next, we develop a physics-informed network for spatiotemporal super-resolution, termed as Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator (ST-SRPINN). The proposed ST-SRPINN is an unsupervised learning method. The influence of data-driven and physics-informed loss function weights on model accuracy is explored in detail. Benefiting from physics-based constraints, ST-SRPINN requires only low-resolution stress field data during training and can upscale the spatiotemporal resolution of stress fields to arbitrary magnifications.

Title: Entropy-based analysis of single-qubit Otto and Carnot heat engines
Authors: Andrés Vallejo, Catty Lissardy, Santiago Silva-Gallo, Alejandro Romanelli, Raul Donangelo
Abstract: From an entropy-based formulation of the first law of thermodynamics in the quantum regime, we investigate the performance of Otto-like and Carnot-like engines for a single-qubit working medium. Within this framework, the first law includes an additional contribution -- coherence work -- that quantifies the energetic cost of deviating the quantum trajectory from its natural unitary evolution. We focus on the efficiency of the heat-to-coherence work conversion and show that the Carnot cycle achieves the classical Carnot efficiency, while the performance of the Otto cycle is upper-bounded by the Carnot efficiency corresponding to the extreme temperatures of the cycle. We identify entropy generation during the isochoric stages as the key source of irreversibility limiting the Otto cycle's efficiency.

Title: Exploring Metamaterial Lasers through Non-Hermitian Scattering Formalism
Authors: Özge Beyza Vardar, Uğur Tamer, Mohammad Mehdi Sadeghi, Mustafa Sarısaman
Abstract: This study explores the exciting properties of metamaterials and their innovative applications in non-Hermitian physics, with particular emphasis on the scattering formalism, a key topic of recent research. We have analyzed how light behaves in a negative index metamaterial (NIM), allowing us to develop a transfer matrix and identify the essential conditions for the occurrence of spectral singularities. These findings are crucial for fine-tuning system parameters that will drive the development of metamaterial slab lasers and coherent perfect absorber (CPA) systems. Overall, our research demonstrates the enormous potential of metamaterials and their significant role in driving innovation in various technology areas.

Title: A note on the asymptotic uniformity of Markov chains with random rates
Authors: Jacob Calvert, Frank den Hollander, Dana Randall
Abstract: The stationary distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain is generally a complicated function of its transition rates. However, we show that if the transition rates are i.i.d. random variables with a common distribution satisfying certain tail conditions, then the resulting stationary distribution is close in total variation distance to the distribution that is proportional to the inverse of the exit rates of the states. This result, which generalizes and makes a precise prediction of Chvykov et al. (2021), constitutes the first rigorous validation of an emerging physical theory of order in non-equilibrium systems. The proof entails showing that the stationary distribution of the corresponding "jump chain," i.e., the discrete-time Markov chain with transition probabilities given by the normalized transition rates, is asymptotically uniform as the number of states grows, which settles a question raised by Bordenave, Caputo, and Chafaï (2012) under certain assumptions.

Title: A computational framework for predicting the effect of surface roughness in fatigue
Authors: S. Jiménez-Alfaro, E. Martínez-Pañeda
Abstract: Surface roughness is a critical factor influencing the fatigue life of structural components. Its effect is commonly quantified using a correction coefficient known as the surface factor. In this paper, a phase field based numerical framework is proposed to estimate the surface factor while accounting for the stochastic nature of surface roughness. The model is validated against existing experimental data. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of key parameters on the fatigue life of rough surfaces, such as surface topology and failure strength. An important effect of surface roughness is observed when the average surface roughness increases and the correlation length of the surface profile decreases. This effect becomes more pronounced with higher failure strengths.

Title: BOOM: Benchmarking Out-Of-distribution Molecular Property Predictions of Machine Learning Models
Authors: Evan R. Antoniuk, Shehtab Zaman, Tal Ben-Nun, Peggy Li, James Diffenderfer, Busra Demirci, Obadiah Smolenski, Tim Hsu, Anna M. Hiszpanski, Kenneth Chiu, Bhavya Kailkhura, Brian Van Essen
Abstract: Advances in deep learning and generative modeling have driven interest in data-driven molecule discovery pipelines, whereby machine learning (ML) models are used to filter and design novel molecules without requiring prohibitively expensive first-principles simulations. Although the discovery of novel molecules that extend the boundaries of known chemistry requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, ML models often struggle to generalize OOD. Furthermore, there are currently no systematic benchmarks for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present BOOM, $\boldsymbol{b}$enchmarks for $\boldsymbol{o}$ut-$\boldsymbol{o}$f-distribution $\boldsymbol{m}$olecular property predictions -- a benchmark study of property-based out-of-distribution models for common molecular property prediction models. We evaluate more than 140 combinations of models and property prediction tasks to benchmark deep learning models on their OOD performance. Overall, we do not find any existing models that achieve strong OOD generalization across all tasks: even the top performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x larger than in-distribution. We find that deep learning models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. Although chemical foundation models with transfer and in-context learning offer a promising solution for limited training data scenarios, we find that current foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation capabilities. We perform extensive ablation experiments to highlight how OOD performance is impacted by data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation. We propose that developing ML models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML model development. This open-source benchmark will be made available on Github.

Title: Discrete Spatial Diffusion: Intensity-Preserving Diffusion Modeling
Authors: Javier E. Santos, Agnese Marcato, Roman Colman, Nicholas Lubbers, Yen Ting Lin
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality images. However, because these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces - diffusing independently per pixel and color channel - they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications where quantities such as particle counts or material units are inherently discrete and governed by strict conservation laws such as mass preservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving mass in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve mass preservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across widely-used image benchmarks, with the ability to condition on image intensity. Additionally, we highlight its applicability to domain-specific scientific data for materials microstructure, bridging the gap between diffusion models and mass-conditioned scientific applications.

Title: Deterministic Mechanical Wigner Negativity via Nonlinear Cavity Quantum Optomechanics in the Unresolved-Sideband Regime
Authors: Jack Clarke, Pascal Neveu, Ewold Verhagen, Michael R. Vanner
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, it is commonly held that deterministic preparation of mechanical Wigner negativity in the unresolved-sideband regime is not possible, as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this, by accounting for the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.

Title: Wannier decay and the Thouless conjecture
Authors: Simon Becker, Zhongkai Tao, Mengxuan Yang
Abstract: Non-trivial Chern classes pose an obstruction to the existence of exponentially decaying Wannier functions which provide natural bases for spectral subspaces. For non-trivial Bloch bundles, we obtain decay rates of Wannier functions in dimensions $d=2,3$. For $d=2$, we construct Wannier functions with full asymptotics and optimal decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-2})$ as conjectured by Thouless; for $d=3$, we construct Wannier functions with the uniform decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-7/3})$.

Title: Rényi Markov length in one-dimensional non-trivial mixed state phases and mixed state phase transitions
Authors: Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose
Abstract: Discovering and classifying non-trivial mixed states and mixed state phase transitions are some of the most important current issues in condensed matter and quantum information. In this study, we investigate some non-trivial mixed states and phase transitions between them by using the second Rényi conditional mutual information (CMI). The CMI can measure mixed state ``gap'', estimated by the exponential decay rate of the second Rényi CMI under a tripartition of system, which provides the second Rényi version of the Markov length. We introduce an efficient numerical scheme for the calculation of the second Rényi CMI based on the doubled Hilbert space formalism, and study the classification of non-trivial mixed states and the emergence of mixed state phase transitions for (i) the cluster model under odd-site local $Z$ decoherence and (ii) transverse field Ising model under both $ZZ$ and $X$ decoherence. The second Rényi CMI is a powerful measure to study non-trivial mixed ``gapped" quantum matters and mixed phase transitions. In addition to this, the present study shows that the second Rényi CMI exhibits specific behavior for the transition to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking mixed phase.

Title: Emergent scattering regimes in disordered metasurfaces near critical packing
Authors: Miao Chen, Adrian Agreda, Tong Wu, Franck Carcenac, Kevin Vynck, Philippe Lalanne
Abstract: Disordered metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for harnessing near- and far-field scattered light. Most research has focused on either particulate topologies composed of individual, well-identified metaatoms or, to a lesser extent, semi-continuous aggregate topologies without well identified inclusions. Here, we uncover an intermediate critical packing regime characterized by metasurface morphologies in which a significant fraction of metaatoms begin to connect. We experimentally demonstrate that, at this threshold, the properties of the scattered light abruptly change and interpret this change as a marked transition in the statistics of the photon density of states. Unlike percolation metal films, this transition affects not only the specular but also the diffuse components of the scattered light in a profound way. Our results introduce critical packing topologies as a novel design strategy for manipulating the spectral and angular characteristics of light using ultrathin optical coatings. Emergent functionalities include color shifts in diffuse light driven by multiple scattering and surface whitening, with potential applications in display technologies -- for example, to reduce glare in electronic screens.

Title: Heterosynaptic Circuits Are Universal Gradient Machines
Authors: Liu Ziyin, Isaac Chuang, Tomaso Poggio
Abstract: We propose a design principle for the learning circuits of the biological brain. The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via heterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of gradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of biologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine learning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This principle suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics, thus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative perspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning and memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations that show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can explain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can arise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any explicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also implies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically learnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to the common belief, gradient computation may be extremely easy and common in nature.

Title: How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte
Authors: Vinay Thakur, Prabhat Prakash, Raghavan Ranganathan
Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex decreases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.

Title: The Quantum Random Energy Model is the Limit of Quantum $ p $-Spin Glasses
Authors: Anouar Kouraich, Chokri Manai, Simone Warzel
Abstract: We consider the free energy of a class of spin glass models with $ p$-spin interactions in a transverse magnetic field. As $ p \to \infty $, the infinite system-size free energy is proven to converge to that of the quantum random energy model. This is accomplished by combining existing analytical techniques addressing the non-commutative properties of such quantum glasses, with the description of the typical geometry of extreme negative deviations of the classical $ p $-spin glass. We also review properties of the corresponding classical free energy and conjectures addressing $ 1/p $-corrections in the quantum case.

Title: Fabrication of highly uniform laser-induced periodic structures on polycarbonate via UV femtosecond pulses
Authors: Matina Vlahou, Nektaria Protopapa, Stella Maragkaki, George D. Tsibidis, Emmanuel Stratakis
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the fabrication of highly uniform laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on bulk polycarbonate (PC) using 258 nm femtosecond laser pulses. A systematic approach was pursued to investigate the influence of various laser parameters such as fluence, effective number of pulses, energy dose and polarisation on the features of the generated LIPSS. Experimental results showed that linearly polarized beams produce LIPSS with period comparable to the laser wavelength. Moreover, it was observed that the orientation of LIPSS is either parallel or perpendicular to the laser polarization, depending on the excitation level. These features are similar to the LIPSS formed on dielectrics, despite the considerably higher absorption and larger extinction coefficient (~10-2) of polycarbonate at 258 nm. The orientation and features of the patterns at different excitation levels are explained using Sipe's theory, while the excitation and induced carrier densities were quantified through the application of a theoretical physical model that describes ultrafast dynamics in polymers. Furthermore, observations revealed that low excitation levels with linearly polarized enhance the uniformity of LIPSS, whereas irradiating PC targets with circularly polarized beams leads to the formation of microscale topographies decorated with protruding nanosphered-like structures, with their size varying based on the laser conditions. A detailed analysis of the impact of the induced topographies on their wetting and optical properties demonstrated a steady increase in hydrophilicity over time, in contrast to a modest increase in optical absorbance. The results regarding the morphological features and properties of the induced topographies on PC are anticipated to support future efforts in creating patterned surfaces on polymeric materials for potential applications.

Title: Fast initialization of Bell states with Schrödinger cats in multi-mode systems
Authors: Miriam Resch, Ciprian Padurariu, Björn Kubala, Joachim Ankerhold
Abstract: Schrödinger cat states play an important role for applications in continuous variable quantum information technologies. As macroscopic superpositions they are inherently protected against certain types of noise making cat qubits a promising candidate for quantum computing. It has been shown recently that cat states occur naturally in driven Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) as degenerate ground states with even and odd parity that are adiabatically connected to the respective lowest two Fock states by switching off the drive. To perform operations with several cat qubits one crucial task is to create entanglement between them. Here, we demonstrate efficient transformations of multi-mode cat states through adiabatic and diabatic switching between Kerr-type Hamiltonians with degenerate ground state manifolds. These transformations can be used to directly initialize the cats as entangled Bell states in contrast to initializing them from entangled Fock states.

Title: Metamorphosis of collective patterns modulated by non-reciprocal interactions
Authors: Edgardo Brigatti, Fernando Peruani
Abstract: We study memoryless active particles that navigate using visual information. Particle perception is limited by a field of view. As the degree of non-reciprocity in interactions is varied, we can observe the emergence of a zoology of complex collective motion patterns that exhibit significantly different topologies and transport properties. Nematic closed filaments in the form of rings move as chiral active particles. Closed polar filaments with one singular topological point move ballistically, while those with two singular topological points rotate. Open polar filaments behave as persistent random walks. Furthermore, by changing the size of the field of view, we explore the metamorphic process that transforms one structure into another, finding that the process is non-reversible and presents strong hysteric effects. The analysis sheds light on the physics of single-species active particles with non-reciprocal interactions, providing evidence that topological and transport properties are closely related.

Title: Flow induced intermittent transport shapes colloid filtration in complex media
Authors: Filippo Miele, Ankur Deep Bordoloi, Marco Dentz, Herve Tabuteau, Veronica L. Morales, Pietro de Anna
Abstract: The macroscopic phenomenon of filtration is the separation between suspended and liquid phases and it takes place in natural environments (e.g. groundwater, soil, hyporheic zone) and industrial systems (e.g. filtration plants, pharmaceutical industry, hospital care). Porous materials represent excellent filters since they are characterized by a large solid surface to which flowing particles can attach and be retained. Colloidal filtration by porous media is governed by a complex interplay between transport dynamics through intricate pore structures and surface-mediated retention. Yet, classical approaches fail to capture key properties (such as filter spatial heterogeneity) and experimental observations--e.g. non-exponential deposition profiles. A key limitation of such approaches lies in the assumption that particle attachment to solid surfaces occurs at a constant rate over a given length scale, neglecting the intrinsic heterogeneity of the medium, i.e. pore size variability. Here, we develop a multiscale microfluidic model system to directly observe colloidal transport and deposition over more than three orders of magnitude in length--from tens of microns to a meter--within a porous architecture with controlled heterogeneity. By tracking individual colloidal particles within the pores, we reveal intermittent dynamics along each trajectory: particles alternate between long-range "flights" through pore channels and short-range localized "dives" near grain surfaces. During the dives, attachment can occur at a constant rate, but the distributed flight sizes, during which attachment cannot occur, produce anomalous filtration. This is quantified by deposition profiles and breakthrough curves. A stochastic model based on a continuous time random walk (CTRW), constrained by experimental data, captures this behavior and links pore structure with macroscopic filtration.

Title: Chiral Gain-Induced Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Systems
Authors: Mário G. Silveirinha, Daigo Oue
Abstract: Structured light offers a powerful approach to tailor light-matter interactions in quantum systems with chiral properties. While chirality has been extensively studied in passive platforms, the role of optical gain in controlling chiral quantum dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of qubits interacting with structured gain environments, where amplification depends on the light's polarization or momentum. By quantizing the electromagnetic field in linear bianisotropic media with gain and extending the Lindblad formalism to these settings, we derive a master equation governing the qubit's irreversible evolution. We show that chiral gain can break time-reversal symmetry and drive the system toward a symmetry-broken steady state with nonreciprocal properties. This effect is illustrated in detail for moving plasmonic substrates, which exhibit inherently chiral gain that selectively amplifies transitions of a given handedness. Our results establish chiral gain as a novel mechanism for engineering nonreciprocal quantum steady states.

Title: Hyperinductance based on stacked Josephson junctions
Authors: Paul Manset, José Palomo, Aurélien Schmitt, Kyrylo Gerashchenko, Rémi Rousseau, Himanshu Patange, Patrick Abgrall, Emmanuel Flurin, Samuel Deléglise, Thibaut Jacqmin, Léo Balembois
Abstract: Superinductances are superconducting circuit elements that combine a large inductance with a low parasitic capacitance to ground, resulting in a characteristic impedance exceeding the resistance quantum $R_Q = h/(2e)^2 \simeq 6.45 \mathrm{k}\Omega$. In recent years, these components have become key enablers for emerging quantum circuit architectures. However, achieving high characteristic impedance while maintaining scalability and fabrication robustness remains a major challenge. In this work, we present two fabrication techniques for realizing superinductances based on vertically stacked Josephson junctions. Using a multi-angle Manhattan (MAM) process and a zero-angle (ZA) evaporation technique -- in which junction stacks are connected pairwise using airbridges -- we fabricate one-dimensional chains of stacks that act as high-impedance superconducting transmission lines. Two-tone microwave spectroscopy reveals the expected $\sqrt{n}$ scaling of the impedance with the number of junctions per stack. The chain fabricated using the ZA process, with nine junctions per stack, achieves a characteristic impedance of $\sim 16 \mathrm{k}\Omega$, a total inductance of $5.9 \mathrm{\mu H}$, and a maximum frequency-dependent impedance of $50 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ at 1.4 GHz. Our results establish junction stacking as a scalable, robust, and flexible platform for next-generation quantum circuits requiring ultra-high impedance environments.

Title: Large circular photogalvanic effect in the noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal CeAlSi
Authors: Abhirup Roy Karmakar, A. Taraphder, G. P. Das
Abstract: The recent discovery of the Weyl semimetal CeAlSi with simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries has opened up new avenues for research into the interaction between light and topologically protected bands. In this work, we present a comprehensive examination of the shift current and injection current responsible for the circular photogalvanic effect in CeAlSi using first-principles calculations. Our investigation identifies a significant injection current of 4 mA/V$^2$ over a broad range in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, exceeding previously reported findings. In addition, we explored several externally controllable parameters to further enhance the photocurrent. A substantial boost in the injection current is observed when applying uniaxial strain along the $c$ axis of the crystal: a 5% strain results in a remarkable 64% increment. The exceptional photocurrent response in CeAlSi suggests that magnetic non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals may provide promising opportunities for novel photogalvanic applications.

Title: Three-Dimensional Quantum Hall Effect in Topological Amorphous Metals
Authors: Jiong-Hao Wang, Yong Xu
Abstract: Weyl semimetals have been theoretically predicted to become topological metals with anomalous Hall conductivity in amorphous systems. However, measuring the anomalous Hall conductivity in realistic materials, particularly those with multiple pairs of Weyl points, is a significant challenge. If a system respects time-reversal symmetry, then the anomalous Hall conductivity even vanishes. As such, it remains an open question how to probe the Weyl band like topology in amorphous materials. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that, under magnetic fields, a topological metal slab in amorphous systems exhibits three-dimensional quantum Hall effect, even in time-reversal invariant systems, thereby providing a feasible approach to exploring Weyl band like topology in amorphous materials. We unveil the topological origin of the quantized Hall conductance by calculating the Bott index. The index is carried by broadened Landau levels with bulk states spatially localized except at critical transition this http URL topological property also results in edge states localized at distinct hinges on two opposite surfaces.

Title: Searching for quantum non-thermodynamic phenomena
Authors: Yu Qiao
Abstract: Recent research on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics has led to an interesting discovery [1-3]: With locally nonchaotic barriers, as Boltzmann's H-theorem is inapplicable, there exist nontrivial non-thermodynamic systems that can produce useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect, thereby breaking the boundaries of the second law of thermodynamics. The previous analyses used classical mechanical models. In the current investigation, the study is extended to quantum mechanics. First, we reiterate that the Fermi-Dirac distribution and the Bose-Einstein distribution are compatible with the generalized Maxwell's relations, which demonstrates the general robustness of the framework of quantum statistical mechanics. Next, we analyze a set of simple-step scattering problems. When the system is in contact with a thermal reservoir, a bound state inherently follows the second law of thermodynamics, while a scattering state may not. The root cause is associated with the nonlocal nature of the wave function. It implies that the non-thermodynamic phenomena favor unquantized energy and localized wave packets, exhibiting a tendency to occur in "semiclassical" setups.

Title: Non-linear photoconductivity of strongly driven graphene
Authors: Lukas Broers, Ludwig Mathey
Abstract: We present the non-linear DC photoconductivity of graphene under strong infra-red (IR) radiation. The photoconductivity is obtained as the response to a strong DC electric field, with field strengths outside of the linear-response regime, while the IR radiation is described by a strong AC electric field. The conductivity displays two distinct regimes in which either the DC or the AC field dominates. We explore these regimes and associate them with the dynamics of driven Landau-Zener quenches in the case of a large DC field. In the limit of large AC field, we describe the conductivity in a Floquet picture and compare the results to the closely related Tien-Gordon effect. We present analytical calculations for the non-linear differential photoconductivity, for both regimes based on the corresponding mechanisms. As part of this discussion of the non-equilibrium state of graphene, we present analytical estimates of the conductivity of undriven graphene as a function of temperature and DC bias field strength that show very good agreement with our simulations.

Title: Topological analysis and experimental control of transformations of domain walls in magnetic cylindrical nanowires

Abstract: Topology is a powerful tool for categorizing magnetization textures by defining a topological index in both two-dimensional (2D) systems, such as thin films or curved surfaces, and in 3D bulk systems. In the emerging field of 3D nanomagnetism, both volume and surface topological numbers must be considered, requiring the identification of a proper global topological invariant to support categorization. Here we consider domain walls in cylindrical nanowires as an excellent playground for 3D nanomagnetic systems, excited by a charge current, that generates an OErsted field. We first provide experimental evidence of previously unreported domain-wall transformations of topology occurring at the nanosecond timescale. We investigate these transformations with micromagnetic simulations, tracking both bulk and surface topological this http URL demonstrate a topological invariant combining both signatures, while the topological charge varies from bulk to surface during the dynamics. The experimental change of topology is reproduced when the pulse duration matches the timescale of the internal transformations of the wall, and the current is switched off before the transformation is complete. We expect that the topological categorization and dynamical exploitation apply to any 3D nanomagnetic system.

Title: Nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in ballistic graphene Andreev interferometers
Authors: Asmaul Smitha Rashid, Le Yi, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Nitin Samarth, Régis Mélin, Morteza Kayyalha
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in a voltage-biased graphene three-terminal Josephson junction (JJ). We observe periodic oscillations of resistance with maxima at multiples of the magnetic flux quantum (noninversion regime). As we increase the bias voltage, we further observe a transition point beyond which oscillations exhibit a $\pi$ phase shift (inversion regime) with maxima of resistance occuring at multiples of half-flux quantum. At this transition point, the frequency of the oscillations is doubled. We develop a model based on the coupling of the static Andreev bound states (ABSs) to the nonequilibrium Fermi surface of graphene to explain the observed noninversion to inversion crossovers. Our model associates these crossovers to microscopic phase-sensitive Andreev reflections which couple the normal and superfluid components of the current. Our findings show that multiterminal JJs can be used to engineer unconventional energy-phase relations such as those expected in the $\pi$-shifted ABSs without relying on quartet and Floquet physics. These nonequilibrium ABSs could potentially find applications in superconducting $\pi$ qubits.

Title: Mutual distribution of two partial solutions in 1D localization: new information on the phase transition
Authors: I. M. Suslov (<a href="http://P.L.Kapitza" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> Institute for Physical Problems, Moscow, Russia)
Abstract: We consider the mutual distribution of two linearly independent solutions y_1(x) and y_2(x) of the 1D Schroedinger equation with a random potential. Since individual distributions of $y_1$ and $y_2$ are log-normal, it is naturally to suggest that their mutual distribution is also log-normal. Such hypothesis is confirmed in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands, but failed near the initial band edge. The mechanism of deviations from the log-normal form is elucidated, and the first correction to it is calculated. The latter allows to demonstrate broadening of the spectral lines in the universal conductance fluctuations. A lot of new information is obtained on the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), where \psi is a combined phase entering the evolution equations. According to the previous publications, this transition is related with appearance of the imaginary part of \psi at a certain energy E_0, and is not accompanied by singularities in the system resistance. The real sense of this transition consists in the change of configuration of four Lyapunov exponents, which determine the general solution: there are two pairs of complex-conjugated exponents for E>E_0, while for E<E_0 all exponents become real. Realization of two different configurations is confirmed for energies in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands; it proves the existence of the singular point E_0 at the formal level. The phase transition can be observed in optical systems, tracing the sign of the field in a wave, when the coordinate is changed.

Title: Tunable atomically enhanced moiré Berry curvatures in twisted triple bilayer graphene
Authors: Konstantin Davydov, Ziyan Zhu, Noah Friedman, Ethan Gramowski, Yaotian Li, Jack Tavakley, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Mitchell Luskin, Efthimios Kaxiras, Ke Wang
Abstract: We report a twisted triple bilayer graphene platform consisting of three units of Bernal bilayer graphene consecutively twisted at 1.49° and 1.68°. We demonstrate the atomic reconstruction between the two competing moiré superlattices strongly enhances the Berry curvature of each moiré band insulator state, characterized by measured strong nonlocal valley Hall effect that sensitively depends on the inter-moiré competition strength, tunable by manipulating the out-of-plane carrier distribution. Our study sheds light on the microscopic mechanism of atomic and electronic reconstruction in twisted multilayer systems, by systematically investigating transport signatures of moiré Berry curvature and its enhancement from moiré-of-moiré lattice reconstruction. We show that the reconstructed electronic band can be versatilely tuned by electrostatics, providing an approach toward engineering the band structure and its topology for a quantum material platform with designer electrical and optical properties.

Title: Electric Control of Polarity in Spin-Orbit Josephson Diode
Authors: Junghyun Shin, Jae-Ho Han, Anjali Rathore, Joon Sue Lee, Seung-Bo Shim, Jinwoong Cha, Sunghun Park, Junho Suh
Abstract: The effect of spin-orbit coupling in a Josephson diode has not been elucidated due to its interplay with the complexity of Josephson devices. Here, we systematically control local electric fields in epitaxial Al-InAs Josephson junctions under in-plane magnetic fields and observe a polarity reversal of the Josephson diode. We interpret this polarity reversal as an effect of field-tunable spin-orbit coupling on nonreciprocal Josephson currents. A theoretical model, accounting for Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings in a planar Josephson junction containing many transverse subbands, aligns with the observed polarity reversal and its dependence on magnetic field. Our finding addresses spin-orbit control in a Josephson diode, enabling manipulation of Josephson harmonics.

Title: Meissner effect in non-Hermitian superconductors
Authors: Shun Tamura, Helene Müller, Linus Aliani, Viktoriia Kornich
Abstract: We study theoretically Meissner effect in non-Hermitian systems of BCS type, i.e., with an electron-electron interaction leading to the mean field description in a Cooper channel, via superfluid stiffness. We show that depending on the values of the mean fields, chemical potential, and temperature, we obtain paramagnetic or diamagnetic Meissner effect. Notably, positive real part of the product of mean fields guarantees diamagnetic Meissner effect in an $s$-wave 3D non-Hermitian superconductor. Once the mean fields are close to being anti-Hermitian, 2D $s$-, $p_x$-, and $d$-wave superconductors exhibit interesting behaviour, including negative superfluid stiffness giving paramagnetic Meissner effect for certain parameters. Negative superfluid stiffness indicates instability of this collective state.

Title: A Spectral-based Physics-informed Finite Operator Learning for Prediction of Mechanical Behavior of Microstructures
Authors: Ali Harandi, Hooman Danesh, Kevin Linka, Stefanie Reese, Shahed Rezaei
Abstract: A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with minimal computational overhead, effectively eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. The introduced methodology accelerates the training process by enabling gradient construction on a fixed, finite discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning (SPiFOL) framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without relying on labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition, which also guarantees the periodicity. SPiFOL, as a physics-informed operator learning method, enables rapid predictions through forward inference after training. To ensure accuracy, we incorporate physical constraints and diversify the training data. However, performance may still degrade for out-of-distribution microstructures. SPiFOL is further enhanced by integrating a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields and provides nearly resolution-independent results. Additionally, its zero-shot super-resolution capabilities are explored in heterogeneous domains. Finally, SPiFOL is extended to handle 3D problems and further adapted to finite elasticity, demonstrating the robustness of the framework in handling nonlinear mechanical behavior. The framework shows great potential for efficient and scalable prediction of mechanical responses in complex material systems while also reducing the training time required for training physics-informed neural operators.

Title: Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Workflow for Transmission Electron Microscopy: From Data Analysis Automation to Materials Knowledge Unveiling

Abstract: (Scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) has significantly advanced materials science but faces challenges in correlating precise atomic structure information with the functional properties of devices due to its time-intensive nature. To address this, we introduce an analytical workflow for the holistic characterization, modelling, and simulation of device heterostructures. This workflow automates the experimental (S)TEM data analysis, providing an in-depth characterization of crystallographic information, 3D orientation, elemental composition, and strain distribution. It reduces a process that typically takes days for a trained human into an automatic routine solved in minutes. Utilizing a physics-guided artificial intelligence model, it generates representative descriptions of materials and samples. The workflow culminates in creating digital twins, 3D finite element and atomic models of millions of atoms, enabling simulations that provide crucial insights into device behaviour in practical applications. Demonstrated with SiGe planar heterostructures for scalable spin qubits, the workflow links digital twins to theoretical properties, revealing how atomic structure impacts materials and functional properties such as spatially-resolved phononic or electronic characteristics, or (inverse) spin orbit lengths. The versatility of our workflow is demonstrated through its application to a wide array of materials systems, device configurations, and sample morphologies.

Title: Stable Thin Clathrate Layers
Authors: Eva Pospíšilová
Abstract: We explore elemental Si, Ge and Sn free-standing slabs in diamond, clathrate and other competing structures and evaluate their stability by comparing Kohn-Sham total energies at the same atoms/area coverage $\rho$. We find that within 3-6 ML range (in units of diamond monolayer), the surface energy stabilizes clathrates against the bulk-stable diamond structure or other competitors, for all three elements. At~1.3-1.6 ML coverages, Si and Ge stable layers are adatomic decorations of the puckered honeycomb lattice, forming a dumbbell--decorated pattern with rectangular unit cell. Analogical Sn layer is unstable to a web-like net of interconnected Sn$_9$ clusters. The zoo of stable thin-layer non-diamond structures is completed by a Sn metallic bilayer at 2.3 ML coverage.

Title: A Density Functional Theory Study of Magnetic Transition in MnO2 adsorbed Vanadium Carbide (V$_2$C) MXene
Authors: Mahjabeen Fatima, Saleem Ayaz Khan, Syed Rizwan
Abstract: The work reports nonmagnetic behavior (0.04 $\mu$B) in two-dimensional (2D) V2C-OF MXene and ferromagnetism in MnO$_2$ adsorbed V2C-OF MXene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the magnetic moments of V$_2$C-OF and MnO$_2$@V$_2$C-OF MXene. The MXene, which is derived from the exfoliation of its parent V$_2$AlC MAX phase, shows a good potential to be a ferromagnetic when MnO$_2$ is adsorbed on it. The V$_2$C MXene and MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene were successfully synthesized, as characterized using X-ray diffraction, showing an increased c-lattice parameter from 22.6Å to 27.2Å after MnO$_2$ adsorption. The DFT study confirmed that MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene changed from nonmagnetic (in V$_2$C MXene) to a strong ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 4.48$\mu$B for Mn adsorbed V$_2$C-OF MXene. The current work is a step-forward towards understanding of magnetism in two-dimensional materials for future 2D spintronics.

Title: Surface topological quantum criticality: Conformal manifolds and Discrete Strong Coupling Fixed Points
Authors: Saran Vijayan, Fei Zhou
Abstract: In this article, we study quantum critical phenomena in surfaces of symmetry-protected topological matter, i.e. surface topological quantum criticality. A generic phase boundary of gapless surfaces in a symmetry-protected state shall be a co-dimension one manifold in an interaction parameter space of dimension $D_p$ (where $p$ refers to the parameter space) where the value of $D_p$ further depends on bulk topologies. In the context of fermionic topological insulators that we focus on, $D_p$ depends on the number of half-Dirac cones $\mathcal{N}$. We construct such manifolds explicitly for a few interaction parameter spaces with various $D_p$ values. Most importantly, we further illustrate that in cases with $D_p=3$ and $6$, there are sub-manifolds of fixed points that dictate the universalities of surface topological quantum criticality. These infrared stable manifolds are associated with emergent symmetries in the renormalization-group-equation flow naturally appearing in the loop expansion. Unlike in the usual order-disorder quantum critical phenomena, typically governed by an isolated Wilson-Fisher fixed point, we find in the one-loop approximation surface topological quantum criticalities are naturally captured by conformal manifolds where the number of marginal operators uniquely determines their co-dimensions. Isolated strong coupling fixed points also appear, usually as the endpoints in the phase boundary of surface topological quantum phases. However, their extreme infrared instabilities along multiple directions suggest that they shall be related to multi-critical surface topological quantum critical phenomena rather than generic surface topological quantum criticality. We also discuss and classify higher-loop symmetry-breaking effects, which can either distort the conformal manifolds or further break the conformal manifolds down to a few distinct fixed points.

Title: Optical detection of 4-spin chiral interaction in a 2D honeycomb ferrimagnet
Authors: Bektur Murzaliev, Mikhail Katsnelson, Mikhail Titov
Abstract: Broken inversion symmetry of magnetic lattice is normally described by Lifshitz invariants in micromagnetic energy functional. Three exceptions are the lattices with T$_\textrm{d}$, C$_\textrm{3h}$ and D$_\textrm{3h}$ point group symmetries. The inversion symmetry breaking of the corresponding magnets is described by more complex 4-spin chiral invariants that cannot be related to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Experimental detection of 4-spin chiral interactions is an important task that has yet to be performed. We propose that the 4-spin chiral interaction can be probed by energy selective magnon relaxation in two-dimensional ferromagnet Fe$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ that possess D$_\textrm{3h}$ point group symmetry.

Title: Sliding wear: role of plasticity
Authors: Ruibin Xu, B.N.J. Persson
Abstract: We present experimental wear data for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sliding on tile, sandpaper, and polished steel surfaces, as well as for soda-lime, borosilicate, and quartz glass sliding on sandpaper. The experimental results are compared with a recently developed theory of sliding wear\cite{ToBe}. Our findings demonstrate that wear on surfaces with roughness below a critical threshold cannot result from crack propagation induced by frictional shear stress in block-substrate asperity contact regions and must, therefore, originate from a different mechanism.

Title: First-principles derived force field for h-BN monolayer nanostructures: Applications to sheets, nanotubes and nanotori
Authors: Aristotelis P. Sgouros, Markos Arapchatzis, Nektarios N. Lathiotakis, Konstantinos Papagelis, George Kalosakas
Abstract: In this work, we present an empirical force field for hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers, derived via a bottom-up strategy from first principles calculations. We aim to deliver a simple analytical force field for boron nitride which is efficient and applicable to large-scale simulations, without compromising its accuracy. The force field is developed with the goal to analytically reproducing the potential energy contributions arising from planar bond-stretching and bond-angle-bending deformations, as well as from out-of-plane torsional deformations, as obtained from periodic density functional theory calculations. Analytical anharmonic potential energy functions were employed to describe and parameterize the force field through a fitting process. The potential is applied for estimating in-plane (stiffness matrix and elastic constants) and out-of-plane (bending and Gaussian rigidity) mechanical properties of monolayer hBNs using both molecular mechanics calculations and analytical formulas. Additionally, we determined the elastic properties of more complex nanostructures, including hBN nanotubes and nanotori. By combining a continuum model for bent hollow beams with the definition of bending rigidity, we validate the model predictions against an analytical expression for the bending rigidity of large-diameter hBN nanotubes, expressed as a function of their radius and the in-plane Young modulus.

Title: Inhomogeneous Evolution of a Dense Ensemble of Optically Pumped Excitons to a Charge Transfer State
Authors: Natasha Kirova, Serguei Brazovskii
Abstract: Phase transformations induced by short optical pulses are mainstream in studies on the dynamics of cooperative electronic states. We present a semi-phenomenological modeling of spacio-temporal effects expected when optical excitons are intricate with the order parameter as in, e.g., organic compounds with neutral-ionic ferroelectric phase transitions. A conceptual complication appears here, where both the excitation and the ground state ordering are built from the intermolecular electronic transfer. To describe both thermodynamic and dynamic effects on the same root, we adopt, for the phase transition, a view of the Excitonic Insulator - a hypothetical phase of a semiconductor that appears if the exciton energy becomes negative. After the initial pumping pulse, a quasi-condensate of excitons can appear as a macroscopic quantum state that then evolves, while interacting with other degrees of freedom which are prone to an instability. The self-trapping of excitons enhances their density, which can locally surpass a critical value to trigger the phase transformation. The system is stratified in domains that evolve through dynamical phase transitions and may persist even after the initiating excitons have recombined.

Title: Transitions from Composite Fermi Liquid to Moore-Read States in Weyl Semimetals
Authors: Jiong-Hao Wang, Yong Xu
Abstract: Weyl semimetals represent a significant class of topological gapless materials in three dimensions and have been shown to exhibit three-dimensional quantum Hall effect. However, existing research mainly focuses on scenarios without interactions. Recent studies suggest that the fractional quantum Hall effect can arise in a Weyl semimetal with a one-third filled Landau level under a magnetic field. However, it remains unclear whether more exotic states, such as composite Fermi liquid and MooreRead states, can appear at half filling. Here we surprisingly find the existence of composite Fermi liquid, Moore-Read states and charge density waves in the same Weyl-orbit-based Landau level of a Weyl semimetal and their transitions induced by varying the distance between Weyl points. We attribute these transitions to a significant change in the single-particle wave functions of the Landau level as the distance between Weyl points is varied. Finally, we demonstrate that a transition from composite Fermi liquid to Moore-Read states can be induced by tuning the direction of a magnetic field, a process that is more experimentally accessible.

Title: Pseudo-Ising superconductivity induced by $p$-wave magnetism
Authors: Zi-Ting Sun, Xilin Feng, Ying-Ming Xie, Benjamin T. Zhou, Jin-Xin Hu, K. T. Law
Abstract: Unconventional magnetic orders usually interplay with superconductivity in intriguing ways. Here we propose that a conventional superconductor in proximity to a compensated $p$-wave magnet exhibits behaviors analogous to those of Ising superconductivity found in transition-metal dichalcogenides, which we refer to as pseudo-Ising superconductivity. The pseudo-Ising superconductivity is characterized by several distinctive features: (i) it stays much more robust under strong $p$-wave magnetism than usual ferromagnetism or $d$-wave altermagnetism, thanks to the apparent time-reversal symmetry in $p$-wave spin splitting; (ii) in the low-temperature regime, a second-order superconducting phase transition occurs at a significantly enhanced in-plane upper critical magnetic field $B_{c2}$; (iii) the supercurrent-carrying state establishes non-vanishing out-of-plane spin magnetization, which is forbidden by symmetry in Rahsba and Ising superconductors. We further propose a spin-orbit-free scheme to realize Majorana zero modes by placing superconducting quantum wires on a $p$-wave magnet. Our work establishes a new form of unconventional superconductivity generated by $p$-wave magnetism.

Title: Emergence of $X$ states in a quantum impurity model
Authors: Moallison F. Cavalcante, Marcus V. S. Bonança, Eduardo Miranda, Sebastian Deffner
Abstract: In the present work, we demonstrate the emergence of $X$ states in the long-time response of a locally perturbed many-body quantum impurity model. The emergence of the double-qubit state is heralded by the lack of decay of the response function as well as the out-of-time order correlator, signifying the trapping of excitations and hence information in edge modes. Surprisingly, after carrying out a quantum information theory characterization, we show that such states exhibit genuine quantum correlations.

Title: Tuning the surface energy of fluorinated diamond-like carbon coatings via plasma immersion ion implantation plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition with 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane
Authors: Yuhan Tong, Maryam Zahedian, Aiping Zeng, Ricardo Vidrio, Mike Efremov, Shenwei Yin, Hongyan Mei, Patrick Heaney, Jennifer T. Choy
Abstract: We demonstrate an environmentally friendly and scalable method to create fluorine-doped diamond-like carbon (F-DLC) coatings using plasma immersion ion implantation plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PIII-PECVD) with 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. F-DLC films tend to have low wettability and good mechanical flexibility, which make them suitable for applications in biomedical devices and antibiofouling surfaces. We report on the effects of fluorine incorporation on the surface chemistry, surface energy, and morphology of these coatings, showing that our method is effective in increasing the fluorine content in the F-DLC up to 40%. We show that the addition of fluorine leads to a decrease in surface energy, which is consistent with a reduction in surface wettability.

Title: Photoemission electron microscopy of exciton-polaritons in thin WSe$_2$ waveguides
Authors: Tobias Eul, Miwan Sabir, Victor DeManuel-Gonzalez, Florian Diekmann, Kai Rossnagel, Michael Bauer
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings provide a basis for the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.

Title: Stirring supercooled colloidal liquids at the particle scale
Authors: Piotr Habdas, Eric R. Weeks
Abstract: We study the decay of tangential velocity profiles with distance from a local disturbance in hard-sphere colloidal suspensions as the colloidal glass transition is approached. The disturbance, generated by a dimer of superparamagnetic particles rotated by an external magnetic field, enables a precise characterization of the system's response through confocal microscopy and tracking of individual particle dynamics. The tangential velocity profiles exhibit nearly exponential decay with distance. As particle density increases toward the colloidal glass transition, the characteristic length scale derived from exponential fits grows. We also observe that the colloidal particles slip against the rotating dimer, with less slip in samples which are closer to the glass transition.

Title: Thermal response functions and second sound in single-layer hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Patrick K. Schelling, Antonio Martinez Margolles, Logan Echazabal
Abstract: Ballistic heat transport and second sound propagation in solids is of direct relevance in electronic and energy applications at short length scales and low temperatures. Measurement or calculation of thermal conductivity, which is typically a primary objective, may be of limited usefulness for predicting heat transport which does not follow the heat-diffusion equation. In this paper, molecular-dynamics simulations of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are used to compute thermal response functions from equilibrium correlation functions defined in Fourier space. The response functions are useful for describing the time-dependent transport beyond the usual assumptions of Fourier's law. The results demonstrate that for length scales ~110nm at T=100K second sound should be experimentally observable. At higher temperatures and longer length scales, while second sound may not be directly observable, thermal transport can nevertheless strongly deviate from predictions based on the heat-diffusion equation. Along with classical simulations, we outline a first-principles, many-body theoretical approach for calculation of the response function based on solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The relevant expressions for heat current clarify the importance of phase coherence within a phonon branch to the observation of second sound. Previous work on one-dimensional chains is also discussed to show that materials characterized by linear dispersion and simple phonon band structure should more readily display second sound.

Title: Non-ergodic Phase Transition in the Global Hysteresis of the Frustrated Magnet DyRu2Si2
Authors: S. Yoshimoto, Y. Tabata, T. Waki, H. Nakamura
Abstract: Some frustrated magnets exhibit a huge hysteresis called "global hysteresis (GH)", where the magnetic plateaus appearing in the increasing field process are skipped in the decreasing field process from the high magnetic field state. In this paper, we focused on the frustrated magnet DyRu2Si2 and measured magnetization relaxations from two plateau states inside the GH loop, the phases III and IV, and investigated the phase transitions into them. As a result of the relaxation measurements, no relaxation is observed in the phase III, whereas long-time relaxations of more than 105 sec are observed at the phase IV plateau. Moreover, a Mpemba-effect-like relaxation phenomenon where the relaxation from an initial state prepared in the zero-field-cooled condition overtakes that from an initial state prepared in the field-cooled condition is observed. These results indicate that the phase IV is the non-ergodic state with a complex free-energy landscape with multiple local minima, while the phase III has a simple free energy structure. Therefore, the III-IV phase transition is considered to be the ergodic to non-ergodic phase transition. Although this type of phase transition typically occurs in random glassy systems, the phase IV in DyRu2Si2 has a regular long-range ordered magnetic structure and yet exhibits non-ergodic properties, which is highly nontrivial. Our findings open the possibility of observing non-ergodic states in frustrated magnets with regular long-range orders.

Title: X-ray Thomson scattering studies on spin-singlet stabilization of highly compressed H-like Be ions heated to two million degrees Kelvin
Authors: M. W. C. Dharma-wardana, Dennis. D. Klug (NRC-Canada)
Abstract: Experiments at the US National Ignition Facility (NIF) [Döppner et al., Nature {\bf 618}, 270-275 (2023)] have created highly compressed hot hydrogen-like Be plasmas. Published analyses of the the NIF experiment have used finite-$T$ multi-atom density-functional theory (DFT) with Molecular dynamics (MD), and Path-Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations. These methods are very expensive to implement and often lack physical transparency. Here we (i) relate their results to simpler first-principles average-atom results, (ii) establish the feasibility of rapid data analysis, with good accuracy and gain in physical transparency, and (iii) show that the NIF experiment reveals high-$T$ spin-singlet pairing of hydrogen-like Be ions with near neighbours. Our analysis predicts such stabilization over a wide range of compressed densities for temperatures close to two million Kelvin. Calculations of structure factors $S(k)$ for electrons or ions, the Raleigh weight and other quantities of interest to X-ray Thomson scattering are presented. We find that the NIF data at the scattering wavevector $k_{sc}$ of 7.89 Å$^{-1}$ are more consistent with a density of $20\pm2$ g/cm$^3$, mean ionization $\bar{Z}=$3.25, at a temperature of $\simeq$ 1,800,000 K than the 34 g/cm$^3, \bar{Z}=3.4$ proposed by the NIF team. The relevance of ion-electron coupled-modes in studying small $k_{sc}$ data is indicated.

Title: Thermally driven two-sphere microswimmer with internal feedback control
Authors: Jun Li, Ziluo Zhang, Zhanglin Hou, Yuto Hosaka, Kento Yasuda, Linli He, Shigeyuki Komura
Abstract: We discuss the locomotion of a thermally driven elastic two-sphere microswimmer with internal feedback control that is realized by the position-dependent friction coefficients. In our model, the two spheres are in equilibrium with independent heat baths having different temperatures, causing a heat flow between the two spheres. We generally show that the average velocity of the microswimmer is nonzero when the friction coefficients are position-dependent. Using the method of stochastic thermodynamics, we obtain the entropy production rate and discuss the efficiency of the two-sphere microswimmer. The proposed self-propulsion mechanism highlights the importance of information in active matter and can be a fundamental process in various biological systems.

Title: Nonresonant Casimir-Polder repulsion with a monolayer topological insulator
Authors: Bing-Sui Lu
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force acting on a metastable polarized state of a two-level atomic system with a right-circularly polarized electric dipole transition in the presence of a monolayer topological insulator inhabiting an anomalous quantum Hall insulator state with a negative Chern number, finding that the force can be repulsive for a certain range within the far-field region. By considering stanene irradiated by circularly polarized monochromatic laser light as a material example of a monolayer topological insulator, we study the effect of the frequency dispersion in the conductivity tensor on the force behavior, finding that the dispersion generally leads to a slight downward shift of the force relative to that predicted by a nondispersive approximation, as well as a slight reduction of the range over which the force is repulsive.

Title: Non-Lorentzian model for strong exciton-plasmon coupling
Authors: Tigran V. Shahbazyan
Abstract: We develop a non-Lorentzian analytical model for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the explicit form of LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of semiclassical Maxwell-Bloch equations that describe LSPs directly in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE resonantly coupled to an LSP, we obtain an analytical expression for effective optical polarizability of the hybrid system which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the results of the classical coupled oscillators model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from temporal dispersion of the metal dielectric function affect significantly the optical spectra as the hybrid system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to results of Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight in the system scattering spectra is shifted toward the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.

Title: Visualization of spin-splitter effect in altermagnets via non-equilibrium Green functions on a lattice
Authors: Karl Bergson Hallberg, Erik Wegner Hodt, Jacob Linder
Abstract: When a charge current is injected into an altermagnet along a suitable crystallographic direction, a transverse spin current can be generated. This so-called spin-splitter effect does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, and is thus distinct from the spin Hall effect. The spin-splitter effect was predicted by \textit{ab initio} calculations and has been experimentally confirmed. To utilize the spin-splitter effect for practical purposes in spintronic devices, it is important to understand (i) how the system parameters affect the transverse spin current, such as filling fraction, altermagnetic strength, interface parameters, spin-orbit interactions, and impurities and (ii) determine the properties of any associated spin accumulation, which is the measurable quantity. Here, we determine the answer to these questions and provide a real-space visualization of the spin flow and spin accumulation due to the spin-splitter effect. We utilize the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function method on a 2D square lattice to this end. We find that the presence of edges induces oscillations in the spin accumulation and strongly modify the signal for small samples. At half-filling, the spin accumulation acquires an anomalous pattern and the spin-splitter effect vanishes. We prove analytically that this follows from a combined particle-hole and spin-reversal symmetry of the model used for the altermagnetic state. Increasing the altermagnetic strength leads to a larger spin accumulation, as expected. However, when adding Rashba spin-orbit interaction, providing an additional spin Hall signal, we find that the spin accumulation is not simply the sum of the spin Hall and spin-splitter contribution. Finally, we show that the spin-splitter effect is robust towards moderate impurity scattering with a potential of the same order as the hopping parameter, which facilitates its observation in real materials.

Title: Fastest first-passage time statistics for time-dependent particle injection
Authors: Denis S. Grebenkov, Ralf Metzler, Gleb Oshanin
Abstract: A common scenario in a variety of biological systems is that multiple particles are searching in parallel for an immobile target located in a bounded domain, and the fastest among them that arrives to the target first triggers a given desirable or detrimental process. The statistics of such extreme events -- the \textit{fastest\/} first-passage to the target -- is well-understood by now through a series of theoretical analyses, but exclusively under the assumption that all $N$ particles start \textit{simultaneously\/}, i.e., all are introduced into the domain instantly, by $\delta$-function-like pulses. However, in many practically important situations this is not the case: in order to start their search, the particles often have to enter first into a bounded domain, e.g., a cell or its nucleus, penetrating through gated channels or nuclear pores. This entrance process has a random duration so that the particles appear in the domain sequentially and with a time delay. Here we focus on the effect of such an extended-in-time injection of multiple particles on the fastest first-passage time (fFPT) and its statistics. We derive the full probability density function $H_N(t)$ of the fFPT with an arbitrary time-dependent injection intensity of $N$ particles. Under rather general assumptions on the survival probability of a single particle and on the injection intensity, we derive the large-$N$ asymptotic formula for the mean fFPT, which is quite different from that obtained for the instantaneous $\delta$-pulse injection. The extended injection is also shown to considerably slow down the convergence of $H_N(t)$ to the large-$N$ limit -- the Gumbel distribution -- so that the latter may be inapplicable in the most relevant settings with few tens to few thousands of particles.

Title: Signatures of exceptional points in multiterminal superconductor-normal metal junctions
Authors: Oliver Solow, Karsten Flensberg
Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian, multiterminal superconducting-normal system in order to identify experimental signatures of exceptional points. We focus on a minimal setting with a single spinful level, spin-dependent normal leads, and a noncollinear magnetic field. This system hosts both topologically-protected, as well as symmetry-protected exceptional points. Using an exact transport formalism, we show that the exceptional points are visible through spectroscopy of the Andreev states, but that they have a minor effect on the Josephson current. We also argue that these findings hold with interactions.

Title: Transfer of active motion from medium to probe via the induced friction and noise
Authors: Ji-Hui Pei, Christian Maes
Abstract: Can activity be transmitted from smaller to larger scales? We report on such a transfer from a homogeneous active medium to a Newtonian spherical probe. The active medium consists of faster and dilute self-propelled particles, modeled as run-and-tumble particles in 1D or as active Brownian particles in 2D. We derive the reduced fluctuating dynamics of the probe, valid for arbitrary probe velocity, characterized by velocity-dependent friction and noise. In addition to a standard passive regime, we identify peculiar active regimes where the probe becomes self-propelled with high persistence, and its velocity distribution begets peaks at nonzero values. These features are quantitatively confirmed by numerical simulations of the joint probe-medium system. The emergence of active regimes depends not only on the far-from-equilibrium nature of the medium but also on the probe-medium coupling. Our findings reveal how, solely via the induced friction and noise, persistence can cross different scales to transfer active motion.

Abstract: We have revisited the Kittel model that describes antiferroelectricity (AFE) in terms of two sublattices of spontaneous polarization and antiparallel couplings. By constructing the comprehensive phase diagram including the antiferroelectric, ferroelectric, and paraelectric phases in the parameter space, we identified a phase with antiferroelectric stable states and ferroelectric metastable states (ASFM) due to the w2Institute of Materials Science and Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, USAeak coupling between sublattices. We found that the metastability of the ferroelectric phase leads to apparent remanent polarization, depending on the measurement timescale. This explains the observed ferroelectric behavior of orthorhombic hafnia, which is predicted to be an antiferroelctric materials.

Title: Surface-Dominated Quantum Metric-Induced Nonlinear Transport in the Layered Antiferromagnet CrSBr
Authors: Kamal Das, Yufei Zhao, Binghai Yan
Abstract: The van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnet CrSBr has recently garnered significant attention due to its air stability, high magnetic transition temperature, and semiconducting properties. We investigate its nonlinear transport properties and identify a quantum metric dipole-induced nonlinear anomalous Hall effect and nonlinear longitudinal resistivity, which switch sign upon reversing the Néel vector. The significant quantum metric dipole originates from Dirac nodal lines near the conduction band edge within the experimentally achievable doping range. Known the weak interlayer coupling, it is unexpected that the nonlinear conductivities do not scale with sample thickness but are dominantly contributed by surface layers. In the electron-doped region, the top layer dominates the response while the top three layers contribute the most in the hole-doped region. Our results establish topological nodal lines as a guiding principle to design high-performance nonlinear quantum materials and suggest that surface-sensitive transport devices will provide new avenues for nonlinear electronic applications.

Title: How quantum fluctuations freeze a classical liquid and then melt it into a topological one
Authors: Hao Chen, Dan Mao, Andrea Kouta Dagnino, Glenn Wagner, Mark H. Fischer, Juraj Hasik, Eun-Ah Kim, Titus Neupert
Abstract: Topologically ordered quantum liquids are highly sought-after quantum phases of matter, and recently, fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) joined the few experimental realizations of such phases. Here, we ask whether a gapped classical, highly degenerate liquid can be the birthplace of FCIs upon the addition of suitable quantum fluctuations. Two competing tendencies can be anticipated: (i) following the quantum order-by-disorder paradigm, quantum fluctuations could induce symmetry-breaking (charge) order, or (ii) the classical liquid builds up long-range entanglement and turns into a quantum liquid. We study spinless fermions on a honeycomb lattice subject to cluster-charging interactions and introduce quantumness through a Haldane kinetic term, featuring complex second-nearest-neighbor hopping. Based on extensive exact diagonalization calculations and high-order perturbation theory, we find that neither scenario (i) nor (ii) prevails, but (i) and (ii) manifest sequentially as the kinetic energy is increased. We demonstrate how the gradual lifting of kinematic constraints gives rise to this sequence of phases. Our results relate to the regime of intermediate-scale interactions present in moiré systems, where band projections are not suitable to model FCIs and competing charge-ordered phases have been identified.

Title: Out-of-equilibrium dynamics across the first-order quantum transitions of one-dimensional quantum Ising models
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto, Davide Rossini, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional quantum Ising models in a transverse field $g$, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field $h$ across their {\em magnetic} first-order quantum transition at $h=0$, for sufficiently small values of $|g|$. We consider nearest-neighbor Ising chains of size $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. We focus on the out-of-equilibrium behavior arising from Kibble-Zurek protocols, in which $h$ is varied linearly in time with time scale $t_s$, i.e., $h(t)=t/t_s$. The system starts from the ground state at $h_i\equiv h(t_i)<0$, where the longitudinal magnetization $M$ is negative. Then it evolves unitarily up to positive values of $h(t)$, where $M(t)$ becomes eventually positive. We identify several scaling regimes characterized by a nontrivial interplay between the size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$, which can be observed when the system is close to one of the many avoided level crossings that occur for $h\ge 0$. In the $L\to\infty$ limit, all these crossings approach $h=0^+$, making the study of the thermodynamic limit, defined as the limit $L\to\infty$ keeping $t$ and $t_s$ constant, problematic. We study such limit numerically, by first determining the large-$L$ quantum evolution at fixed $t_s$, and then analyzing its behavior with increasing $t_s$. Our analysis shows that the system switches from the initial state with $M<0$ to a positively magnetized state at $h = h_*(t_s)>0$, where $h_*(t_s)$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, apparently as $h_*\sim 1/\ln t_s$. This suggests the existence of a scaling behavior in terms of the rescaled time $\Omega = t \ln t_s/t_s$. The numerical results also show that the system converges to a nontrivial stationary state in the large-$t$ limit, characterized by an energy significantly larger than that of the corresponding homogeneously magnetized ground state.

Title: Shuttling Majorana zero modes in disordered and noisy topological superconductors
Authors: Bill P. Truong, Kartiek Agarwal, T. Pereg-Barnea
Abstract: The braiding of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) forms the fundamental building block for topological quantum computation. Braiding protocols which involve the physical exchange of MZMs are typically envisioned on a network of topological superconducting wires. An essential component of these protocols is the transport of MZMs, which can be performed by using electric gates to locally tune sections ("piano keys") of the wire between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. In this work, we numerically simulate this piano key transport on a superconducting wire which contains either disorder (uncorrelated and correlated) or noise. We focus on the impact of these additional effects on the diabatic error, which describes unwanted transitions between the ground state and excited states. We show that the behavior of the average diabatic error is predominantly controlled by the statistics of the minimum bulk energy gap which is suppressed in the presence of disorder. The increase in diabatic error can be several orders of magnitude and is most deleterious when the disorder correlation length is a finite fraction of the piano key size and negligible when these lengths are far apart. In the presence of noise, the diabatic error is significantly enhanced due to optical transitions which depend on the minimum bulk energy gap as well as the frequency modes present in the noise. The results presented here serve to further characterize the diabatic error in disordered and noisy settings, which are important considerations in practical implementations of physical braiding schemes.

Abstract: We show by acoustic emission analysis that FeAlCrMo complex-concentrated alloy (CCA) exhibits signatures of self-organization of deformation processes during both microplasticity and serrated flow (dynamic strain aging). Due to complex microstructures of CCAs and scarcity of literature data, these novel alloys are a prominent subject of future research efforts.

Title: Interacting Chern insulator transition on the sphere: revealing the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality
Authors: Zhi-Qiang Gao, Taige Wang, Dung-Hai Lee
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, the transition between topological and trivial Chern insulators exemplifies a class of beyond-Landau critical phenomena. We show that the interaction-driven multicritical point of this transition falls into the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) universality class, a topic of considerable interest in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In this work, we focus on the $N=2$ case of the GNY criticality. We employ exact diagonalization of Dirac fermions on a sphere to circumvent the parity anomaly, capitalize on full SO(3) symmetry to reduce finite-size effects, and directly extract operator scaling dimensions from the excitation spectrum. Despite working with only modest system sizes, our results closely match conformal bootstrap predictions for low-scaling dimension operators and reveal several previously uncharacterized higher primaries. These findings highlight the efficacy of spherical geometry for probing interacting Dirac criticality.

Title: A Unified Predictive and Generative Solution for Liquid Electrolyte Formulation
Authors: Zhenze Yang, Yifan Wu, Xu Han, Ziqing Zhang, Haoen Lai, Zhenliang Mu, Tianze Zheng, Siyuan Liu, Zhichen Pu, Zhi Wang, Zhiao Yu, Sheng Gong, Wen Yan
Abstract: Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However, measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design. This unified framework advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.

Title: Direct Evidence of Metal-Ligand Redox in Li-ion Battery Cathodes

Thakur, Tien-Lin Lee, Dave C. Grinter, Pilar Ferrer, Serena A. Cussen, Matthias Hepting, Louis F. J. Piper
Abstract: Describing Li-ion battery cathodes in terms of distinct transition metal or oxygen redox regimes can lead to confusion in understanding metal-ligand hybridisation, oxygen dimerisation, and degradation. There is a pressing need to study the electronic structure of these materials and determine the role each cation and anion plays in charge compensation. Here, we employ transition metal Ledge X-ray Resonance Photoemission Spectroscopy in conjunction with Single Impurity Anderson simulations to directly evaluate the redox mechanisms in (de-)lithiated battery electrodes. This approach reconciles the redox description of two canonical cathodes -- LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$ and LiNiO$_{2}$ -- in terms of varying degrees of charge transfer using the established Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen framework, common to condensed matter physics. In LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$, we show that capacity arises due to the depopulation of metal 3d states. Whereas, in LiNiO$_{2}$, charge transfer dominates and redox occurs through the formation and elimination of ligand hole states. This work clarifies the role of oxygen in Ni-rich system and provides a framework to explain how capacity can be extracted from oxygen-dominated states in highly covalent systems without needing to invoke dimerisation.

Title: Quantum many-body attractors
Authors: Berislav Buca, Archak Purkayastha, Giacomo Guarnieri, Mark T. Mitchison, Dieter Jaksch, John Goold
Abstract: Complex dynamics when occurring autonomously, i.e. without external driving, is usually associated with everyday length scales and classical physics, e.g. living organisms. This dynamics is \emph{not} quantum coherent. Quantum coherent dynamics is, by contrast, assumed to be either simple periodic oscillation in particular when autonomous, e.g. spin precession, or random quantum fluctuations. Combining autonomous complex and quantum coherent dynamics on microscopic length-scales could allow for novel coherent quantum machines working without external time-dependent driving. Motivated by this, here we provide an exact theoretical condition for a system to display complex quantum coherent dynamics on both microscopic and macroscopic length scales that we call a \emph{dynamical quantum algebraic thread} (D-QAT). Due to D-QATs our autonomous quantum coherent dynamics is robust to realistic imperfections (including low-doped disorder) and present for generic initial states, allowing for potential realisations in experiments. We give an example of a \emph{spin lace} model structurally similar to magnetic azurite and certain recently experimentally realized large single-molecular magnets with long coherence times. Our work opens the possibility for many potential applications including ultra-dense storage and manipulation of quantum memories, creating \emph{giant} quantum coherent qubits, or microscopic quantum mechanism perform complicated motion.

Title: Fluctuation without dissipation: Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo
Authors: Jakob Robnik, Uroš Seljak
Abstract: Stochastic sampling algorithms such as Langevin Monte Carlo are inspired by physical systems in a heat bath. Their equilibrium distribution is the canonical ensemble given by a prescribed target distribution, so they must balance fluctuation and dissipation as dictated by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In contrast to the common belief, we show that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is not required because only the configuration space distribution, and not the full phase space distribution, needs to be canonical. We propose a continuous-time Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo (MCLMC) as a dissipation-free system of stochastic differential equations (SDE). We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation and show that the stationary distribution is the microcanonical ensemble with the desired canonical distribution on configuration space. We prove that MCLMC is ergodic for any nonzero amount of stochasticity, and for smooth, convex potentials, the expectation values converge exponentially fast. Furthermore, the deterministic drift and the stochastic diffusion separately preserve the stationary distribution. This uncommon property is attractive for practical implementations as it implies that the drift-diffusion discretization schemes are bias-free, so the only source of bias is the discretization of the deterministic dynamics. We applied MCLMC on a lattice $\phi^4$ model, where Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is currently the state-of-the-art integrator. For the same accuracy, MCLMC converges 12 times faster than HMC on an $8\times8$ lattice. On a $64\times64$ lattice, it is already 32 times faster. The trend is expected to persist to larger lattices, which are of particular interest, for example, in lattice quantum chromodynamics.

Title: Angular Momentum-Dependent Spectral Shift in Chiral Vacuum Cavities
Authors: Qing-Dong Jiang
Abstract: Based on a hybrid light-matter unitary transformation for cavity quantum electrodynamics, we investigate the spectral shift of an atom induced by quantum fluctuations in a chiral vacuum cavity. Remarkably, we find an intriguing angular momentum-dependent shift in the spectra of bound states. Our approach shows promise in going beyond traditional perturbative methods and demonstrates effectiveness even in the strong-coupling limit, as evidenced by our numerical benchmarks in the case of a two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. In addition, we establish a cavity-interaction picture for calculating the chiral vacuum Rabi oscillation in the strong-coupling limit for a generic central potential. The anomalous spectral shift revealed in this study possesses both fundamental and practical significance and could be readily observed in experiments.

Title: Automatic Input Feature Relevance via Spectral Neural Networks
Authors: Lorenzo Chicchi, Lorenzo Buffoni, Diego Febbe, Lorenzo Giambagli, Raffaele Marino, Duccio Fanelli
Abstract: In machine learning practice it is often useful to identify relevant input features, so as to obtain compact dataset for more efficient numerical handling. On the other hand, by isolating key input elements, ranked according their respective degree of relevance, can help to elaborate on the process of decision making. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Notably, the spectral features ranking is performed automatically, as a byproduct of the network training, with no additional processing to be carried out. The technique is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.

Title: Slow decay rate of correlations induced by long-range extended Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions
Authors: Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: We examine the impact of long-range Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in the extended $XY$ model on the phase diagram as well as the static and dynamical properties of quantum and classical correlation functions. It is known that in the nearest-neighbor $XY$ model with DM interaction, the transition from the gapless chiral phase to a gapped one occurs when the strengths of the DM interaction and anisotropy coincide. We exhibit that the critical line gets modified with the range of interactions which decay according to power-law. Specifically, instead of being gapless in the presence of a strong DM interaction, a gapped region emerges which grows with the increase of the moderate fall-off rate (quasi-long range regime) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. The gapless chiral phase can also be separated from a gapped one by the decay patterns of quantum mutual information and classical correlation with distant sites of the ground state which are independent of the fall-off rate in the gapless zone. We observe that the corresponding critical lines that depend on the fall-off rate can also be determined from the effective central charge involved in the scaling of entanglement entropy. We illustrate that in a non-equilibrium setting, the relaxation dynamics of classical correlation, the decay rate of total correlation, and the growth rate of entanglement entropy can be employed to uncover whether the evolving Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian corresponding to the initial state are gapped or gapless.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo and Stabilizer States
Authors: Bhilahari Jeevanesan
Abstract: The Quantum-Monte-Carlo technique known as the Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) relies on a crucial no-branching condition: the SSE sampling is carried out in the computational basis, and the no-branching assumption ensures that superpositions of basis-states do not appear when operators are applied. Without this proviso, the number of complex amplitudes would grow exponentially with the number of qubits and would eventually overwhelm the memory and processing power of a classical computer. However, the action of Clifford group elements on stabilizer states can be very efficiently described without resorting to an amplitude description. We explore how stabilizer states allow an extension of the SSE technique, and we give an example of a toy model that can be studied in this way. The method is also illustrated using the Transverse-Field Ising model.

Title: Multiscale Embedding for Quantum Computing
Authors: Leah P. Weisburn, Minsik Cho, Moritz Bensberg, Oinam Romesh Meitei, Markus Reiher, Troy Van Voorhis
Abstract: We present a novel multi-scale embedding scheme that links conventional QM/MM embedding and bootstrap embedding (BE) to allow simulations of large chemical systems on limited quantum devices. We also propose a mixed-basis BE scheme that facilitates BE calculations on extended systems using classical computers with limited memory resources. Benchmark data suggest the combination of these two strategies as a robust path in attaining the correlation energies of large realistic systems, combining the proven accuracy of BE with chemical and biological systems of interest in a lower computational cost method. Due to the flexible tunability of the resource requirements and systematic fragment construction, future developments in the realization of quantum computers naturally offer improved accuracy for multi-scale BE calculations.

Title: Fractonic Coset Construction for Spontaneously Broken Translations
Authors: Ameya Chavda, Daniel Naegels, John Staunton
Abstract: We study the homogeneous breaking of spatial translation symmetry concomitantly with the spontaneous breaking of other internal and spacetime symmetries, including dilations. We use the symmetry-breaking pattern as the only input to derive, via the coset construction, general effective field theories for the symmetry-originated modes associated with Goldstone's theorem, namely the Nambu-Goldstone candidates. Through explicit computations, we show that integrating out the explicit massive Nambu-Goldstone candidates or imposing symmetric constraints, namely the inverse Higgs constraints, to express massive modes in terms of the massless ones leads to physically distinct effective field theories. This sensitivity to the chosen method can be traced back to the homogeneous breaking of translations, the homogeneous aspect of the breaking induces a mixing between internal and spacetime symmetries at the level of the Lie algebra. This, in turn, leads to subtle discussions about the inverse Higgs constraints, in particular that they lead to a loss of generality in our specific examples. The derived general effective field theories also give rise to a broad class of theories exhibiting emergent enhanced shift symmetries, which constrain the mobility of the modes. The latter are referred to as fractonic modes.

Title: A universal inequality on the unitary 2D CFT partition function
Authors: Indranil Dey, Sridip Pal, Jiaxin Qiao
Abstract: We prove the conjecture proposed by Hartman, Keller and Stoica [HKS14]: the grand-canonical free energy of a unitary 2D CFT with a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12}+\epsilon$ and below the twist $\frac{c}{12}$ is universal in the large $c$ limit for all $\beta_L\beta_R \neq 4\pi^2$. The technique of the proof allows us to derive a one-parameter (with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1]$) family of universal inequalities on the unitary 2D CFT partition function with general central charge $c\geqslant 0$, using analytical modular bootstrap. We derive an iterative equation for the domain of validity of the inequality on the $(\beta_L,\beta_R)$ plane. The infinite iteration of this equation gives the boundary of maximal-validity domain, which depends on the parameter $\alpha$ in the inequality. In the $c \to \infty$ limit, with the additional assumption of a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12} + \epsilon$ and the twist $\frac{\alpha c}{12}$ (with $\alpha \in (0,1]$ fixed), our inequality shows that the grand-canonical free energy exhibits a universal large $c$ behavior in the maximal-validity domain. This domain, however, does not cover the entire $(\beta_L, \beta_R)$ plane, except in the case of $\alpha = 1$. For $\alpha = 1$, this proves the conjecture proposed by [HKS14], and for $\alpha < 1$, it quantifies how sparseness in twist affects the regime of universality. Furthermore, this implies a precise lower bound on the temperature of near-extremal BTZ black holes, above which we can trust the black hole thermodynamics.

Title: Quantum Many-Body Scars beyond the PXP model in Rydberg simulators
Authors: Aron Kerschbaumer, Marko Ljubotina, Maksym Serbyn, Jean-Yves Desaules
Abstract: Persistent revivals recently observed in Rydberg atom simulators have challenged our understanding of thermalization and attracted much interest to the concept of quantum many-body scars (QMBSs). QMBSs are non-thermal highly excited eigenstates that coexist with typical eigenstates in the spectrum of many-body Hamiltonians, and have since been reported in multiple theoretical models, including the so-called PXP model, approximately realized by Rydberg simulators. At the same time, questions of how common QMBSs are and in what models they are physically realized remain open. In this Letter, we demonstrate that QMBSs exist in a broader family of models that includes and generalizes PXP to longer-range constraints and states with different periodicity. We show that in each model, multiple QMBS families can be found. Each of them relies on a different approximate $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra, leading to oscillatory dynamics in all cases. However, in contrast to the PXP model, their observation requires launching dynamics from weakly entangled initial states rather than from a product state. QMBSs reported here may be experimentally probed using Rydberg atom simulator in the regime of longer-range Rydberg blockades.

Title: A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry
Authors: Lea E. Bottini, Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically a Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.

Title: The non-Hermitian skin effect: A perspective
Authors: Julius T. Gohsrich, Ayan Banerjee, Flore K. Kunst
Abstract: The non-Hermitian (NH) skin effect is a truly NH feature, which manifests itself as an accumulation of states, known as skin states, on the boundaries of a system. In this perspective, we discuss several aspects of the NH skin effect focusing on the most interesting facets of this phenomenon. Beyond reviewing necessary requirements to see the NH skin effect, we discuss the NH skin effect as a topological effect that can be seen as a manifestation of a truly NH bulk-boundary correspondence, stemming from the spectral topology, and show how skin states can be distinguished from topological boundary states. As most theoretical work has focused on studying the NH skin effect in one-dimensional non-interacting systems, recent developments of studying this effect in higher dimensions as well as in many-body systems are highlighted. Lastly, experimental signatures and applications are discussed, and an outlook is provided.

Title: Scaling of Stochastic Normalizing Flows in $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory
Authors: Andrea Bulgarelli, Elia Cellini, Alessandro Nada
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Markov Chain Monte Carlo (NE-MCMC) simulations provide a well-understood framework based on Jarzynski's equality to sample from a target probability distribution. By driving a base probability distribution out of equilibrium, observables are computed without the need to thermalize. If the base distribution is characterized by mild autocorrelations, this approach provides a way to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions share the same framework of flow-based approaches and they can be naturally combined into a novel architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this work we present the first implementation of SNFs for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions, defined by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates. The core of our analysis is focused on the promising scaling properties of this architecture with the degrees of freedom of the system, which are directly inherited from NE-MCMC. Finally, we discuss how systematic improvements of this approach can realistically lead to a general and yet efficient sampling strategy at fine lattice spacings for observables affected by long autocorrelation times.

Title: Fabrication of low-loss Josephson parametric devices
Authors: K. E. Honasoge, M. Handschuh, W. K. Yam, S. Gandorfer, D. Bazulin, N. Bruckmoser, L. Koch, A. Marx, R. Gross, K. G. Fedorov
Abstract: Superconducting circuits incorporating Josephson elements represent a promising hardware platform for quantum technologies. Potential applications include scalable quantum computing, microwave quantum networks, and quantum-limited amplifiers. However, progress in Josephson junction-based quantum technologies is facing the ongoing challenge of minimizing loss channels. This is also true for parametric superconducting devices based on nonlinear Josephson resonators. In this work, we report on the fabrication and characterization of low-loss Josephson parametric devices operated in the GHz frequency range, showing record internal quality factors. Specifically, we achieve internal quality factors $Q_\mathrm{int}$ significantly exceeding $10^5$ for both Josephson parametric converters and Josephson parametric amplifiers in the single-photon regime by fitting the scattering data. We confirm the extracted $Q_\mathrm{int}$ values by analyzing purity of squeezed vacuum states generated by these devices. These low-loss devices mark a significant step forward in realizing high-performance quantum circuits, enabling further advancements in superconducting quantum technologies.

Title: Optimal control in phase space applied to minimal-time transfer of thermal atoms in optical traps
Authors: Omar Morandi, Sara Nicoletti, Vladislav Gavryusev, Leonardo Fallani
Abstract: We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.

Title: Analog charged black hole formation via percolation: Exploring cosmic censorship and Hoop conjecture
Authors: Nitesh Jaiswal, S. Shankaranarayanan (IIT Bombay)
Abstract: We investigate an analog model of charged black hole (BH) formation using the framework of classical percolation. By analyzing the scaling behavior of key quantities, including surface gravity and Komar mass, we establish a robust correspondence between this analog system and gravitational collapse in general relativity. Our numerical simulations of the lattice model show excellent agreement with analytical predictions for the continuum limit, highlighting the potential of analog systems to capture essential features of BH physics. Interestingly, we find that while geometric criteria related to the hoop conjecture are necessary, they are not sufficient for BH formation in our model. Instead, the exponential growth of energy and cluster size emerges as the key indicator, suggesting a novel interpretation of the hoop conjecture and providing further support for cosmic censorship within our analog framework by ensuring horizon formation. This work offers a fresh perspective on the organization of matter within BH event horizons and lays the groundwork for future quantum extensions that could shed light on Hawking radiation and the BH information paradox by linking entanglement entropy in quantum percolation models to BH entropy.

Title: Emergent Hydrodynamic Mode on SU(2) Plaquette Chains and Quantum Simulation
Authors: Francesco Turro, Xiaojun Yao
Abstract: We search for emergent hydrodynamic modes in real-time Hamiltonian dynamics of $2+1$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quasi one dimensional plaquette chain, by numerically computing symmetric correlation functions of energy densities on lattice sizes of about $20$ with the local Hilbert space truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. Because of the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width approximately proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.

Title: Dynamical Phases of Higher Dimensional Floquet CFTs
Authors: Diptarka Das, Sumit R. Das, Arnab Kundu, Krishnendu Sengupta
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher-dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.

Title: Efficient mutual magic and magic capacity with matrix product states
Authors: Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Tobias Haug
Abstract: Stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic) of many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.

Title: Engineering Dark Spin-Free Diamond Interfaces

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO2) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO2 interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in spin echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin depolarization with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits.

Title: Tailoring Heat Transfer at Silica-Water Interfaces via Hydroxyl and Methyl Surface Groups
Authors: Viktor Mandrolko, Konstantinos Termentzidis, David Lacroix, Mykola Isaiev
Abstract: Efficient thermal transport across solid-liquid interfaces is essential for optimizing heat dissipation in modern technological applications. This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the impact of surface functionalization on heat transfer at the silica/water interface. It has been shown that the surface functionalization changes significantly the wetting characteristics of silica surface: from one hand hydroxyl groups render such surfaces more hydrophilic, while methyl groups more hydrophobic. Here, we reveal that modifying the surface functionalization from methylated to hydroxylated groups results in: (i) up to an approximately eightfold increase in adhesion energy, (ii) a reorientation of interfacial water molecules to align perpendicular to the surface normal, (iii) a reduction in the liquid depletion length near the interface, and (iv) an overall enhancement of interfacial heat conduction. We quantify interfacial thermal resistance through the calculation of the contribution of each functional group to the total heat flux, providing insights into the physical mechanisms governing heat transfer at functionalized interfaces. We demonstrated that manipulation of the concentrations of the functional groups can be used to tailor interfacial thermal transport.
