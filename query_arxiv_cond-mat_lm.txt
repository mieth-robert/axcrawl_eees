Title: Sub-Nanometer Interfacial Hydrodynamics: The Interplay of Interfacial Viscosity and Surface Friction
Authors: Shane R. Carlson, Roland R. Netz
Abstract: For an accurate description of nanofluidic systems, it is crucial to account for the transport properties of liquids at surfaces on sub-nanometer scales, where classical hydrodynamics fails due to the finite range of surface-liquid interactions and modifications of the local viscosity. We show how to account for both via generalized, position-dependent surface-friction and interfacial viscosity profiles, which enables the accurate description of interfacial flow on the nanoscale using the Stokes equation. Such profiles are extracted from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of water on polar, non-polar, fluorinated, and unfluorinated alkane and alcohol self-assembled monolayers of widely varying wetting characteristics. Power-law relationships among the Navier friction coefficient, interfacial viscosity excess, and depletion length are revealed, and these are each found to be exponential in the work of adhesion. Our framework forms the basis for describing sub-nanometer fluid flow at interfaces with implications for electrokinetics, biophysics, and nanofluidics.

Title: Qubit parametrization of the variational discrete action theory for the multiorbital Hubbard model
Authors: Zhengqian Cheng, Chris A. Marianetti
Abstract: The variational discrete action theory (VDAT) at \mathcal{N}=3 is a potent tool for accurately capturing Mott and Hund physics at zero temperature in d=\infty at a cost comparable to the Gutzwiller approximation, which is recovered by VDAT at \mathcal{N}=2. Here we develop a qubit parametrization of the gauge constrained algorithm of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3 for the multiorbital Hubbard model with general density-density interactions. The qubit parametrization yields an explicit variational trial energy, and the variational parameters consist of the momentum density distribution, the shape of a reference fermi surface, and the pure state of a qubit system with dimension of the local Hilbert space. To illustrate the power of the qubit parametrization, we solve for the ground state properties of the multiorbital Hubbard model with Hund coupling for local orbital number N_{orb}=2-7. A Taylor series expansion of the partially optimized trial energy is used to explain how the Hund's coupling changes the order of the Mott transition. For the case of the SU(2N_{orb}) Hubbard model, an explicit approach for computing the critical U_{c} for the Mott transition is provided, yielding an analytical expression for U_{c} in the large N_{orb} limit. Additionally, we provide an analytical solution for the ground state properties of the single band Hubbard model with a special density of states. Finally, we demonstrate that the qubit parametrization can also be applied to \mathcal{N}=2, for both G-type and B-type variants, where the G-type yields an identical expression to the slave spin mean-field theory. The qubit parametrization not only improves the efficiency and transparency of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3, but also provides the key advances for the construction of a one-body reduced density matrix functional capable of capturing Mott and Hund physics.

Title: Experimental observation of multimode quantum phase transitions in a superconducting Bose-Hubbard simulator
Authors: Claudia Castillo-Moreno, Théo Sépulcre, Timo Hillmann, Kazi Rafsanjani Amin, Mikael Kervinen, Simone Gasparinetti
Abstract: The study of phase transitions and critical phenomena arising in quantum driven-dissipative systems, and whether a correspondence can be drawn to their equilibrium counterparts, is a pressing question in contemporary physics. The development of large-scale superconducting circuits provides an experimental platform for these theoretical models. We report an experimental study of a multi-mode dissipative first-order phase transition in a 1D Bose-Hubbard chain consisting of 21 superconducting resonators. This phase transition manifests itself as a simultaneous frequency jump in all resonator modes as the frequency or power of a pump tone is swept. By measuring the system's emission spectrum through the transition, we characterize the dim-to-bright phase transition and construct the full phase diagram. We further perform time-dependent measurements of the switching between the two phases in the transition region, from which we corroborate the transition line and extract transition times ranging from a few ms up to 143~s. Our model, based on single-mode mean-field theory and cross-Kerr interactions, captures the features at moderate pump powers and quantitatively reproduces the transition line. Our results open a new window into non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics and mark a step toward realizing and understanding dissipative phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit using superconducting quantum circuits.

Title: MicroLad: 2D-to-3D Microstructure Reconstruction and Generation via Latent Diffusion and Score Distillation
Authors: Kang-Hyun Lee, Faez Ahmed
Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets. Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies, hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data, effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation. Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural descriptors and material properties.

Title: Revealing degradation mechanisms in YSZ ceramics through machine learning-guided aging and multiscale characterization
Authors: Prachi Garg, Baishakhi Mazumder
Abstract: The long-term performance of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) based energy and biomedical devices is compromised by low-temperature degradation (LTD). This study presents a novel integration of machine learning-guided hydrothermal aging with multiscale characterization to resolve a two-stage degradation mechanism in 3 mol% YSZ. Stage 1 (0 to 30 hrs) features initial surface relief building, which transitions to partial refinement and relief distribution in stage 2 (30 to 60 hrs), alongside a rise in monoclinic phase content. The evolving microstructure increases triple-junction grain boundary density, and these junctions act as degradation hotspots, where vacancy exchange and water access accelerate the transformation. These findings highlight grain boundary chemistry, rather than grain size alone, as a key LTD driver, suggesting boundary engineering as a strategy to enhance YSZ stability for energy, biomedical, and thermal applications.

Title: Probing disorder-driven topological phase transitions via topological edge modes with ultracold atoms in Floquet-engineered honeycomb lattices
Authors: Alexander Hesse, Johannes Arceri, Moritz Hornung, Christoph Braun, Monika Aidelsburger
Abstract: One of the most fascinating properties of topological phases of matter is their robustness to disorder and imperfections. Although several experimental techniques have been developed to probe the geometric properties of engineered topological Bloch bands with cold atoms, they almost exclusively rely on the translational invariance of the underlying lattice. This prevents direct studies of topology in the presence of disorder, further hindering an extension to disordered interacting topological phases. Here, we identify disorder-driven phase transitions between two distinct Floquet topological phases using the characteristic properties of topological edge modes with ultracold atoms in periodically-driven two-dimensional (2D) optical lattices. Our results constitute an important step towards studying the rich interplay between topology and disorder with cold atoms. Moreover, our measurements confirm that disorder indeed favors the anomalous Floquet topological regime over conventional Hall systems, indicating an enhanced robustness and paving the way towards observing exotic out-of-equilibrium phases such as the anomalous Floquet Anderson insulator.

Title: Nonlinear Hall effect in topological Dirac semimetals in parallel magnetic field
Authors: Maxim Dzero, Maxim Khodas, Alex Levchenko, Vladyslav Kozii
Abstract: We compute the second-harmonic response of two-dimensional topological Dirac semimetals subjected to an external in-plane magnetic field. The quantum kinetic equation for the Wigner distribution function is derived and then solved to evaluate the second-order electric-field contributions to the current density. Both the Berry curvature dipole and the field-induced terms in the current are analyzed across a broad range of model parameters. We propose that our theory can be tested experimentally by measuring the dependence of the anomalous Hall resistivity on the in-plane magnetic field in the surface states of the topological insulator SnTe, in WTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, as well as in the Kondo lattice material Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$ at very low temperatures.

Title: Extended s-wave altermagnets
Authors: Matteo Dürrnagel, Lennart Klebl, Tobias Müller, Ronny Thomale, Michael Klett
Abstract: We propose extended s-wave altermagnets (sAMs) as a class of magnetic states which are fully gapped, spin-compensated, and feature spin-polarized bands. sAMs are formed through valley-exchange symmetries, which act as momentum-space translations beyond standard crystallographic spin-group classifications. Using an effective two-valley model, we demonstrate that sAMs exhibit isotropic spin splitting, enable spin-selective transport in tailored heterostructures, and give rise to descendant pair density wave order. From a microscopic sAM minimal model, we develop the guiding principles to identify sAMs in quantum magnets.

Title: Critical quantum liquids and the cuprate high temperature superconductors
Authors: Pietro M. Bonetti, Maine Christos, Alexander Nikolaenko, Aavishkar A. Patel, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$. We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a pair of ancilla qubits on each site. Its mean field theory yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs. One route to confinement upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experimental data. Increasing doping from the FL* phase drives a transition to a conventional Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.

Title: Bosonization and Kramers-Wannier dualities in general dimensions
Authors: Lei Su, Ivar Martin
Abstract: It is well known that the noninteracting Majorana chain is dual to the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, either through the Jordan-Wigner transformation or by gauging fermion parity. In this correspondence, the minimal translation of the Majorana chain maps to the celebrated Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality of the spin model, with the critical point mapped to the self-dual point. In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and higher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the parity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary polyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the gauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged) fermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence of the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the discrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit. Applying this bosonization to one or two copies of Majorana fermions on translationally invariant lattices, we derive higher-dimensional analogs of KW (self-)dualities in spin systems arising from fermionic minimal translations. The KW (self-)dualities are non-invertible due to projections onto eigenspaces of higher-form symmetries in the associated symmetry operators. The bosonization framework we present is intuitive, general, and systematic, encompassing other known exact bosonization methods while offering a novel approach to establish new connections between fermionic and spin systems in arbitrary dimensions.

Authors: Nicolas Crampé, Rafael I. Nepomechie, Luc Vinet, Nabi Zare Harofteh
Abstract: We show that, after suitably adjusting a uniform transverse magnetic field, the generic inhomogeneous open XX spin chain has a two-fold degeneracy, and an exact $su(2)$ symmetry whose "inhomogeneous" generators depend on coefficients that can be explicitly computed for models associated with discrete orthogonal polynomials.

Title: Insulating ground state and 2-k magnetic structure of candidate Weyl Hydrogen atom K$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$
Authors: Keith M. Taddei, Kulugammana G. S. Ranmohotti, Duminda S. Liurukara, Alex Martinson, Stuart Calder, German Samolyuk, Nabaraj Pokhrel, Daniel Phelan, David Parker
Abstract: The ideal Weyl 'Hydrogen-atom' semi-metal exhibits only a single pair of Weyl nodes and no other trivial states at the Fermi energy. Such a material would be a panacea in the study of Weyl quasi particles allowing direct unambiguous observation of their topological properties. The alluaudite-like K$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$ compound was recently proposed as such a material. Here we use comprehensive experimental work and first principle calculations to assess this prediction. We find K$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$ crystallizes in the $C2/c$ symmetry with a quasi-1D Mn sublattice, growing as small needle-like crystals. Bulk properties measurements reveal magnetic transitions at $\approx$ 8 and $\approx$ 4 K which neutron scattering experiments show correspond to two distinct magnetic orders, first a partially ordered ferrimagnetic $\mathbf{k_1}$= (0, 0, 0) structure at 8 K and a second transition of $\mathbf{k_2}$= (1, 0, 0) at 4 K to a fully ordered state. Below the second transition, both ordering vectors are necessary to describe the complex magnetic structure with modulated spin magnitudes. Both of the best-fit magnetic structures in this work are found to break the symmetry necessary for the generation of the Weyl nodes, though one of the magnetic structures allowed by $\mathbf{k_1}$ does preserve this symmetry. However, the crystals are optically transparent and ellipsometry measurements reveal a large band-gap, undermining expectations of semi-metallic behavior. Density functional theory calculations predict an insulating antiferromagnetic ground state, in contrast to previous reports, and suggest potential frustration on the magnetic sublattice. Given the wide tunability of the alluaudite structure we consider ways to push the system closer to semi-metallic state.

Title: Long-range spatial extension of exciton states in van der Waals heterostructure
Authors: Zhiwen Zhou, E. A. Szwed, W. J. Brunner, H. Henstridge, L. H. Fowler-Gerace, L. V. Butov
Abstract: Narrow lines in photoluminescence (PL) spectra of excitons are characteristic of low-dimensional semiconductors. These lines correspond to the emission of exciton states in local minima of a potential energy landscape formed by fluctuations of the local exciton environment in the heterostructure. The spatial extension of such states was in the nanometer range. In this work, we present studies of narrow lines in PL spectra of spatially indirect excitons (IXs) in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure. The narrow lines vanish with increasing IX density. The disappearance of narrow lines correlates with the onset of IX transport, indicating that the narrow lines correspond to localized exciton states. The narrow lines extend over distances reaching several micrometers and over areas reaching ca. ten percent of the sample area. This macroscopic spatial extension of the exciton states, corresponding to the narrow lines, indicates a deviation of the exciton energy landscape from random potential and shows that the excitons are confined in moiré potential with a weak disorder.

Title: Strong Raman Optical Activity and Chiral Phonons in Chiral Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskites
Authors: Evan W. Muller, Aleksey Ruditskiy, Jie Jiang, Thuc T. Mai, Katherine Burzynski, Ruth Pachter, Michael F. Durstock, W. Joshua Kennedy, Rahul Rao
Abstract: Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with chiral organic cations are very interesting for optoelectronic applications because of their intrinsically chiral light-matter interactions. Chiral distortions in these materials lead to circular dichroism, circular birefringence, and circularly polarized luminescence in the band transitions of the inorganic sublattice. Raman-active vibrational modes in these crystals are governed by crystal symmetry and therefore are also strongly impacted by the nature and magnitude of the chiral distortions. Here, we report low-frequency Raman modes that are sensitive to circularly polarized excitation in chiral hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (CHOIPs) across a wide range of structures and compositions. The circularly polarized Raman spectra from enantiomers of CHOIP single crystals exhibit sharp modes below 150 cm-1, corresponding to vibrations of the lead iodide octahedra. These modes exhibit strong differences in intensities (Raman optical activity, ROA) depending on the handedness of the excitation, with high degree of polarization for several modes. Calculations reveal the presence of several chiral phonon modes with opposite phonon angular momenta. The strong ROA and the chiral phonon modes are a direct consequence of chirality transfer from the chiral organic linker to the lead iodide octahedra in the CHOIP structure, resulting in a strong chiroptical response in the phonon modes.

Title: When Dephasing Fails: Thermodynamic Consequences of Decoherence Models in Quantum Transport
Authors: Eren Erdogan, Justin P. Bergfield
Abstract: Understanding how decoherence influences heat and information flow is essential for realizing the promise of quantum technologies. Two widely used models for incorporating decoherence in quantum transport are the voltage probe (VP), which imposes local charge current conservation, and the voltage-temperature probe (VTP), which also conserves heat current. Although these models are often treated as functionally equivalent, we demonstrate that this equivalence actually exists only under highly symmetric conditions, which may be challenging to achieve experimentally Under asymmetric coupling or thermal bias, the VTP respects thermodynamic constraints and enforces decoherence in both charge and heat channels, while the VP instead acts as a source or sink of heat. Strikingly, the VP can fail to model decoherence in the heat transport entirely, even with large probe coupling strengths. Using a benzene-based molecular junction as a realistic example, we show that these effects significantly impact the predicted heat transport. These results establish that the VP and VTP models are not interchangeable: only the VTP provides a thermodynamically consistent framework for modeling decoherence in quantum transport.

Title: Machine learning topological defect formation
Authors: Fumika Suzuki, Ying Wai Li, Wojciech H. Zurek
Abstract: According to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), the density of topological defects created during a second-order phase transition is determined by the correlation length at the freeze-out time. This suggests that the final configuration of topological defects in such a transition is largely established during the impulse regime, soon after the critical point is traversed. Motivated by this, we conjecture that machine learning (ML) can predict the final configuration of topological defects based on the time evolution of the order parameter over a short interval in the vicinity of the critical point, well before the order parameter settles into the emerging new minima resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we show that the predictability of ML also follows the power law scaling dictated by KZM. We demonstrate these using a Recurrent Neural Network.

Title: Atomistic understanding of hydrogen bubble-induced embrittlement in tungsten enabled by machine learning molecular dynamics
Authors: Yu Bao, Keke Song, Jiahui Liu, Yanzhou Wang, Yifei Ning, Penghua Ying, Ping Qian
Abstract: Hydrogen bubble formation within nanoscale voids is a critical mechanism underlying the embrittlement of metallic materials, yet its atomistic origins remains elusive. Here, we present an accurate and transferable machine-learned potential (MLP) for the tungsten-hydrogen binary system within the neuroevolution potential (NEP) framework, trained through active learning on extensive density functional theory data. The developed NEP-WH model reproduces a wide range of lattice and defect properties in tungsten systems, as well as hydrogen solubility, with near first-principles accuracy, while retaining the efficiency of empirical potentials. Crucially, it is the first MLP capable of capturing hydrogen trapping and H\textsubscript{2} formation in nanovoids, with quantitative fidelity. Large-scale machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations reveal a distinct aggregation pathway where planar hydrogen clusters nucleate and grow along \{100\} planes near voids, with hexagonal close-packed structures emerging at their intersections. Under uniaxial tension, these aggregates promote bubble fracture and the development of regular \{100\} cracks, suppressing dislocation activity and resulting in brittle fracture behavior. This work provides detailed atomistic insights into hydrogen bubble evolution and fracture in nanovoids, enables predictive modeling of structural degradation in extreme environments, and advances fundamental understanding of hydrogen-induced damage in structural metals.

Title: Quantum Interference Supernodes, Thermoelectric Enhancement, and the Role of Dephasing
Authors: Justin P. Bergfield
Abstract: Quantum interference (QI) can strongly enhance thermoelectric response, with higher-order "supernodes" predicted to yield scalable gains in thermopower and efficiency. A central question, however, is whether such features are intrinsically more fragile to dephasing. Using $Büttiker$ voltage-temperature probes, we establish an order-selection rule: the effective near-node order is set by the lowest among coherent and probe-assisted channels. Supernodes are therefore fragile in an absolute sense because their transmission is parametrically suppressed with order. However, once an incoherent floor dominates, the fractional suppression of thermopower, efficiency, and figure of merit becomes universal and order-independent. Illustrating these principles with benzene- and biphenyl-based junction calculations, we show that the geometry of environmental coupling -- through a single orbital or across many -- dictates whether coherence is lost by order reduction or by floor building. These results yield general scaling rules for the thermoelectric response of interference nodes under dephasing.

Title: Lattice-induced spin dynamics in Dirac magnet CoTiO3
Authors: Andrey Baydin, Jiaming Luo, Zhiren He, Jacques Doumani, Tong Lin, Fuyang Tay, Jiaming He, Jianshi Zhou, Guru Khalsa, Junichiro Kono, Hanyu Zhu
Abstract: Spin-lattice coupling is crucial for understanding the spin transport and dynamics for spintronics and magnonics applications. Recently, cobalt titanate (CoTiO3), an easy-plane antiferromagnet, has been found to host axial phonons with a large magnetic moment, which may originate from spin-lattice coupling. Here, we investigate the effect of light-driven lattice dynamics on the magnetic properties of CoTiO3 using time-resolved spectroscopy with a THz pump and a magneto-optic probe. We found resonantly driven Raman active phonons, phonon-polariton-induced excitation of the antiferromagnetic magnons, and a slow increase in the polarization rotation of the probe, all indicating symmetry breaking that is not intrinsic to the magnetic space group. The temperature dependence confirmed that the observed spin dynamics is related to the magnetic order, and we suggest surface effects as a possible mechanism. Our results of THz-induced spin-lattice dynamics signify that extrinsic symmetry breaking may contribute strongly and unexpectedly to light-driven phenomena in bulk complex oxides.

Title: Lee-Yang-zero ratio method in three-dimensional Ising model
Authors: Tatsuya Wada, Masakiyo Kitazawa, Kazuyuki Kanaya
Abstract: By performing Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model, we apply the recently proposed Lee-Yang-zero ratio (LYZR) method to determine the location of the critical point in this model. We demonstrate that the LYZR method is as powerful as the conventional Binder-cumulant method in studying the critical point, while the LYZR method has the advantage of suppressing the violation of the finite-size scaling and non-linearity near the critical point. We also achieve a precise determination of the values of the LYZRs at the critical point, which are universal numbers. In addition, we propose an alternative method that uses only a single Lee-Yang zero and show that it is also useful for the search for the critical point.

Title: Bosonization in $R$-paraparticle Luttinger models
Authors: Dennis F. Salinel, Kristian Hauser A. Villegas
Abstract: We reintroduce the parafermion-paraboson classification in $R$-paraparticles in terms of their average occupation numbers, analogous to Green's parastatistics. The notion of $p$-order in $R$-parafermions is also redefined as the maximum number of particles that can occupy a quantum state. An example of an order-$2$ $R$-parafermion with $m=2$ internal degrees of freedom is presented, which obeys an exclusion principle that is not Pauli's. The interacting $R$-parafermions are studied in the context of bosonization. Specifically, we show that while density waves are generally bosonic in nature and that flavor-charge separation naturally occurs for any one-dimensional $R$-parafermion system described by the Luttinger model, flavor waves do not always satisfy bose statistics. Comparison of the partition functions further show that only $(p=1)$-ordered $R$-parafermions are compatible with the bosonization procedure in the low-energy limit. Based from these results, we discuss a potential realization of parafermion signatures in one-dimensional systems.

Title: Toughening beta-Ga2O3 via mechanically seeded dislocations
Authors: Zanlin Cheng, Jiawen Zhang, Peng Gao, Guosong Zeng, Xufei Fang, Wenjun Lu
Abstract: \b{eta}-Ga2O3 is a promising candidate for next-generation semiconductors, but is limited by its intrinsic brittleness, which hinders its application in flexible electronics and high-precision devices. This study explores a new approach to improving the damage tolerance of (001)-oriented \b{eta}-Ga2O3 by introducing mechanically seeded dislocations via surface scratching. By applying a Brinell indenter to scratch the surface along the [100] direction, we effectively generate edge-type dislocations belonging to the (011)[01-1] and/or (0-11)[011] slip systems within a mesoscale wear track. Through a combination of nanoindentation tests, surface morphology analysis, and microstructural characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we reveal that the introduction of dislocations significantly mitigates the formation of cleavage cracks during indentation, in contrast to that observed in as-received \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The mechanically seeded dislocations in the subsurface layers play an important role in preventing brittle fracture by facilitating stable plastic deformation.

Title: Enhanced premelting at the ice-rubber interface using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation
Authors: Takumi Kojima, Ikki Yasuda, Takumi Sato, Noriyoshi Arai, Kenji Yasuoka
Abstract: The ice-rubber interface is critical in applications such as tires and shoe outsoles, yet its molecular tribology remains unclear. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we studied premelting layers at the basal face of ice in contact with styrene-butadiene rubber from 254 to 269 K. Despite its hydrophobicity, rubber enhances structural disorder of interfacial water, promoting premelting. In contrast, water mobility is suppressed by confinement from polymer chains, leading to glassy dynamics distinct from the ice-vapor interface. Near the melting point, rubber chains become more flexible and penetrate the premelting layer, forming a mixed rubber-water region that couples the dynamics of both components. These results suggest that nanoscale roughness and morphology of hydrophobic polymers disrupt ice hydrogen-bond networks, thereby enhancing premelting. Our findings provide molecular-level insight into ice slipperiness and inform the design of polymer materials with controlled ice adhesion and friction.

Title: Magnetic Field Induced Band Deformation in a Lieb Lattice:Aharonov-Bohm Caging and Zeeman Splitting
Authors: Nana Chang, Xiaoji Zhou
Abstract: Flat-band systems are highly sensitive to external perturbations, providing a route to study unconventional localization, transport, and spin physics. Lieb lattice, a two-dimensional geometry with an inherent flat band, exemplifies this behavior and is experimentally realizable in ultracold atoms, photonic arrays, and superconducting circuits. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of magnetic field induced band deformation in the Lieb lattice by jointly considering orbital Peierls phases and Zeeman spin splitting. A perpendicular magnetic flux generates Aharonov Bohm caging, confining particles into localized flat-band states, while Zeeman coupling lifts spin degeneracy and induces spin-resolved energy shifts. The competition between these two mechanisms gives rise to rich band restructuring and tunable spin-selective flat-band phenomena. These results establish the Lieb lattice as a controllable setting for spin-selective transport and magneticfield engineering in synthetic quantum platforms such as ultracold atoms, photonic lattices, and superconducting circuits, offering guiding principles for quantum simulation and the corresponding experiments, which opens the avenue for controlled engineering of spin-resolved localization and flat-band physics in synthetic quantum matter.

Title: Run-and-tumble particle with diffusion: boundary local times and the zero-diffusion limit
Authors: Paul C Bressloff
Abstract: Incorporating boundary conditions into stochastic models of passive or active particle motion is usually implemented at the level of the associated forward or backward Kolmogorov equation, whose solution determines the probability distribution of sample paths. In order to write down the corresponding stochastic differential equation (SDE) that generates the individual sample paths, it is necessary to introduce a Brownian functional that keeps track of the boundary-particle contact time. We previously constructed the SDE for a (non-diffusing) run-and-tumble particle (RTP) on the half-line with either a reflecting or sticky wall at $x=0$. In this paper we extend the theory to include the effects of diffusion. One of the non-trivial consequences of combining drift-diffusion with tumbling is that the zero diffusion limit $D\rightarrow 0$ is singular in the sense that the number of boundary conditions is doubled when $D>0$. We use stochastic calculus to derive the forward Kolmogorov equation for two distinct boundary conditions that reduce, respectively, to non-sticky and sticky boundary conditions in the zero-diffusion limit. In the latter case, it is necessary to include a boundary layer in a neighbourhood of the wall and use singular perturbation theory. We also treat the wall as partially absorbing by assuming that the particle is absorbed when the amount of boundary-particle contact time (discrete or continuous local time) exceeds a quenched random threshold. Finally, we analyse the survival probability and corresponding FPT density for absorption at a non-sticky wall by deriving the corresponding backward Kolmogorov equation

Title: Boson peak in covalent network glasses: Isostaticity and marginal stability
Authors: Hideyuki Mizuno, Tatsuya Mori, Giacomo Baldi, Emi Minamitani
Abstract: The boson peak (BP) stands as a key feature in understanding glasses and amorphous materials. It directly underlies their anomalous material properties, including thermal behaviors such as excess specific heat and low thermal conductivity, as well as mechanical characteristics such as nonaffine elasticity and fragile plasticity. Despite its importance, understanding of the BP remains limited in covalent network glasses. The most promising concepts are isostaticity and marginal stability, which have been established in theories of rigidity percolation and the jamming transition. While these concepts, supported by comprehensive data, account for the BP in packing-based glasses, comparable explanations have not yet been demonstrated for covalent network glasses. Here we study silica glass, a prototypical covalent network glass, using molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the BP in silica glass is governed by near-isostatic constraints and marginal stability, supporting their universality across diverse glassy systems. Furthermore, we reveal that these principles manifest as a wavenumber-independent band in the dynamical structure factor, and we demonstrate consistency with inelastic X-ray scattering data on silica glass. Our results provide a unified, experimentally testable framework for deciphering the BP and for refining the interpretation of scattering data in amorphous materials.

Title: Bose-Einstein condensate of ultracold sodium-rubidium molecules with tunable dipolar interactions
Authors: Zhaopeng Shi, Zerong Huang, Fulin Deng, Wei-Jian Jin, Su Yi, Tao Shi, Dajun Wang
Abstract: Realizing Bose-Einstein condensation of polar molecules is a long-standing challenge in ultracold physics and quantum science due to near-universal two-body collisional losses. Here, we report the production of a Bose-Einstein condensate of ground-state sodium-rubidium molecules via high efficiency evaporative cooling, with losses suppressed using the dual microwave shielding technique. The ability to tune the dipolar interaction between these ultracold polar molecules is crucial for producing the condensate and enables exciting prospects for future applications. We explore different regimes of dipolar interactions, realizing both the gas phase and the quantum droplet phase of the molecular condensate. This work opens new avenues for investigating quantum matter with strong dipolar interactions and for quantum simulation of long-range many-body systems.

Title: Extensive entanglement between coupled Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids in and out of equilibrium
Authors: Taufiq Murtadho, Marek Gluza, Nelly H. Y. Ng
Abstract: Quantum entanglement exists in nature but is absent in classical physics, hence it fundamentally distinguishes quantum from classical theories. While entanglement is routinely observed for few-body systems, it is significantly more challenging to witness in quantum many-body systems. Here, we theoretically study entanglement between two parallel and spatially separated Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) partitioned along the longitudinal axis. In particular, we focus on 1D Bose gases as a realization of TLLs and investigate two experimentally relevant situations: tunnel-coupled gases at finite temperatures and after coherent splitting. In both scenarios, we analytically calculate the logarithmic negativity and identify a threshold temperature below which the system is entangled. Notably, this threshold temperature is accessible in near-term coherent splitting experiments. Furthermore, we investigate the crossover between quantum and classical correlations in the vicinity of the threshold temperature by comparing logarithmic negativity with mutual information. We argue that the initial mutual information established by the coherent splitting is conserved in TLL dynamics, thus preventing certain generalized Gibbs ensembles from being reached during prethermalization. Moreover, both logarithmic negativity and mutual information are found to scale extensively with the subsystem's length. Although the ground-state entanglement between coupled TLLs has been predicted to be extensive, this setting is largely overlooked compared to other partitions. Our work extends the study of entanglement between coupled TLLs to finite temperatures and out-of-equilibrium regimes, and provides a strategy towards experimental detection of extensive entanglement in quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures.

Title: Physics-informed Hamiltonian learning for large-scale optoelectronic property prediction
Authors: Martin Schwade, Shaoming Zhang, Frederik Vonhoff, Frederico P. Delgado, David A. Egger
Abstract: Predicting optoelectronic properties of large-scale atomistic systems under realistic conditions is crucial for rational materials design, yet computationally prohibitive with first-principles simulations. Recent neural network models have shown promise in overcoming these challenges, but typically require large datasets and lack physical interpretability. Physics-inspired approximate models offer greater data efficiency and intuitive understanding, but often sacrifice accuracy and transferability. Here we present HAMSTER, a physics-informed machine learning framework for predicting the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of complex chemical systems. Starting from an approximate model encoding essential physical effects, HAMSTER captures the critical influence of dynamic environments on Hamiltonians using only few explicit first-principles calculations. We demonstrate our approach on halide perovskites, achieving accurate prediction of optoelectronic properties across temperature and compositional variations, and scalability to systems containing tens of thousands of atoms. This work highlights the power of physics-informed Hamiltonian learning for accurate and interpretable optoelectronic property prediction in large, complex systems.

Title: Accurate Screening of Functional Materials with Machine-Learning Potential and Transfer-Learned Regressions: Heusler Alloy Benchmark
Authors: Enda Xiao, Terumasa Tadano
Abstract: A machine learning-accelerated high-throughput (HTP) workflow for the discovery of magnetic materials is presented. As a test case, we screened quaternary and all-$d$ Heusler compounds for stable compounds with large magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ($E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$). Structure optimization and evaluation of formation energy and distance to hull convex were performed using the eSEN-30M-OAM interatomic potential, while local magnetic moments, phonon stability, magnetic stability, and $E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$ were predicted by eSEM models trained on our DxMag Heusler database. A frozen transfer learning strategy was employed to improve accuracy. Candidate compounds identified by the ML-HTP workflow were validated with density functional theory, confirming high predictive precision. We also benchmark the performance of different MLIPs, and discuss the fidelity of local magnetic moment prediction and its extension to other magnetic materials.

Title: A perspective on inelastic light scattering spectroscopy for probing transport of collective acoustic excitations
Authors: Hyemin Kim, Hyungseok Kim, Taeyong Kim
Abstract: Understanding and manipulating nanoscale energy transport and conversion processes are essential for diverse applications, ranging from thermoelectrics and energy harvesting to thermal management of microelectronics. While it has long been recognized that acoustic and thermal properties in condensed matters are primarily due to microscopic transport of phonons as quasiparticles, probing thermal acoustic excitations particularly at sub-THz remains a challenge primarily due to limitations in experimental techniques with spatiotemporal resolutions pertinent to probing them. Brillouin light scattering (BLS) and its variant, impulsive stimulated Brillouin scattering (ISS), provide access to these thermal acoustic excitations, enabling measurement of quantities such as acoustic dispersions along with relaxation dynamics occurring in ultrasonic as well as hypersonic frequencies. In this perspective, we provide a brief overview of the operational principles of BLS and ISS, and highlight their applications in probing acoustic, thermal, and magnetic excitations in emerging and low-dimensional materials. We conclude by discussing current challenges and future opportunities for advanced material characterization using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy techniques.

Title: Decoding local framework dynamics in the ultra-small pore MOF MIL-120(Al) CO2 sorbent with Machine Learned Potentials
Authors: Dong Fan, Felipe Lopes Oliveira, Mohammad Wahiduzzaman, Guillaume Maurin
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with ultra-small pores offer an optimal environment to effectively capture guest molecules such as CO2. Subtle local dynamics of their frameworks, either throughout reorientation of functional groups grafted to the organic linkers or those present in their inorganic nodes, is expected to play a major role in their sorption behaviors. Here, we combine density-functional theory (DFT) with a purpose-trained machine-learned potential to systematically investigate the local dynamics of the bridging hydroxyl groups, {\mu}2-OH groups present in the prototypical ultra-small pore MOF MIL-120(Al), reported recently as an attractive CO2 sorbent. We identified six MOF configurations associated with distinct {\mu}2-OH orientations with relatively low interconversion energy barriers (0.07-0.19 eV per unit cell) suggesting that all these states can be observed experimentally at room temperature. We demonstrated that our MLP achieves near-DFT-level fidelity, reproducing the energy barriers and phonon spectra of the empty MOF, and accurately predicting CO2 adsorption geometries depending on the {\mu}2-OH orientations with CO2 adopting either parallel or perpendicular alignment to the pore axis, which in turn governs the adsorption energetics. This work establishes that a reliable description of the local structure, such as reorientation/flipping of bridging hydroxyl groups, is a key feature to gain an accurate description of the guest locations and energetics in ultra-small pore MOFs.

Title: The total energy approach for calculating the specific heat of liquids and glasses
Authors: K. Shirai
Abstract: The recent development of the calculation of specific heat ($C$) of liquids and glasses by first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is reviewed. Liquid and glass states have common properties in that there is no periodicity and the atom relaxation has an important role in their thermodynamic properties. These properties have, for a long time, hindered the construction of an appropriate theory of $C$ for these states. The total energy approach based on the density-functional theory (DFT) provides a universal method to calculate $C$, irrespective of the material states. However, aside from the convergence problem, even DFT-based MD simulations give different values for a thermodynamic property of liquids and glasses, depending on the setup of MD simulations. The essential problem is atom relaxation, which affects the relationship between the energy and temperature $T$. The temperature is determined by the equilibrium state, but there are many metastable states for glasses. Metastable states are stable within their relaxation times. We encounter the difficult problem of hysteresis, which is the most profound consequence of irreversibility. Irreversibility occurs even for quasistatic processes. This is the most difficult and confusing point in the thermodynamics literature. Here, a consistent treatment of both equilibrium properties and irreversibility in adiabatic MD simulations, which has no frictional term, is given by taking multi-timescales into account. A leading principle to determine the equilibrium is provided by the second law of thermodynamics. The basic ideas and the usefulness of the total energy approach in real calculations are presented.

Title: Emergent dynamics of active elastic microbeams
Authors: Q. Martinet, Y. Li, A. Aubret, E. Hannezo, J. Palacci
Abstract: In equilibrium, the physical properties of matter are set by the interactions between the constituents. In contrast, the energy input of the individual components controls the behavior of synthetic or living active matter. Great progress has been made in understanding the emergent phenomena in active fluids, though their inability to resist shear forces hinders their practical use. This motivates the exploration of active solids as shape-shifting materials, yet, we lack controlled synthetic systems to devise active solids with unconventional properties. %and bridge the gap between active solids made of macroscopic robots and the complexity of biological materials. Here we build active elastic beams from dozens of active colloids and unveil complex emergent behaviors such as self-oscillations or persistent rotations. Developing tensile tests at the microscale, we show that the active beams are ultra-soft materials, with large (non-equilibrium) fluctuations. Combining experiments, theory, and stochastic inference, we show that the dynamics of the active beams can be mapped on different phase transitions which are tuned by boundary conditions. More quantitatively, we assess all relevant parameters by independent measurements or first-principles calculations, and find that our theoretical description agrees with the experimental observations. Our results demonstrate that the simple addition of activity to an elastic beam unveils novel physics and can inspire design strategies for active solids and functional microscopic machines.

Title: Prediction of EDS Maps from 4DSTEM Diffraction Patterns Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Mridul Kumar, Yevgeny Rakita
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between atomic structure (order) and chemical composition (chemistry) is critical for advancing materials science, yet traditional spectroscopic techniques can be slow and damaging to sensitive samples. Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) captures detailed diffraction patterns across scanned regions, providing rich structural information, while energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) offers complementary chemical data. In this work, we develop a machine learning framework that predicts EDS spectra directly from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, reducing beam exposure and acquisition time. A convolutional neural network (CNN) accurately infers elemental compositions, particularly for elements with strong diffraction contrast or higher concentrations, such as Oxygen and Tellurium. Both extrapolation and interpolation strategies demonstrate consistent performance, with improved predictions when additional structural context is available. Visual and cross-correlation analyses confirm the model's ability to capture global and local compositional trends. This approach establishes a data-driven pathway to non-destructive, high-throughput materials characterization.

Title: Evanescent random walker on networks: Hitting times, budget renewal, and survival dynamics
Authors: Thomas M. Michelitsch, Alejandro P. Riascos
Abstract: We consider a mortal random walker evolving with discrete time on a network, where transitions follow a degree-biased Markovian navigation strategy. The walker starts with a random initial budget $T_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and must maintain a strictly positive budget to remain alive. Each step incurs a unit cost, decrementing the budget by one; the walker perishes (is ruined) upon depletion of the budget. However, when the walker reaches designated target nodes, the budget is renewed by an independent and identically distributed (IID) copy of its initial value. The degree bias is tuned to either favor or disfavor visits to these target nodes. Our model exhibits connections with stochastic resetting. The evolution of the budget can be interpreted as a deterministic drift on the integer line toward negative values, where the walker is intermittently reset to positive IID random positions and dies at the first hit of the origin. The first part of the paper focuses on the target-hitting statistics of an immortal Markovian walker. We analyze the \textit{target hitting counting process} (THCP) for an arbitrary set of target nodes. Within this framework, the second part of the paper addresses the dynamics of the evanescent walker. We derive analytical results for arbitrary configurations of target nodes, including the evanescent propagator matrix, the survival probability, the mean residence time on a set of nodes during the walker's lifetime, and the expected lifetime itself. Additionally, we compute the expected number of target hits (i.e., budget renewals) in a lifetime of the walker and related distributions. We explore both analytically and numerically various scenarios affecting the life expectancy of the walker.

Title: Electric-field induced half-metallicity in a two-dimensional ferromagnetic Janus VSSe bilayer
Authors: Khushboo Dange, Shivprasad S. Shastri, Alok Shukla
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) half-metals with intrinsic ferromagnetism hold great potential for applications in spintronics. In this study, we aim to expand the known space of such 2D ferromagnetic (FM) half-metals by investigating bilayer of Janus VSSe, an FM semiconductor. Its structural, electronic, and magnetic properties are examined using density functional theory, employing the DFT+$U$ method, coupled with the PBE functional. The stability of the bilayer is examined using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at finite temperatures up to 400 K. To ensure the stability further, the elastic constants of the system have also been investigated and we found that VSSe bilayer manifests an easy plane of magnetization similar to its monolayer counterpart. At the DFT+$U$ level, the considered VSSe bilayer exhibits a tendency towards half-metallicity with a small band gap of 0.11 eV for the majority spin carriers, and of 0.66 eV for the minority ones. To include a transition from a semiconductor to a half-metal, the bilayer is subjected to an external electric field of varying strengths normal to the plane. The lack of horizontal mirror symmetry in the bilayer allows bidirectional tuning of the band gap, with different values for the field in "upward" and "downward" directions. The band gaps for the two spin channels increase with the increasing upward electric field, while the opposite happens for the downward fields, with the majority carrier gap closing at 0.16 V/$\unicode{x212B}$, making the material a spin gapless semiconductor. Further increase in the electric field renders the material half metallic at 0.18 V/$\unicode{x212B}$. Given the fact that these values of the external electric field are achievable in the lab suggests that the FM Janus VSSe bilayer is a promising candidate for spintronic devices.

Title: Dynamic compression of glassy GeO$2$ up to the TPa range and first observation of shock induced crystallization
Authors: R. Torchio, J.A. Hernandez, A. Cordone, S.Balugani, T. Vinci, A. Ravasio, C. Pepin, N. Sevelin-Radiguet, E. Guillam, F. Dorchies, A.Benuzzi
Abstract: In this work we present an extensive study of glassy GeO$_2$ under laser induced dynamic compression. New VISAR and SOP data provide the extension of Hugoniot EoS up to the TPa range for this material including temperature measurements. Reflectivity data at both 532 and 1064 nm wavelenght are also reported. In the low compression range we observe changes of the optical properties from transparent, to opaque, to metallic state. The second part of this work describes a further laser shock experiment combined with in-situ X-ray diffraction. Here we observe, for the first time, the laser shock-induced crystallization of glassy GeO$_2$ to a structure compatible with the rutile phase at pressure higher than 20 GPa and melting occurring at around 75 GPa.

Title: Stability of many-body localization in two dimensions
Authors: Junhyeok Hur, Joey Li, Byungjin Lee, Kiryang Kwon, Minseok Kim, Samgyu Hwang, Sumin Kim, Yong Soo Yu, Amos Chan, Thorsten Wahl, Jae-yoon Choi
Abstract: Disordered quantum many-body systems pose one of the central challenges in condensed matter physics and quantum information science, as their dynamics are generally intractable for classical computation. Many-body localization (MBL), hypothesized to evade thermalization indefinitely under strong disorder, exemplifies this difficulty. Here, we study the stability of MBL in two dimensions using ultracold atoms in optical lattices with variable system sizes up to $24\times 24$ sites, well beyond the classically simulable regime. Using the imbalance as a probe, we trace the long-time dynamics under two distinctive disorder potentials: quasiperiodic and random disorder. For random disorder, the MBL crossover point shifts to higher disorder strength with increasing system size, consistent with the avalanche scenario. In contrast, with quasiperiodic disorder, we observe no clear system size dependence, suggesting possible stability of MBL in two dimensions.

Title: Magnetism and nonlinear charge transport in NiFe2O4/γ-Al2O3/SrTiO3 heterostructure for spintronic applications
Authors: Amit Chanda, Thor Hvid-Olsen, Christina Hoegfeldt, Anshu Gupta, Alessandro Palliotto, Maja A. Dunstan, Kasper S. Pedersen, Dae-Sung Park, Damon J. Carrad, Thomas Sand Jespersen, Felix Trier
Abstract: We present the synthesis and study of the magnetic and electronic properties of NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 heterostructure. The {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 interface hosts a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with large spin-orbit coupling, making it promising for spintronics applications if it can be coupled to a suitable source of spin currents. Here, we synthesize a ferrimagnetic insulating NiFe2O4(001) layer on {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) using a low-temperature reactive sputtering at 150 deg C without compromising the mobility and charge carrier density of the 2DEG at the {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) interface. The sheet resistance of both {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 and NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 exhibits metallic behavior down to cryogenic temperatures, with a low temperature upturn driven by the Kondo-like scattering. Most importantly, NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 behaves as a magnetic diode at low temperatures, and its rectification performance increases significantly with increasing magnetic field strength giving rise to a robust magneto-electronic rectification effect at low temperatures, which provides a first step towards the development of all-oxide heterostructures capable of efficient spin-charge conversion.

Title: Integrability from a Single Conservation Law in Quantum Spin Chains
Authors: Akihiro Hokkyo
Abstract: We prove that for quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.

Title: Ultrafast solid-state chemical synthesis of BaTiO3 initiated by gyrotron microwave radiation
Authors: S.V. Sintsov, N.V. Chekmarev, K.I. Rybakov, A.A. Sorokin, E.I. Preobrazhenskii, A.V. Vodopyanov
Abstract: This work presents the results of a study on the solid-state synthesis of barium titanate under continuous microwave radiation from a 24 GHz gyrotron in a multimode cavity reactor. It is shown that in localized domains where fine-scale thermal instabilities develop, initiated by microwave radiation within the initial stoichiometric reaction mixture of ultrafine barium carbonate and titanium dioxide powders, the synthesis can proceed within 1,5 - 7 minutes, achieving a target product yield of up to 90%. Based on a developed realistic numerical model of the multimode reactor, involving an iterative solution of stationary Maxwell and heat conduction equations, it is demonstrated that the specific absorbed power in the domains where fine-scale thermal instabilities develop can reach 670 W/cm3 under an input microwave power of 400 W.

Title: A Replica Stoner Theory for Dirty Ferromagnets
Authors: Wenzhe Deng, Tai Kai Ng
Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of disorder on a ferromagnetic metal with repulsive interactions. We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic state can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder affects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field approach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic mean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner criteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite temperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram, revealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may exist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is non-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced ferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite temperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic materials is briefly discussed.

Title: A two-state generalisation of the strong collision model
Authors: Ola Kenji Forslund
Abstract: Muon spin relaxation is a powerful technique for probing static and dynamic local magnetic fields. The strong collision model, based on a Gaussian-Markovian process, is commonly used to account for dynamical effects. Yet, it remains limited in describing systems where the local field undergoes discrete state changes. To address this, I introduce a generalized two-state strong collision model that explicitly incorporates transitions between distinct local field environments during fluctuations. This extension allows for a more accurate representation of dynamical effects, particularly in systems where each collision alters the underlying static polarisation function. Analytical and numerical solutions are presented, and the model's applicability is demonstrated {\color{black}and discussed} across relevant physical systems -- including low-dimensional magnets, systems with dynamic disorder and ion and muon diffusion. These results offer an enhanced framework for interpreting data in complex materials and extend the method's reach to a broader class of dynamical phenomena in condensed matter physics.

Title: Revival of Layered Ferroelectrics in Thin Films
Authors: Elzbieta Gradauskaite
Abstract: Layered perovskites are a versatile class of ferroelectrics with their structural anisotropy reflected in unusual electrostatics that give rise to exceptional ferroelectric properties. These materials fall into four main families: Aurivillius, Carpy-Galy, Ruddlesden-Popper, and Dion-Jacobson phases; each forming natural superlattices by interleaving perovskite slabs with spacer layers. For a long time, these materials were considered too structurally complex to prepare as high-quality thin films. However, recent breakthroughs in deposition and advanced characterization have made it possible to stabilize high-quality films with atomic precision, uncovering a wide range of unconventional ferroelectric functionalities. These include robust in-plane polarization without a critical thickness, the emergence of charged domain walls and non-trivial polar textures, resilience to doping with magnetic ions and charge carriers, and possibility to epitaxially integrate them into standard perovskite heterostructures. This review aims to unify current knowledge on the fabrication and characterization of layered ferroelectric thin films, and to present research findings across all four structural families, with the goal of highlighting their common features despite differences in crystal structure and polarization mechanisms. We also discuss promising research directions, including polar metallicity, (alter-)magnetoelectricity, exfoliation, and soft-chemistry-driven phase transformations, with the goal of consolidating the field and encouraging further exploration of these materials for both fundamental studies and applications.

Title: Anomalous diffusion and run-and-tumble motion of a chemotactic particle in low dimensions
Authors: Jacopo Romano, Andrea Gambassi
Abstract: We study the stochastic dynamics of a symmetric self-chemotactic particle and determine the long-time behavior of its mean squared displacement (MSD). The attractive or repulsive interaction of the particle with the chemical field that it generates induces a non-linear, non-Markovian effective dynamics, which results into anomalous diffusion for spatial dimensions $d \leq 2$. In one spatial dimension, we map the case of repulsive chemotaxis onto a run-and-tumble-like dynamics, leading to an MSD which, as a function of the elapsed time $t$, grows superdiffusively with exponent $4/3$. In the presence of attractive chemotaxis, instead, the particle exhibits a slowdown, with the MSD growing logarithmically with time. In $d=2$, we find logarithmic aging of the diffusion coefficient, while in $d=3$ the motion reverts standard diffusive behavior with a renormalized diffusion coefficient.

Title: Topological invariant responsible for the stability of the Fermi surfaces in non - homogeneous systems
Authors: M.A.Zubkov
Abstract: The topological invariant responsible for the stability of Fermi point/Fermi surface in homogeneous systems is expressed through the one particle Green function, which depends on momentum. It is given by an integral over the 3D hypersurface in momentum space surrounding the Fermi surface. Notion of Fermi surface may be extended to the non - homogeneous systems using Wigner - Weyl calculus. The Fermi surface becomes coordinate dependent, it may be defined as the position of the singularity in momentum space of the Wigner transformed Green function. Then the topological invariant responsible for the stability of this Fermi surface is given by the same expression as for the homogeneous case, in which the Green function is replaced by its Wigner transformation while the ordinary products are replaced by the Moyal products. We illustrate the proposed construction by the examples of the systems, in which the given topological invariant is nontrivial and may be calculated explicitly.

Title: A configuration interaction approach to solve the Anderson impurity model; applications to elemental Ce
Authors: Basile Herzog, Patrik Thunström, Olle Eriksson
Abstract: Accurate calculations of strongly correlated materials remain a formidable challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly due to the computational demand of conventional methods. This paper presents an efficient solver for dynamical mean field theory using configuration interaction (CI). The method is shown to have improved efficiency compared to traditional, exact diagonalization approaches. Hence, it provides an accessible, open-source alternative that can be executed on standard laptop computers or on supercomputers. The solver is demonstrated on cerium in the $\gamma$-, $\alpha$- and $\epsilon$-phases. An analysis of how the electronic structure of Ce evolves as function of lattice compression is made. It is argued that the electronic structure evolves from a localized nature of the 4f shell in $\gamma$-Ce to an essentially itinerant nature of the 4f shell of $\epsilon$-Ce. The transition between these two phases, as function of compression, can hence be seen as a Mott transition. However, this transition is intercepted by the strongly correlated $\alpha$-phase of elemental Ce, for which the 4f shell forms a Kondo singlet.

Title: Distinct Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Thermoelectric Transport Across Superconducting Transition
Authors: Rajae Malek, Qing-Dong Jiang, Haiwen Liu
Abstract: We investigate the relaxation dynamics of heat transport in superconductors, shaped by the interplay of diffusion, nonlinearity, and magnetic fields. Focusing on regimes near the critical temperature Tc, we analyze two classes of relaxation diffusion equations that give rise to qualitatively distinct dynamics, which we denote as Type I (linear) and Type II (nonlinear). Type I relaxation, characteristic of the normal state above Tc, results in a steady and spatially uniform heat current governed by linear diffusion. By contrast, Type II relaxation, relevant below Tc, exhibits non steady dynamics marked by pronounced spatial inhomogeneities and an evolving pattern, in which an initially localized hot spot propagates transiently through the system. The striking distinction between these regimes underscores a fundamental shift in transport mechanisms across the superconducting phase transition and provides experimentally relevant predictions in light of emerging techniques for probing local dissipation.

Abstract: Experiments with ultracold quantum gases are a rapidly advancing research field with many applications in fundamental physics and quantum technology. Here, we report on a high-flux generation of Bose-Einstein condensate mixtures of $^{41}$K and $^{87}$Rb, using a fully integrated sounding rocket setup. We investigate the release and the free expansion of the quantum mixtures for different orientations to gravity. The release dynamics are governed by the mixture interactions as well as the decaying magnetic field during the release. The latter can be minimized by a dedicated switch-off protocol of the trap generating currents where an exact model enabled us to characterize the interaction effects. Our results establish a new benchmark for generating ultracold mixtures on mobile platforms, with direct relevance for future experiments on interacting quantum gases and tests of the equivalence principle in space.

Title: Confinement in the three-state Potts quantum spin chain in extreme ferromagnetic limit
Authors: Anna Krasznai, Sergei Rutkevich, Gábor Takács
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of the three-state Potts quantum spin chain in the extreme ferromagnetic regime using perturbation theory in the transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that this approach provides access to features well beyond the semiclassical method applied previously, including the description of resonant excitations and analytic prediction for the time evolution after a quantum quench. We also demonstrate that it agrees with the meson/bubble spectrum results from exact diagonalisation and the numerical simulations of the time evolution.

Title: Multicritical Infection Spreading
Authors: Leone V. Luzzatto, Juan Felipe Barrera López, István A. Kovács
Abstract: The contact process is a simple infection spreading model showcasing an out-of-equilibrium phase transition between a macroscopically active and an inactive phase. Such absorbing state phase transitions are often sensitive to the presence of quenched disorder. Traditionally, a phase transition in the disordered contact process is either triggered by dilution or by locally varying the infection rate. However, when both factors play an important role, a multicritical point emerges that remains poorly understood. Here, we study the multicritical contact process by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions. The multicritical behavior is found to be universal and exhibits ultra-slow, activated dynamical scaling, with exponents consistent with those predicted by the strong disorder renormalization group method. This finding indicates that the multicritical contact process belongs to the same universality class as the multicritical quantum Ising model, opening future directions to measure quantum entanglement properties via classical simulations.

Title: Subspace-Protected Topological Phases and Bulk-Boundary Correspondence
Authors: Kenji Shimomura, Ryo Takami, Daichi Nakamura, Masatoshi Sato
Abstract: While tremendous research has revealed that symmetry enriches topological phases of matter, more general principles that protect topological phases have yet to be explored. In this Letter, we elucidate the roles of subspaces in free-fermionic topological phases. A subspace property for Hamiltonians enables us to define new topological invariants. They result in peculiar topological boundary phenomena, i.e., the emergence of an unpaired zero mode or zero-winding skin modes, characterizing subspace-protected topological phases. We establish and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence in subspace-protected topological phases. We further discuss the interplay of the subspace property and internal symmetries. Toward application, we also propose possible platforms possessing the subspace property.

Title: Electrode modified domain morphology in ferroelectric capacitors revealed by X-ray microscopy
Authors: Megan O. Hill Landberg, Bixin Yan, Huaiyu Chen, Efe Ipek, Morgan Trassin, Jesper Wallentin
Abstract: Ferroelectric thin films present a powerful platform for next generation computing and memory applications. However, domain morphology and dynamics in buried ferroelectric stacks have remained underexplored, despite the importance for real device performance. Here, nanoprobe X-ray diffraction (nano-XRD) is used to image ferroelectric domains inside BiFeO3-based capacitors, revealing striking differences from bare films such as local disorder in domain architecture and partial polarization reorientation. We demonstrate sensitivity to ferroelectric reversal in poled capacitors, revealing expansive/compressive (001) strain for up-/down-polarization using nano-XRD. We observe quantitative and qualitative differences between poling by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and in devices. Further, biasing induces lattice tilt at electrode edges which may modify performance in down-scaled devices. Direct comparison with PFM polarized structures even demonstrates potential nano-XRD sensitivity to domain walls. Our results establish nano-XRD as a noninvasive probe of buried ferroelectric domain morphologies and dynamics, opening avenues for operando characterization of energy-efficient nanoscale devices.

Title: Control of polarization and polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ by epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry
Authors: Elzbieta Gradauskaite, Natascha Gray, Quintin N. Meier, Marta D. Rossell, Morgan Trassin
Abstract: The balance between interfacial chemistry, electrostatics, and epitaxial strain plays a crucial role in stabilizing polarization in ferroelectric thin films. Here, we bring these contributions into competition in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films grown on the charged-surface-terminated La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO)-buffered NdGaO$_3$ (001) substrates. The large anisotropic compressive strain from the substrate promotes the formation of ferroelectric domains despite the expected stabilization of a uniform out-of-plane polarization by the (La,Sr)O$^{0.7+}$ termination of the metallic buffer. Piezoresponse force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal that the resulting nanoscale domain architecture is stabilized by the deterministic formation of a fluorite-like Bi$_2$O$_2$ surface layer on regions polarized oppositely to the LSMO-imposed polarization orientation. Leveraging this polarization compensation mechanism, we stabilize a uniform out-of-plane polarization in our highly strained BFO films by inserting a Bi$_2$O$_2$-terminated Aurivillius film as a buffer layer. Additionally, we reveal signatures of homochiral polarization textures in our BFO films on the level of domain configurations using local polarization switching experiments. Our work thus brings new strategies for controlling polarization direction and chiral textures in oxide ferroelectrics, opening pathways for functional domain-wall and domain-based electronics.

Title: Gate-tunable nonreciprocal thermoelectric effects on the surface states of topological insulators
Authors: Phillip Mercebach, Sun-Yong Hwang, Bo Lu, Björn Sothmann, Yukio Tanaka, Pablo Burset
Abstract: Thermoelectric devices at the nanoscale offer promising routes for on-chip refrigeration and waste-heat recovery, yet most semiconductor-based implementations suffer from limited tunability and narrow operational ranges. We introduce a highly flexible thermoelectric platform based on a ballistic junction formed by two gate-tunable regions of a topological insulator surface state bridged by a magnetic barrier. We theoretically demonstrate that such device exhibits strong electrical control over both refrigeration and thermoelectric power generation via side gates. We exploit the interplay between strong spin-orbit coupling and magnetism to achieve pronounced nonreciprocal transport, asymmetric cooling and tunable diode-like behavior. To demonstrate experimental feasibility, we further analyze refrigeration efficiency and phonon-limited performance in realistic material settings.

Title: Microscopic and collective signatures of feature learning in neural networks
Authors: Andrea Corti, Rosalba Pacelli, Pietro Rotondo, Marco Gherardi
Abstract: Feature extraction - the ability to identify relevant properties of data - is a key factor underlying the success of deep learning. Yet, it has proved difficult to elucidate its nature within existing predictive theories, to the extent that there is no consensus on the very definition of feature learning. A promising hint in this direction comes from previous phenomenological observations of quasi-universal aspects in the training dynamics of neural networks, displayed by simple properties of feature geometry. We address this problem within a statistical-mechanics framework for Bayesian learning in one hidden layer neural networks with standard parameterization. Analytical computations in the proportional limit (when both the network width and the size of the training set are large) can quantify fingerprints of feature learning, both collective ones (related to manifold geometry) and microscopic ones (related to the weights). In particular, (i) the distance between different class manifolds in feature space is a nonmonotonic function of the temperature, which we interpret as the equilibrium counterpart of a phenomenon observed under gradient descent (GD) dynamics, and (ii) the microscopic learnable parameters in the network undergo a finite data-dependent displacement with respect to the infinite-width limit, and develop correlations. These results indicate that nontrivial feature learning is at play in a regime where the posterior predictive distribution is that of Gaussian process regression with a trivially rescaled prior.

Title: Quantum melting a Wigner crystal into Hall liquids
Authors: Aidan P. Reddy, Liang Fu
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that, counterintuitively, applying a magnetic field to a Wigner crystal can induce quantum Hall effects. In this work, using variational Monte Carlo, we show that magnetic fields can melt zero-field Wigner crystals into integer quantum Hall liquids. This melting originates from quantum oscillations in the liquid's ground state energy, which develops downward cusps at integer filling factors due to incompressibility. Our calculations establish a range of densities in which this quantum melting transition occurs.

Title: Evolution of quasiparticle edge states with Hubbard interaction in Rice-Mele chain
Authors: Jyoti Bisht, Brijesh Kumar
Abstract: We study the behaviour of edge states in Rice-Mele model with Hubbard interaction, U , at half-filling using density matrix renormalization group, exact diagonalization and effective charge dynamics in Kumar representation. For a fixed dimerization, $\delta$, and staggered potential, V , we find by increasing U the quasiparticle edge states in the charge gap to come down in energy from V in the absence of Hubbard interaction to zero energy for U $\approx$ 2V . This presents an uncommon case where repulsion leads to zero-energy edge states. Upon increasing U further, the edge state energy starts increasing again until they are lost in the bulk. However, upon increasing U even further, these edge states reappear in the high energy gap. So, with Hubbard interaction, the edge states in Rice-Mele chain transmigrate from the physical charge gap to a high energy gap.

Title: Optical Response by Time-Varying Plasmonic Nanoparticles
Authors: Miguel Verde, Paloma A. Huidobro
Abstract: The temporal modulation of material parameters enables optical amplification within linear media. Here we consider the fundamental building block of plasmonics, a subwavelength metal nanoparticle, and study how temporal modulation alters the optical response of the frequency-dispersive scatterers. We show that modulating in time leads to Floquet replicas of the localized surface plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle, which can result in light amplification. We propose a model based on a point-like dipole description of the time-varying frequency-dispersive nanoparticle that fully captures the radiative and amplifying properties of the system in the subwavelength regime. By comparing our simplified model to full Floquet-Mie scattering calculations, we demonstrate that the optical scattering by the nanoparticle is accurately described by an analytical two-band model. This allows us to introduce a two-frequency effective polarizability that fully incorporates the properties of the localized surface plasmon and its amplifying replica, as well as their interaction. In addition, we analyze the emergence of the parametric amplification condition for the modulated nanoparticle, showing that amplification can be obtained in a broad range of parameters.

Title: Controlled spin-to-charge conversion in noncollinear antiferromagnet-based Py/Mn$_{3}$Pt heterostructure
Authors: Indraneel Sinha, Saurav Sachin, Prashant Kumar, Atul Pandey, Bijoy Kumar Kuanr, Sujit Manna
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets (NCAFs) have recently emerged as promising candidates for future spintronic technologies, offering ultrafast switching, negligible stray fields allowing dense packing, and robustness against external magnetic perturbations. When interfaced with ferromagnets (FMs), they can strongly influence interfacial exchange and spin-torque mechanisms that enable manipulating magnetic order and realizing functionalities beyond conventional heavy metals (HMs) based FM/HM heterostructures. Here, we perform a broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) study to systematically investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin-to-charge conversion in permalloy (Py) and Mn$_3$Pt bilayers. High-quality Py films provide a well-defined FMR spectra with a low Gilbert damping parameter ( $\alpha_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 9.8 \times 10^{-3}$). We observe a pronounced enhancement of damping with intrinsic value $\alpha_{\mathrm{int}} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{-2}$ in the Py/Mn$_3$Pt bilayer, indicating efficient spin pumping into the NCAF layer. Frequency dependent linewidth analysis shows a predominantly Gilbert type damping in the bilayers and the corresponding effective spin-mixing conductance ( $g^{\uparrow\downarrow}_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 4.8 \times 10^{18}$m$^{-2}$) is comparable to that of other high-performance antiferromagnetic heterostructures. These results are significant for establishing NCAFs as a candidate material for spin generation and highlights the potential of Py/Mn$_3$Pt bilayers for efficient and ultrafast spintronic applications.

Title: Lithiation Analysis of Metal Components for Li-Ion Battery using Ion Beams
Authors: Arturo Galindo, Neubi Xavier, Noelia Maldonado, Jesús Díaz-Sánchez, Carmen Morant, Gastón García, Celia Polop, Qiong Cai, Enrique Vasco
Abstract: Metal components are extensively used as current collectors, anodes, and interlayers in lithium-ion batteries. Integrating these functions into one component enhances the cell energy density and simplifies its design. However, this multifunctional component must meet stringent requirements, including high and reversible Li storage capacity, rapid lithiation/delithiation kinetics, mechanical stability, and safety. Six single-atom metals (Mg, Zn, Al, Ag, Sn and Cu) are screened for lithiation behavior through their interaction with ion beams in electrochemically tested samples subjected to both weak and strong lithiation regimes. These different lithiation regimes allowed us to differentiate between the thermodynamics and kinetic aspects of the lithiation process. Three types of ions are used to determine Li depth profile: $H^+$ for nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), $He^+$ for Rutherford backscattering (RBS), and $Ga^+$ for focused ion beam (FIB) milling. The study reveals three lithiation behaviors: (i) Zn, Al, Sn form pure alloys with Li; (ii) Mg, Ag create intercalation solid solutions; (iii) Cu acts as a lithiation barrier. NRA and RBS offer direct and quantitative data, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the lithiation process in LIB components. These findings fit well with our ab-initio simulation results, establishing a direct correlation between electrochemical features and fundamental thermodynamic parameters.

Title: Spin structures and phase diagrams of the spin-$\frac{5}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ under magnetic field
Authors: N. Biniskos, F. J. dos Santos, M. Stekiel, K. Schmalzl, E. Ressouche, D. Sviták, A. Labh, M. Vališka, N. Marzari, P. Čermák
Abstract: We combine single-crystal neutron diffraction studies and Monte Carlo simulations to determine the spin structures and finite-temperature phase diagram of the spin-5/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ in magnetic field. With the application of a magnetic field in two different directions, namely along the $c$-axis and in the $ab$-plane of the trigonal symmetry, we track the evolution of the spin structure through changes of the magnetic propagation vector. We account for these results with a minimal Heisenberg Hamiltonian that includes easy-axis anisotropy and weak, frustrated interlayer couplings in addition to intralayer exchange. Guided by representation analysis, we refine symmetry-allowed modes to the measured intensities and obtain the spin structures for all field-induced phases, which we compare quantitatively with simulated configurations. Taken together, our measurements and simulations show that frustrated interlayer exchange -- rather than purely 2D physics -- organizes the unexpectedly rich field-induced phases of Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$.

Title: Topotactic phase transition in epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-δ films induced by oxygen getter assisted thermal annealing
Authors: Chenyang Yin, Lei Cao, Xue Bai, Suqin He, Hengbo Zhang, Tomas Duchon, Felix Gunkel, Yunxia Zhou, Mao Wang, Anton Kaus, Janghyun Jo, Rafal E. Dunin-Borkowski, Shengqiang Zhou, Thomas Brückel, Oleg Petracic
Abstract: Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in controlling the physical properties of complex oxides. In La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta}, the topotactic phase transition from Perovskite (PV) to Brownmillerite (BM) can be triggered e.g. via oxygen removal during thermal annealing. Here we report on a very efficient thermal vacuum annealing method using aluminum as an oxygen getter material. The topotactic phase transition is characterized by X-ray Diffraction which confirms a successful transition from PV to BM in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta} thin films grown via physical vapor deposition. The efficiency of this method is confirmed using La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta} micron-sized bulk powder. The accompanying transition from the original Ferromagnetic (FM) to an Antiferromagnetic (AF) state and the simultaneous transition from a metallic to an insulating state is characterized using Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)-magnetometry and Alternating Current (AC) resistivity measurements, respectively. The near surface manganese oxidation states are probed by synchrotron X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. Moreover, X-ray Reflectivity, Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy reveal surface segregation and cation redistribution during the oxygen getter assisted annealing process.

Title: Predicting Trends in $V_{OC}$ Through Rapid, Multimodal Characterization of State-of-the-Art p-i-n Perovskite Devices
Authors: Amy E. Louks, Brandon T. Motes, Anthony T. Troupe, Axel F. Palmstrom, Joseph J. Berry, Dane W. deQuilettes
Abstract: Perovskite photovoltaic technologies are approaching commercial deployment, yet single junction and tandem architectures both still have significant room to improve power conversion efficiency and stability. The ability to perform rapid screening of material quality after altering processing conditions is critical to accelerating the optimization and commercialization of perovskite-based technologies. Currently, researchers utilize a wide range of stand-alone metrology tools to isolate sources of power loss throughout a device stack, which can be slow and labor intensive. Here, we demonstrate the use of a multimodal metrology approach to rapidly determine the maximum achievable and predicted open circuit voltages of > 100 perovskite devices during fabrication. Acquisition of these different data are facilitated by combining them into a single integrated measurement platform. We show that these data and automated analysis can be used to rapidly understand and ultimately predict quantitative trends in open circuit voltages of state-of-the-art devices architectures. The data and automated analysis workflow presented provides a reliable approach to quickly identify absorber and charge transport layer combinations that can lead to improved open circuit voltages.

Title: Activity propagation with Hebbian learning
Authors: Will T. Engedal, Róbert Juhász, István A. Kovács
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Hebbian learning on the contact process, a paradigmatic model for infection spreading, which has been also proposed as a simple model to capture the dynamics of inter-regional brain activity propagation as well as population spreading. Each of these contexts calls for an extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian learning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between a pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen either in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning model), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population dynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich class of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite global effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation rates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement (reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active phase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is twofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise to the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two distinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects with non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of activity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill" phenomenon.

Title: Altermagnetic Shastry-Sutherland fullerene networks
Authors: Jiaqi Wu, Alaric Sanders, Rundong Yuan, Bo Peng
Abstract: Molecular building blocks provide a versatile platform for realising exotic quantum phases. Using charge neutral, pure carbon fullerene molecules as an example, we design altermagnetic C$_{40}$ monolayers in Shastry-Sutherland lattice. The resonance structure of one unpaired electron leads to an effective spin-1/2 cluster on both long sides of the molecule, which, after rotating into a 2D rutile-like crystal structure, forms altermagnetic ground state. We show $d$-wave spitting of the spin-polarised electronic band structure and strong chiral-split magnon bands. Most interestingly, the effective spin-1/2 clusters form the Shastry-Sutherland model with a rich phase diagram including altermagenti, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases, which can be easily accessed to via moderate bi-axial strains. Our findings present magnetic fullerene monolayers as a tunable platform for exotic quantum magnetism and spintronic applications.

Title: CrystalICL: Enabling In-Context Learning for Crystal Generation
Authors: Ruobing Wang, Qiaoyu Tan, Yili Wang, Ying Wang, Xin Wang
Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation. Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method, which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs. We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional and unconditional generation tasks.

Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers can nowadays deliver pairs of ultrabright, ultrashort light pulses with controllable delays at different photon energies. When combined with diffraction experiments, the interaction of these pulses with a sample at different times can produce two snapshots of an evolving system, enabling spatial and temporal resolution of ultrafast dynamics in nanomatter at and beyond the terahertz time scale. However, light detectors are orders of magnitude slower. The diffraction signals from the two pulses overlap in the recorded data and cannot be separated using currently available analysis methods. Here, we address this challenge by introducing Dichography, a diffraction imaging technique that restores the two unique views of the sample from superimposed scattering signals. We apply Dichography to experimental diffraction patterns of isolated xenon-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets, imaged using time-delayed, two-color X-ray pulses at intensities near the detection limit. The reconstructed images provide evidence of the survival of the xenon structures up to 750 fs after the interaction with the first shot. The capabilities of Dichography are further explored by applying the method to data from a second experiment, in which we retrieve the images of two distinct silver nanoparticles intercepted by the same light pulse. Dichography enables a new class of experiments for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast phenomena, making a significant step toward the original promise of X-ray free-electron lasers to capture ultrafast movies of nanomatter.

Title: Towards Large-Spin Effective Theory II: $O(2)$ model in $d=4-ε$
Authors: Giulia Fardelli, A. Liam Fitzpatrick, Wei Li
Abstract: We show how to construct a holographic effective theory for the leading-twist operators in the $O(2)$ model in the $4-d=\epsilon$ expansion up to $O(\epsilon^2)$, based on the separation of short-distance and long-distance effects that arises as a function of spin $J$. We obtain the Hamiltonian of the theory and show that it correctly reproduces all the dimensions at $O(\epsilon^2)$ of the leading twist operators for all values of the charge $Q$ and spin $J$. The holographic Hamiltonian is given by the bulk exchange of a charged scalar $\phi$, neutral scalar $s \sim \phi \phi^*$, and a `ghost' field $c$, as well as a single local bulk interaction $(\phi \phi^*)^2$. We analyze various aspects of the spectrum and discuss their interpretation in light of the bulk description.

Title: Symmetry enforces entanglement at high temperatures
Authors: Amir-Reza Negari, Leonardo A. Lessa, Subhayan Sahu
Abstract: Many-body quantum systems with local interactions undergo "sudden death of entanglement" at high temperatures, whereby thermal states become classical mixtures of product states. We investigate whether symmetry constraints can prevent this phenomenon. We prove that strongly symmetric thermal states (canonical ensemble) of generic Hamiltonians with on-site Abelian symmetries remain entangled with non-zero entanglement negativity at arbitrarily high temperatures, under mild conditions on the symmetry actions and the charge sector of the strong symmetry. Our results extend to weakly symmetric thermal states (Gibbs ensemble) under superselection rules, which restrict state decompositions to be symmetric. In particular, we show that fermionic Gibbs states do not exhibit sudden death of entanglement and have persistent fermionic negativity at high temperatures. These findings demonstrate that global symmetry correlations can preserve quantum entanglement despite thermal decoherence, providing new insights into the interplay between symmetry and quantum information in thermal equilibrium.

Title: Beyond Optimization: Exploring Novelty Discovery in Autonomous Experiments
Authors: Ralph Bulanadi, Jawad Chowdhury, Funakubo Hiroshi, Maxim Ziatdinov, Rama Vasudevan, Arpan Biswas, Yongtao Liu
Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework, INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration), to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery; in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

Title: Collective communication in a transparent world: Phase transitions in a many-body Potts model and social-quantum duality
Authors: Pawat Akarapipattana, Sergei Nechaev, Bogdan Slavov
Abstract: We consider the Schelling-like social competition reflected in "dynamics of opinions" among groups of agents ("communities") in a highly transparent world. Specifically, we investigate a $q$-state Potts spin system with competing two- and three-body interactions on a complete graph. Agents interact through pairwise repulsion (opposing opinions) between different communities and three-body attraction (shared opinions) within the same community. In the thermodynamic limit, we identify variants of three key phases: (a) a symmetric "mixed" phase of $q$ states, in which no single opinion dominates in the society (interpreted as a "democracy"), (b) a symmetric "mixed" phase but of $q-1$ states, and (c) a "consensus" phase, characterized by the emergence of a dominant opinion (or "ideology"), coexisting with symmetrically distributed minority views. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal finite-size effects and metastable switching between configurations. Furthermore, we establish a correspondence between our social model on a complete graph and the mean-field $SU(N)$ quantum spin system with both quadratic and cubic interactions, revealing a "social-quantum" duality. This duality provides new perspectives on both stratification of social communication, and quantum many-body phenomena, offering a unified framework for understanding emergent collective behavior in complex systems.

Title: Spacetime Density Matrix: Formalism and Properties
Authors: Wu-zhong Guo
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the general formalism and properties of the spacetime density matrix, which captures correlations among different Cauchy surfaces and can be regarded as a natural generalization of the standard density matrix defined on a single Cauchy surface. We present the construction of the spacetime density matrix in general quantum systems and its representation via the Schwinger Keldysh path integral. We further introduce a super-operator framework, within which the spacetime density matrix appears as a special case, and discuss possible generalizations from this perspective. We also show that the spacetime density matrix satisfies a Liouville von Neumann type equation of motion. When considering subsystems, a reduced spacetime density matrix can be defined by tracing over complementary degrees of freedom. We study the general properties of its moments and, in particular, derive universal short time behavior of the second moment. We find that coupling between subsystems plays a crucial role in obtaining nontrivial results. Assuming weak coupling, we develop a perturbative method to compute the moments systematically.

Title: Diamond-loaded polyimide aerogel scattering filters and their applications in astrophysical and planetary science observations

Abstract: Infrared-blocking, aerogel-based scattering filters have a broad range of potential applications in astrophysics and planetary science instruments in the far-infrared, sub-millimeter, and microwave regimes. This paper demonstrates the ability of conductively-loaded, polyimide aerogel filters to meet the mechanical and science instrument requirements for several experiments, including the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS), the Experiment for Cryogenic Large-Aperture Intensity Mapping (EXCLAIM), and the Sub-millimeter Solar Observation Lunar Volatiles Experiment (SSOLVE). Thermal multi-physics simulations of the filters predict their performance when integrated into a cryogenic receiver. Prototype filters have survived cryogenic cycling to 4\,K with no degradation in mechanical properties. Measurement of total hemispherical reflectance and transmittance, as well as cryogenic tests of the aerogel filters in a full receiver context, allow estimates of the integrated infrared emissivity of the filters. Knowledge of the emissivity will help instrument designers incorporate the filters into future experiments in planetary science, astrophysics, and cosmology.

Title: Photonic restricted Boltzmann machine for content generation tasks
Authors: Li Luo, Yisheng Fang, Wanyi Zhang, Zhichao Ruan
Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling, enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations. The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative artificial intelligence.

Title: Topological photonics in nanoscaled systems with far field radiation and polarization singularities
Authors: Grazia Salerno
Abstract: Topology is a powerful framework for controlling and manipulating light, minimizing detrimental perturbations on the photonic properties. Combining nanophotonics with topological concepts presents opportunities for both fundamental physics and technological applications. Although most topological photonic realizations have been inspired by condensed-matter analogue models, new topological ideas have just begun to be realized at the nanoscale. Nanophotonics is characterized by subtle phenomena that are not usually considered in other topological models' realizations, such as nonlocality, strong field confinement, and light radiating to the far-field continuum. In this perspective, we will discuss how standard topological band theory for photonic crystals needs to be extended by a more comprehensive approach that properly treats such nanophotonic intrinsic effects and, in particular, the interplay of polarization and far-field radiation. We highlight the emerging role that polarization singularities might play in defining the topological invariants in the far field, which are not fully captured by bulk observables alone. We conclude by outlining a set of open questions and promising directions for exploring novel concepts in topological nanophotonics and shaping next-generation photonic devices.

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.

Title: Extending flow birefringence analysis to combined extensional-shear flows via Jeffery-Hamel flow measurements
Authors: Miu Kobayashi, William Kai Alexander Worby, Misa Kawaguchi, Yuto Yokoyama, Sayaka Ichihara, Yoshiyuki Tagawa
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between phase retardation and strain rates in combined extensional-shear flows using the Jeffery-Hamel flow formalism, which yields an analytical velocity solution. Flow birefringence was measured in a 1.0 wt$\%$ cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) suspension using a high-speed polarization camera. The velocity field was validated via particle image velocimetry (PIV), which showed good agreement with the analytical solution. In regions dominated by either shear or extensional components, the birefringence behavior was consistent with prior theoretical and experimental findings. In the combined extensional-shear regions of the Jeffery-Hamel flow, the birefringence magnitude followed the root-sum-square (RSS) of the shear- and extension-induced contributions. This observation aligns with the principal stress formulation derived from Mohr's circle, in which the principal stress is expressed as the RSS of extensional and shear stresses. This finding provides a basis for extending stress-birefringence analysis to flows with coexisting deformation modes.

Title: Renormalizable Graph Embeddings For Multi-Scale Network Reconstruction
Authors: Riccardo Milocco, Fabian Jansen, Diego Garlaschelli
Abstract: In machine learning, graph embedding algorithms seek low-dimensional representations of the input network data, thereby allowing for downstream tasks on compressed encodings. Recently, within the framework of network renormalization, multi-scale embeddings that remain consistent under an arbitrary aggregation of nodes onto block-nodes, and consequently under an arbitrary change of resolution of the input network data, have been proposed. Here we investigate such multi-scale graph embeddings in the modified context where the input network is not entirely observable, due to data limitations or privacy constraints. This situation is typical for financial and economic networks, where connections between individual banks or firms are hidden due to confidentiality, and one has to probabilistically reconstruct the underlying network from aggregate information. We first consider state-of-the-art network reconstruction techniques based on the maximum-entropy principle, which is designed to operate optimally at a fixed resolution level. We then discuss the limitations of these methods when they are used as graph embeddings to yield predictions across different resolution levels. Finally, we propose their natural 'renormalizable' counterparts derived from the distinct principle of scale invariance, yielding consistent graph embeddings for multi-scale network reconstruction. We illustrate these methods on national economic input-output networks and on international trade networks, which can be naturally represented at multiple levels of industrial and geographic resolution, respectively.

Title: Toward triggered generation of indistinguishable single-photons from MoTe$_2$ quantum emitters
Authors: Paweł Wyborski, Athanasios Paralikis, Pietro Metuh, Martin A. Jacobsen, Christian Ruiz, Niels Gregersen, Battulga Munkhbat
Abstract: Single-photon sources operating in the telecom band are fundamental components for long-distance optical quantum communication and information processing. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer a promising platform for such sources, but their development has been hindered by limited spectral range and poor single-photon indistinguishability. Here, we demonstrate a reproducible and systematic approach for generating near-infrared (1090-1200 nm) quantum emitters in bilayer MoTe$_2$ using deterministic strain and defect engineering. These emitters exhibit strong linear polarization (DOLP $>70\%$), sub-nanosecond lifetimes ($\tau \leqslant$ ~450 ps), high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0)<0.1$), and resolution-limited emission ($\sim$200 $\mu$eV). Electrostatic biasing enables Stark tuning over a $\sim$3 meV range, reduced photon bunching, and significantly shortened radiative lifetimes, yielding narrow emission with ratios of experimental to transform-limited linewidths as low as $R\sim55$. Most notably, two-photon interference measurements reveal a Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility of $V_\text{HOM}\sim $10$\%$, and up to $V_\text{HOM}\sim$ 40$\%$ with post-selection by temporal filtering, representing the highest reported indistinguishability for any TMD quantum emitters and the first such demonstration in the near-infrared regime. These results establish MoTe$_2$ as a viable platform for tunable, low-noise, high-purity single-photon sources with promising indistinguishability, paving the way for their integration into telecom-compatible quantum photonic technologies.

Title: Boundary bootstrap for the three-dimensional O($N$) normal universality class
Authors: Runzhe Hu, Wenliang Li
Abstract: The three-dimensional classical O($N$) model with a boundary has received renewed interest due to the discovery of the extraordinary-log boundary university class for $2\leq N< N_\text{c}$. The exponent of the spin correlator and the critical value $N_c$ are related to certain universal amplitudes in the normal universality class. To determine their precise values, we revisit the 3d O($N$) boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) for $N=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. After substantially improving the accuracy of the boundary bootstrap, our determinations are in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo results, resolving the previous discrepancies due to low truncation orders. We also use the recent bulk bootstrap results to derive highly accurate Ising data. Many bulk and boundary predictions are obtained for the first time. Our results demonstrate the great potential of the $\eta$ minimization method for many unexplored non-positive bootstrap problems.

Title: LeMat-Traj: A Scalable and Unified Dataset of Materials Trajectories for Atomistic Modeling
Authors: Ali Ramlaoui, Martin Siron, Inel Djafar, Joseph Musielewicz, Amandine Rossello, Victor Schmidt, Alexandre Duval
Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher are publicly available at this https URL and this https URL.

Abstract: Additives are essential to enhance or modify the properties of plastics for target applications. However, finding appropriate additives may be challenging, since we lack knowledge on their interactions with the plastics and with moisture, and the interplay between them. In this work, we study a commercial additive as well as two new potential additives for their antistatic and slip properties in polyethylene by means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We reveal the most favorable interactions between polyethylene, each of these molecules and water, along with providing a microscopic picture of their interfacial structure. All additives interact with water mainly by their polar heads, with water acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor or donor depending on the additive. As expected, water does not enter the polyethylene matrix; it accumulates at its surface instead, without any preferencial orientation. The additives studied exhibit remarkably different structures when they are mixed with the polymer: two of them enter the polymer matrix to various degrees, either by intercalating their chains with the polyethylene ones or by forming miscellar-like structures, while the third one stays at the surface. When water is incorporated into the system, the structure of some of the additive/polyethylene systems changes. The magnitude and nature of these changes depend on the relative concentrations of all species. If the additives are in low concentrations, water stays at the surface of the material, in a drop-like shape. The additives penetrate and organize the polymer more or less depending on whether water is present or not. We predict that one of our two proposed molecules has promising antistatic properties while the other one could be applied as a slip agent. We hope that our predictions will spark interest in testing these molecules in the laboratory as polyethylene additives.

Title: Distinct weak asymmetric interactions shape human brain functions as probability fluxes
Authors: Yoshiaki Horiike, Shin Fujishiro
Abstract: The functional computation of the human brain arises from the collective behaviour of the underlying neural network. The emerging technology enables the recording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks is expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data. Thermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by the brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high energy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy consumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not involved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide repertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy consumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by subtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We first show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced whole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the microscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns depending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function is a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the parameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal that the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and task-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and task-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed probability flux patterns. Our results indicate that the human brain performs its functional computation by subtly modifying the antisymmetric interaction among the brain regions, which might be possible with a small amount of energy.

Title: Bohr--Sommerfeld rules for systems
Authors: Simon Becker, Setsuro Fujiié, Jens Wittsten
Abstract: We present a complete, self-contained formulation of the Bohr--Sommerfeld quantization rule for a semiclassical self-adjoint $2 \times 2$ system on the real line, arising from a simple closed curve in phase space. We focus on the case where the principal symbol exhibits eigenvalue crossings within the domain enclosed by the curve -- a situation commonly encountered in Dirac-type operators. Building on earlier work on scalar Bohr--Sommerfeld rules and semiclassical treatments of the Harper operator near rational flux quanta, we identify additional contributions to the quantization condition, and derive concise expressions for general self-adjoint $2 \times 2$ systems. The resulting formulas give explicit geometric phase corrections and clarify when these phases take quantized values.

Title: Dynamics of the Fermion-Rotor System
Authors: Vazha Loladze, Takemichi Okui, David Tong
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of the fermion-rotor system, a simple impurity model in d=1+1 dimensions that consists of a collection of purely right-moving fermions interacting with a quantum mechanical rotor localised at the origin. This was first introduced by Polchinski as a toy model for monopole-fermion scattering and is surprisingly subtle, with ingoing and outgoing fermions carrying different quantum numbers. We show that the rotor acts as a twist operator in the low-energy theory, changing the quantum numbers of excitations that have previously passed through the origin to ensure scattering consistent with all symmetries. We further show how generalisations of this model with multiple rotors and unequal charges can be viewed as a UV-completion of boundary states for chiral theories, including the well-studied 3450 model. We compute correlation functions between ingoing and outgoing fermions and show that fermions dressed with the rotor degree of freedom act as local operators and create single-particle states, generalising an earlier result obtained in a theory with a single rotor and equal charges. Finally, we point out a mod 2 anomaly in these models that descends from the Witten anomaly in 4d

Title: Physical constraints on effective non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Aaron Kleger, Rufus Boyack
Abstract: Interacting and open quantum systems can be formulated in terms of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH), however, there are important constraints that must be satisfied by the effective action and the associated Green's functions. One common approach to many-body non-Hermitian (NH) systems is to incorporate the anti-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian directly in the Matsubara Green's function. Here, we show that such an approach is incompatible with the standard framework for systems with interactions. Furthermore, we furnish a consistent physical description for such systems by determining their distinction from conventional interacting physics, and find that they are described by pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we characterize the zero-temperature distribution functions within several frameworks for NH systems. As an application of our results, we consider the electromagnetic response of a NH quasiparticle Hamiltonian based on the (1+1)-dimensional NH Dirac model subject to various physical descriptions.

Title: A Fermi Surface Descriptor Quantifying the Correlations between Anomalous Hall Effect and Fermi Surface Geometry
Authors: Elena Derunova, Jacob Gayles, Yan Sun, Michael W. Gaultois, Mazhar N. Ali
Abstract: In the last few decades, basic ideas of topology have completely transformed the prediction of quantum transport phenomena. Following this trend, we go deeper into the incorporation of modern mathematics into quantum material science focusing on geometry. Here we investigate the relation between the geometrical type of the Fermi surface and Anomalous and Spin Hall Effects. An index, $\mathbb{H}_F$, quantifying the hyperbolic geometry of the Fermi surface, shows a universal correlation (R$^2$ = 0.97) with the experimentally measured intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, of 16 different compounds spanning a wide variety of crystal, chemical, and electronic structure families, including those where topological methods give R$^2$ = 0.52. This raises a question about the predictive limits of topological physics and its transformation into a wider study of bandstructures' and Fermi surfaces' geometries and relating them to the quantum geometry theory of a more general metric of eigenstates, opening horizon for the prediction of phenomena beyond topological understanding.

Title: Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets
Authors: Phillip Popp, Arthur P. Ramirez, Sergey Syzranov
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.

Title: Non-Hermitian Origin of Detachable Boundary States in Topological Insulators
Authors: Daichi Nakamura, Ken Shiozaki, Kenji Shimomura, Masatoshi Sato, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: While topology can impose obstructions to exponentially localized Wannier functions, certain topological insulators are exempt from such Wannier obstructions. The absence of the Wannier obstructions can further accompany topological boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. Here, we elucidate a close connection between these detachable topological boundary states and non-Hermitian topology. Identifying topological boundary states as non-Hermitian topology, we demonstrate that intrinsic non-Hermitian topology leads to the inevitable spectral flow. By contrast, we show that extrinsic non-Hermitian topology underlies the detachment of topological boundary states and clarify anti-Hermitian topology of the detached boundary states. Based on this connection and $K$-theory, we complete the tenfold classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states.

Title: $K$-theory classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states
Authors: Ken Shiozaki, Daichi Nakamura, Kenji Shimomura, Masatoshi Sato, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: A hallmark of certain topology, including the Chern number, is the obstruction to constructing exponentially localized Wannier functions in the bulk bands. Conversely, other types of topology do not necessarily impose Wannier obstructions. Remarkably, such Wannier-localizable topological insulators can host boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. In our accompanying Letter [D. Nakamura {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 096601 (2025), arXiv:2407.09458], we demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology underlies detachable boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators and superconductors, thereby establishing their tenfold classification based on internal symmetry. Here, using $K$-theory, we elucidate the relationship between Wannier localizability and detachability of topological boundary states. From the boundary perspective, we classify intrinsic and extrinsic non-Hermitian topology, corresponding to nondetachable and detachable topological boundary states, respectively. From the bulk perspective, on the other hand, we classify Wannier localizability through the homomorphisms of topological phases from the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes to the threefold Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. Notably, these two approaches from the boundary and bulk perspectives lead to the same classification. We clarify this agreement and develop a unified understanding of the bulk-boundary correspondence on the basis of $K$-theory.

Title: Unveiling Stripe-shaped Charge Density Modulations in Doped Mott Insulators
Authors: Ning Xia, Yuchen Guo, Shuo Yang
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental findings, we investigate various scenarios of the doped Hubbard model with impurity potentials. We calculate the lattice Green's function in a finite-size cluster and then map it to the continuum real space, which allows for a direct comparison with scanning-tunneling-microscopy measurements on the local density of states. Our simulations successfully reproduce experimental data, including the characteristic stripe- and ladder-shaped structures observed in cuprate systems. Moreover, our results establish a connection between previous numerical findings on stripe-ordered ground states and experimental observations, thus providing new insights into microscopic mechanisms of the Mott insulator to superconductor transition in cuprates.

Title: Atomic-scale 3D structural dynamics and functional degradation of Pt alloy nanocatalysts during the oxygen reduction reaction
Authors: Chaehwa Jeong, Juhyeok Lee, Hyesung Jo, KwangHo Lee, SangJae Lee, Colin Ophus, Peter Ercius, EunAe Cho, Yongsoo Yang
Abstract: Pt-based electrocatalysts are the primary choice for fuel cells due to their superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. To enhance ORR performance and durability, extensive studies have investigated transition metal alloying, doping, and shape control to optimize the three key governing factors for ORR: geometry, local chemistry, and strain of their surface and subsurface. However, systematic optimization remains incomplete, as it requires an atomic-scale understanding of these factors and their dynamics over potential cycling, as well as their relationship to ORR activity. Here, we implement neural network-assisted atomic electron tomography to measure the 3D atomic structural dynamics and their effects on the functional degradation of PtNi alloy catalysts. Our results reveal that PtNi catalysts undergo shape changes, surface alloying, and strain relaxation during cycling, which can be effectively mitigated by Ga doping. By combining geometry, local chemistry, and strain analysis, we calculated the changes in ORR activity over thousands of cycles and observed that Ga doping leads to higher initial activity and greater stability. These findings offer a pathway to understanding 3D atomic structural dynamics and their relation to ORR activity during cycling, paving the way for the systematic design of durable, high-efficiency nanocatalysts.

Title: Realizing the interacting resonant level model using a quantum dot detector
Authors: Zhanyu Ma, Matan Lotem, Yigal Meir, Eran Sela
Abstract: The interacting resonant level model (IRLM) is the simplest quantum impurity model to display strongly correlated effects in mesoscopic systems, which triggered its extensive theoretical study. However, to date, there have not been any realizations of the model with controllable interaction parameter, and thus the detailed predictions could not be confirmed. Here we use a recently developed approach to Anderson orthogonality catastrophe physics, using a charge detector coupled to a quantum dot (QD) system, to devise a simple experimental system which could display IRLM behavior and detail its predictions. At the same time, the mapping to IRLM allows us to determine the interaction parameter of the charge detector using simple experimental probes.

Title: Theory of Microphase Separation in Elastomers
Authors: Manu Mannattil, Haim Diamant, David Andelman
Abstract: Inspired by recent experiments, we present a phase-field model of microphase separation in an elastomer swollen with a solvent. The imbalance between the molecular scale of demixing and the mesoscopic scale beyond which elasticity operates produces effective long-range interactions, forming stable finite-sized domains. Our predictions concerning the dependence of the domain size and transition temperature on the stiffness of the elastomer are in good agreement with the experiments. Analytical phase diagrams, aided by numerical findings, capture the richness of the microphase morphologies, paving the way to create stable, patterned elastomers for various applications.

Title: Topological charge excitations and Green's function zeros in paramagnetic Mott insulators
Authors: Emile Pangburn, Catherine Pépin, Anurag Banerjee
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of topological features in the charge excitations of Mott insulators in the Chern-Hubbard model. In the strong correlation regime, treating electrons as the sum of holons and doublons excitations, we compute the topological phase diagram of Mott insulators at half-filling using composite operator formalism. The Green function zeros manifest as the tightly bound pairs of such elementary excitations of the Mott insulators. Our analysis examines the winding number associated with the occupied Hubbard bands and the band of Green's function zeros. We show that both the poles and zeros show gapless states and zeros, respectively, in line with bulk-boundary correspondence. The gapless edge states emerge in a junction geometry connecting a topological Mott band insulator and a topological Mott zeros phase. These include an edge electronic state that carries a charge and a charge-neutral gapless zero mode. Our study is relevant to several twisted materials with flat bands where interactions play a dominant role.

Title: Grain boundaries amplify local chemical ordering in complex concentrated alloys
Authors: Ian Geiger, Yuan Tian, Ying Han, Yutong Bi, Xiaoqing Pan, Penghui Cao, Timothy J. Rupert
Abstract: Local chemical ordering strongly influences the behavior of complex concentrated alloys, yet its characterization remains challenging due to the nanoscale dimensions and scattered spatial distribution of the ordered domains. Here, we study chemical ordering near grain boundaries, demonstrating they can act as microstructural anchor points that amplify chemical order and drive the formation of compositional nanopatterns. Atomistic simulations reveal the development of composition waves with ordering vectors normal to the boundary plane in two distinct material systems, CrCoNi and NbMoTaW. These waves manifest as periodic enrichment-depletion patterns that reflect the underlying chemical ordering tendencies of each system, but with amplified contrast that extends several nanometers into the grain interior before gradually decaying. By examining multiple grain boundary orientations and alloys, we show that both the interfacial segregation profile and the crystallographic terminating plane govern the extent and character of this amplification. This interplay between boundary-dictated directional ordering and the diffuse, untemplated chemical domain evolution within the grain advances our understanding of interface-mediated ordering phenomena and suggests new opportunities for experimentally detecting local chemical order in complex concentrated alloys.

Title: 5d orbital Induced Room Temperature Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in TbCl
Authors: Jianqi Zhong, Jianzhou Zhao, Jinyu Zou, Gang Xu
Abstract: Following the experimental realization of Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in thin films of chromium-doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$, enhancing the work temperature of QAH effect has emerged as a significant and challenging task. Here we demonstrate monolayer TbCl as a promising candidate to realize the room temperature QAH effect. Using DFT+U method, double checked by HSE06 and DMFT calculations, we identify the Hall conductivity $G = -e^2/h$ per layer in three-dimensional ferromagnetic insulator TbCl, which is a weakly stacking of QAH layers. The monolayer TbCl inherits the magnetic and topological properties, exhibiting the QAH effect with Chern number $C$=-1. The large topological band gap reaches 42.8 meV, which is beyond room temperatue. The extended 5$d$ electrons lead to sizable exchange and superexchange interactions, resulting in a high Curie temperature $T_c$$\sim$457K. All these features demonstrate that monolayer TbCl will provide an ideal platform to realize the room temperature QAH effect.

Title: Entanglement asymmetry dynamics in random quantum circuits
Authors: Filiberto Ares, Sara Murciano, Pasquale Calabrese, Lorenzo Piroli
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in random unitary circuits (RUCs). Focusing on a local $U(1)$ charge, we consider symmetric initial states evolved by both local one-dimensional circuits and geometrically non-local RUCs made of two-qudit gates. We compute the entanglement asymmetry of subsystems of arbitrary size, analyzing the relaxation time scales. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of the whole system approaches its stationary value in a time independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits. For subsystems, we find qualitative differences depending on their size. When the subsystem is larger than half of the full system, the equilibration time scales are again independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits and the entanglement asymmetry grows monotonically in time. Conversely, when the subsystems are smaller than half of the full system, we show that the entanglement asymmetry is non-monotonic in time and that it equilibrates in a time proportional to the quantum-information scrambling time, providing a physical intuition. As a consequence, the subsystem-equilibration time depends on the locality of interactions, scaling linearly and logarithmically in the system size, respectively, for local and non-local RUCs. Our work confirms the entanglement asymmetry as a versatile and computable probe of symmetry in many-body physics and yields a phenomenological overview of entanglement-asymmetry evolution in typical non-integrable dynamics.

Title: Non-renormalization of the fractional quantum Hall conductivity by interactions
Authors: M. Selch, M.A.Zubkov, Souvik Pramanik, M.Lewkowicz
Abstract: We investigate the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) proposed a long time ago by Lopez and Fradkin \cite{Fradkin1991chern} to describe the principal Jain series. The magnetic fluxes of the statistical gauge field attached to electrons remain at rest in the reference frame moving together with the electron liquid. In the laboratory reference frame the electric field of the statistical gauge field forms and screens the external electric field. The fractional QHE conductivity appears as a consequence of this screening already on the mean field theory level. We consider a relativistic extension of the model, and propose an alternative description of the fractional QHE based on macroscopic motion of the electron liquid within the Zubarev statistical operator approach. It is this macroscopic motion of electrons which in this pattern gives rise to the fractional QHE. Within this approach we propose the proof to all orders of perturbation theory that the interaction corrections cannot change the above mentioned mean field theory result for the QHE conductivity.

Title: Two Channel Multi impurity Kondo model
Authors: A. M. Tsvelik, G. Kotliar
Abstract: We show that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasua-Yoisida interaction between overscreened spins in two channel Kondo impurity systems is a relevant perturbation when the number of impurities N is greater than 3 driving the system to a new quantum critical point with anomalous dimensions $\frac{1}{ (N+1)} $ for the spin operator and the Sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat scales as $\gamma \sim T^{- \frac{3}{N+1}}$. The critical point universal properties are relevant to many strong correlation problems, such as impurity placed in a Majorana metal and the multichannel Kondo lattice model of heavy fermion materials. We discuss relevance of our results for cluster DMFT studies of quantum criticality.

Title: The carbon nanotube gatemon qubit
Authors: H. Riechert, S. Annabi, A. Peugeot, H. Duprez, M. Hantute, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, E. Arrighi, J. Griesmar, J.-D. Pillet, L. Bretheau
Abstract: Gate-tunable transmon qubits are based on quantum conductors used as weak links within hybrid Josephson junctions. These gatemons have been implemented in just a handful of systems, all relying on extended conductors, namely epitaxial semiconductors or exfoliated graphene. Here we present the coherent control of a gatemon based on a single molecule, a one-dimensional carbon nanotube, which is integrated into a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. The measured qubit spectrum can be tuned with a gate voltage and reflects the quantum dot behaviour of the nanotube. Our ultraclean integration, using a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, results in record coherence times of 200ns for carbon nanotube-based qubits. Furthermore, we investigate its decoherence mechanisms, thus revealing a strong gate dependence and identifying charge noise as a limiting factor. On top of positioning carbon nanotubes as contenders for future quantum technologies, our work paves the way for studying microscopic fermionic processes in low-dimensional quantum conductors.

Abstract: These notes are based on the lectures that one of us (HT) gave at the Summer School on the "Theory of Large Deviations and Applications", held in July 2024 at Les Houches in France. They present the basic definitions and mathematical results that form the theory of large deviations, as well as many simple motivating examples of applications in statistical physics, which serve as a basis for the many other lectures given at the school that covered more specific applications in biophysics, random matrix theory, nonequilibrium systems, geophysics, and the simulation of rare events, among other topics. These notes extend the lectures, which can be accessed online, by presenting exercises and pointer references for further reading.

Title: Elastic displacements and viscous hydrodynamic flows in wedge-shaped geometries with a straight edge: Green's functions for parallel forces
Authors: Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Lukas Fischer, Marc Pradas, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: For homogeneous and isotropic linearly elastic solids and for incompressible fluids under low-Reynolds-number conditions the fundamental solutions of the associated continuum equations were derived a long time ago for bulk systems. That is, the corresponding Green's functions are available in infinitely extended systems, where boundaries do not play any role. However, introducing boundaries renders the situation significantly more complex. Here, we derive the corresponding Green's functions for a linearly elastic homogeneous and isotropic material in a wedge-shaped geometry. Two flat boundaries confine the material and meet at a straight edge. No-slip and free-slip conditions are considered. The force is oriented in a direction parallel to the straight edge of the wedge. Assuming incompressibility, our expressions also apply to the situation of low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamic viscous fluid flows. Thus, they may be used, for instance, to describe the motion of self-propelled objects guided by an edge or the distortion of soft elastic actuators in wedge-shaped environments of operation.

Title: Measuring work in quantum many-body systems using a dynamical "work agent"
Authors: Cheolhee Han, Nadav Katz, Eran Sela
Abstract: We consider a generic quantum many-body system initiated at thermal equilibrium and driven by an external parameter, and discuss the prospect for measuring the work done by the varying parameter on the system. While existing methods are based on a full control of the system's Hamiltonian and are thus limited to few-level quantum systems, measuring work in many-body quantum systems remains challenging. Our approach relies on transforming the external parameter into a dynamical ``work agent", for which we consider an harmonic oscillator in a semiclassical coherent state with a large photon number. We define a work generating function which coincides with the standard two-point measurement protocol for work measurement in the limit of a large photon number. While \emph{in principle} it allows to relate the moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ to observables of the work agent, we focus on the average work, which is obtained from energy conservation by the change of the energy of the agent, which can be measured using photon number detection. We illustrate this concept on a transmon-microcavity system, which displays various quantum coherent effects including Landau-Zener Stükelberg interference and collapse and revival of Rabi oscillations. We discuss how our setup allows to measure work in a variety of quantum many-body systems.

Title: Nonperturbative treatment of a quenched Langevin field theory
Authors: Friederike Ihssen, Valerio Pagni, Jamir Marino, Sebastian Diehl, Nicolò Defenu
Abstract: We present a novel approach within the functional renormalization group framework for computing critical exponents that characterize the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium many-body systems. Our approach permits access to quantities involved in the renormalization procedure, using an expansion about time-translation invariant problems. This expansion can be upgraded to a fully time-dependent computation by iteration. As a prototypical example, we compute the aging exponent $\theta$ describing the dynamics of model A following a sudden quench to the critical point. Already at leading order, the approach demonstrates remarkable accuracy when compared with MC simulations and resummed perturbative expansions in the range $2<d<4$. This yields results that surpass those of the two-loop $\epsilon$ expansion in accuracy and match analytically known benchmarks at large $N$. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of out-of-equilibrium universality and open new avenues for non-perturbative studies of critical dynamics, as well as for exploring the critical behavior of systems with spatial boundaries.

Title: Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model
Authors: Andreas M. Läuchli, Loïc Herviou, Patrick H. Wilhelm, Slava Rychkov
Abstract: Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.

Title: Exciton Energy Routing via Defect Networks in hBN/2D-Perovskite Hybrids
Authors: Sara Darbari, Paul Bittorf, Leon Multerer, Fatemeh Chahshouri, Parsa Darman, Pavel Ruchka, Harald Giessen, Masoud Taleb, Yaser Abdi, Nahid Talebi
Abstract: Excitons in two dimensional Ruddlesden Popper perovskites (RPPs) exhibit large and tunable binding energies, making them promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. In particular, long-range exciton energy transfer in these materi-als holds potential for light-harvesting technologies and nanoscale interconnects. Here, using cathodoluminescence spectros-copy, we demonstrate that exciton energy can be transferred over ultralong distances, up to 150 micrometers, in heterostructures composed of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and RPPs. This transfer is enabled by efficient exciton coupling to defect centers in hBN and subsequent defect defect interactions. This mechanism not only facilitates long-range energy transfer, but also leads to enhanced luminescence intensity, narrower emission linewidths, extended exciton lifetimes, and reduced electron-beam-induced degradation. Owing to the high density of emitters within the hBN layers, the investigated van der Waals heterostructure emerges as a robust and stable hybrid platform. Our findings open promising pathways for room-temperature excitonic devices with enhanced performance, including quantum transducers, light-harvesting systems, and optoelectronic interconnects.

Title: Band-spin-valley coupled exciton physics in antiferromagnetic MnPS$_3$
Authors: Dan Wang, Haowei Chen, Yu Pang, Xiaolong Zou, Wenhui Duan
Abstract: The introduction of intrinsic magnetic order in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors offers great opportunities for investigating correlated excitonic phenomena. Here, we employ full-spinor GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation methodology to reveal rich exciton physics in a prototypical 2D Néel-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor MnPS$_3$, enabled by the interplay among inverted dispersion of the second valence band, spin-valley coupling and magnetic order. The negative hole mass increases the reduced mass of the lowest-energy bright exciton, leading to exchange splitting enhancement of the bright exciton relative to band-edge dark exciton. Notably, such splitting couples with spontaneous valley polarization to generate distinct excitonic fine structure between $K$ and $-K$ valleys, which dictate distinct relaxation behaviors. Crucially, magnetic order transition from Néel antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic state induces significant quasiparticle band structure reconstruction and excitonic transitions modification, with low-energy optical excitations being exclusively contributed by majority-spin channel. These findings establish 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductors as an intriguing platform to study band-spin-valley coupled exciton physics.

Title: Josephson Diode Effect from Nonequilibrium Current in a Superconducting Interferometer
Authors: Daniel Shaffer, Songci Li, Jaglul Hasan, Mikhail Titov, Alex Levchenko
Abstract: We investigate the Josephson diode effect in a superconducting interferometer under nonequilibrium conditions. In contrast to its thermodynamic counterpart, which requires the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetry, we demonstrate that a diode-like asymmetry of the critical current can emerge solely due to a dissipative current in the normal region of an otherwise symmetric Josephson junction. This effect is driven entirely by the nonequilibrium conditions, without the need for additional inversion symmetry breaking. Using the standard quasiclassical Keldysh Green's function formalism, we explicitly calculate the diode coefficient from the supercurrent-phase relation of the interferometer. Remarkably, within certain ranges of control parameters, such as applied voltage, temperature, and the geometric aspect ratio of the device, the diode coefficient can exceed its nominal perfect value.

Title: Finite Membrane Thickness Influences Hydrodynamics on the Nanoscale
Authors: Zachary G. Lipel, Yannick A. D. Omar, Dimitrios Fraggedakis
Abstract: Many lipid membrane-mediated transport processes--such as mechanically-gated channel activation and solute transport--involve structural and dynamical features on membrane thickness length scales. Most existing membrane models, however, tend to adopt (quasi-)two-dimensional descriptions that neglect thickness-dependent phenomena relevant to internal membrane mechanics, and thus do not fully account for the complex coupling of lipid membranes with their surrounding fluid media. Therefore, explicitly incorporating membrane thickness effects in lipid membrane models will enable a more accurate description of the influence of membrane/fluid coupling on transport phenomena in the vicinity of the bilayer surfaces. Here, we present a continuum model for membrane fluctuations that accounts for finite membrane thickness and resolves hydrodynamic interactions between the bilayer and its surrounding fluid. By applying linear response analysis, we observe that membrane thickness-mediated effects, such as bending-induced lipid reorientations, can generate shear flows close to the membrane surface that slow down the relaxation of nanometer scale shape fluctuations. Additionally, we reveal the emergence of pressure inversion and flow reversal near the membrane interfaces, accompanied by localized stagnation points. Among these, extensional stagnation points give rise to a novel mode of bulk dissipation, originating from bending-induced compression and expansion of the membrane surfaces and their coupling to shear stresses in the fluid. Our findings identify membrane thickness as a key factor in nanoscale hydrodynamics and suggest that its effects may be detectable in fluctuation spectra and can be relevant to interfacial processes such as solute permeability and contact with solid boundaries or other membranes.

Title: Fractional Chern insulator states in an isolated flat band of zero Chern number
Authors: Zuzhang Lin, Hongyu Lu, Wenqi Yang, Dawei Zhai, Wang Yao
Abstract: A flat band with Chern number $C=0$, and well isolated from the rest of Hilbert space by a gap much larger than interaction strength, is a context that has not been regarded as relevant for fractional quantum Hall physics. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of the fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in such a trivial flat band, using large-scale exact diagonalization (ED) and infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations. The $C=0$ isolated flat band is hosted by an anisotropic fluxed dice lattice. Both the quantum metric and Berry curvature of the $C=0$ flat band have a sharp peak at the $\Gamma$ point, whereas in the rest of the Brillouin zone (BZ) they mimic the quantum geometry of the lowest Landau level. We consider nearest-neighbor repulsion that is weak enough to ensure the isolated-band limit is always satisfied. From the projected ED simulations at $\nu_\mathrm{F}=2/3$ electron filling of the flat band (i.e. $1/3$ hole filling), we find the unexpected FCI with 3-fold ground-state degeneracy and $\sigma_\mathrm{H}=-1/3 (e^2/h)$. The momentum space carrier distribution shows that the quantum metric peak tends to push the interacting holes away from $\Gamma$ point towards the BZ regions with the nearly ``ideal'' quantum geometry, underlying the formation of FCI in the $C=0$ flat band. Besides, when tuning the single-particle anisotropy such that the quantum geometry of the $C=0$ flat band becomes less sharp around $\Gamma$, we find the ground state becomes a charge density wave with tripled unit cell at $\nu_\mathrm{F}=2/3$. Our two-band iDMRG simulations further corroborate the FCI in the isolated $C=0$ flat band, demonstrating in such parameter regime the fractionally quantized charge pumping upon flux insertion as well as the momentum-resolved entanglement spectrum characteristic of the $1/3$ Laughlin state.

Abstract: We report on the experimental study of the spectrum of plasma excitations in a plasmonic crystal fabricated from the two-dimensional electron system in an AlGaAs/GaAs semiconductor heterostructure. We perform a comprehensive research on the mode frequency and relaxation as a function of the gate width across different plasmonic crystal periods. Importantly, we develop an analytical approach that accurately describes the behavior of plasma excitations in plasmonic crystals, providing new insights into the fundamental physics of plasmonic systems.

Title: Enhanced Neel temperature and unusual thermal expansion in flux-grown FeCrAs crystals
Authors: Michael A. McGuire, Matthew S. Cook, Brenden R. Ortiz, Jiaqiang Yan, Andrew F. May
Abstract: We report results from our experimental investigation of the distorted-kagome compound FeCrAs. For this work, we developed a procedure using tin metal as a flux to produce needlelike crystals. The crystals were characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction as well as measurements of magnetization, electrical transport, and heat capacity. The physical behaviors are generally similar to published results on crystals grown from a stoichiometric melt with two notable exceptions. The Sommerfeld coefficient is found to be 18 mJ/K2/mol, a little more than half of the previously reported value, and the Neel temperature is found to be 150 K, about 25K higher than in previous reports. The reason for these discrepancies are uncertain, but they may be related to differences in stoichiometry or disorder; it is expected that the Cr/Fe ratio has some variability in this compound. In addition, we find unusual thermal expansion behavior, with an anomaly at the Neel temperature and nearly temperature independent thermal expansion along the hexagonal c-axis above this transition. This suggests significant spin-lattice coupling, which may provide insight into non-metallic transport properties that have been associated with anomalous charge carrier scattering.

Title: Cell-Scale Dynamic Modeling of Membrane Interactions with Arbitrarily Shaped Particles
Authors: Didarul Ahasan Redwan, Justin Reicher, Xin Yong
Abstract: Modeling membrane interactions with arbitrarily shaped colloidal particles, such as environmental micro- and nanoplastics, at the cell scale remains particularly challenging, owing to the complexity of particle geometries and the need to resolve fully coupled translational and rotational dynamics. Here, we present a force-based computational framework capable of capturing dynamic interactions between deformable lipid vesicles and rigid particles of irregular shapes. Both vesicle and particle surfaces are represented using triangulated meshes, and Langevin dynamics resolves membrane deformation alongside rigid-body particle motion. Adhesive interactions between the particle and membrane surfaces are modeled using two numerical schemes: a vertex-to-vertex mapping and a vertex-to-surface projection. The latter yields more accurate wrapping energetics, as demonstrated by benchmark comparisons against ideal spheres. The dynamic simulations reveal that lower particle-to-vesicle mass ratios facilitate frequent particle reorientation and complete membrane wrapping, while higher mass ratios limit orientation changes and stabilize partial wrapping. To illustrate the framework's versatility, we simulate interactions involving cubical, rod-like, bowl-shaped, and tetrahedral particles with spherical, cigar-shaped, or biconcave vesicles. This generalizable modeling approach enables predictive, cell-scale studies of membrane-particle interactions across a wide range of geometries, with applications in environmental biophysics and nanomedicine.

Title: Enhanced strain rate sensitivity due to platelet linear complexions in Al-Cu
Authors: Pulkit Garg, Daniel S. Gianola, Timothy J. Rupert
Abstract: Platelet array linear complexions have been predicted in Al-Cu, with notable features being dislocation faceting and climb into the precipitate, both of which should impact plasticity. In this study, we examine the strain rate dependence of strength for platelet linear complexions using atomistic simulations, with classical precipitate strengthening through particle cutting and particle bowing used as baseline comparisons. Dislocation segments with edge character must climb down from the platelet structures prior to the commencement of glide, introducing a significant time-dependent barrier to plastic deformation. Consequently, the strain rate sensitivity of strength for the platelet linear complexions system was found to be up to five times higher than that of classical precipitation strengthening mechanisms.

Title: Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity
Authors: Mohit Sharma, Srikanth Sastry, Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility, the rate at which the relaxation time grows with decreasing temperature, is central to unravelling the glass transition. Fragility is often associated with dynamic heterogeneity, implying that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using: Lennard Jones (LJ) and Weeks Chandler Andersen (WCA) systems, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q,p) system, where fragility is varied by changing the potential softness. We define a structural order parameter based on a mean field caging potential and analyse energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic free energy barrier slope correlates with fragility, the microscopic free energy barrier does not show a consistent trend. Instead, it exhibits a strong correlation with a structure dynamics correlation measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble simulations. Interestingly, the two systems showing the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8,5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, large non Gaussian parameters, yet low four point susceptibilities, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation length and mobility contrast. Both systems lie in the enthalpy dominated regime and are close to the spinodal, pointing to mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. Our results reveal that structure dynamics correlation is more closely linked to the contrast in individual particle mobility than to the spatial extent of dynamic correlations that typically scale with fragility.

Title: Real time observation of glass-like carbon formation from SU-8 using X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy
Authors: Simon Astley, Jaspa Stritt, Soumen Mandal, Jerome A. Cuenca, D. Andrew Evans, Oliver A. Williams
Abstract: The structural development and change in elemental composition of SU-8 3005 photoresist into glass-like carbon due to pyrolysis up to 1000~$\degree$C is investigated utilising \textit{in-situ} x-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) under ultra-high vacuum (UHV). XPS spectra were analysed in order to investigate changes to elemental composition and physical structure. Peak asymmetry in the measured C 1s spectra is found to be a clear indicator of a transition in both physical structure and increased electrical conductivity. The \textit{in-situ} XPS measurement of pyrolysis is effective in isolating changes in oxygen composition solely due to the pyrolysis process. Oxygen concentration, C 1s peak asymmetry and C 1s peak positions are strong indicators of semiconducting SU-8 transitioning to conducting glass-like carbon. For SU-8 pyrolysed above temperatures of 500~$\degree$C, a clear development is observed in the material structure and composition towards a carbon rich conducting network indicative of glass-like carbon. UPS spectra were analysed to investigate the changes in secondary electron cut-off (SECO) and valence band maximum (VBM) as the SU-8 layer is heated in UHV. The changes in SECO and VBM correlates well with the XPS data and a zero binding energy state is observed at 1000~$\degree$C.

Title: Defect Engineering the Interacting Many-body SSH Model
Authors: Lin Wang, Thomas Luu, Ulf-G. Meißner
Abstract: The ability to engineer topologically distinct materials opens the possibility of enabling novel phenomena in low-dimensional nano-systems, as well as manufacturing novel quantum devices. One of the simplest examples, the SSH model with both even and odd number of sites, demonstrates the connection between localized edge states and the topology of the system. We show that the SSH model hosts localized spin centers due to the interplay between the localized edge states and the on-site Hubbard interaction. We further show how one can engineer any number of localized spin centers within the chain by careful addition of defects. These spin centers are paired in spin-singlet or spin-triplet channels within each block separated by the defects, and together they construct an array of spin singlet and/or triplet qubits. As this system is realizable experimentally, our findings describe a novel way for manipulating and engineering spin qubits and therefore provide a platform for performing many-body quantum simulations on spin excitations like magnons and triplons.

Title: Type-II Antiferroelectricity
Authors: Yang Wang, Chaoxi Cui, Yilin Han, Tingli He, Weikang Wu, Run-Wu Zhang, Zhi-Ming Yu, Shengyuan A. Yang, Yugui Yao
Abstract: Antiferroelectricity (AFE) is a fundamental concept in physics and materials science. Conventional AFEs have the picture of alternating local electric dipoles defined in real space. Here, we discover a new class of AFEs, termed type-II AFEs, which possess opposite polarizations defined in momentum space across a pair of symmetry decoupled subspaces. Unlike conventional AFEs, the order parameter of type-II AFEs is rigorously formulated through Berry-phase theory and can be quantitatively extracted from the electronic band structure. Focusing on a subclass of type-II AFEs that preserve spin-rotation symmetry, we establish the relevant symmetry constraints and identify all compatible spin point groups. Remarkably, we find that type-II AFE order intrinsically coexists with antiferromagnetism, revealing a robust form of magnetoelectric coupling. We construct an altermagnetic model and identify several concrete antiferromagnetic/altermagnetic materials, such as FeS, Cr2O3, MgMnO3, monolayer MoICl2 and bilayer CrI3, that exhibit this novel ordering. Furthermore, we uncover unique physical phenomena associated with type-II spin-AFE systems, including spin current generation upon AFE switching and localized spin polarization at boundaries and domain walls. Our findings reveal a previously hidden class of quantum materials with intertwined ferroic orders, offering exciting opportunities for both fundamental exploration and technological applications.

Title: Readout of multi-level quantum geometry from electronic transport
Authors: Raffael L. Klees, Mónica Benito
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of a quantum system in a given parameter space captures both the geometry of the state manifold and the topology of the system. While the local QGT elements have been successfully measured in various platforms, the challenge of detecting them in electronic transport systems - such as tunnel or molecular junctions - has yet to be resolved. To fill this gap, we propose a measurement protocol based on weak and resonant parameter modulations, and theoretically demonstrate how the local QGT in such systems can be directly probed from changes of the tunnel conductance. This approach enables the measurement of both geometrical and topological features of quantum states in a broad class of transport-based quantum systems.

Title: Realization and characterization of an all-bands-flat electrical lattice
Authors: Noah Lape, Simon Diubenkov, L.Q. English, P.G. Kevrekidis, Alexei Andreanov, Yeongjun Kim, Sergej Flach
Abstract: We construct an electrical all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice and experimentally generate compact localized states (CLSs) therein. The lattice is a diamond (rhombic) chain and implemented as a network of capacitors and inductors, as well as voltage inverters (using operational amplifiers) in order to introduce a \(\pi\)-phase flux within each diamond. The network's normal modes split into three flat bands, and the corresponding CLSs can be excited in isolation via a two-node driving at the flat band frequencies. We also examine the role of the lattice edges and their interaction with the CLSs. Finally, we compare the experimental results to tight-binding predictions and obtain very good agreement. This analysis paves the way for further experimental implementations of ABF systems in electric networks, especially with an eye towards exploring their interplay with nonlinearity.

Title: Disordered origins, deterministic outcomes: How the architecture of elastic networks imprints relaxed structure and mechanics
Authors: Stefanie Heyden, Mohit Pundir, Eric R. Dufresne, David S. Kammer
Abstract: This work targets the influence of disorder on the relaxed structure and macroscopic mechanical properties of elastic networks. We construct network classes of different types of disorder (length, topology and stiffness), which are subsequently equilibrated in a finite kinematics setting. Relaxed network structures are distinct among network classes, which opens the path towards exploiting easily accessible experimental measures as a way of inferring further microstructural details.

Title: Room temperature giant magnetoresistance detection of spin hall nano-oscillator dynamics in synthetic antiferromagnetic Spin-Valve
Authors: Chunhao Li, Xiaotian Zhao, Wenlong Cai, Long Liu, Wei Liu, Zhidong Zhang
Abstract: Conventional spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) face fundamental power limitations due to the low anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR < 0.3%) of ferromagnetic layers. To address this, we developed a synthetic antiferromagnetic spin-valve (SAF-SV) heterostructure [Ta/NiFe/Ru/NiFe/Cu/NiFe/Hf/Pt] that enables efficient giant magnetoresistance (GMR)-based detection of SHNO dynamics at room temperature. The NiFe/Ru/NiFe SAF reference layer, operating in the spin-flop state, couples with the NiFe free layer through a Cu spacer to achieve a remarkable GMR ratio of 0.568% - exhibiting complete independence of magnetic field/current orientation. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) verifies that the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth of the free layer can be effectively modulated by dc current through the Pt heavy metal layer, while maintaining decoupled dynamics from the SAF layer. Thermal management via high-thermal-conductivity SiC substrates and AlN capping layers successfully mitigates current-shunting-induced Joule heating. Notably, stable auto-oscillation peaks are observed at 0.82 mA bias current, with oscillation frequency tunable by external magnetic field and potential dual-mode behavior at low fields. This work establishes a new paradigm for room-temperature, high-power spintronic oscillators, offering significant potential for neuromorphic computing and coherent RF communication applications.

Title: Cavity Control of Topological Qubits: Fusion Rule, Anyon Braiding, and Majorana-Schrödinger Cat States
Authors: Luis Quiroga, Fernando J. Gómez-Ruiz, Ivan A. Bocanegra-Garay, Ferney J. Rodríguez, Carlos Tejedor
Abstract: We investigate the effects of coupling a local electromagnetic cavity to a segment of a topological Kitaev chain (KC), with particular emphasis on the interplay between photons and Majorana zero modes (MZMs). In addition to the well-known {\it scissor effect}-which effectively partitions the chain and isolates free MZMs in the bulk-we provide evidence of non-trivial fusion rules and braiding operations, hallmark signatures of non-Abelian anyons, enabled by spatially selective ultrastrong KC-cavity coupling. We propose that these distinctive MZM properties can be experimentally probed via fermionic parity measurements and photon-induced Berry phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the so-called sweet-spot regime, the coupled system can be mapped onto a Rabi-like model with a homodyne-rotated quadrature, offering a simplified yet powerful theoretical description. Exploiting the symmetry of fermionic modes within a two-site cavity configuration, we also show the feasibility of generating hybrid MZM-polariton Schrödinger cat states. Our findings offer a novel approach to manipulating topological quantum matter through local light-matter interactions and provide theoretical tools for future experimental realizations in platforms such as quantum materials or superconducting circuits.

Title: Physics-informed renormalisation group flows
Authors: Friederike Ihssen, Jan M. Pawlowski
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated systems offers some of the most intriguing physics challenges such as competing orders or the emergence of dynamical composite degrees of freedom. Often, the resolution of these physics challenges is computationally hard, but can be simplified enormously by a formulation in terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom and within an expansion about the physical ground state. Importantly, such a formulation does not only reduce or minimise the computational challenges, it also facilitates the access to the physics mechanisms at play. The tasks of finding the dynamical degrees of freedom and the physical ground state can be systematically addressed within the functional renormalisation group approach with flowing fields which accommodates both, emergent composites as well as the physical ground state. In the present work we use this approach to set up physics-informed renormalisation group flows (PIRG flows): Scale-dependent coordinate transformations in field space induce emergent composites, and the respective flows for the effective action generate a large set of target actions, formulated in these emergent composite fields. This novel perspective on RG flows bears a great potential both for conceptual as well as computational applications: to begin with, PIRG flows allow for a systematic search of the dynamical degrees of freedom and the respective ground state that leads to the most rapid convergence of expansion schemes, thus minimising the computational effort. Secondly, the resolution of the remaining computational tasks within a given expansion scheme can be further reduced by optimising the physics content within a given approximation. Thirdly, the maximal variability of PIRG flows can be used to reduce the analytic and numerical effort of solving the flows within a given approximation.

Title: High-Q cavity coupled to a high permittivity dielectric resonator for sensing applications
Authors: Shahnam Gorgi Zadeh, Alberto Ghirri, Sergio Pagano, Simone Tocci, Claudio Gatti, Antonio Cassinese
Abstract: The use of high-quality factor resonators is of undoubted interest for high-precision measurements and for applications in quantum technologies. Novel types of microwave sensors can be realized by coupling a first resonator acting as a stable frequency reference with a second resonator that is sensitive to a particular physical quantity. Here we report on a coupled cavity configuration in which a high $Q$ factor elliptical TESLA-shaped superconducting cavity is coupled with a high permittivity ($\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$) SrTiO$_3$ puck, whose resonant frequency varies as a function of temperature due to the temperature dependence of the permittivity that reaches values higher than 30000 below 1 K. Extensive electromagnetic simulations are used to test different coupling configurations, showing great versatility in tuning the coupling in the weak or strong regime, depending on the puck's position within the cavity. Moreover, for the coupled system, they allow investigation of the dependence of the zero transmission frequency (notch frequency) on changes in permittivity $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, obtaining a maximum value of 2.8 MHz per unit change of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, for $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r} \approx 230$. Finally, we discuss the use of the coupled system as a sensor that operates in different temperature ranges.

Title: Experimentally probing entropy reduction via iterative quantum information transfer
Authors: Toshihiro Yada, Pieter-Jan Stas, Aziza Suleymanzade, Erik N. Knall, Nobuyuki Yoshioka, Takahiro Sagawa, Mikhail D. Lukin
Abstract: Thermodynamic principles governing energy and information are important tools for a deeper understanding and better control of quantum systems. In this work, we experimentally investigate the interplay of the thermodynamic costs and information flow in a quantum system undergoing iterative quantum measurement and feedback. Our study employs a state stabilization protocol involving repeated measurement and feedback on an electronic spin qubit associated with a Silicon-Vacancy center in diamond, which is strongly coupled to a diamond nanocavity. This setup allows us to verify the fundamental laws of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics, including the second law and the fluctuation theorem, both of which incorporate measures of quantum information flow induced by iterative measurement and feedback. We further assess the reducible entropy based on the feedback's causal structure and quantitatively demonstrate the thermodynamic advantages of non-Markovian feedback over Markovian feedback. For that purpose, we extend the theoretical framework of quantum thermodynamics to include the causal structure of the applied feedback protocol. Our work lays the foundation for investigating the entropic and energetic costs of real-time quantum control in various quantum systems.

Title: Photon State Evolution in Arbitrary Time-Varying Media
Authors: Artuur Stevens, Christophe Caloz
Abstract: We introduce the instantaneous eigenstate method to study the evolution of quantum states in media with arbitrary time-varying permittivity and permeability. This method leverages the Heisenberg equation to bypass the Schrödinger equation, which leads to a complicated infinite set of coupled differential equations. Instead, the method allows the computation of the state evolution by solving only two coupled differential equations. Using this approach, we draw general conclusions about photon statistics in time-varying media. Our findings reveal that the maximum probability of generating a single photon pair from vacuum in such media is 25%, while Bell states can be created with a maximum probability of 84%. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spectral profile of emitted photons can be precisely controlled through the temporal profiles of permittivity and permeability. These results provide deeper insights into photon state manipulation in time-varying media. Furthermore, the instantaneous eigenstate method opens new opportunities to study state evolution in other systems where the Heisenberg equation offers a more tractable solution than the Schrödinger equation.

Title: Realization of a doped quantum antiferromagnet with dipolar tunnelings in a Rydberg tweezer array

Abstract: Doping an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly-correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors. To describe the competition between tunneling $t$ of hole dopants and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin interactions $J$, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic $t$-$J$ model, and the direct analog quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought. Here, we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbour (NNN) tunnelings $t'$ and hard-core bosonic holes using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We utilize coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes, to implement a tunable bosonic $t$-$J$-$V$ model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for $|t/J|\ll 1$, and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnelings $t'$ and perturbative pair tunneling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of $t$. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models to a larger class of $t$-$J$ and spin-$1$ models.

Title: Three-dimensional chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for helical motion of microorganisms
Authors: Leon Lettermann, Falko Ziebert, Mirko Singer, Friedrich Frischknecht, Ulrich S. Schwarz (Heidelberg University)
Abstract: Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. One such case are malaria parasites gliding through 3D hydrogels, for which we find that the internal correlation time for the stochastic process generating propulsion is similar to the time taken for one helical turn. Motivated by this experimental finding, here we theoretically analyze the case of finite internal correlation time for microorganisms with helical trajectories as chiral active particles with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. Finally we provide experimental evidence for this prediction for the case of the malaria parasites.

Title: Symmetry Properties of Quantum Dynamical Entropy
Authors: Eric D. Schultz, Keiichiro Furuya, Laimei Nie
Abstract: As quantum analogs of the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, quantum dynamical entropies have emerged as important tools to characterize complex quantum dynamics. In particular, Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) entropy, which quantifies the information production of a coherent quantum system subjected to repeated measurement, has received considerable attention as a potential diagnostic for quantum chaos. Despite this interest, the precise behavior of quantum dynamical entropy in the presence of symmetry has seen little study. In this work, we establish rigorous inequalities of the AFL entropy for arbitrary unitary dynamics (single-particle and many-body) in the presence of various types of symmetry. Our theorems encompass three cases: Abelian symmetry, an anticommuting unitary, and non-Abelian symmetries. We motivate our main results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the role of symmetry in quantum dynamics under measurements, and our framework is easily adaptable for study of symmetry in other probes of quantum chaos.

Title: Diagonal Symmetrization of Neural Network Solvers for the Many-Electron Schrödinger Equation
Authors: Kevin Han Huang, Ni Zhan, Elif Ertekin, Peter Orbanz, Ryan P. Adams
Abstract: Incorporating group symmetries into neural networks has been a cornerstone of success in many AI-for-science applications. Diagonal groups of isometries, which describe the invariance under a simultaneous movement of multiple objects, arise naturally in many-body quantum problems. Despite their importance, diagonal groups have received relatively little attention, as they lack a natural choice of invariant maps except in special cases. We study different ways of incorporating diagonal invariance in neural network ansätze trained via variational Monte Carlo methods, and consider specifically data augmentation, group averaging and canonicalization. We show that, contrary to standard ML setups, in-training symmetrization destabilizes training and can lead to worse performance. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that this unexpected behavior may arise from a unique computational-statistical tradeoff not found in standard ML analyses of symmetrization. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that post hoc averaging is less sensitive to such tradeoffs and emerges as a simple, flexible and effective method for improving neural network solvers.

Title: Solvable Quantum Circuits in Tree+1 Dimensions
Authors: Oliver Breach, Benedikt Placke, Pieter W. Claeys, S.A. Parameswaran
Abstract: We devise tractable models of unitary quantum many-body dynamics on tree graphs, as a first step towards a deeper understanding of dynamics in non-Euclidean spaces. To this end, we first demonstrate how to construct strictly local quantum circuits that preserve the symmetries of trees, such that their dynamical light cones grow isotropically. For trees with coordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then introduce a family of gates for which the dynamics is exactly solvable; these satisfy a set of constraints that we term 'tree-unitarity'. Notably, tree-unitarity reduces to the previously-established notion of dual-unitarity for z = 2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of tree-unitarity is a trade-off between 'maximum butterfly velocity' dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators and the existence of non-vanishing correlation functions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional dual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We connect the existence of (a wide class of) solvable dynamics with non-maximal butterfly velocity directly to a property of the underlying circuit geometry called $\delta$-hyperbolicity, and argue that such dynamics can only arise in non-Euclidean geometries. We give various examples of tree-unitary gates, discuss dynamical correlations, out-of-time-order correlators, and entanglement growth, and show that the kicked Ising model on a tree is a physically-motivated example of maximum-velocity tree-unitary dynamics.

Title: Autophoretic skating along permeable surfaces
Authors: Günther Turk, Rajesh Singh, Howard A. Stone
Abstract: The dynamics of self-propelled colloidal particles are strongly influenced by their environment through hydrodynamic and, in many cases, chemical interactions. We develop a theoretical framework to describe the motion of confined active particles by combining the Lorentz reciprocal theorem with a Galerkin discretisation of surface fields, yielding an equation of motion that efficiently captures self-propulsion without requiring an explicit solution for the bulk fluid flow. Applying this framework, we identify and characterise the long-time behaviours of a Janus particle near rigid, permeable, and fluid-fluid interfaces, revealing distinct motility regimes, including surface-bound skating, stable hovering, and chemo-hydrodynamic reflection. Our results demonstrate how the solute permeability and the viscosity contrast of the surface influence a particle's dynamics, providing valuable insights into experimentally relevant guidance mechanisms for autophoretic particles. The computational efficiency of our method makes it particularly well-suited for systematic parameter sweeps, offering a powerful tool for mapping the phase space of confined active particles and informing high-fidelity numerical simulations.

Title: Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing
Authors: Mario U. Gaimann, Miriam Klopotek
Abstract: Information processing abilities of active matter are studied in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.

Title: A critical note on the sideband peak count-index technique: failure for nonlinear damage characterization of impacted CFRP plates
Authors: Bernd Köhler, Frank Schubert
Abstract: It is widely accepted, that nonlinear elastodynamic methods are superior to linear methods in detecting early stages of material deterioration. A number of recently developed methods are reported to be particularly sensitive to nonlinearities and thus appropriate to indicate early damage. We applied systematically one of the methods, the sideband peak count index (SPC-I), to a series of increasingly damaged carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plates. Our data leads to different conclusions. The SPC-I values are influenced by (usually undocumented) variations in the index calculation procedure, which is not acceptable for a robust method. Moreover, the behavior of the index when the ultrasound amplitude is varied contradicts material nonlinearity as a direct and significant contributor to the index value. To clarify the apparent contradiction of our results with the previously published statements, it is recommended that (a) our data are re-evaluated by independent researchers and (b) the experiments already published are repeated or (if sufficient data is availThe paper has been updated for submission to NDT&this http URL) also re-evaluated.

Title: Phase Transitions between Accuracy Regimes in L2 regularized Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Ibrahim Talha Ersoy, Karoline Wiesner
Abstract: Increasing the L2 regularization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) causes a first-order phase transition into the under-parametrized phase -- the so-called onset-of learning. We explain this transition via the scalar (Ricci) curvature of the error landscape. We predict new transition points as the data complexity is increased and, in accordance with the theory of phase transitions, the existence of hysteresis effects. We confirm both predictions numerically. Our results provide a natural explanation of the recently discovered phenomenon of '\emph{grokking}' as DNN models getting stuck in a local minimum of the error surface, corresponding to a lower accuracy phase. Our work paves the way for new probing methods of the intrinsic structure of DNNs in and beyond the L2 context.

Title: Symmetry properties of pair correlations in heavy deformed nuclei
Authors: G. Palkanoglou, A. Gezerlis
Abstract: Nucleons are known to form pairing correlations with various types of spin-symmetries. Spin-singlet neutron-neutron and proton-proton pairing is abundant in the nuclear chart but spin-triplet and mixed-spin proton-neutron pairing correlations have also been predicted to form at least in the ground states of certain nuclei. A realistic candidate region is that of the lightest Lanthanides where it was recently demonstrated that the nuclear deformation expected to emerge enhances spin-triplet pairing correlations. In this paper we provide the details of the deformed multimodal Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory that lead to this conclusion, as well as the details of the effects identified. We present in detail the response of different pairing correlations to various deformation modes and calculate their signatures in the odd-even staggering of masses. This paper provides a detailed discussion, and some resolutions, on the long-standing question ``what is the effect of nuclear deformation on the various pairing correlations?''

Title: Modelling bulk mechanical effects in a planar cellular monolayer
Authors: Natasha Cowley, Sarah Woolner, Oliver E. Jensen
Abstract: We use a three-dimensional formulation of the cell vertex model to describe the mechanical properties of a confluent planar monolayer of prismatic cells. Treating cell height as a degree of freedom, we reduce the model to a two-dimensional form. We show how bulk effects, associated with cell volume and total surface area, lead to coupling between energy variations arising from changes in cell apical area and apical perimeter, a feature missing from standard implementations of the two-dimensional vertex model. The model identifies five independent mechanisms by which cells can lose in-plane rigidity, relating to variations in total cell surface area, the strength of lateral adhesion, and constrictive forces at the apical cortex. The model distinguishes bulk from in-plane stresses, and identifies two primary measures of cell shear stress. In the rigid regime, the model shows how lateral crowding in a disordered isolated monolayer can lead to cell elongation towards the monolayer centre. We examine loss of in-plane rigidity in a disordered monolayer and connect isolated patches of stiffness that persist during the rigidity transition to the spectrum of a Laplacian matrix. This approach enables bulk mechanical effects in an epithelium to be captured within a two-dimensional framework.

Title: Free Independence and Unitary Design from Random Matrix Product Unitaries
Authors: Neil Dowling, Jacopo De Nardis, Markus Heinrich, Xhek Turkeshi, Silvia Pappalardi
Abstract: The concept of unitary randomness underpins the modern theory of quantum chaos and fundamental tasks in quantum information. In one research direction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the non-commutative generalization of statistical independence. In a distinct setting, approximate unitary designs look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble, an efficient unitary design. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We further compute the frame potential of the RMPU ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value also with only polynomial deviations, indicating that freeness is reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand, to reproduce freeness for traceless observables, volume-law operator entanglement is required. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage while shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.

Title: A Field-Theoretical Paradigm via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: I. Generalized Mode Theory
Authors: Jaehyeok Jin, Yining Han, Gregory A. Voth
Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale. Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques. By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions into the field-theoretic description.
