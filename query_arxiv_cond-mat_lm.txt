Title: Hyperelastic stability landscape: A check for HILL stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelasticity depending on material parameters
Authors: Herbert Baaser
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a uniform and standardized approach for analytically verifying the stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelastic material models. Here, we address stability as fulfillment of the Hill's condition - i.e. the positive definiteness of the material modulus in the Kirchhoff stress - log-strain relation. For incompressible material behavior, all mathematically and mechanically possible deformations lie within a range bounded, on the one hand, by uniaxial states and, on the other hand, by biaxial states; shear {deformation} states lie in between. This becomes particularly clear when the possible states are represented in the invariant plane. This very representation is now also used to visualize the regions of unstable material behavior depending on the selected strain energy function and the respective data set of material parameters. This demonstrates how, for some constellations of energy functions, with appropriate selection or calibration of parameters, stable and unstable regions can be observed. If such cases occur, it is no longer legitimate to use them to initiate, for example, finite element simulations. This is particularly striking when, for example, a fit appears stable in uniaxial tension, but the same parameter set for shear states results in unstable behavior without this being specifically investigated. The presented approach can reveal simple indicators for this.

Title: Non-invertible defects in generalized Ising models via strange correlator
Authors: Aswin Parayil Mana, Yaman Sanghavi
Abstract: Defects associated with non-invertible symmetries have attracted significant attention in recent years. Among them, Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality defects have been investigated in both classical statistical systems and quantum Hamiltonian models. Aasen et al. analyzed duality defects in the 2D Ising model and in statistical models built from fusion categories, while Koide et al. later constructed a duality defect in 4D lattice gauge theory. In this work, we extend these developments by providing a systematic construction of KW duality defects/KW defects for a broad class of models formulated within the chain complex framework. Our construction employs the strange correlator, an overlap between a topologically ordered state and a product state, to realize these KW defects.

Title: Lessons from $α$-RuCl3 for pursuing quantum spin liquid physics in atomically thin materials

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids can arise from Kitaev magnetic interactions, and exhibit fractionalized excitations with the potential for a topological form of quantum computation. This review surveys recent experimental and theoretical progress on the pursuit of phenomena related to Kitaev magnetism in layered and exfoliatable materials, which offer numerous opportunities to apply powerful techniques from the field of atomically thin materials. We primarily focus on the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl3, which exhibits Kitaev couplings and is readily exfoliated to single- or few-layer sheets, and thus serves as a test bed for developing probes of Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials and devices. We introduce the Kitaev model and how it is realized in $\alpha$-RuCl3 and other material candidates; and cover $\alpha$-RuCl3 synthesis and fabrication into van der Waals heterostructure devices. A key discovery is a work-function-mediated charge transfer that heavily dopes both the $\alpha$-RuCl3 and proximate materials, and can enhance Kitaev interactions by up to 50%. We further discuss a wide range of recent results in electronic transport and optical and tunneling spectroscopies of $\alpha$-RuCl3 devices. The experimental techniques and theoretical insights developed for $\alpha$-RuCl3 establish a framework for discovering and engineering superior two-dimensional Kitaev materials that may ultimately realize elusive quantum spin liquid phases.

Title: Tunable dynamics of flexible magnetic microcrosses: synchronous rotation, breathing and out-of-plane arm overtaking
Authors: Joseph Tavacoli, Andris P. Stikuts, Mihir Dass, Tim Liedl, Pietro Tierno
Abstract: We combine colloidal self-assembly and soft-lithography techniques to realize flexible magnetic microcrosses that can be manipulated via external, time dependent magnetic fields. The crosses are characterized by a central domain connected via four flexible arms. When subjected to an in-plane, rotating magnetic field, the crosses transit from a synchronous to an asynchronous spinning motion where their average rotation decreases with the driving frequency. In the asynchronous regime and at low field amplitudes, the crosses display a breathing mode, characterized by relative oscillations between the arms, while remaining localized in the two dimensional plane. In contrast, for high field amplitudes, we observe an arm overtaking regime where two opposite filaments surpass the remaining ones forcing the cross to perform a three-dimensional gyroscopic-like rotation. Using slender body theory and balancing the effect of magnetic and elastic interactions, we recover the experimental findings and show that the overtaking regime occurs due to different arm magnetizations. Our engineered microscopic colloidal rotors characterized by multiple flexible filaments may find potential applications for precise lab-on-a-chip operations or as stirrers dispersed within microfluidic or biological channels.

Title: Universal negative magnetoresistance in antiferromagnetic metals caused by symmetry breaking of electron wave functions
Authors: Pavel D. Grigoriev, Nikita S. Pavlov, Igor A. Nekrasov, Igor R. Shein, Andrey V. Sadakov, Oleg A. Sobolevskiy, Evgeny Maltsev, Vladimir M. Pudalov
Abstract: Layered van der Waals crystals of topologically non-trivial and trivial semimetals with antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of magnetic sublattice are known to exhibit a negative magnetoresistance that is well correlated with AFM magnetization changes in a magnetic field. This effect is reported in several experimental studies with EuFe2As2, EuSn2As2, EuSn2P2, etc., where the resistance decreases quadratically with field by about 5% up to the spin-polarization field. Although this effect is well documented experimentally, its theoretical explanation is missing up to date. Here, we propose a theoretical mechanism describing the observed magnetoresistance that is inherent in AFM metals and is based on violation the binary T2 symmetry. It is almost isotropic to the field and current directions, contrary to the known mechanisms such as giant magnetoresistance and chiral anomaly. The proposed intrinsic mechanism of magnetoresistance is strong in a wide class of the layered AFM-ordered semimetals. The theoretically calculated magnetoresistance is qualitatively consistent with experimental data for crystals of various composition.

Title: Effect of substrate miscut angle on critical thickness, structural and electronic properties of MBE-grown NbN films on c-plane sapphire
Authors: Anand Ithepalli, Saumya Vashishtha, Naomi Pieczulewski, Qiao Liu, Amit Rohan Rajapurohita, Matthew Barone, Darrell Schlom, David A. Muller, Huili Grace Xing, Debdeep Jena
Abstract: We report the structural and electronic properties of niobium nitride (NbN) thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on c-plane sapphire with miscut angles of $0.5^\text{o}$, $2^\text{o}$, $4^\text{o}$, and $10^\text{o}$ towards m-axis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans reveal that the full width at half maximum of the rocking curves around the 1 1 1 reflection of these NbN films decreases with increasing miscut. Starting from 76 arcsecs on $0.5^\text{o}$ miscut, the FWHM reduces to almost 20 arcsecs on $10^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire indicating improved structural quality. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images indicate that NbN on c-sapphire has around 10 nm critical thickness, irrespective of the substrate miscut, above which it turns columnar. The improved structural property is correlated with a marginal increment in superconducting transition temperature $T_\text{c}$ from 12.1 K for NbN on $0.5^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire to 12.5 K for NbN on $10^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire.

Title: Screw-dislocation-engineered quantum dot: geometry-tunable nonlinear optics, orbital qubit addressability, and torsion metrology
Authors: Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: We study a single electron confined in a uniform-torsion medium, a continuum model of a screw dislocation density, in a perpendicular magnetic field, and in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm flux. Torsion alone produces radial confinement without any \textit{ad hoc} potential, while the Aharonov--Bohm phase breaks the usual $m\leftrightarrow -m$ symmetry. From the exact spectrum and wave functions, we find: (i) a torsion-controlled optical transition whose energy blue-shifts from $\sim 6.8$ to $\sim 15.5$~meV and whose saturation intensity varies by an order of magnitude, enabling geometry-programmable optical switching; (ii) an Aharonov--Bohm-tunable ``angular pseudospin'' formed by the $m=\pm1$ states, with flux-controlled level splitting and asymmetric oscillator strengths that allow selective optical addressability; and (iii) an approximately linear torsion dependence of the transition energy that enables nanoscale torsion metrology with an estimated resolution of $\sim 10^{5}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. In this context, ``torsion'' refers to the experimentally relevant continuum limit of a uniform density of parallel screw dislocations, i.e., a crystal with finite torsion but vanishing curvature, which can, in practice, be engineered and probed in twisted nanowires and strained semiconductor heterostructures. We also show how torsion provides \textit{in situ} control of emitter--cavity detuning and light--matter coupling in cavity QED, in direct analogy with strain tuning of semiconductor quantum dots in nanocavities, but here arising from a purely geometric/topological parameter.

Title: Dynamical behavior of compound vesicles in wall-bounded shear flow
Authors: A. Lamura
Abstract: We report a numerical study addressing the dynamics of compound vesicles confined in a channel under shear flow. The system comprises a smaller vesicle embedded within a larger one and can be used to mimic, for example, leukocytes or nucleate cells. A two-dimensional model, which combines molecular dynamics and mesoscopic hydrodynamics including thermal fluctuations, is adopted to perform an extended investigation. We are able to vary independently the swelling degree and the relative size of vesicles, the viscosities of fluids internal and external to vesicles, and the Capillary number, so to observe a rich dynamical phenomenology which goes well beyond what observed for single vesicles, matching quantitatively with experimental findings. Tank-treading, tumbling, and trembling motions are enriched by dynamical states where inner and outer vesicles can perform different motions. We show that thermal fluctuations are crucial during trembling and swinging dynamics, as observed in experiments. Undulating motion of the external vesicle, characterized by periodic oscillation of the inclination and buckling of the membrane, is observed at high filling fractions. This latter state exhibits features that are shown to depend on the relative size, the swelling degree of both vesicles as well as on thermal noise lacking in previous analytical and numerical studies.

Title: Spin-singlet dimer phase in a frustrated square lattice under a magnetic field
Authors: L. M. Ramos, M. Schmidt, F. M. Zimmer
Abstract: We investigated the isotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on an anisotropic square lattice with competing exchange interactions, motivated by the unconventional magnetic behavior observed in the verdazyl-based compound (o-MePy-V)PF6. Using a cluster mean-field approach, we explore a field-induced phase stabilized by the interplay between frustration and quantum fluctuations, focusing on the role of exchange interactions. We identify: (i) the formation of spin singlet pairs, signaled by enhanced spin-spin correlations in specific field regimes; and (ii) a one-half magnetization plateau, emerging from a subtle balance between competing exchange couplings and field-enhanced quantum fluctuations. Our results reveal that an enhancement of frustration, achieved by tuning small variations in the spatially anisotropic exchange interactions of the compound (o-MePy-V)PF6, can stabilize a field-induced quantum phase where ferromagnetism coexists with antiferromagnetic dimers. Our results provide microscopic insight into the mechanisms driving these nontrivial phases and offer theoretical support for interpreting experimental observations in this class of low-dimensional quantum magnets.

Title: Twin-boundary-induced nonrelativistic spin splitting
Authors: Kristoffer Eggestad, Marc Vila, Sverre M. Selbach, Sinéad M. Griffin
Abstract: Nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS) in compensated magnetic materials is drawing considerable attention due to its potential impact in next-generation spintronic devices. While NRSS is typically restricted to materials with particular symmetry constraints, here we demonstrate, using density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding transport calculations, that twin boundaries can induce NRSS in magnetic systems where it is otherwise forbidden. We focus on two representative material systems: the tetragonal perovskite oxide BiCoO$_3$ with $90^{\circ}$ ferroelastic domain walls, and the rhombohedral layered delafossite-type oxide CoO$_2$, supporting $71^{\circ}$, $109^{\circ}$, and $135^{\circ}$ twin boundaries. Our results reveal that, if these boundaries coexist with ferromagnetic domain walls, they consistently produce NRSS similar to that of d-wave altermagnets, with nodal surfaces dictated by the underlying symmetry of the supercell containing the twin boundary. Tight-binding models further elucidate how the NRSS and derived transport properties scale with domain size and density. Our results put forward twin boundary engineering as a versatile route to realize and control spin splitting in a broader class of materials.

Title: Universal regimes of strong turbulence in the multi-component Gross-Pitaevskii model
Authors: Vladimir Rosenhaus, Natalia Vladimirova, Gregory Falkovich
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) model, also known as the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, is arguably the most universal model in classical and quantum physics, describing spectrally narrow or long-wavelength distributions of interacting waves or particles. Modern applications -- from oceanic and atmospheric flows to photonics and cold atoms -- predominantly involve states that are far from equilibrium, culminating in the regime of fully developed turbulence. To date, a consistent theoretical description of such states has only existed for weakly interacting quasiparticles. Here we present a theory of strong turbulence in the two-dimensional $N$-component Gross-Pitaevskii model for both repulsive and attractive interactions, corresponding to the defocusing and focusing cases, respectively. In the focusing case, we show that attraction is enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to a critical-balance state independent of the pumping level. In the defocusing case, repulsion is suppressed by collective effects, giving rise to another type of universality in strong turbulence -- independence from the bare coupling constant. The theory is confirmed by analytical results in the many-component limit and by direct numerical simulations of the single-component GP model.

Title: Pressure-Induced B1 to B2 Phase Transition in CeN Studied by ab initio Correlation Matrix Renormalization Theory Calculations
Authors: Jianhua Zhang, Jun Liu, Yongxin Yao, Kai-Ming Ho, Cai-Zhuang Wang
Abstract: We apply correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) to cerium nitride (CeN) under pressure. For B1 (NaCl-type) phase, CMRT gives an equation of state consistent with ambient pressure experiments. It produces electronic density-of-state (DOS) characterized by a sharp 4f quasi-particle resonance peak pinned at the Fermi level and two subbands formed by strong hybridization between the localized Ce-4f electrons and the itinerant Ce-5d and N-2p electrons below the Fermi level, consistent with XPS experiments. Upon compression, CMRT predicts a first-order B1 to B2 (CsCl-type) transition with ~11% volume collapse. Across the transition, the 4f spectral weight broadens, the 4f orbital occupancy increases, and the hybridization with conduction states enhances, signaling a crossover from partially localized to more itinerant 4f behavior. These features are in excellent agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that CMRT provides a parameter-free description and prediction of correlation-driven structural and electronic transitions in rare-earth compounds.

Title: Dynamics of entanglement asymmetry for space-inversion symmetry of free fermions on honeycomb lattices
Authors: Ryogo Hara, Shimpei Endo, Shion Yamashika
Abstract: We study the entanglement asymmetry for the space-inversion symmetry of free fermions on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with an on-site energy imbalance between the two sublattices. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of a local subsystem exhibits nonanalytic dependence on the energy imbalance, due to the presence of Dirac points in the Brillouin zone. We also study the quench dynamics from the ground state into the inversion-symmetric point at which the energy imbalance vanishes. Under certain conditions on the subsystem geometry, the entanglement asymmetry relaxes to a finite value after the quench, revealing that the inversion-symmetry breaking in the initial ground state can persist even under the symmetric dynamics. We attribute the absence of symmetry restoration to the presence of a flat energy dispersion (flat band) in a specific direction.

Title: Topological transition induced by selective random defects on a honeycomb lattice
Authors: Sogen Ikegami, Kiyu Fukui, Shun Okumura, Yasuyuki Kato, Yukitoshi Motome
Abstract: We investigate how the spectral and topological properties of electron systems evolve on a lattice that interpolates between the honeycomb and its 1/6-depleted structures through the introduction of selective random defects. We find that in certain parameter regimes, the topological properties of the two lattice systems are smoothly connected, whereas in other regimes, selective random defects induce a topological transition. Analysis based on an effective model reveals that the effect of selective random defects can be understood as a modulation of hopping amplitudes. Our results highlight the potential for designing and controlling the spectral and even topological properties of electronic systems across a wide range of material platforms.

Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional magnetic materials has provided an ideal platform for exploring physical phenomena in the two-dimensional limit. However, intrinsic two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials have been rarely reported, limiting systematic studies of their electronic properties. The discovery of novel intrinsic two-dimensional antiferromagnets and the development of robust synthesis strategies, therefore, remain significant challenges. Here, we report the chemical vapor deposition synthesis of CrOCl monolayer films and nanosheets that exhibit excellent air stability. The CrOCl morphology is tunable, ranging from two-dimensional nanosheets to three-dimensional flower-like structures, with lateral sizes ranging from several microns to continuous monolayer films. Structural characterization confirms the materials composition and high crystalline quality. Furthermore, magnetic measurements, supported by theoretical calculations, reveal a Néel temperature for CrOCl of ~14 K. This work provides a reliable route for preparing two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials.

Title: Mass-imbalance effect on the cluster formation in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with coexistent $s$- and $p$-wave interactions
Authors: Yixin Guo
Abstract: We consider the mass-imbalance effect on the clustering in a one-dimensional two-component Fermi gas with coexistent even- and odd-wave interactions resulting in different configurations of clustering phases. We obtain the solutions of both stable two- and three-body cluster states with different mass ratios and configurations by solving the corresponding variational equations. We feature out phase diagrams consisting of the $s$- and $p$-wave pairing phases, and tripling phase with different configurations, in a plane of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths. As for the in-vacuum case, the three-body clustering is always the lowest-lying phase. While for the in-medium case, the Cooper tripling phase dominates over the pairing phases when both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions are moderately strong. There is also a competition between different clustering configurations of three-body clustering.

Title: Strongly Electric Field Dependent Conductivity in Quantum Dot Solids
Authors: Morteza Shokrani, Xinlu Wu, Ebbo Krahmer, Martijn Kemerink
Abstract: Charge transport in QD solids is typically understood as thermally activated tunneling or hopping between states that are localized on individual QDs. Here, we show that the slow relaxation that is associated with the disorder-broadened density of (localized) states leads to a strong electric field F dependence of the charge carrier mobility. We interpret the results in terms of an increased effective electronic temperature T_eff that exceeds that of the lattice. We use a heat balance model to derive an analytical expression for T_eff (F) that is similar to, and puts a physical basis under the phenomenological expression proposed by Marianer and Shklovskii [Phys. Rev. B 46, 13100 (1992)]. We apply this model to analyze the field- and temperature-dependent conductivity in ZnO QDs with varying ligand length and depletion shell thickness and find (effective) localization lengths ranging from 2 to 5 nm. Both experimental and analytical results compare favorably to numerical simulations by kinetic Monte Carlo. Due to the large value of the effective localization length, the field dependence already becomes relevant at modest fields around 1-10 V/micron, that are typical for operational conditions of photovoltaic and light emitting devices based on quantum dot solids.

Title: Integrating electronic structure into generative modeling of inorganic materials
Authors: Junkil Park, Junyoung Choi, Yousung Jung
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have introduced a new paradigm for the inverse design of inorganic materials, enabling the discovery of new crystalline structures with desired properties. However, existing generative models focus solely on structural aspects of materials during generation, while overlooking the underlying electronic behavior that fundamentally governs materials' stability and functionality. In this work, we present ChargeDIFF, the first generative model for inorganic materials that explicitly incorporates electronic structure into the generation process. Specifically, ChargeDIFF leverages charge density, a direct spatial representation of a material's electronic structure, as an additional modality for generation. ChargeDIFF demonstrates exceptional performance in both unconditional and conditional generation tasks compared to baseline models, with ablation studies revealing that this improvement is directly due to its ability to capture the material's electronic structure during generation. Moreover, the ability to control charge density during generation allows ChargeDIFF to introduce a novel inverse design method based on three-dimensional charge density, illustrating the potential to generate lithium-ion battery cathode materials with desired ion migration pathways, as validated by physics-based simulations. By highlighting the importance of accounting for electronic characteristics during material generation, ChargeDIFF offers new possibilities in the generative design of stable and functional materials.

Title: Current-driven switching of topological spin chirality in a van der Waals antiferromagnet
Authors: Kai-Xuan Zhang, Seungbok Lee, Woonghee Cho, Je-Geun Park
Abstract: Magnetic topology is central to modern quantum magnet, where spin chirality governs exotic spin winding, real-space Berry phase, and topological Hall effect. A key unresolved challenge is how to electrically switch topological spin chirality and its associated gauge flux, an essential requirement for manipulating its topological quantum properties. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the concept of current-switching spin chirality. We identify the new vdW antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2 as an ideal platform, hosting a topological 3Q state with a minimum chirality cell, an ultrahigh skyrmion density, a non-centrosymmetric geometry, and a strong Berry curvature. Using a Co1/3TaS2/Pt heterostructure, we achieve the nonvolatile and reversible switching by current via current-driven spin-orbit torque based on Pts spin Hall effect. Beyond this conventional route, we further discover intrinsic self-torque-induced chirality switching within Co1/3TaS2, driven purely by current, without a magnetic field, and with high energy efficiency. These complementary pathways establish a unified framework for electrically creating and controlling spin chirality. Our results demonstrate a practical route toward chiral spintronics. They can be naturally generalised to other skyrmion systems, offering new opportunities in symmetry control, topological manipulation, and spin-chirality-based quantum functionalities.

Title: Heat Capacity of Thermally Reduced Graphene Oxide: Compaction and Thermal Annealing Effects

Romantsova (1 and 2), D. Szewczyk (2) ((1) B. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering, NAS of Ukraine, Ukraine, (2) Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research PAS, Poland)
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the low-temperature heat capacity of thermally reduced graphene oxide (trGO) as a function of compaction pressure and annealing temperature. Graphene oxide was synthesized using a modified Hummers method and subsequently thermally reduced at 300\,°C, 500\,°C, and 700\,°C under vacuum to systematically vary the oxygen content and structural ordering. The specific heat data in the 2--300\,K range reveal that the thermal response is governed by phonons, including contributions from a Schottky-type anomaly, a defect-related linear term, a Debye term, and a dispersive term with a negative coefficient associated with out-of-plane flexural (ZA) phonons. Increasing compaction pressure alters interlayer coupling and leads to non-monotonic changes in heat capacity, while higher annealing temperatures enhance graphitization, reduce disorder, and modify phonon dispersion. The absence of a boson peak -- similar to that observed in carbon nanotubes -- supports the dominance of two-dimensional vibrational modes. These findings elucidate the relationship between dimensionality, structural disorder, and processing parameters in shaping the phonon dynamics of trGO, providing guidance for tailoring its thermal behavior in advanced carbon-based functional materials.

Title: Stability of current-carrying states in hard-core bosons with long-range hopping on a square lattice
Authors: Yoshihiro Yabuuchi, Ippei Danshita
Abstract: We investigate the stability of current-carrying states with quasi-momentum $K$ in the Bose-condensed phase of the hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice, where particles transfer between two sites separated by distance $r$ with hopping amplitude decaying algebraically with $r$ as $\propto r^{-\alpha}$. Using a mean-field theory, we analyze the excitation spectrum and determine the critical quasi-momenta associated with Landau and dynamical instabilities. We find that the long-range hopping suppresses the critical quasi-momenta and makes them vanish at $\alpha=3$. Near $\alpha=3$, we show that the critical quasi-momentum $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the dynamical instability exhibits the scaling behavior $K_\mathrm{c} \propto \Delta^{1+\Delta}$ with $\Delta=\alpha-3$, where the scaling exponent explicitly depends on $\Delta$, as a consequence of the long-range nature of the hopping.

Title: Molecular dynamics simulations reveal internal tension in native state collagen fibrils
Authors: Konstantinos Steiakakis, Alan Pichard, Maxime Vassaux
Abstract: Collagen fibrils are the building block of many biological tissues, which viability depend on the fibrils properties. Altered properties of collagen fibrils are central to the appearance of many diseases, and physiological or native properties must be reproduced for tissue engineering. Yet, the self-assembly, the structure, and therefore the properties of collagen fibrils remain elusive. One main reason is the extreme sensitivity of the fibrils to their environmental conditions, and in particular hydration which is only loosely bound by experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanics are an integral part of the self-assembly process and may result in internal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions. Here, we propose to investigate internal stresses in collagen fibrils by means of molecular dynamics simulations of the collagen microfibril model. Our simulations reveal the quantitative evolution of internal stresses in collagen fibrils with hydration. We establish a value of native hydration of collagen fibrils at 0.78 g/g based on an absence of cross-sectional stresses. In turn, we determine a quantitative estimate of internal longitudinal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions of 210 MPa. We find that internal longitudinal stresses are caused by an over-extended protein backbone rather than partial hydration, which appears remnant of the local forces driving collagen self-assembly. We also demonstrate the consequences of internal longitudinal stresses on the mechanical properties of collagen fibrils, which the absence of induces more than a 20% decrease in the Young's modulus. Overall, our findings provide insights into the native structure and properties of collagen fibrils. More than ever, collagen fibrils appear to be assembled via an out-of-equilibrium process key for the synthesis of viable tissues.

Title: Two-component anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in anisotropic Fe$_{4-x}$Ge$_x$N thin films
Authors: R.K. Paul, J. Vít, P. Levinský, J. Hejtmánek, O. Kaman, M. Pashchenko, L. Kubíčková, K. Ahn, M. Jarošová, J. More Chevalier, S. Cichoň, T. Kmječ, J. Kohout, M. Hans, S. Mráz, J.M. Schneider, E. Adabifiroozjaei, L. Molina-Luna, O. Gutfleisch, I. Dirba, K. Knížek
Abstract: A series of thin films Fe$_{4-x}$Ge$_x$N (x=0-1) was fabricated onto MgO substrates by magnetron sputtering with the aim of studying the possible enhancement of the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), envisaged based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The Nernst and Hall effects of the series were systematically analyzed, complemented with resistivity, magnetic, electron microscopy and Mössbauer experiments, and DFT calculations including elastic properties. The Fe$_4$N phase crystallizes in the cubic symmetry with Pm3m space group, whereas a small tetragonal distortion is realized in for x>0.35. From the comparison of the experimental isomer shift with DFT calculations, we conclude that Ge occupies the 4b site in the tetragonal I4/mcm tructure. Ferromagnetic T$_C$ decreases rapidly from 750 K for x=0 to 100 K for x=1. The tetragonal samples with x=0.8 and 1 display two-component behavior in the Hall and Nernst effects hysteresis loops, which can be analyzed as a sum of positive and negative loops with different saturation fields. This unusual behavior is a product of a combination of several factors. (1) Co-existence of two different crystallographic orientations in the tetragonal thin film, namely with the majority of c-axis and minority of a-axis normal to the film surface. (2) Opposite sign of the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects for the direction of magnetization along the a and c-axis revealed by DFT calculation. (3) The magnetocrystalline anisotropy characterized by an easy ab-plane, which is responsible for the different saturation fields for a and c-axis. The maximum ANE was determined to be 0.9 $\mu$V/K for x=0 at room temperature, and -0.85 $\mu$V/K for x=1 at T=50 K. The rapid increase of ANE of Fe$_3$GeN from low temperatures indicates that, were it not for its low T$_C$, it could surpass ANE of Fe$_4$N.

Title: Full Shapiro spectroscopy of current-phase relationships
Authors: Maxim Tjøtta, Devashish Shah, Kanishk Modi, Marco Valentini, Rubén Seoane Souto, Georgios Katsaros, Jeroen Danon
Abstract: Extracting the current-phase relationship (CPR) of a single superconducting junction is challenging in practice and traditionally involves embedding the junction in a larger superconducting circuit containing SQUIDs and/or resonators. Applying ac driving to the junction has proven to be a viable and less invasive way to extract information about the few lowest harmonics of the CPR, by locating the integer and fractional Shapiro steps in the IV-curve of the driven junction. Here, we present an alternative driving-based method that allows to extract the full harmonic content of a CPR in a non-invasive way, by fitting the measured critical currents of the driven junction as a function of driving power. We test our method, both using numerical simulations and in experiments, and we show that it works very accurately, also in the presence of noise.

Title: Numerical analysis of heat transport in classical one-dimensional systems
Authors: Antonio Politi
Abstract: Numerical studies of some unidimensional systems provide evidence of finite thermal conductivity, where theory predicts a divergence with the system size. Some models are here reviewed under the working hypothesis that the energy flux across a nonequilibrium stationary state may be the sum of two contributions: the former responsible for normal conductivity, the latter accounting for the anomalous component. I conclude that in the thermodynamic limit, the diverging component is indeed present, although the crossover to a regime dominated by the anomalous component may occur at extremely long system sizes. Finally, I study a variant of the ding-a-ling model, previously claimed to satisfy Fourier law, showing that it too exhibits a diverging conductivity in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Hybrid ab initio and empirical machine learning models for the potential energy surface
Authors: Pablo Peña-Cano, Pablo M. Piaggi
Abstract: We propose a methodology to generate hybrid machine learning models for the potential energy surface trained simultaneously on data from ab initio electronic structure calculations and on thermodynamic and/or structural observables from experiment. The approach is based on the use of a loss function that includes the mean square error of observables with respect to their experimental values, in addition to the usual terms involving the mean square error of the energies and forces with respect to ab initio data. We employ a reweighting procedure that allows for the calculation of ensemble averages of observables during training for arbitrary values of the model parameters and on the fly. The method is general and can be applied to any set of static observables. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to the generation of hybrid models for liquid water that reproduce accurately the experimental density maximum, the density isobar at 1 bar, and the radial distribution function in molecular dynamics simulations.

Title: On the First Quantum Correction to the Second Virial Coefficient of a Generalized Lennard-Jones Fluid
Authors: Daniel Parejo, Andrés Santos
Abstract: We derive an explicit analytic expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient of a $d$-dimensional fluid whose particles interact via the generalized Lennard-Jones $(2n,n)$ potential. By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed. Moreover, the same methodology can be systematically extended to obtain higher-order quantum corrections.

Title: Shape dependence of Edelstein and magnetoelectric effects in the V-shaped model
Authors: Shuhei Kanda, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the shape dependence and microscopic mechanism of the magnetoelectric effect, including both nonmagnetic (Edelstein-type) and magnetic origins, in a V-shaped one-dimensional chain model. Numerical calculations based on the Kubo formula reveal that the magnitude of the nonmagnetic-driven magnetoelectric response reaches a maximum at an apex angle of $\theta \approx 0.6\pi$. To clarify the microscopic origin of this behavior, we construct a low-energy effective Hamiltonian by projecting onto the $s$-orbital subspace and demonstrate that the polarity induced by the V-shaped geometry manifests as an effective spin--orbit interaction. An analytical derivation of the Green's function shows that the geometric effect appears as a $T$-matrix contribution, reflecting the local breaking of translational symmetry at the V-shaped edge. Furthermore, by employing a multipole-basis representation, we identify the selection rules that govern the magnetoelectric tensor and reveal that the coupling between the effective spin--orbit interaction and the orbital angular momentum generated across the apex plays an essential role. The resulting angular dependence, $\sin{\theta}\sin{\theta/2}$, peaks at $\theta = 2\tan^{-1}\sqrt{2} \approx 0.608\pi$, in good agreement with the numerical results. We also analyze a ferromagnetic V-shaped model including the Zeeman interaction and show that the magnetic-driven magnetoelectric response originates from the spin magnetization induced by the coupling between the electric-field--driven charge-potential gradient and the Zeeman term. These findings demonstrate that the V-shaped geometry gives rise to distinct magnetoelectric mechanisms depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry and provide a microscopic framework for understanding shape-induced multipole phenomena in mesoscopic and bulk systems.

Title: Scaling of Low-Temperature Heat Capacity in Cryocrystals
Authors: M. Barabashko (1), A. Jeżowski (2), A. Krivchikov (1,2) ((1) <a href="http://B.Verkin" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kharkiv, Ukraine, (2) Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research PAS, Wrocław, Poland)
Abstract: The low-temperature isochoric heat capacity of cryocrystals was scaled using the universal scaling function. This universality links the magnitude of the anomaly and the characteristic temperature of the hump $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ in heat capacity, which is related to the first van Hove singularity in the phonon spectrum. For atomic, molecular, and quantum cryocrystals, $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ systematically shifts with molar volume, reflecting Brillouin zone scaling and revealing a common vibrational origin. These findings for the scaling function bridge thermodynamics with the vibrational density of states, highlighting fundamental universality in lattice dynamics.

Title: Inertial active particles in a Poiseuille flow: negative mobility and particle separation
Authors: Ankit Gupta, P. S. Burada
Abstract: The diffusive behavior of small entities is strongly influenced by the flow of the surrounding medium, which is ubiquitous in natural and artificial environments. In this study, we investigate the transport characteristics of the inertial active Brownian particles (ABPs) in a microfluidic channel under a Poiseuille flow. The interplay between the inertia of the particles and the imposed fluid flow leads to interesting diffusive behaviors. For instance, in the overdamped regime ($m \to 0$), particles exhibit a negative average velocity $\langle v \rangle$ due to upstream movement. As $m$ increases, particles tend to move along the flow direction with an increase in $\langle v \rangle$ in the positive direction, exhibiting a maximum at optimal $m$, and diminish for higher $m$ values. The effective diffusion coefficient $D_{eff}$ also shows a peak at this optimal $m$. Interestingly, at higher $m$ values, $D_{eff}$ decreases with increasing the noise strength. The self-propelled velocity of the particles further enhances the upstream movement. Further, the rotation rate of the particles also contributes positively to the upstream motion, and enhances the diffusion of the particles by many orders in the limit of higher $m$. This study reveals that inertia not only modifies swimmer flow interactions but also enables new dynamical regimes, where mass-dependent trajectories can be harnessed for selective control. Such control holds promise for mass based particle separation in precisely engineered environments and lab on a chip devices for technological applications.

Title: Spintronics in antiferromagnetic helix: A new prescription
Authors: Suparna Sarkar, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: The occurrence of a finite mismatch between the up and down spin energy channels due to the application of an electric field, leading to the generation of a polarized spin current from an unpolarized beam in antiferromagnetic materials, has already been established. But, in this work, we report for the first time that even in the absence of any electric field, spin polarization can be achieved. We choose a tight-binding antiferromagnetic helix, where the strengths of magnetic moments at different lattice sites are non-uniform. The non-uniformity is introduced in two distinct forms, correlated and uncorrelated, and in each case we find a high degree of spin polarization. The Greens formalism is used to compute the results under various input conditions, and the results are valid for a broad range of physical parameters. Our analysis can open up a new direction of getting spin selectivity in different magnetic systems with zero net magnetization, in the absence of an electric field.

Title: Observation of the surface hybridization gap in the electrical transport properties of the ultrathin topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_2$Te$_3$
Authors: Feike van Veen, Sofie Kölling, Stijn R. de Wit, Roel Metsch, Daniel Rosenbach, Chuan Li, Alexander Brinkman
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ in its ultrathin limit i.e. when the thickness is of the same order as the surface state penetration depth. It is expected that in this limit a hybridization gap opens at the Dirac point, which gives rise to a quantum spin Hall (QSH) or insulating phase, depending on the material thickness. We fabricate (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ Hall bars with a thicknesses of 6 and 9 nm and measure an insulating phase around the Dirac point for low bias and at sub-Kelvin temperatures only in samples fabricated from the 6 nm films, which indicates the presence of a hybridization gap. The effect of a perpendicular magnetic field on the hybridization gap is studied but remains partially unresolved. The results form an important step towards experimentally realizing the quantum spin Hall state via hybridization in ultrathin films of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, yet, they also expose a knowledge gap regarding transport measurements in these systems.

Title: Composition-Dependent Properties of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ Nanopowders Tailored for X-Ray Photodynamic Therapy and Cathodoluminescence Imaging
Authors: Xenie Lytvynenko, Marie Urbanová, Ondřej Lalinský, Vilém Vojta, Jan Bárta, Lenka Prouzová Procházková, Václav Čuba
Abstract: This study investigates the synthesis and luminescence behavior of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ nanoparticles with varying $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ content. The materials were prepared via a wet chemical route and thermally annealed to improve crystallinity and reduce defects. Phase composition and structural parameters were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), while elemental composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Cathodoluminescence (CL) intensity mapping was used to evaluate emission uniformity and monitor the degradation of luminescence under electron beam exposure. Photoluminescence (PL) and radioluminescence (RL) spectroscopy confirmed energy transfer from $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ to $\mathrm{Tb^{3+}}$ ions. Luminescence intensities were found to depend strongly on both Ce content and thermal treatment. The results contribute to the understanding of defect-related quenching mechanisms and are relevant for the design of rare-earth-based luminescent nanomaterials for biomedical applications.

Title: Neural network impurity solver for real-frequency dynamical mean-field theory
Authors: Fenglin Deng, Yi Lu, Xiaodong Cao, Zhicheng Zhong
Abstract: We introduce a neural network impurity solver for real-frequency DMFT that employs a multihead cross-attention mechanism to map hybridization functions to spectral functions, conditioned on impurity parameters. Trained on high-quality MPS data from complex contour time evolution and incorporating derivative constraints with respect to the complex-time angle, our model achieves smooth generalization to the real-frequency axis. Benchmarking on the single-band Hubbard model for the Bethe lattice demonstrates quantitative accuracy across metallic, strongly correlated, and insulating regimes.

Title: Analytic theory of shear localization in amorphous solids confined by Couette geometry
Authors: Yang Fu, Yuliang Jin, Itamar Procaccia
Abstract: ``Couette geometry'' refers to two concentric rings in 2-dimensions (or cylinders in 3-dimensions with a medium in between. Typically the inner and outer rings (or cylinders) rotate at different rates and the response of the medium is studied. Here we study a medium which is a twodimensional amorphous solid, and we rotate the inner ring quasi-statically. As stress accumulates, plastic avalanches can result in shear localization, characterized by adjacent parts of the system rotating in opposite directions, with the maximum shear localized between them. We derive an analytic theory that describes and explains the shear localization, providing a-priori predictions for the displacement field associated with the plastic drops and the shear localization.

Title: Precise, efficient and flexible modeling of crystallizing elastomers based on physics-augmented neural networks
Authors: Konrad Friedrichs, Franz Dammaß, Karl A. Kalina, Markus Kästner
Abstract: We propose a precise and efficient physics-augmented neural network (PANN) to model strain-induced crystallization in natural rubber (NR). The approach is based on a two potential framework, similar to the concept of generalized standard materials (GSMs). To describe the material behavior, neural network-based free energy and dissipation potentials are employed. The evolution of crystallinity is derived from the two potentials and resembles a classical GSM-type equation. Two additional Lagrange multipliers together with the corresponding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are introduced to ensure boundedness of the crystallinity, such that it can be interpreted as a variable of concentration type. The neural network-based potentials ensure all physically desirable properties by construction. Most importantly, objectivity, material symmetry, and thermodynamic consistency are automatically fulfilled. In addition, an alternative derivation of the governing model equations in time-discrete form is presented based on an incremental variational framework, which also serves as the basis for a finite element implementation. We demonstrate the predictive capability of the PANN using three different experimental data sets from literature, considering both stress and crystallinity evolution at material point level as well as the corresponding field distributions in a notched specimen. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model can be flexibly employed for both unfilled and filled NR.

Title: Nonlinearity-induced transition in heat conduction through a topological metamaterial of rotors
Authors: T. R. Vishnu, Dibyendu Roy
Abstract: We investigate heat conduction in a one-dimensional chain of rigid rotors. The rotors are constrained to rotate in a plane about fixed pivot points and coupled by springs, such that in equilibrium, the neighboring rotors lie on opposite sides of the chain axis. The linearized limit of this model valid for small angular displacements, was first introduced by Kane and Lubensky (KL) as a topological mechanical insulator hosting zero-energy vibrational edge modes. We show that the linearized KL chain behaves as a thermal insulator at low temperature in both the topological phases with a finite band gap, and the heat current falls exponentially with the chain length. When the gap vanishes at the topological phase transition, the KL chain becomes a good thermal conductor and conducts heat ballistically. The chain of rotors for arbitrary angular displacements hosts nonlinear solitary waves and distinct topological mechanical phases. Our numerical analysis shows normal (diffusive) heat conduction in all topological phases of the nonlinear chain. Nevertheless, a finite thermal conductivity is achieved for different system sizes in different topological phases of this nonlinear chain.

Title: Interlayer Coupling Driven Correlated and Charge-Ordered Electronic States in a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Superlattice
Authors: Yiwei Li, Lixuan Xu, Shihao Zhang, Lanxin Liu, Yifan Zhou, Qiang Wan, Shiwei Chen, Shiheng Liang, Yulin Chen, Yi-feng Yang, Xuan Luo, Yuping Sun, Nan Xu, Zhongkai Liu
Abstract: 4Hb-TaS_2, a van der Waals superlattice comprising alternate stacked Ising superconducting 1H-TaS_2 and cluster Mott insulating 1T-TaS_2, exhibits emergent properties beyond those of its constituent layers. Notable phenomena include time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity and spontaneous vortex phases, which are driven by nontrivial interlayer interactions that remain debated. Using area-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence of such interaction by systematically probing the electronic structures of 1T- and 1H-terminted surfaces of 4Hb-TaS_2. The metallic states of subsurface 1H-layers are folded to the Brillouin zone center by the sqrt(13) by sqrt(13) modulation of the surface 1T-layer, forming chiral "windmill" Fermi surfaces via Umklapp scattering. These conducting states further hybridize with the incipient flat band of the surface 1T-layer, producing a Kondo-like peak at the Fermi level. Interlayer charge transfer induces distinct 3 by 3 and 2 by 2 charge orders on the surface and subsurface 1H-layers, respectively, which result in characteristic segmented Fermi surfaces and dichotomously shift the van Hove singularities. These findings reconcile the competing Kondo and Mott-Hubbard models in this material and emphasize the interplay of flat bands, van hove singularities, charge orders, and unconventional superconductivity in correlated superlattices.

Title: Collective modes, Yb-valence instability and metal-insulator transition in the cage-cluster borides RB12 (R- Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Zr)
Authors: Gennady Komandin, Elena Zhukova, Boris Gorshunov, Alexander Melentyev, Ludmila Alyabyeva, Andrey Azarevich, Andrey Muratov, Yurii Aleshchenko, Nikolay Sluchanko
Abstract: A thorough study of the wide-range (40-35000 cm-1) dynamic conductivity spectra of the rare-earth (RE) dodecaborides RB12 (R- Ho, Er and Tm) and Tm1-xYbxB12 substitutional solid solutions was carried out at room temperature. Both the Drude-type components and overdamped excitations have been separated and analyzed. An additional absorption band observed above 200 cm-1 in these RB12 with magnetic RE ions is attributed to the cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics of the B12 complexes, which depends crucially on the RE-ion cage space and is compared with the same effect found in the non-magnetic LuB12 and ZrB12. It was shown that non-equilibrium (hot) electrons participating in the formation of the collective JT modes dominate in charge transport, and portion of Drude-type carriers changes by 20-40% in these compounds with unstable boron lattice. Strong renormalization of the infrared response is observed in Tm1-xYbxB12 solid solutions with metal-insulator transition (MIT) and is discussed in terms of localized collective modes caused by Yb-ion valence instability. We demonstrate that even at room temperature the MIT is accompanied with simultaneous decrease in concentration of Drude-type electrons and redistribution of carriers to localized JT collective modes.

Title: Non-Fermi-liquid behaviour and Fermi-surface expansion induced by van Hove-driven ferromagnetic fluctuations: the D-TRILEX analysis
Authors: Ilia S. Dedov, Andrey A. Katanin, Evgeny A. Stepanov
Abstract: We consider the electronic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on a square lattice with the ratio of the next-nearest-neighbor and nearest-neighbor hoppings $t'/t=-0.45$, which favours the ferromagnetic instability. We find, that a self-consistent consideration of the ferromagnetic fluctuations within the D-TRILEX approach results in the splitting of the electronic spectral function at low temperatures. This splitting exhibits only a weak momentum dependence, and only one of the split bands crosses the Fermi level. As a result, the Fermi surface itself remains unsplit, but its area increases, reflecting the presence of non-Fermi-liquid electronic excitations. We show that both the self-consistent account of the non-local contributions to the electronic self-energy and the proper treatment of electron interaction vertices in D-TRILEX are important to obtain this behaviour.

Title: Active Matter as a framework for living systems-inspired Robophysics
Authors: Giulia Janzen, Gaia Maselli, Juan F. Jimenez, Lia Garcia-Perez, D A Matoz Fernandez, Chantal Valeriani
Abstract: Robophysics investigates the physical principles that govern living-like robots operating in complex, realworld environments. Despite remarkable technological advances, robots continue to face fundamental efficiency limitations. At the level of individual units, locomotion remains a challenge, while at the collective level, robot swarms struggle to achieve shared purpose, coordination, communication, and cost efficiency. This perspective article examines the key challenges faced by bio-inspired robotic collectives and highlights recent research efforts that incorporate principles from active-matter physics and biology into the modeling and design of robot swarms.

Title: Interplay of Electron Phonon Coupling Dissipative Phonon Bath and Electron Electron Interaction in a Triangular Quantum-Dot Trimer
Authors: Hemant Kumar Sharma
Abstract: Nonequilibrium charge transport through a trimer molecular transistor composed of three quantum dots arranged in a triangular geometry, which is placed on a substrate, has been studied in the presence of electron electron and electron phonon interactions. The entire system is described by an extended Anderson Holstein Caldeira Leggett Hamiltonian, in which the Caldeira Leggett term accounts for phonon damping arising from the coupling between the molecular vibrations and the substrate phonon bath. The electron phonon interaction is treated nonperturbatively using the Lang Firsov canonical transformation, while the electron electron interaction is incorporated at the mean field level. Keldysh nonequilibrium Greens function framework is used to study the transport properties, allowing us to calculate the spectral function, tunneling current, ad differential conductance of the trimer molecular transistor. The formalism enables systematic evaluation of the effects of Coulomb interaction, electron phonon coupling, and dissipation on the devices electronic transport characteristics.

Title: Search by Return: Stochastic Resetting in Fluctuating Harmonic Potentials
Authors: Derek Frydel
Abstract: We study a class of stochastic resetting (SR) processes in which a diffusing particle alternates between free motion and confinement by an externally controlled potential. When the particle is recaptured, it undergoes a return trajectory that drives it toward a designated reset point. In standard SR, such returns are treated as instantaneous, but in realistic setups they have finite duration and introduce imprecision in the starting points of subsequent search attempts. We analyze a fluctuating harmonic potential in which return trajectories are forcibly terminated the moment the particle reaches the origin, ensuring that all outward (diffusive) trajectories begin from the same point. This is implemented through instantaneous positional information: a feedback signal that shortens the return phase without incurring additional mechanical energetic cost. We examine several search protocols built on this controlled return mechanism and determine their mean first-passage times (MFPTs). Of particular interest is a protocol in which outward diffusion is eliminated entirely and the return motion itself becomes the search mechanism. This "search by return" perspective reverses the conventional logic of SR and yields a closed-form MFPT that highlights the efficiency of using return dynamics as the primary search strategy.

Title: Automated Prediction of Thermodynamic Properties via Bayesian Free-Energy Reconstruction from Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Ekaterina Spirande (1,2,3), Timofei Miryashkin (3), Andrei Kolmakov (1,2), Alexander Shapeev (3,2) ((1) Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny, Russia, (2) Digital Materials LLC, Odintsovo, Russia, (3) Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russia)
Abstract: Accurate free-energy calculations are essential for predicting thermodynamic properties and phase stability, but existing methods are limited: phonon-based approaches neglect anharmonicity and liquids, while molecular dynamics (MD) is computationally demanding, neglects low-temperature quantum effects, and often requires manual planning and post-processing of simulations. We present a unified workflow that reconstructs the Helmholtz free-energy surface from MD data using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), augmented with zero-point energy corrections from harmonic/quasi-harmonic theory. The framework propagates statistical uncertainties, mitigates finite-size effects, and employs active learning to optimize sampling in the volume-temperature space. It applies seamlessly to both crystalline and liquid phases. We demonstrate the methodology by computing heat capacities, thermal expansion, isothermal and adiabatic bulk moduli, and melting properties for nine elemental FCC and BCC metals using 20 classical and machine-learned interatomic potentials, with all predictions accompanied by quantified confidence intervals. Automated, general, and uncertainty-aware, the workflow advances high-throughput thermodynamics and provides a systematic benchmark for interatomic potentials.

Title: Giant enhancement of attosecond tunnel ionization competes with disorder-driven decoherence in silicon
Authors: D. N. Purschke, D. Vick, A. Cárdenas, N. Haram, P. Bastani, S. Gholam-Mirzaei, S. Mokhtari, V. Jelic, J. Chen, J. Canlas, J. Tordiff, Md. W. Rahman, A. Yu. Naumov, D. M. Villeneuve, A. Staudte, M. Salomons, R. E. F. Silva, Á. Jiménez-Galán, G. Vampa
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a strong-field phenomenon that is sensitive to the attosecond dynamics of tunnel ionization and coherent transport of electron-hole pairs in solids. While the foundations of solid HHG have been established, a deep understanding into the nature of decoherence on sub-cycle timescales remains elusive. Furthermore, there is a growing need for tools to control ionization at the nanoscale. Here, we study HHG in silicon along a crystalline-to-amorphous (c-Si to a-Si) structural phase transition and observe a dramatic reshaping of the spectrum, with enhanced lower-order harmonic yield accompanied by quenching of the higher-order harmonics. Modelling the real-space quantum dynamics links our observations to a giant enhancement (>250 times) of tunnel ionization yield in the amorphous phase and a disorder-induced decoherence that damps the electron-hole polarization over approximately six lattice sites. HHG spectroscopy also reveals remnant order that was not apparent with conventional probes. Finally, we observe a rapid and targeted non-resonant laser annealing of amorphous silicon islands. Our results offer a unique insight into attosecond decoherence in strong-field phenomena, establish HHG spectroscopy as a probe of structural disorder, and pave the way for new opportunities in lightwave nanoelectronics.

Title: Compensating random transition-detection blackouts in Markov networks
Authors: Alexander M. Maier, Benjamin Häsler, Udo Seifert
Abstract: In Markov networks, measurement blackouts with unknown frequency compromise observations such that thermodynamic quantities can no longer be inferred reliably. In particular, the observed currents neither discern equilibrium from non-equilibrium nor can they be used in extant estimators of entropy production. Our strategy to eliminate these effects is based on formally attributing the blackouts to a second channel connecting states. The unknown frequency of blackouts and the true underlying transition rates can be determined from the short-time limit of observed waiting-time distributions. A post-modification of observed trajectory data yields a virtual effective dynamics from which the lower bound on entropy production based on thermodynamic uncertainty relations can be recovered fully. Moreover, the post-processed data can be used in waiting-time based estimators. Crucially, our strategy does neither require the blackouts to occur homogeneously nor symmetrically under time-reversal.

Title: On the Modified Eguchi-Oki-Matsumura System
Authors: P.O. Mchedlov-Petrosyan, L.N. Davydov
Abstract: To describe the simultaneous order-disorder transformation and phase separation Eguchi, Oki and Matsumura [\doi{https://doi.org/10.1557/proc-21-589}] introduced the system of two equations: one equation, governing the evolution of a conserved order parameter, and the second equation for the non-conserved order parameter. The key feature of their model is the free energy functional, which contains the square gradient terms of the both order parameters and a fourth power polynomial depending on both order parameters. According to the general Hohenberg-Halperin classification it is the type C model. We show that if the dynamics of the conserved order parameter is governed by the convective-viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation, this system allows exact traveling wave solution.

Title: Cell Shape Emerges from Motion
Authors: Gautham Gopinath, Emmanuel Y. Mintah, Aashrith Saraswathibhatla, Jonah J. Spencer, Shahar Nahum, Lior Aria, Jacob Notbohm, Mark D. Shattuck, Corey S. O'Hern
Abstract: We perform cell segmentation on images from experimental studies of confluent, mobile cells in epithelial monolayers and show that these systems possess a broad, positively-skewed shape parameter distribution $P(\mathcal{A})$, where $\mathcal{A}=p^2/4\pi a$, $p$ is the perimeter, and $a$ is area of each cell. $P(\mathcal{A})$ is peaked at a value higher than the typical shape parameter $\mathcal{A}^* \sim 1.15$ that occurs for randomly packed, static confluent cell monolayers. The distribution does not arise from a heterogeneous population of cells with different {\it fixed} $\mathcal{A}$, nor can it arise from cell shape fluctuations from strains below the elastic limit. Instead, we find that all cells in each monolayer sample $\mathcal{A}$ values that span the full shape parameter distribution. We develop a deformable particle model that allows cell perimeter to adapt to local forces during cell motion, and this model recovers $P(\mathcal{A})$ to within $5\%$ for both MDCK and HaCaT epithelial cell monolayers. These results emphasize that confluent epithelial monolayers of mobile cells generate a well-defined broad shape parameter distribution that is independent of the initial cell shapes.

Title: From Equilibrium Multistability to Spatiotemporal Chaos in Channel Flows of Nematic Fluids
Authors: Rahil N. Valani, Sumesh Thampi, Julia M. Yeomans
Abstract: We investigate channel-confined, nematic liquid crystals using the Beris-Edwards model of nematohydrodynamics. Using strong homeotropic anchoring at the walls, we find multistability i.e. multiple coexisting states where the uniform nematic state coexists with states having spatially varying scalar nematic order and director fields. When a pressure gradient is applied, flows develop, and the inherent multistability of the system organizes a variety of complex dynamics. For low pressure gradients, steady flows are established, and the director fields that emerge from the multistable states at equilibrium correspond to Bowser and Dowser configurations similar to those reported in experiments. An increasing pressure-gradient destabilizes steady Bowser and Dowser flow states sequentially, leading to unsteady periodic and chaotic regimes featuring cyclical topological transitions, pulsating flows, advecting defects and spatiotemporal chaos. These findings demonstrate that modest variations in the scalar nematic order, as captured by the Beris-Edwards model, can qualitatively modify equilibrium structures and give rise to complex nonequilibrium behaviour in confined nematics-contrasting with the Ericksen-Leslie model, which assumes a constant scalar order parameter. Our key model predictions - multistability, periodically oscillating states and advecting defect-mediated turbulence can be experimentally investigated in pressure-driven channel flows of nematic fluids.

Title: Observation of critical scaling in the Bose gas universality class
Authors: Leon Kleebank, Frank Vewinger, Arturo Camacho-Guardian, Victor Romero-Rochín, Rosario Paredes, Martin Weitz, Julian Schmitt
Abstract: Critical exponents characterize the divergent scaling of thermodynamic quantities near phase transitions and allow for the classification of physical systems into universality classes. While quantum gases thermalizing by interparticle interactions fall into the XY model universality class, the ideal Bose gas has been predicted to form a distinct universality class whose signatures have not yet been revealed experimentally. Here, we report the observation of critical scaling in a two-dimensional quantum gas of essentially noninteracting photons, which thermalize by radiative contact to a reservoir of molecules inside a microcavity. By measuring the spatial correlations near the condensation transition, we determine the critical exponent for the correlation length to be $\nu = 0.52(3)$. Our results constitute a first experimental test of the long-standing scaling predictions for the Bose gas universality class.

Title: Variational multiscale enrichment method for dynamic response of hyperelastic materials at finite deformation
Authors: Abhishek Arora, Caglar Oskay
Abstract: In this manuscript, we extend the variational multiscale enrichment (VME) method to model the dynamic response of hyperelastic materials undergoing large deformations. This approach enables the simulation of wave propagation under scale-inseparable conditions, including short-wavelength regimes, while accounting for material and geometric nonlinearities that lead to wave steepening or flattening. By employing an additive decomposition of the displacement field, we derive multiscale governing equations for the coarse- and fine-scale problems, which naturally incorporate micro-inertial effects. The framework allows the discretization of each unit cell with a patch of coarse-scale elements, which is essential to accurately capture wave propagation in short-wavelength regimes. An operator-split procedure is used to iteratively solve the semi-discrete equations at both scales until convergence is achieved. The coarse-scale problem is integrated explicitly, while the fine-scale problem is solved using either explicit or implicit time integration schemes, including both dissipative and non-dissipative methods. Numerical examples demonstrate that multiscale dissipative schemes effectively suppress spurious oscillations. The multiscale framework was applied to investigate how material and geometric nonlinearities, along with elastic stiffness contrast in heterogeneous microstructures, influence key wave characteristics such as dispersion, attenuation, and steepening. This multiscale computational framework provides a foundation for studying the dynamic response of architected materials.

Title: Skeleton of isometric Tensor Network States for Abelian String-Net Models
Authors: Julian Boesl, Yu-Jie Liu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap
Abstract: We construct parametrized isometric tensor network states -- referred to as skeletons -- that allow us to explore phases of abelian topological order and can be efficiently implemented on quantum processors. We obtain stable finite correlation length deformations of string-net fixed points, which are constructed both by conserving virtual symmetries of the tensor and by imposing local isometry constraints. They connect distinct topological phases via a shared critical point, thereby providing analytically tractable examples of phase transitions beyond anyon condensation. By mapping such classes of 2D tensor networks to 1D stochastic automata with local update rules, we show that expectation values of generalized Pauli strings of arbitrary weight can be efficiently computed using classical methods. Therefore these skeletons not only serve as an organizing principle for abelian topological order but also provide a non-trivial testbed for quantum processors.

Title: Optimizing two-dimensional isometric tensor networks with quantum computers
Authors: Sebastian Leontica, Alberto Baiardi, Julian Schuhmacher, Francesco Tacchino, Ivano Tavernelli
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for approximating the ground state of two-dimensional quantum systems using an isometric tensor network ansatz, which maps naturally to quantum circuits. Inspired by the density matrix renormalization group, we optimize tensors sequentially by diagonalizing a series of effective Hamiltonians. These are constructed using a tomography-inspired method on a qubit subset whose size depends only on the bond dimension. Our approach leverages quantum computers to enable accurate solutions without relying on approximate contractions, circumventing the exponential complexity faced by classical techniques. We demonstrate our method on the two-dimensional (2D) transverse-field Ising model, achieving ground-state optimization on up to 25 qubits with modest quantum overhead -- significantly less than standard solutions based on variational quantum eigensolvers. Overall, our results offer a path towards scalable variational quantum algorithms in both noisy and fault-tolerant regimes.

Title: Realizing Unitary $k$-designs with a Single Quench
Authors: Yi-Neng Zhou, Robin Löwenberg, Julian Sonner
Abstract: We present a single-quench protocol that generates unitary $k$-designs with minimal control. A system first evolves under a random Hamiltonian $H_1$; at a switch time $t_s \geq t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ (the Thouless time), it is quenched to an independently drawn $H_2$ from the same ensemble and then evolves under $H_2$. This single quench breaks residual spectral correlations that prevent strictly time-independent chaotic dynamics from forming higher-order designs. The resulting ensemble approaches a unitary $k$-design using only a single control operation -- far simpler than Brownian schemes with continuously randomized couplings or protocols that apply random quenches at short time intervals. Beyond offering a direct route to Haar-like randomness, the protocol yields an operational, measurement-friendly definition of $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ and provides a quantitative diagnostic of chaoticity. It further enables symmetry-resolved and open-system extensions, circuit-level single-quench analogs, and immediate applications to randomized measurements, benchmarking, and tomography.

Title: Quantum Metamorphosis: Programmable Emergence and the Breakdown of Bulk-Edge Dichotomy in Multiscale Systems
Authors: Mahmoud Jalali Mehrabad, Alireza Parhizkar, Lida Xu, Gregory Moille, Avik Dutt, Dirk Englund, Kartik Srinivasan, Daniel Leykam, Mohammad Hafezi
Abstract: Multiscale synergy -- the interplay of a system's distinct characteristic length, time, and energy scales -- is becoming a unifying thread across many contemporary branches of science. Ranging from moiré and super-moiré materials and cold atoms to DNA-templated superlattices and nested photonic networks, multiscale synergy produces behaviors not obtainable at any single scale alone. Yet a general framework that programs cross-scale interplay to steer spectra, transport, and topology has been missing. Here, we elevate multiscale synergy from a byproduct to a general design principle for emergent phenomena. Specifically, we introduce a scale-programmable framework for hierarchically nested lattices (HNLs) that can host quantum metamorphosis (QuMorph) -- a continuous evolution between system-dependent features governed by a dimensionless tunable parameter $\alpha$ (the relative hopping). To exemplify, we show an HNL, in which as $\alpha$ changes, the spectrum metamorphoses from integer quantum Hall-like to anomalous quantum Hall-like, passing through a cocoon regime with proliferating mini-gaps. This multiscale mixing yields multiple novel phenomena, including hybrid edge-bulk states, scale-dependent topology, topologically embedded flat bands, and isolated edge bands. We propose a feasible photonic implementation using commercially available coupled-resonator arrays, outline spatial-spectral signatures to map QuMorph, and explore applications for multi-timescale nonlinear optics. Our work establishes a scalable and programmable paradigm for engineering multiscale emergent phenomena.

Title: On Universal Deformations and Material Preferred Directions in Anisotropic Cauchy Elasticity
Authors: Seyedemad Motaghian, Arash Yavari
Abstract: In this paper we study universal deformations in anisotropic Cauchy elasticity. We show that the universality constraints of hyperelasticity and Cauchy elasticity for transversely isotropic, orthotropic, and monoclinic solids are equivalent. This implies that for each of these symmetry classes the universal deformations and the corresponding universal material preferred directions of hyperelastic and Cauchy elastic solids are identical. This is consistent with previous findings for isotropic solids. Universal deformations and material preferred directions are therefore independent of the existence or absence of a strain energy function.

Title: Charge reservoir as a design concept for plasmonic antennas
Authors: Rostislav Řepa, Michal Horák, Tomáš Šikola, Vlastimil Křápek
Abstract: Plasmonic antennas exploit localized surface plasmons to shape, confine, and enhance electromagnetic fields with subwavelength resolution. The field enhancement is contributed to by various effects, such as the inherent surface localization of plasmons or the plasmonic lightning-rod effect. Inspired by nanofocusing observed for propagating plasmons, we test the hypothesis that plasmonic antennas with a large cross-section represent a large charge reservoir, enabling large induced charge and field enhancement. Our study reveals that a large charge reservoir is accompanied by large radiative losses, which are the dominant factor, resulting in a low field enhancement.

Title: Interaction of Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity PIM-1 with explosive analytes at the molecular level: Combined experiment and computational modelling
Authors: Salam Mohammed, Edward B. Ogugu, Ramakant Sharma, Dominic Taylor, Graeme Cooke, Neil McKeown, Glib Baryshnikov, Hans Ågren, Ifor D.W. Samuel, Graham A. Turnbull
Abstract: This work investigates the molecular-level interactions of a fluorescent microporous polymer (PIM-1) with nitroaromatic explosives, in the context of thin film explosive sensors. Thin films of the PIM-1 were exposed to 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and their steady-state absorption and emission spectra measured. For comparison, the response of PIM-1 to non-explosive molecules such as benzene (BN) was also explored. Complementary electronic-structure calculations were used to predict absorption and emission spectra and to determine binding energies for the PIM-1-analyte complexes. The calculations agree well with experiment and reveal that association of nitroaromatic analyte molecules with PIM-1 alters the energy levels and the arrangements of frontier orbitals, indicating significant molecular interactions. Calculations show that the electronic properties and photo-excited electron transfer can be described by interaction with a single repeat unit of the polymer. The molecular binding, however, involves interaction with at least three repeat units, with the DNT or TNT molecule binding into a pocket in the contorted structure of the microporous polymer. Together, the experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that PIM-1 is a promising platform for selective nitroaromatic detection and provide molecular design principles that could improve sensitivity and selectivity in future sensor materials.

Title: Friendship-paradox paradox: Do most people's friends really have more friends than they do?
Authors: Sang Hoon Lee
Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.

Title: Probing Local Topology in a Disordered Higher-Order Topological Insulator

Abstract: Higher-order topology is prized for its ability to realize lower-dimensional boundary states which are stable beyond fine-tuning. However, disorder presents a failure mechanism that can destroy topological in-gap states. Here, we investigate a disordered two-dimensional polariton lattice and employ the spectral localizer framework to define a real-space topological index rooted in crystalline spatial symmetries. This framework enables direct real-space mapping of topology beyond conventional momentum-space classifications, confirming the presence of corner and edge modes in this generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Furthermore, it can directly quantify topological protection of a state. We leverage the versatility of our platform to experimentally realize normally distributed, random disorder and find that the corner states persist until the spectral gap closes. Experimentally, this corresponds to a disorder strength of approximately one quarter of the spectral gap. The spectral localizer accurately identifies the disorder strength at which the bandgap closes, establishing the framework as a predictive tool for every finite size system. Our results broaden the design principles for higher-order topological insulators and open the way towards imple menting disorder-resilient devices for robust lasing, light-routing, and quantum computation.

Title: Anisotropic Dielectric Function of Graphite Probed by Far- and Near-Field Spectroscopies
Authors: A. Toksumakov, G. Ermolaev, D. Grudinin, A. Slavich, N. Pak, G. Tikhonowski, A. Vyshnevyy, G. Tselikov, A. Arsenin, V. Volkov
Abstract: Graphite is a cornerstone material for revolutionary technologies, from energy storage to the entire field of two-dimensional materials. Despite its foundational role, the predictive power required for engineering emergent optical behavior in van der Waals heterostructures is severely constrained by persistent discrepancies in reported optical constants. We resolve this long-standing ambiguity by deploying a multi-modal approach that synergizes far-field spectroscopic ellipsometry with nanoscale near-field optical probing (s-SNOM) and micro-reflectance spectroscopy. We have established a new, self-consistent set of optical constants (n and k) for both in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic directions across the ultraviolet-to-near-infrared spectrum. This work presents a unified set of optical constants that addresses inconsistencies in the existing literature. By establishing this definitive reference, we provide the essential foundation for the quantitative modeling and engineering of light-matter interactions in the evolving landscape of carbon-based nanophotonics.

Title: Ellipsometric Identification of Transition from Layered Metal-dielectric Film to Hyperbolic Metamaterial
Authors: Samhita Kattekola, Vinod Menon, Alexander Couzis, Ilona Kretzschmar
Abstract: Hyperbolic Metamaterials (HMMs) continue to be intriguing due to their applications in super resolution imaging and spontaneous emission control. One of the successful realizations of HMMs is a layered metal-dielectric film. Despite the extensive knowledge in thin film technology and the promises of HMM's applications, the scale up and practical utilization of HMMs have not yet occurred. This is due to the difficulty in identifying versatile design parameters for HMM fabrication and characterization via accessible techniques. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry and numerical simulations are utilized to identify design parameters for fabrication of HMMs using the silver and alumina system as a model system. Four interdependent design parameters are explored: thicknesses of metal and dielectric layers, transition wavelength, and minimum number of periods required for a layered metal-dielectric film to display hyperbolic dispersion. The findings are presented as a practical engineering design chart.

Title: Stochastic Thermodynamics of Social Imitation beyond Energetics
Authors: Luis Irisarri, Lucas Trigal, Raúl Toral, Gonzalo Manzano
Abstract: The development of stochastic thermodynamics during the last decades prompted the discovery of novel nonequilibrium relations refining our understanding of the second law in small fluctuating systems and its connection with information theory. A fundamental open question is whether these powerful tools can illuminate other areas of complex systems, such as social phenomena, where energy plays no fundamental role. Here we develop a framework that derives a ``second law" for social systems. Similarly to Landauer's principle, it constrains spontaneous changes in agent attributes (opinions, cultural traits, etc.) and their informational entropy. We apply this framework to toy agent-based models of social imitation with non-trivial phase diagrams. We demonstrate how cornerstone results -- fluctuation theorems, kinetic and thermodynamic uncertainty relations, and second-law-like inequalities -- emerge naturally in this context, even across symmetry-breaking transitions. These results reveal fundamental trade-offs in opinion currents arising from the competition between herding and anti-conformity. Moreover, they provide inference tools to extract model parameters from observations of stochastic changes in agents.

Title: A Machine Learning study of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model with nearest and next-to-nearest interactions on the triangular lattice
Authors: Shang-Wei Li, Yuan-Heng Tseng, Kai-Wei Huang, Fu-Jiun Jiang
Abstract: We study the phase transitions of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model with nearest $J_1$ and next-to-nearest $J_2$ interactions on the triangular lattice for $J_2/J_1 = 0.1, 0.5$ and 1.0. The method of supervised neural networks (NN) is employed for the investigation. While supervised NN is used, no real spin configurations are needed for the training. In addition, two kinds of configurations having their spins be arranged in a staggered pattern are considered as the training set. Remarkably, with this unconventional training strategy, not only the critical temperatures of the studied $J_2/J_1$ are computed accurately by the resulting NN, but also the nature of the investigated phase transitions are determined correctly. Specifically, the phase transitions associated with $J_2/J_1 = 0.1, 0.5$ and 1.0 are first order. These conclusions are consistent with the known results obtained by other methods. Since the training strategy is simple, the NN calculations is highly efficient. It remains to examine whether the unconventional training approach considered in this study can be used to investigate other models with untypical phase transitions or with nontrivial ground state configurations.

Title: Magnetic atoms with a large electric dipole moment
Authors: Johannes Seifert, Sid C. Wright, Boris G. Sartakov, Giacomo Valtolina, Gerard Meijer
Abstract: We experimentally show that an electric dipole moment of more than 1 Debye can be induced in the dysprosium (Dy) atom, in a long-lived state that is about 17513 cm$^{-1}$ above the ground state. This metastable state is part of a strongly coupled opposite-parity doublet. Using optically detected microwave spectroscopy in an atomic beam, we determine the approximately 1.12 cm$^{-1}$ doublet spacing for the five stable bosonic isotopes of Dy with kHz-level accuracy. From the shift of the microwave transition frequency in low electric fields (below 150 V/cm) and from optical spectra in high electric fields (up to 150 kV/cm), a reduced transition dipole moment of 7.65 $\pm$ 0.05 Debye between the doublet states is extracted. In high electric fields the doublet interacts with a third state at 17727 cm$^{-1}$, that connects to the ground state via an electric-dipole transition. The three-state Stark interaction enables preparation of Dy atoms in the metastable state via single-photon excitation from the ground state.

Title: Record Index-Bandgap Trade-off: CdPS3 as a High-Index van der Waals Platform for Ultraviolet-Visible Nanophotonics

Abstract: The development of nanophotonics is hindered by a fundamental trade-off between a material's refractive index (n) and its electronic bandgap (Eg), which severely restricts the choice of materials for short-wavelength applications. This challenge is particularly acute in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectra, where high-performance devices require materials that are simultaneously highly refractive and transparent. Here, we report on the van der Waals (vdW) crystal cadmium phosphorus trisulfide (CdPS3) as a solution to this long-standing problem. Through comprehensive optical and structural characterization, we show that CdPS3 possesses an anomalously high in-plane refractive index across the visible spectrum approaching 3 in the near-UV, combined with a wide indirect bandgap. This combination of properties, which circumvents the empirical Moss's law, is validated by first-principles calculations and direct near-field imaging of highly confined waveguide modes. These findings establish CdPS3 as a leading material for UV-visible photonics, opening a new pathway for the development of high-density integrated circuits and metasurfaces.

Title: Quantum Biology, Quantum Simulation and Quantum Coherent Devices
Authors: Rong-Hang Chen, Jing Dong, Wen Yang, Qing Ai, Gui-Lu Long
Abstract: Many living organisms can exploit quantum mechanical effects to gain distinct biological advantages. In plants, photosynthesis uses quantum coherence to achieve near 100% efficiency in energy transfer. With advances in experimental techniques, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy can reveal dynamic processes such as coherence and coupling within a system, and it plays an important role in studying energy transfer in photosynthesis. On the theory side, methods such as the generalized Bloch-Redfield theory and the hierarchical equations of motion are used to model photosynthetic systems. Quantum simulation, as a high-efficiency and low-complexity approach, has also made progress across various platforms in the study of photosynthesis. In recent years, a series of studies has introduced quantum coherence into artificial systems to enhance energy transfer efficiency, laying the groundwork for the design of coherent devices with efficient energy transport. Birds can use the weak geomagnetic field and spin-dependent chemical reactions to detect direction. Theoretical frameworks for animal navigation include magnetite-based mechanisms, magnetoreceptor genes, and the radical-pair mechanism. Quantum simulations of navigation have also advanced on multiple platforms. Inspired by animal navigation, diverse quantum effects have been applied to improve sensing and to support navigation tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive review of progress on quantum coherence in photosynthesis and avian navigation, along with related theoretical methods, quantum simulation approaches, and research on quantum coherent devices.

Title: Stationary inverse-Wishart polymers
Authors: Guillaume Barraquand, Zikun Ouyang
Abstract: A solvable model of directed polymer with matrix-valued disorder is introduced in arXiv:2203.14868. The disorder is made of $d\times d$ inverse-Wishart random matrices, so that the model nicely generalizes the well-studied log-gamma polymer, recovered when $d=1$. Much of the features of the log-gamma polymer seem to have analogues for higher $d$, although the integrability needs to be better understood. In this paper, we introduce stationary inverse-Wishart polymer models on a quadrant or a strip of $\mathbb Z^2$. In each setting, we identify stationary measures, characterized explicitly in terms of random walks with inverse-Wishart increments in special cases, or more complicated two-layer Gibbs measures for generic choices of boundary parameters. We also make conjectures about asymptotics of the free energy, and explain important differences between matrix-valued polymer models and their scalar counterpart, due to non-commutativity.

Title: MiAD: Mirage Atom Diffusion for De Novo Crystal Generation
Authors: Andrey Okhotin, Maksim Nakhodnov, Nikita Kazeev, Andrey E Ustyuzhanin, Dmitry Vetrov
Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Title: Reflectivity-based refractive index measurement of van der Waals materials
Authors: Xavier Zambrana-Puyalto, Alexander Johan Olsen, Søren Raza
Abstract: We present a reflectivity-based method for measuring the in-plane refractive index of transparent van der Waals (vdW) materials. The approach enables the characterization of as small as $3 \times 3$~{\textmu}m$^2$ exfoliated flakes on a non-transmissive substrate without assuming any specific spectral shape of the refractive index. Exfoliated flakes are most commonly obtained through mechanical exfoliation, which generally produces vdW flakes with tens-of-micron lateral dimensions. As a result, conventional ellipsometry - which depends on large, uniform areas and specific spectral models - becomes challenging to apply. Our method determines the refractive index directly from the spectral position of reflectivity minima, provided the flake thickness and the substrate complex refractive index are known. We demonstrate the technique on hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$), a vdW semiconductor with high refractive index and low absorption, retrieving its in-plane refractive index across the visible range. The results both validate previous ellipsometry measurements and establish this method as an accessible and spectral-model-free alternative for refractive index characterization of vdW materials.

Title: Systems with Quantum Dimensions
Authors: Mikołaj Myszkowski, Mattia Damia Paciarini, Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable. As a consequence, the effective dimension depends on the physical state of the system. Interestingly, systems of this form exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a harmonic oscillator for which the spatial dimension is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.

Title: Dispersive shock waves in periodic lattices
Authors: Su Yang, Sathyanarayanan Chandramouli, Panayotis G. Kevrekidis
Abstract: We introduce and systematically investigate the generation of dispersive shock waves, which arise naturally in physical settings such as optical waveguide arrays and superfluids confined within optical lattices. The underlying physically relevant model is a nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation with a periodic potential. We consider the evolution of piecewise smooth initial data composed of two distinct nonlinear periodic eigenmodes. To begin interpreting the resulting wave dynamics, we employ the tight-binding approximation, reducing the continuous system to a discrete NLS (DNLS) model with piecewise constant initial data (i.e., a Riemann problem), where each constant state represents a discrete Floquet-Bloch mode at the continuum model level. The resulting tight-binding approximation is shown to display higher-fidelity for {deeper} periodic potentials. This reduced DNLS model effectively models the dynamics at the minima of the periodic potential of the original continuum NLS. Within such a single-band DNLS framework, we apply tools from Whitham modulation theory and long-wave quasi-continuum reductions to uncover and analyze a rich spectrum of non-convex, discrete dispersive hydrodynamic phenomena, comparing the resulting phenomenology with that of the periodic-potential-bearing continuum model.

Title: Measuring Reactive-Load Impedance with Transmission-Line Resonators Beyond the Perturbative Limit
Authors: Xuanjing Chu, Jinho Park, Jesse Balgley, Sean Clemons, Ted S. Chung, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Leonardo Ranzani, Martin V. Gustafsson, Kin Chung Fong, James Hone
Abstract: We develop an analytic framework to extract circuit parameters and loss tangent from superconducting transmission-line resonators terminated by reactive loads, extending analysis beyond the perturbative regime. The formulation yields closed-form relations between resonant frequency, participation ratio, and internal quality factor, removing the need for full-wave simulations. We validate the framework through circuit simulations, finite-element modeling, and experimental measurements of van der Waals parallel-plate capacitors, using it to extract the dielectric constant and loss tangent of hexagonal boron nitride. Statistical analysis across multiple reference resonators, together with multimode self-calibration, demonstrates consistent and reproducible extraction of both capacitance and loss tangent in close agreement with literature values. In addition to parameter extraction, the analytic relations provide practical design guidelines for maximizing energy participation ratio in the load and improving the precision of resonator-based material metrology.

Title: Real-time time-dependent density functional theory for high-energy density physics
Authors: Alina Kononov, Minh Nguyen, Andrew D. Baczewski
Abstract: Electronic response properties of high-energy density (HED) systems influence planetary structure, drive evolution of fusion targets, and underpin diagnostics in laboratory astrophysics. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) offers a versatile modeling framework capable of accurately predicting the dynamic response of HED materials -- including free-free, bound-free, and bound-bound contributions without requiring ad hoc state partitioning; capturing both collective and non-collective behavior; and applicable within the linear-response regime and beyond. We review the theoretical formalism of real-time TDDFT as applied to HED systems, provide a practical tutorial for computing relevant response properties (dynamic structure factors, conductivity, and stopping power), and comment on avenues for further development of this powerful computational method in service of HED science.

Title: From Random Determinants to the Ground State
Authors: Hao Zhang, Matthew Otten
Abstract: Accurate quantum many-body calculations often depend on reliable reference states or good human-designed ansätze, yet these sources of knowledge can become unreliable in hard problems like strongly correlated systems. We introduce the Trimmed Configuration Interaction (TrimCI) method, a prior-knowledge-free algorithm that builds accurate ground states directly from random Slater determinants. TrimCI iteratively expands the variational space and trims away unimportant states, allowing a random initial core to self-refine into an accurate approximation of exact ground state. Across challenging benchmarks, TrimCI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with strikingly efficiency gains of several orders of magnitude. For [4Fe-4S] cluster, it matches recent quantum computing results with $10^6$-fold fewer determinants and CPU-hours. For the nitrogenase P-cluster, it matches selected-CI accuracy using $10^5$-fold fewer determinants. For $8\times8$ Hubbard model, it recovers over $99\%$ of the ground-state energy using only $10^{-28}$ of the Hilbert space. In some regimes, TrimCI attains orders-of-magnitude higher accuracy than AFQMC method. These results demonstrate that high-accuracy many-body ground states can be discovered directly from random determinants, establishing TrimCI as a prior-knowledge-free, accurate and highly efficient framework for quantum many-body systems. The compact explicit wavefunctions it produces further enable direct and rapid evaluation of observables.

Title: Visualization of Entanglement Geometry by Structural Optimization of Tree Tensor Network
Authors: Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda, Kouichi Okunishi, Kenji Harada, Tomotoshi Nishino
Abstract: In tensor-network analysis of quantum many-body systems, it is of crucial importance to employ a tensor network with a spatial structure suitable for representing the state of interest. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed a structural optimization algorithm for tree-tensor networks. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the Rainbow-chain model, which has a product state of singlet pairs between spins separated by various distances as an approximate ground state. We then demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully visualize the spatial pattern of spin-singlet pairs in the ground state.

Title: Weak (non)conservation and stochastic dynamics of angular momentum
Authors: Ashot Matevosyan
Abstract: Angular momentum conservation influences equilibrium statistical mechanics, leading to a generalized microcanonical density for an isolated system and a generalized Gibbs density for a weakly coupled system. We study the stochastic decay of angular momentum due to weakly imperfect rotational symmetry of the external potential that confines the isolated many-particle system. We present a mesoscopic description of the system, deriving Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations, which are consistent with equilibrium statistical mechanics when rotational symmetry is maintained. When the symmetry is weakly violated, we formulate a coarse-grained stochastic differential equation governing the decay of total angular momentum over time. To validate our analytical predictions, we conduct numerical simulations of the microcanonical ensemble, an isolated system undergoing thermalization due to weak two-body interactions. Our coarse-grained Langevin equation accurately characterizes both the decay of the angular momentum and its fluctuations in a steady state. Furthermore, we estimate the parameters of our mesoscopic model directly from simulations, providing insights into the dissipative phenomenological coefficients, such as friction. More generally, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the behavior of the integrals of motion when the corresponding symmetry is weakly violated.

Title: Observation of Shapiro steps in an ultracold atomic Josephson junction
Authors: Erik Bernhart, Marvin Röhrle, Vijay Pal Singh, Ludwig Mathey, Luigi Amico, Herwig Ott
Abstract: The current-voltage characteristic of a driven superconducting Josephson junction displays discrete steps. This phenomenon, called the Shapiro steps, forms today's voltage standard! Here, we report the observation of Shapiro steps in a driven Josephson junction in a gas of ultracold atoms. We demonstrate that the steps exhibit universal features, and provide insight into the microscopic dissipative dynamics that we directly observe in the experiment. We find that the steps are directly connected to phonon emission and nucleation of solitonic excitations, whose dynamics we follow in space and time. The experimental results are underpinned by extensive numerical simulations based on classical-field dynamics and may enable metrological and fundamental advances.

Title: Spin-polarized transport and quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures

Abstract: We theoretically propose a one-dimensional electronic nanodevice inspired in recently fabricated semiconductor-superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator (SE-SC-FMI) hybrid heterostructures, and investigate its zero-temperature transport properties. While previous related studies have primarily focused on the potential for generating topological superconductors hosting Majorana fermions, we propose an alternative application: using these hybrids to explore controllable quantum phase transitions (QPTs) detectable through transport measurements. Our study highlights two key differences from existing devices: first, the length of the FMI layer is shorter than that of the SE-SC heterostructure, introducing an inhomogeneous Zeeman interaction with significant effects on the induced Andreev bound states (ABS). Second, we focus on semiconductor nanowires with minimal or no Rashba spin-orbit interaction, allowing for the induction of spin-polarized ABS and high-spin quantum ground states. We show that the device can be tuned across spin- and fermion parity-changing QPTs by adjusting the FMI layer length orange and/or by applying a global backgate voltage, with zero-energy crossings of subgap ABS as signatures of these transitions. Our findings suggest that these effects are experimentally accessible and offer a robust platform for studying quantum phase transitions in hybrid nanowires.

Title: Chiral Phonons Arising From Chirality-Selective Magnon-Phonon Coupling
Authors: Markus Weißenhofer, Philipp Rieger, M. S. Mrudul, Luca Mikadze, Ulrich Nowak, Peter M. Oppeneer
Abstract: Chiral phonons are desirable for applications in spintronics but their generation and control remains a this http URL we demonstrate the emergence of truly chiral phonons from selective magnon-phonon coupling in inversion-symmetric magnetic systems. Considering bcc Fe as example, we quantitatively calculate hybridized magnon-phonon quasiparticle states across the entire Brillouin zone utilizing first-principles calculations. Our findings challenge conventional magneto-elastic interpretations and reveal finite zero-point phonon angular momentum and strong anomalous thermal Hall responses linked to finite (spin) Berry curvatures. Our results further establish that the existence of chiral phonons, particularly along high-symmetry directions, is common in many magnetic materials, offering promising avenues for novel spintronic and phononic devices.

Title: Machine Learning Domain Adaptation in Spin Models with Continuous Phase Transitions
Authors: Vladislav Chertenkov, Lev Shchur
Abstract: The main question raised in the article is whether a neural network trained on a spin lattice model in one universality class can be used to test a model in another universality class. The quantities of interest are the critical phase transition temperature and the correlation length exponent. In other words, the question of transfer learning is how ``universal'' the trained network is and under what conditions. For this purpose, we applied a supervised learning procedure to three two-dimensional models for which critical properties are precisely known: the Ising model, the four-state Potts model, and the Baxter-Wu model. We consider two datasets: one with spins configurations and one with binding energy configurations. We find that estimates of the critical temperature agree well with the known results for both datasets, but not with the results of cross-testing using the energy datasets of the two models: the four-state Potts model and the Ising model. Estimates of the critical length exponent are less regular, and appear to be more accurate for energy datasets. A good example is the cross-testing using the energy dataset between Ising model and Baxter-Wu model in both training and testing directions.12

Title: Automated Materials Discovery Platform Realized: Scanning Probe Microscopy of Combinatorial Libraries

Abstract: Combinatorial materials libraries provide a powerful platform for mapping how physical properties evolve across binary and ternary cross-sections of multicomponent phase diagrams. While synthesis of such libraries has advanced since the 1960s and been accelerated by laboratory automation, their broader utility depends on rapid, quantitative measurements of composition-dependent structures and functionalities. Scanning probe microscopies (SPM), including piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), offer unique potential for providing these functionally relevant, spatially resolved readouts. Here, we demonstrate a fully automated SPM framework for exploring ferroelectric properties across combinatorial libraries, focusing on binary Sm-doped BiFeO3 (SmBFO) and ternary Al$_{1-x-y}$Sc$_x$B$_y$N (Al,Sc,B)N systems. In SmBFO, automated exploration identifies the known morphotropic phase boundary with enhanced ferroelectric response and reveals a previously unreported double-peak fine structure. In the (Al,Sc,B)N library, ferroelectric behavior emerges at the phase-stability boundary, correlating with variations in morphology and defect concentration. By integrating automated SPM with wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) and photoluminescence mapping, we resolve the composition-morphology-defect-property relationships underlying ferroelectric response and demonstrate a pathway toward a multi-tool, high-throughput characterization platform. Finally, we implement Gaussian-process-based single- and multi-objective Bayesian optimization to enable autonomous exploration, highlighting the Pareto front as a powerful framework for balancing competing physical rewards and accelerating data-driven physics discovery.

Title: A real-time approach to frequency-mixing spectroscopies: application to sum and difference frequency generation in two-dimensional crystals
Authors: Mike N. Pionteck, Myrta Grüning, Simone Sanna, Claudio Attaccalite
Abstract: We propose a computational framework to extract non-linear response functions from real-time simulations in the presence of more than one external field. We apply this approach to the calculation of sum frequency generation (SFG) and difference frequency generation (DFG). SFG and DFG are second-order nonlinear processes where two lasers with frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ combine to produce a response at frequency $\omega = \omega_1 \pm \omega_2$. Compared with other nonlinear responses such as second-harmonic generation, SFG and DFG allow for tunability over a larger range. Moreover, the optical response can be enhanced by selecting the two laser frequencies in order to match specific electron-hole transitions. To assess the approach, we calculate the SFG and DFG of two-dimensional crystals, hBN and MoS2 monolayers, from real-time solution of an effective Schrödinger equation. Within the effective Schrödinger equation, one can select from various levels of theory for the effective one-particle Hamiltonian to account for local-field effects and electron-hole interactions. We compare results obtained within the independent-particle picture and including many-body effects. Such comparison allows us to identify and characterize excitonic features in the obtained spectra. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can also extract higher-order response functions, such as field-induced second-harmonic generation. We provide an example using the hBN bilayer.

Title: Magnetoelasticity - magnetic structure interrelation - tetragonal MnPt system study
Authors: Jakub Šebesta, Karol Synoradzki, Michal Vališka, Tetiana Haidamak, Tamara J. Bednarchuk, Pablo Nieves, Dominik Legut
Abstract: Magnetic materials represent an essential ingredient for the contemporary industry. Apart from common material parameters such as magnetocrystalline anisotropy, coercivity, or saturation magnetization, magnetoelastic behavior is vital for applications serving in various devices, e.g., in acoustic actuators, transducers, or sensors providing a desirable fast response and high efficiency with respect to applied magnetic field. Magnetoelastic properties have been studied for ferromagnetic 3d elements, or especially in high symmetry systems containing rare-earth elements to achieve higher values. Since, unlike for rare earth Laves phases, in the transition metals or alloys, these effects are very weak. Here, in contrast, we analyze the magnetoelastic behavior of antiferromagnetic tetragonal system MnPt, explaining the experimentally measured data based on the theoretical calculations and discussing the influence of the magnetic structure. Particularly, we inspect the origin of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, as well as the size and source of the isotropic and anisotropic parts of magnetoelastic (magnetostriction) coefficients.

Title: Emergent Pair Density Wave Order Across a Lifshitz Transition
Authors: Luhang Yang, Elbio Dagotto, Adrian E. Feiguin
Abstract: We numerically investigate the telltale signs of pair-density-wave order (PDW) in the Kondo-Heisenberg chain by focusing on the momentum resolved spectrum in different parameter regimes. Density matrix renormalization group calculations reveal that this phase is characterized by a dispersion with two minima and four Fermi points, indicating the emergence of an effective next-nearest-neighbor hopping that arises as a second-order effect to avoid magnetic frustration. The pairs appear in the spectrum as in-gap bound states with weight concentrated in the hole pockets. The low-energy physics can be understood by means of a generalized t-J model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. Our results offer a guide for searching for experimental signatures, and for other models that can realize PDW physics.

Title: Self-trapped holes and acceptor impurities in orthorhombic Ga2O3
Authors: Eric Welch, Nathan Rabelo Martins, Lauro Guerra, Luisa Scolfaro, Luiz A. F. C. Viana, Pablo D. Borges
Abstract: The electronic and optical properties of self-trapped holes in kappa-phase orthorhombic Ga2O3 in conjunction with isoelectronic and acceptor dopants were studied using hybrid density functional theory. Hole trapping was found to be energetically favorable in all systems investigated and was further stabilized by acceptor dopants with large ionization energies. The electronic structures revealed emergent states in the band gap ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 eV above the valence band maximum, primarily composed of O 2p orbitals in all cases, with a notable contribution from Zn 3d orbitals in the Zn-doped system. Hole trapping resulted in a pronounced red shift and the emergence of additional absorption peaks, producing optical characteristics that were in closer agreement with experimental observations. In each system, the trapped hole localized near the dopant atom, predominantly on adjacent O atoms, accompanied by local lattice distortions. The valence band remained largely non-dispersive even in the presence of a hole; hole states lied near the Fermi level for isoelectronic dopants and deeper in the band gap for acceptor dopants. These findings indicate that isoelectronic doping may find an avenue for p-type doping in this polymorph of Ga2O3 if a means to mitigate self-compensation is found.

Title: Designing Topological High-Order Van Hove Singularities: Twisted Bilayer Kagomé
Authors: David T. S. Perkins, Anirudh Chandrasekaran, Joseph J. Betouras
Abstract: The interplay of high-order Van Hove singularities and topology plays a central role in determining the nature of the electronic correlations governing the phase of a system with unique signatures characterising their presence. Layered van der Waals heterostuctures are ideal systems for band engineering through the use of twisting and proximity effects. Here, we use symmetry to demonstrate how twisted Kagomé bilayers can host topological high-order Van Hove singularities. We study a commensurate system with a large twist angle and demonstrate how the initial choice of high-symmetry stacking order can greatly influence the electronic structure and topology of the system. We, furthermore, study the sublattice interference in the system. Our results illustrate the rich energy landscape of twisted Kagomé bilayers and unveil large Chern numbers (of order 10), establishing twisted bilayer Kagomé as a natural playground for probing the mixing of strong correlations and topology.

Title: Hydrodynamic fields in fluctuating environment: a model for isochoric heat capacity of simple liquids
Authors: I. P. de Freitas, F. Sobrero, A. M. S. Macedo, N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: Using functional methods, we investigate the sound quanta arising from quantized hydrodynamic fields in simple liquids at low temperatures, under the influence of high-energy processes, coming from non-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom. To model these effects on the hydrodynamic fields, we assume that the quantum fields are coupled to an additive, delta-correlated (in space and time) quantum noise field. Thus, the hydrodynamic fields are defined in a fluctuating environment. After defining the generating functional of connected correlation functions in the presence of the noise field, we perform a functional integral over all noise field configurations. This is done using a formal object inspired by the distributional zeta-function method, called the configurational zeta-function. We obtain a new generating functional written in terms of an analytically tractable functional series. This formalism allow us to obtain the excitation spectra of liquids. In the liquid, each term of the series describes the emergent non-interacting elementary excitations with the usual phonon-like dispersion relation and additional excitations with dispersion relations with gaps in pseudo-momenta space. Finally, the behavior of the constant volume specific heat as a function of temperature is obtained for different simple liquids.

Title: Critical Non-Hermitian Edge Modes
Authors: Kunling Zhou, Zihe Yang, Bowen Zeng, Yong Hu
Abstract: We unveil a unique critical phenomenon of topological edge modes in non-Hermitian systems, dubbed the critical non-Hermitian edge modes (CNHEM). Specifically, in the thermodynamic limit, the eigenvectors of edge modes jump discontinuously under infinitesimal on-site staggered perturbations. The CNHEM arises from the competition between the introduced on-site staggered potentials and size-dependent non-reciprocal coupling between edge modes, and are closely connected to the exceptional point (EP). As the system size increases, the coupling between edge modes decreases while the non-reciprocity is enhanced, causing the eigenvectors to gradually collapse toward the EP. However, when the on-site potentials dominate, this weakened coupling assists the eigenvectors to stay away from the EP. Such a critical phenomenon is absent in Hermitian systems, where the coupling between edge modes is reciprocal.

Title: Pseudopotentials, an overlooked source and remedy of DFT errors
Authors: Kuiyu Ye, Jiale Shen, Haitao Liu, Yuanchang Li, S. B. Zhang
Abstract: First-principles calculations rely heavily on pseudopotentials, yet their impact on accuracy is hardly addressed. In this work, we show that most pseudopotentials to date introduce errors, which manifest themselves as errors of atomic energy levels, leading to a $de facto$ deviation from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. We consider the atomic-level adjusted pseudopotentials, whose interplay with exchange-correlation functional provides a pragmatic correction that balances accuracy and efficiency. We benchmark our theory with bandgap calculation for 54 semiconductors containing monovalent Cu. The results, compared to those from conventional studies, not only remove all erroneous metal predictions for 11 compounds, but also reduce the mean relative error from 80\% to 20\%. Overall accuracy even exceeds those of standard hybrid functionals and GW methods.

Title: A Unifying Framework for Fractional Chern Insulator Stabilization
Authors: Peleg Emanuel, Anna Keselman, Yuval Oreg
Abstract: We present a theory of fractional Chern insulator stabilization against charge-ordered states. We argue that the phase competition is captured by an effective interaction range, which depends on both the bare interaction range and quantum geometric properties. We argue that short effective interaction ranges stabilize fractional states while longer-range interactions favor charge-ordered states. To confirm our hypothesis, we conduct a numerical study of the generalized Hofstadter model using the density matrix renormalization group. Our theory offers a new interpretation of the geometric stability hypothesis and generalizes it, providing a unifying framework for several approaches to fractional phase stabilization. Finally, we propose a route towards experimental verification of the theory and possible implications for fractional states in bands with higher Chern numbers.

Title: Polarity and anti-distortive polarons in WO3 through epitaxial shear strain
Authors: Ewout van der Veer, Martin F. Sarott, Jack T. Eckstein, Stijn Feringa, Dennis van der Veen, Johanna van Gent González, Majid Ahmadi, Horatio R. J. Cox, Ellen M. Kiens, Gertjan Koster, Bart J. Kooi, Michael A. Carpenter, Ekhard K. H. Salje, Beatriz Noheda
Abstract: Bestowing CMOS-compatible binary oxides with additional functionalities is a powerful strategy toward the realization of oxide electronics. Ideal candidates are thin films which display a strong sensitivity to strain, chemical doping or nanoscale confinement. Among these, crystalline tungsten trioxide WO3 exhibits exceptional structural flexibility, enabling a wide range of functionalities. Here, we reveal the emergence of a previously unreported polar phase in epitaxial WO3 thin films. We accomplish this by imposing epitaxial shear strain, which stabilizes a low-symmetry triclinic structure that persists up to large film thicknesses and elevated temperatures. At the atomic scale, a change in the oxygen octahedral tilt pattern facilitates this symmetry lowering into a polar phase, which manifests as a periodic in-plane polarized stripe domain configuration with needle-like bifurcations at the microscale. The stripe domain walls further exhibit a strongly enhanced electrical conductivity in conjunction with a pronounced reduction of a distortive structural mode, providing the first experimental evidence for the formation of anti-distortive polarons recently predicted in WO3.

Title: Tunable intertwining via collective excitations
Authors: Andras Szabo, R. Chitra
Abstract: The intertwining of multiple order parameters is a widespread phenomenon in equilibrium condensed matter systems, yet its exploration is often hindered by the complexity of real materials. Here, we present a controlled study of intertwined orders in a minimal and versatile driven-dissipative quantum-engineered platform. We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate at the intersection of two optical cavities, realizing two competing copies of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-breaking superradiant phase transition characterized by density wave orders. Using periodic drives that exploit dynamical symmetry reduction, we show that collective excitations can be harnessed to stabilize a variety of novel intertwined orders. Going beyond the conventional phenomenology involving Landau orders, we show the emergence of a larger class of out-of-equilibrium intertwined phases, including intertwining of purely time-crystalline orders, as well as between Landau and time crystal orders. These results should be observable in state of the art experimental setups.

Title: BaCd2P2: a promising impurity-tolerant counterpart of GaAs for photovoltaics
Authors: Gideon Kassa, Zhenkun Yuan, Muhammad R. Hasan, Guillermo L. Esparza, David P. Fenning, Geoffroy Hautier, Kirill Kovnir, Jifeng Liu
Abstract: BaCd2P2 (BCP) has been recently identified as a new solar absorber with promising optoelectronic properties. This work demonstrates that, despite having a low precursor purity (98.90% to 99.95%), synthesized BCP samples exhibit promising photoconductive carrier lifetime up to 300 ns and an implied open circuit voltage exceeding 1 V, comparable to a high-purity single-crystalline GaAs wafer. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of the promising properties of BCP, its tolerance to intrinsic defects and extrinsic impurities is investigated using first-principles defect modeling and compared with the well-studied GaAs. The results show that the nonradiative recombination rates induced by dominant deep-level intrinsic antisite defects are lower in BCP than in GaAs under typical growth conditions. Further exploration of the impact of transition metal impurities in the raw materials used to make BCP and impurities introduced during its synthesis shows that most of these do not form deep-level nonradiative recombination centers. As an impurity-tolerant counterpart of GaAs, BCP demonstrates great potentials to improve the cost to performance ratio of photovoltaics.

Title: Discontinuous percolation via suppression of neighboring clusters in a network
Authors: Young Sul Cho
Abstract: Our recent study on the Bethe lattice reported that a discontinuous percolation transition emerges as the number of occupied links increases and each node rewires its links to locally suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. However, since the Bethe lattice is a tree, a macroscopic cluster forms as an infinite spanning tree but does not contain a finite fraction of the nodes. In this paper, we study a bipartite network that can be regarded as a locally tree-like structure with long-range neighbors. In this network, each node in one of the two partitions is allowed to rewire its links to nodes in the other partition to suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. We observe a discontinuous percolation transition characterized by the emergence of a single macroscopic cluster containing a finite fraction of nodes, followed by critical behavior of the cluster size distribution. We also provide an analytical explanation of the underlying mechanism.

Title: System-Bath Approach to Rotating Brownian Motion
Authors: Ashot Matevosyan, Armen E. Allahverdyan
Abstract: Rotating equilibrated systems are widespread, but relatively little attention has been devoted to studying them from the first principles of statistical mechanics. We fill this gap by studying a Brownian particle coupled with a thermal bath made of rotating harmonic oscillators. We show that the Langevin equation that describes the dynamics of the Brownian particle contains (due to rotation) long-range correlated noise. In contrast to the usual situation of (non-rotating) equilibration, the rotating Gibbs distribution is recovered only for a weak coupling with the bath. In the presence of a uniform magnetic field, the stationary state is not Gibbsian, even under weak coupling. In this context, we clarify the applicability of the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem to classical systems in rotating equilibrium, as well as the concept of work done by a changing magnetic field. We show that the Brownian particle under a rotationally symmetric potential reaches a stationary state that behaves as an effective equilibrium, characterized by a free energy. As a result, no work can be extracted via cyclic processes that respect the rotation symmetry. However, if the external potential exhibits asymmetry, then work extraction via slow cyclic processes is possible. This is illustrated by a general scenario involving a slow rotation of a non-rotation-symmetric potential. We study sedimentation equilibrium and show that centrifugal instability is prevented by a finite friction.

Title: Machine Learning Study of Surface Reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) Surface
Authors: Payal Wadhwa, Michael Schmid, Georg Kresse
Abstract: The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$)R30° and (2$\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strongly oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.

Title: Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate
Authors: Elrina Hartman, Michael E Tobar, Ben T McAllister, Jeremy F Bourhill, Andreas Erb, Maxim Goryachev
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.01$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.797 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.442 \pm 0.01$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.

Title: Shear-driven memory effects in carbon black gels
Authors: Julien Bauland, Thomas Gibaud
Abstract: In recent years, significant effort has been devoted to developing smart materials whose mechanical properties can adapt under physical stimuli. Particulate colloidal gels, which behave as solids but can also flow under stress, have emerged as promising candidates. Resulting from the attractive interaction between their constituents, their network architecture exhibit solid-like properties even at very low volume fractions. This structural flexibility allows them to adopt various configurations and store structural information making them highly susceptible to memory effects. Shear flow, applied through rheometry, offers a simple and effective way to tune their properties and imprint a ``rheological memory'' of the flow history. However, the precise relationship between flow history and viscoelastic response remains elusive, largely due to the limited structural characterization of these systems during flow and after flow cessation. Here, we use ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) to reveal a strong structural memory in the solid state, where the microstructure formed under shear is retained after flow cessation. We identify two distinct mechanisms of structural memory, as governed by the ratio of viscous to attractive forces, namely, the Mason number. Using recently developed fractal scaling laws, we show that the rheology is fully determined by the gel microstructure. Notably, these gels exhibit a double-fractal architecture, highlighting the remarkably broad range of length scales over which these disordered materials are structured. By clarifying how memory is encoded, our results offer strategies to tune shear sensitivity of colloidal gels and design smart materials.

Title: Phase diagram and eigenvalue dynamics of stochastic gradient descent in multilayer neural networks
Authors: Chanju Park (Swansea University), Biagio Lucini (Queen Mary University of London), Gert Aarts (Swansea University)
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be obtained by studying a neural network's phase diagram, in which each phase is characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder, and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size. As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of the optimiser.

Title: Probing ice-rule-breaking transition in $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ thin film by proximitized transport and magnetic torque
Authors: Chengkun Xing, Han Zhang, Kyle Noordhoek, Guoxin Zheng, Kuan-Wen Chen, Lukas Horák, Yan Xin, Eun Sang Choi, Lu Li, Haidong Zhou, Jian Liu
Abstract: While the spin ice state of bulk pyrochlores such as $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ and $\rm{Ho_2Ti_2O_7}$ has been extensively studied in the last several decades due to its unique degenerate ground state and emergent monopole excitation, whether it survives in the thin-film form remains a mystery. The limited volume of thin-film sample makes it challenging to study the intrinsic magnetic properties. Here, we synthesized 18nm-thick $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ thin film on YSZ (Yttria-stabilized Zirconia with 9.5 mol% $\rm{Y_2O_3}$) substrate and capped it by a thin conductive $\rm{Bi_2Ir_2O_7}$ layer, and performed the proximitized magnetoresistance measurements. Our study found that the ice-rule-breaking phase transition survives but with a modified effective nearest-neighbor interaction ($\rm{J_{eff}}=$ 1.054 K) and distorted Ising spin axes ($\rm{\epsilon}=+0.051)$ compared to the bulk crystal. The results are supported by the simultaneously measured capacitive torque magnetometry. Our study demonstrates that proximitized transport is an effective tool for thin films of insulating frustrated magnets.

Title: Directed evolution effectively selects for DNA based physical reservoir computing networks capable of multiple tasks
Authors: Tanmay Pandey, Petro Feketa, Jan Steinkühler
Abstract: DNA and other biopolymers are being investigated as new computing substrates and alternative to silicon-based digital computers. However, the established top-down design of biomolecular interaction networks remains challenging and does not fully exploit biomolecular self-assembly capabilities. Outside the field of computation, directed evolution has been used as a tool for goal directed optimization of DNA sequences. Here, we propose integrating directed evolution with DNA-based reservoir computing to enable in-material optimization and adaptation. Simulations of colloidal bead networks connected via DNA strands demonstrate a physical reservoir capable of non-linear time-series prediction tasks, including Volterra series and Mackey-Glass chaotic dynamics. Reservoir computing performance, quantified by normalized mean squared error (NMSE), strongly depends on network topology, suggesting task-specific optimal network configurations. Implementing genetic algorithms to evolve DNA-encoded network connectivity effectively identified well-performing reservoir networks. Directed evolution improved reservoir performance across multiple tasks, outperforming random network selection. Remarkably, sequential training on distinct tasks resulted in reservoir populations maintaining performance on prior tasks. Our findings indicate that DNA-bead networks offer sufficient complexity for reservoir computing, and that directed evolution robustly optimizes performance.

Title: Chiral magnetnetism in an altermagnet (MnF2)
Authors: Stephen W. Lovesey
Abstract: Symmetry informed diffraction patterns for magnetically ordered MnF2 illuminated by x-rays tuned in energy to a Mn atomic resonance depend on circular polarization in the primary beam. The change in intensity of a Bragg spot with a change in handedness establishes a chiral signature for the fully compensated collinear antiferromagnet. The signature is calculated for electric dipole (E1) and electric quadrupole (E2) axial absorption events. Polar E1-E2 absorption events are forbidden by inversion symmetry in Wyckoff positions assigned to Mn ions in the established MnF2 magnetic symmetry. It is compatible with atomic altermagnetism, and the corresponding order parameter contributes to E2-E2 and magnetic neutron Bragg diffraction patterns. Moreover, spin-flip patterns from polarized neutron diffraction depend on electronic quadrupole and octupole moments that are zero for the nominal 3d5 configuration of Mn2+, which make them good tests of the actual electronic structure.

Title: Constraint correlation functions of the one-dimensional Ising model in the scaling limit
Authors: Ivan Balog, Adam Rançon
Abstract: We study the correlation function of the one-dimensional Ising model at fixed magnetization. Focusing on the scaling limit close to the zero-temperature fixed point, we show that this correlation function, in momentum space, exhibits surprising oscillations as a function of the magnetization. We show that these oscillations have a period inversely proportional to the momentum and give an interpretation in terms of domain walls. This is in sharp contrast with the behavior of the correlation function in constant magnetic fields, and sheds light on recent results obtained by Monte Carlo simulations for the correlation functions of the critical two-dimensional Ising model at fixed magnetization.

Title: Accelerating first-principles molecular-dynamics thermal conductivity calculations for complex systems
Authors: Sandro Wieser, YuJie Cen, Georg K. H. Madsen, Jesús Carrete
Abstract: Atomistic simulations of heat transport in complex materials are costly and hard to converge. This has led to the development of several noise-reduction techniques applicable to equilibrium molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. We analyze the performance of those strategies, taking InAs nanowires as our benchmark due to the diverse structures and complex phonon spectra of these quasi-1D systems. We demonstrate how, for low-thermal-conductivity systems, cepstral analysis can reduce computational demands while still delivering accurate results that do not require discarding arbitrary parts of the dataset. However, issues with this approach are revealed when treating high-thermal-conductivity systems, where the thermal conductivity is significantly underestimated. We discuss alternative methods to be used in that situation, relying on uncertainty propagation from independent simulations. We show that the contributions of the covariance matrix have to be included for a quantitative assessment of the error. The combination of these strategies with machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provides an accelerated, robust workflow applicable to a diverse set of systems, as our examples using a highly transferable MACE potential illustrate.

Title: Universality in the velocity jump in the crack propagation observed for food-wrapping films for daily use
Authors: Aoi Nohara, Ko Okumura
Abstract: The velocity jump found in the crack propagation for rubbers has been a powerful tool for developing tough rubber materials. Although it is suggested by a theory that the jump could be observed widely for viscoelastic materials, the report on a clear jump is very limited and, even in such a case, reproducibility is low, except for elastomers. Here, we use a mundane food-wrapping film as a sample and observe the crack propagation velocity with pulling the sample at a constant speed in the direction perpendicular to the crack. As a result, we find the jump occurs at a critical strain with high reproducibility. Remarkably, the plot of the crack-propagation velocity as a function of strain can be collapsed onto a master curve by an appropriate rescaling, where the master curve is found to be universal for change in the pulling speed and in the sample height. The result reveals a key parameter for the jump is the strain, suggesting the existence of a small length that governs the deformation along the crack. The present study sets limitations on future theories and opens an avenue for the velocity jump to become a tool for developing a wide variety of tough polymer-based materials.

Title: A Machine Learning Closure for Polymer Integral Equation Theory
Authors: Zhihao Feng, Christian T. Randolph, Tyler B. Martin, Thomas E. Gartner III
Abstract: Polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) theory, a descendent of Ornstein-Zernike liquid state theory, is a powerful tool to predict the structure and thermodynamics of equilibrium polymer systems, but its accuracy and applicability can be limited in some important cases. Typically, these shortcomings are traced to the analytical closure relationships used to solve the integral equations. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based closure relation trained on a dataset of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of homopolymer melts and solutions. PRISM theory with the ML closure outperforms traditional atomic closures (e.g., Percus-Yevick) in predicting the structure of typical coarse-grained model systems. We also use the ML closure to accurately model the results of small-angle neutron scattering experiments. This ML-enhanced PRISM theory can therefore enable rapid soft materials discovery and design efforts.

Title: Gravity-driven flux of particles through apertures
Authors: Ram Sudhir Sharma, Alexandre Leonelli, Kevin Zhao, Eckart Meiburg, Alban Sauret
Abstract: The gravity-driven discharge of granular material through an aperture is a fundamental problem in granular physics and is classically described by empirical laws with different fitting parameters. In this Letter, we disentangle the mass flux into distinct velocity and packing contributions by combining three-dimensional experiments and simulations. We define a dimensionless flux ratio that captures confinement-driven deviations from a free-fall limit, which is recovered when the aperture is large compared to the grain size. For spherical cohesionless grains, the deviations from the free-fall limit are captured by a single exponential correction factor over a characteristic length scale of $\sim$ 10-15 grain diameters. This is shown to be the scale over which the packing structure is modified due to the boundary. Building on the $\sqrt{gD}$ exit-velocity scaling, we propose a kinematic framework that explains the universality of granular discharge beyond empirical descriptions.

Title: Strong coupling phases of conserved growth models are crumpled
Authors: Debayan Jana, Abhik Basu
Abstract: We show that stochastically driven nonequilibrium conserved growth models admit generic strong coupling phases for sufficiently strong nonlocal chemical potentials underlying the dynamics. The models exhibit generic roughening transitions between perturbatively accessible weak coupling phases satisfying an exact relation between the scaling exponents in all dimensions $d$, and strong coupling phases. In dimensions below the critical dimension $d_c$, the latter phases are unstable and argued to be crumpled, and thus distinct from the well-known strong coupling rough phase of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in dimensions $d\geq 2$. At $d_c$, conventional spatio-temporal scaling in the weak coupling phase is logarithmically modulated and are exactly obtained.

Title: Instabilities of a Generalized Gross-Neveu Quantum Criticality
Authors: Jaewon Kim
Abstract: We study the instabilities to the conformal critical point of an exactly solvable family of Gross-Neveu models. Using conformal field theory techniques, we construct the zero-temperature phase diagram and identify the superconducting and ferromagnetic phases that destabilize the critical point. Both instabilities appear only when the fermions are strongly renormalized, above a critical anomalous dimension. A higher fermion anomalous dimension also raises the critical degree of time-reversal-symmetry breaking required to suppress superconductivity, indicating that pairing becomes more robust with stronger renormalization.

Title: Characterizing Neon Thin Film Growth with an NbTiN Superconducting Resonator Array
Authors: Kyle Matkovic, Patrick Russell, Andrew Palmer, Eric Helgemo, Lukas Delventhal, Kun Zuo, Kundan Surse, Rajib Rahman, Maja C. Cassidy
Abstract: Electrons levitating above the surface of solid neon have recently emerged as a promising platform for high-quality qubits. The morphology and uniformity of the neon growth in these systems is crucial for qubit performance in a scalable architecture. Here we report on the controlled growth and characterization of thin solid neon films using multiplexed superconducting microwave resonators. By monitoring changes in the resonant frequency and internal quality factor ($Q_i$) of an array of frequency multiplexed quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators, we quantify the spatial uniformity of the film. A pulsed gas deposition protocol near the neon triple point results in repeatable film formation, generating measurable shifts in frequency and variations in $Q_i$ across the resonator array. Notably, introducing a post-deposition anneal at 12 K for one hour improves the film homogeneity, as shown by the reduced resonator-to-resonator variance in frequency and $Q_i$, consistent with enhanced wetting. These results demonstrate resonator-based metrology as an in-situ tool for characterising neon film growth, directly supporting the development of electron on inert quantum solid qubit platforms.

Title: Improved treatment of relativistic effects in linear augmented plane wave (LAPW) method: application to Ac, Th, ThO2 and UO2
Authors: A. V. Nikolaev, U. N. Kurelchuk, E. V. Tkalya
Abstract: We examine the influence of the relativistic effects within the linear augmented plane wave method (LAPW) with the potential of general shape for solids and suggest a few ways to account them more accurately: (1) we introduce new radial dependencies for LAPW (Bloch-type) basis functions, based on two actual radial solutions of the Dirac equation for j=l-1/2 and j=l+1/2 one-electron states; (2) the canonical LAPW matrix elements for the spherically symmetric component of the potential, assuming non-relativistic radial wave functions, should be corrected; (3) we argue that for a realistic spin-orbit energy splitting of the semicore 6p-states the spin-orbit interaction constant zeta(p) should be calculated with the 6p3/2 radial component; (4) in cases when two j=l +/- 1/2 components are occupied (for example for the 6p states of actinides) the electron density, associated with the small components of valence electrons, can be taken into the calculation scheme. We demonstrate that the new treatment for the relativistic effects is capable to change the equilibrium lattice constant up to 0.15~Å and the bulk modulus up to 26 GPa. We find that the electron density of valence electrons at the nucleus increases by 2.3-4.3 times due to the inclusion of small components, which can be essential for precise description of the potential and density close to the nuclear region, important for nuclear spectroscopies. In contrast to the common believe that in plain band structure treatment UO2 is a metal, we show that in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling UO2 has a small gap of forbidden states (0.2-0.4 eV) at the Fermi level, where the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied $5f$ bands slightly overlap, as in calculations of the conduction and valence band in solid Ge.

Title: Pair-mixing induced Time-reversal-breaking superconductivity
Authors: Saswata Mandal, Chao-Xing Liu
Abstract: Experimental evidences of spontaneous time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking have been reported for the superconducting ground state in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductor 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ or chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ hybrid superlattices, and is regarded as evidence of emergent chiral superconductivity. However, the $T_c$ of these TMD superconductors is of the same order as pristine 1H or 2H-TaS$_2$, which do not show any signature of TR breaking and are believed to be conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. To resolve this puzzle, we propose a new type of pair-mixing state that mixes the dominant conventional s-wave pairing channel with the subdominant chiral p-wave pairing channel via a finite Cooper-pair momentum, based on symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis shows that the fourth-order terms in the chiral p-wave channel can lead to a variety of pair-mixing states with spontaneous TR breaking. These TR-breaking superconducting states also reveal a zero-field, junction-free superconducting diode effect that is observed in chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ superlattices.

Title: Synchronizing microwave cQED limit-cycle oscillators
Authors: Cecilie Hermansen, Jens Paaske
Abstract: Self-sustained oscillators play a central role in the stabilization and synchronization of complex dynamical systems. A number of different physical systems are currently being investigated to clarify the importance of such active components in the quantum realm. Here we explore the properties of a driven dissipative electron-photon hybrid system based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled resonantly to a voltage-biased double quantum dot (DQD). First, we establish a Hopf bifurcation at a critical value of the electron-photon coupling, beyond which an effective negative friction sustains steady limit-cycle oscillations of individual resonators. Second, we show that two such limit-cycle resonators coupled via the same voltage-biased DQD synchronize for small enough frequency detuning. A nonlinear photon Keldysh action is derived by perturbation theory in the effective circuit fine-structure constant, and the limit-cycle dynamics is analyzed in terms of resulting saddle-point, and Fokker-Planck equations. In the Markovian limit of infinite bias voltage, these results are shown to agree well with the solution of a corresponding Lindblad master equation for the DQD resonator system.

Title: MicroEvoEval: A Systematic Evaluation Framework for Image-Based Microstructure Evolution Prediction
Authors: Qinyi Zhang, Duanyu Feng, Ronghui Han, Yangshuai Wang, Hao Wang
Abstract: Simulating microstructure evolution (MicroEvo) is vital for materials design but demands high numerical accuracy, efficiency, and physical fidelity. Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science.

Title: Numerical investigation of electrostatically confined excitons in monolayer $\text{MoSe}_2$
Authors: Lefan Dolg, Moritz Scharfstädt, Andrea Bergschneider, Dante M. Kennes, Silvia Viola Kusminskiy
Abstract: We investigate exciton confinement to a quantum wire in monolayer $\text{MoSe}_2$ where the confinement is achieved by a p-i-n junction. We employ an effective-mass exciton model and solve the problem numerically, reflecting device geometries found in experimental state-of-the-art set up. Our method allows us to investigate the entire spectrum of confined states. We show the emergence of quantum confinement and study the dependence of the confined states as a function of electrical gate voltages, which are experimentally tunable parameters. We find that the confined states can be divided into bright and dark states with the dark states having small but finite oscillator strengths. Their oscillator strengths are low enough that they have not yet been detected in experiments, whereas the spectrum of the bright exciton states reproduces recent experimental measurements. Our results provide insight into the theoretical background of confined exciton states beyond the ground state and pave the way for the development of new confinement schemes as well as avenues to access the previously not detected dark states.

Title: Accelerated Prediction of Temperature-Dependent Lattice Thermal Conductivity via Ensembled Machine Learning Models
Authors: Piyush Paliwal, Aftab Alam
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is a key physical property governing heat transport in solids, with direct relevance to thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coatings, and heat management applications. However, while experimental determination of $\kappa_L$ is challenging, its theoretical calculation via ab initio methods particularly using density functional theory (DFT) is computationally intensive, often more demanding than electronic transport calculations by an order of magnitude. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predict $\kappa_L$ with DFT-level accuracy over a wide temperature range (100-1000 K). Among various models trained on DFT-calculated data obtained from literature, the Extra Trees Regressor (ETR) yielded the best performance on log-scaled $\kappa_L$, achieving an average $R^2$ of 0.9994 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0466 $W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}$. The ETR model also generalized well to twelve previously unseen (randomly chosen) low and high $\kappa_L$ compounds with diverse space group symmetries, reaching an $R^2$ of 0.961 against DFT benchmarks. Notably, the model excels in predicting $\kappa_L$ for both low- and high-symmetry compounds, enabling efficient high-throughput screening. We also demonstrate this capability by screening ultralow and ultrahigh $\kappa_L$ candidates among 960 half-Heusler compounds and 60,000 ICSD compounds from the AFLOW database. This result shows reliability of model developed for screening of potential thermoelectric materials. At the end, we have tested model's prediction ability on systems that have experimental $\kappa_L$ available that shows model's ability to search material that has desirable experimental $\kappa_L$ for thermoelectric applications.

Title: Smoothed-Cubic Spin-Glass Model of Random Lasers
Authors: Marcello Benedetti, Luca Leuzzi
Abstract: We study the equilibrium glassy behavior of a multimode random laser model with nonlinear four-body quenched disordered interactions and a global smoothed-cubic constraint on mode intensities. This constraint, which provides a more realistic representation of gain saturation than the commonly used spherical constraint, prevents intensity condensation while preserving the dense, long-range interaction structure characteristic of many multistate random lasers. The model effective Hamiltonian is a function of mode amplitudes with random frequencies and is defined on a complete mode-locked graph. Using large-scale GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations with the Parallel Tempering algorithm, we analyze systems of varying sizes to probe their thermodynamic-limit behavior. Finite-size scaling of the specific heat, of the Parisi overlap distributions, and of the inverse participation ratio's reveals a spin-glass transition, with critical exponents matching the mean-field Random Energy Model universality class. The smoothed-cubic constraint produces broad, non-condensed intensity distributions, avoiding the pseudo-condensation seen in spherical models on the same interaction graph. Our results show that more realistic gain-saturation constraints preserve spin-glass characteristics while enabling simulations of larger, more dilute systems, providing a robust framework for studying glassy random lasers with self-starting mode-locking.

Title: Lindbladian reverse engineering for general non-equilibrium steady states: A scalable null-space approach
Authors: Leonardo da Silva Souza, Fernando Iemini
Abstract: The study of open system dynamics is of paramount importance both from its fundamental aspects as well as from its potential applications in quantum technologies. In the simpler and most commonly studied case, the dynamics of the system can be described by a Lindblad master equation. However, identifying the Lindbladian that leads to general non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) is usually a non-trivial and challenging task. Here we introduce a method for reconstructing the corresponding Lindbaldian master equation given any target NESS, i.e., a \textit{Lindbladian Reverse Engineering} ($\mathcal{L}$RE) approach. The method maps the reconstruction task to a simple linear problem. Specifically, to the diagonalization of a correlation matrix whose elements are NESS observables and whose size scales linearly (at most quadratically) with the number of terms in the Hamiltonian (Lindblad jump operator) ansatz. The kernel (null-space) of the correlation matrix corresponds to Lindbladian solutions. Moreover, the map defines an iff condition for $\mathcal{L}$RE, which works as both a necessary and a sufficient condition; thus, it not only defines, if possible, Lindbladian evolutions leading to the target NESS, but also determines the feasibility of such evolutions in a proposed setup. We illustrate the method in different systems, ranging from bosonic Gaussian systems, dissipative-driven collective spins and random local spin models.

Title: Extracting the spin excitation spectrum of a fermionic system using a quantum processor
Authors: Lucia Vilchez-Estevez, Raul A. Santos, Sabrina Yue Wang, Filippo Maria Gambetta
Abstract: Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization. They determine the response of the system to external weak perturbations, its dynamical correlation functions, and provide mechanisms for the emergence of exotic phases of matter. In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.

Title: Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm Cage in Bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Systems
Authors: Kunling Zhou, Bowen Zeng, Yong Hu
Abstract: The non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is a unique localization phenomenon that confines all possible excitations. This confinement leads to fully flat spectra in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various types of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.

Title: Digital-Controlled Method of Conveyor-Belt Spin Shuttling in Silicon for Large-Scale Quantum Computation
Authors: Ryo Nagai, Takashi Takemoto, Yusuke Wachi, Hiroyuki Mizuno
Abstract: We propose a digital-controlled conveyor-belt shuttling method for silicon-based quantum processors, addressing the scalability challenges of conventional analog sinusoidal implementations. By placing a switch matrix and low-pass filters in a cryogenic environment, our approach synthesizes near-sinusoidal waveforms from a limited number of DC voltage levels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fidelity comparable to analog methods while significantly reducing wiring overhead and power dissipation. Moreover, the design offers robustness against device-level variations, enabling large-scale integration of high-fidelity spin shuttling for quantum error correction.

Title: Discrete time crystal for periodic-field sensing with quantum-enhanced precision
Authors: Rozhin Yousefjani, Saif Al-Kuwari, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: Sensing periodic-fields using quantum sensors has been an active field of research. In many of these scenarios, the quantum state of the probe is flipped regularly by the application of $\pi$-pulses to accumulate information about the target periodic-field. The emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase, as a nonequilibrium phase of matter, naturally provides oscillations in a many-body system with an inherent controllable frequency. They benefit from long coherence time and robustness against imperfections, which makes them excellent potential quantum sensors. In this paper, through theoretical and numerical analysis, we show that a disorder-free discrete time crystal probe can reach the ultimate achievable precision for sensing a periodic-field. As the amplitude of the periodic-field increases, the discrete time crystalline order diminishes, and the performance of the probe decreases remarkably. Nevertheless, the obtained quantum enhancement in the discrete time crystal phase, which is experimentally accessible using standard projective measurements, shows robustness against different imperfections and dephasing noise in the protocol. Finally, we propose the implementation of our protocol in ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices.

Title: An Analytical Characterization of Sloppiness in Neural Networks: Insights from Linear Models
Authors: Jialin Mao, Itay Griniasty, Yan Sun, Mark K. Transtrum, James P. Sethna, Pratik Chaudhari
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that training trajectories of multiple deep neural networks with different architectures, optimization algorithms, hyper-parameter settings, and regularization methods evolve on a remarkably low-dimensional "hyper-ribbon-like" manifold in the space of probability distributions. Inspired by the similarities in the training trajectories of deep networks and linear networks, we analytically characterize this phenomenon for the latter. We show, using tools in dynamical systems theory, that the geometry of this low-dimensional manifold is controlled by (i) the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix of the training data, (ii) the relative scale of the ground-truth output to the weights at the beginning of training, and (iii) the number of steps of gradient descent. By analytically computing and bounding the contributions of these quantities, we characterize phase boundaries of the region where hyper-ribbons are to be expected. We also extend our analysis to kernel machines and linear models that are trained with stochastic gradient descent.

Title: Fermionic Magic Resources of Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Piotr Sierant, Paolo Stornati, Xhek Turkeshi
Abstract: Understanding the computational complexity of quantum states is a central challenge in quantum many-body physics. In qubit systems, fermionic Gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers and hence can be employed as a natural baseline for evaluating quantum complexity. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying fermionic magic resources, also referred to as fermionic non-Gaussianity, which constitutes an essential resource for universal quantum computation. We leverage the algebraic structure of the fermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently computable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a clear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation functions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase transitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers special solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to out-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources become more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems. We further investigate the growth and saturation of FAF under ergodic many-body dynamics, highlighting the roles of conservation laws and locality in constraining the increase of non-Gaussianity during unitary evolution. This work provides a framework for probing quantum many-body complexity from the perspective of fermionic Gaussian states and opens up new directions for investigating fermionic magic resources in many-body systems. Our results establish fermionic non-Gaussianity, alongside entanglement and non-stabilizerness, as a resource relevant not only to foundational studies but also to experimental platforms aiming to achieve quantum advantage.

Title: Bayes optimal learning of attention-indexed models
Authors: Fabrizio Boncoraglio, Emanuele Troiani, Vittorio Erba, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: We introduce the attention-indexed model (AIM), a theoretical framework for analyzing learning in deep attention layers. Inspired by multi-index models, AIM captures how token-level outputs emerge from layered bilinear interactions over high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike prior tractable attention models, AIM allows full-width key and query matrices, aligning more closely with practical transformers. Using tools from statistical mechanics and random matrix theory, we derive closed-form predictions for Bayes-optimal generalization error and identify sharp phase transitions as a function of sample complexity, model width, and sequence length. We propose a matching approximate message passing algorithm and show that gradient descent can reach optimal performance. AIM offers a solvable playground for understanding learning in self-attention layers, that are key components of modern architectures.

Title: Emergence of an Epsilon-Near-Zero Medium from Microscopic Atomic Principles
Authors: L. Ruks, J. Ruostekoski
Abstract: We demonstrate that an effective near-zero refractive index can emerge from collective light scattering in a discrete atomic lattice, using essentially exact microscopic simulations. In a 25-layer array, cooperative response leads to over a thirtyfold increase in the effective optical wavelength within the medium, almost eliminating optical phase accumulation, with potential applications in spectroscopy and optical manipulation of quantum emitters. Crucially, the near-zero refractive index arises from first-principles microscopic theory, rather than being imposed through continuous phenomenological effective-medium model - providing conceptually important insight into the emergence of macroscopic electromagnetism from atomic-scale interactions.

Title: Spatially Correlated Noise Induces Transitions from the Diffusive to Ballistic Regime in Fluids
Authors: Sijie Huang, Ayush Saurabh, Steve Presse
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuating incompressible Navier--Stokes equation driven by spatially correlated thermal noise characterized by a single length scale. This formulation is constructed to preserve thermal equilibrium through the fluctuation--dissipation relation (FDR), which enforces the same spatial correlation in the viscous diffusion term and therefore gives rise to nonlocal momentum transport. Numerical simulations of tracer diffusion in fluids governed by this formulation reveal that the mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends monotonically on the correlation length $\ell$ and the correlation strength $\beta$. Intuitively, increasing $\ell$ enhances MSD and induces the emergence of an early-time ballistic regime, as a larger correlation length slows momentum diffusion. Counterintuitively, decreasing $\beta$ also increases the MSD, since a weaker correlation strength also retards momentum diffusion, whereas smaller $\ell$ or larger $\beta$ suppresses the ballistic regime and leads to a diffusive behavior. The emergence or suppression of the ballistic regime stems from how spatial correlations, incorporated through the FDR to maintain equilibrium, alter the effective momentum transport across scales. Interestingly, we further show that the resulting nonlocal diffusion is reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.

Title: Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$
Authors: Sibylle Driezen, Adrien Molines
Abstract: We study the proposed integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non-compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods. Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral problem based on a residual root generator both in the continuum limit and for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian twisted integrable models.

Title: Thermodynamic Paradox and Non-Hermitian Topological Singularities
Authors: Mario G. Silveirinha
Abstract: Unidirectional modes in magnetically biased electromagnetic systems have long been associated with a thermodynamic paradox: the absence of counter-propagating channels may produce field "hotspots" that can act as unphysical sinks of thermal radiation. Here we revisit this problem and show that, surprisingly, material dissipation alone cannot fully regularize the singular behavior of the normal modes of a nonreciprocal cavity. We demonstrate that the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material response at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our analysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and thermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and ill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms. These findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish nonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new avenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive nonreciprocal photonics.

Title: Anyons in the $π$-flux phase of fermionic matter coupled to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge field
Authors: Sven Bachmann, Leonardo Goller, Marcello Porta
Abstract: We consider a system of weakly interacting spinful lattice fermions coupled to a dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. Using reflection positivity, we prove that the ground state lies in the sector of a uniform $\pi$-flux per plaquette and that the monopoles are massive. In the presence of a staggered mass for the fermions, this yields a fully gapped, four-dimensional ground state space on large tori. It is topologically ordered. By considering adiabatic $\pi$-flux insertion, we construct dressed monopole excitations, show that their self-braiding is proportional to the Hall conductance and hence vanishes, and prove that their braiding with the fermionic excitations is that of the toric code.

Authors: Jean Liénardy, Christian Walmsley Hagendorf
Abstract: The open XXZ spin chain with the anisotropy parameter $\Delta=-\frac12$, diagonal boundary fields that depend on a parameter $x$, and finite length $N$ is studied. In a natural normalisation, the components of its ground-state vector are polynomials in $x$ with integer coefficients. It is shown that their sum is given by a generating function for the weighted enumeration of totally-symmetric alternating sign matrices with weights depending on $x$.

Title: Quantifying Local Point-Group-Symmetry Order in Complex Particle Systems
Authors: Domagoj Fijan, Maria R. Ward Rashidi, Sharon C. Glotzer
Abstract: Crystals and other condensed phases are defined primarily by their inherent symmetries, which play a crucial role in dictating their structural properties. In crystallization studies, local order parameters (OPs) that describe bond orientational order are widely employed to investigate crystal formation. Despite their utility, these traditional metrics do not directly quantify symmetry, an important aspect for understanding the development of order during crystallization. To address this gap, we introduce a new set of OPs, called Point Group Order Parameters (PGOPs), designed to continuously quantify point group symmetry order. We demonstrate the strength and utility of PGOP in detecting order across different crystalline systems and compare its performance to commonly used bond-orientational order metrics. PGOP calculations for all non-infinite point groups are implemented in the open-source package SPATULA (Symmetry Pattern Analysis Toolkit for Understanding Local Arrangements), written in parallelized C++ with a Python interface. The code is publicly available on GitHub.

Title: A study of the electronic and ionic structure, for competing states of fully and partially ionized hydrogen, using the neutral pseudo-atom method as well as a classical map for the electron subsystem
Authors: M. W. C. Dharma-wardana
Abstract: Prof. Bonitz and his collaborators have made seminal contributions to the study of the uniform electron fluid and the electron-proton fluid, viz., hydrogen, in using {\it ab initio} simulations, as reflected in this festschrift. Here we review the theoretical methods available for these systems where traditional small-parameter methods fail. We use the neutral-pseudo atom (NPA) method, and a classical map for quantum electrons to study hydrogen plasmas. We show that {\it both} fully-ionized and partially-ionized hydrogen phases can exist with the same nominal density and temperature, at pressures and temperatures of interest to planetary physics. The mean ionization $\bar{Z}$, pair-distribution functions, free energies, pressures and conductivities are calculated for the competing phases. Here $\bar{Z}$ is also a measure of the miscibility of fully ionized and un-ionized hydrogen. Recent studies using path-integral Monte Carlo methods, and $N$-atom Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations have provided essential structure data including the electron-electron structure factor $S_{ee}(k)$ that enters into interpretation of X-ray Thomson scattering and other diagnostics. We show that these structure data can be inexpensively evaluated using classical-map schemes for fully ionized plasmas, and more generally, using one-atom (average-atom) DFT methods for partially ionized systems.

Title: Topological Orders from Reflection Positive Frustration-free Hamiltonians
Authors: Zhengwei Liu, Zishuo Zhao
Abstract: We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for establishing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. For any reflection positive frustration-free Hamiltonian, We proved that the local topological quantum order (LTQO) condition of ground states on a disk holds if and only if the ground state on the sphere is non-degenerate. Furthermore, we show that the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction produces the boundary local net of operator algebras from the local ground states.

Title: Symmetry Breaking and Mie-tronic Supermodes in Nonlocal Metasurfaces
Authors: Thanh Xuan Hoang, Ayan Nussupbekov, Jie Ji, Daniel Leykam, Jaime Gomez Rivas, Yuri Kivshar
Abstract: Breaking symmetry in Mie-resonant metasurfaces challenges the conventional view that it weakens optical confinement. Within the Mie-tronics framework, we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. Through diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses, we demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronic supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, reversing the trend predicted by infinite-lattice theory. We further show that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These findings establish a unified wave picture linking scattering and diffraction theories and outline design principles for multifunctional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.

Title: Variations on a Theme of Krylov
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian, Pawel Caputa, Joan Simón
Abstract: Spread complexity uses the distribution of support of a time-evolving state in the Krylov basis to quantify dispersal across accessible dimensions of a Hilbert space. Here, we describe how variations in initial conditions, the Hamiltonian, and the dimension of the Hilbert space affect spread complexity and Krylov basis structure. We introduce Koherence, the entropy of coherence between perturbed and unperturbed Krylov bases, which can, e.g., quantify dynamical amplification of differences in initial conditions in chaos. To illustrate, we show that dynamics on SL(2,R), SU(2), and Heisenberg-Weyl group manifolds, often used as paradigmatic settings for contrasting chaotic and integrable (semi-)classical behavior, display distinctively different responses to variations of the initial state or Hamiltonian. We then describe a lattice model that displays linear growth of spread complexity, saturating for bounded lattices and continuing forever in a thermodynamic limit. The latter example illustrates a breakdown of continuum/classical effective descriptions of complexity growth in bounded quantum systems.

Title: Measurement-Based Quantum Computation Using the Spin-1 XXZ Model with Uniaxial Anisotropy
Authors: Hiroki Ohta, Aaron Merlin Müller, Shunji Tsuchiya
Abstract: We demonstrate that the ground state of a spin-1 XXZ chain with uniaxial anisotropies, single-ion anisotropy $D$ and Ising-like anisotropy $J$, within the Haldane phase can serve as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation implementing single-qubit gates. The gate fidelity of both elementary rotation gates and general single-qubit unitary gates composed of rotations about the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes is evaluated, and is found to exceed 0.99 when $D$ or $J$ is appropriately tuned. Furthermore, we derive an analytic expression for the rotation-gate fidelity under the assumption that the state lies within the $\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2$-protected Haldane phase, showing that it is determined by the post-measurement spin-spin correlation function and the failure probability. The observed enhancement of gate fidelity in the spin-1 XXZ chain originates from the strengthening of antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations near the AFM phase, which effectively suppresses failure states.

Title: A Global Spacetime Optimization Approach to the Real-Space Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation
Authors: Enze Hou, Yuzhi Liu, Lei Wang, Han Wang
Abstract: The time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) in real space is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry to condensed matter physics and materials science. However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy.
