Title: On the Convergence of Strong Cylindrical and Spherical Shock Waves in Solid Materials
Authors: R. K. Anand
Abstract: In this article, we present a description of the behaviour of shock-compressed solid materials following the Geometrical Shock Dynamics (GSD) theory. GSD has been successfully applied to various gas dynamics problems, and here we have employed it to investigate the propagation of cylindrically and spherically symmetric converging shock waves in solid materials. The analytical solution of shock dynamics equations has been obtained in strong-shock limit, assuming the solid material to be homogeneous and isotropic and obeying the Mie-Gruneisen equation of state. The non-dimensional expressions are obtained for the velocity of shock, the pressure, the mass density, the particle velocity, the temperature, the speed of sound, the adiabatic bulk modulus, and the change-in-entropy behind the strong converging shock front. The influences as a result of changes in (i) the propagation distance r from the axis or centre (r=0) of convergence, (ii) the Gruneisen parameter, and (iii) the material parameter are explored on the shock velocity and the domain behind the converging shock front. The results show that as the shock focuses at the axis or origin, the shock velocity, the pressure, the temperature, and the change-in-entropy increase in the shock-compressed titanium Ti6Al4V, stainless steel 304, aluminum 6061-T6, etc.

Title: The study of the energy spectrum of a system of quantum micro-vortices in a bounded spatial domain
Authors: S.V. Talalov
Abstract: This study focuses on microscopic-sized quantum vortex filaments that are shaped like a circle. The model we considered examines loops with different radii and a small but non-zero core diameter. These loops are located in a bounded domain $D$. The quantization scheme of the classical vortices is based on the new approach proposed by the author \cite{Tal22_1,Tal24_2}. For these loops, we calculate both the quantized circulation and the energy spectrum, which are perfectly non-trivial. To understand how the results we have obtained can be used to describe the initial stage of turbulence in a quantum fluid, we study a system of $K$ random, non-interacting vortices. We explain how specific energy and circulation spectra lead to the occurrence of turbulence in the context of the developed approach.

Title: Dynamics and lifetime of geometric excitations in moir\'e systems
Authors: Yuzhu Wang, Joe Huxford, Dung Xuan Nguyen, Guangyue Ji, Yong Baek Kim, Bo Yang
Abstract: We show that spin-2 geometric excitations, known as graviton modes, generally exhibit vanishing lifetimes in lattice Chern bands, including in moiré systems. In contrast to the Landau levels, we first numerically demonstrate that the prominent graviton peaks in spectral functions diminish rapidly with increasing system sizes. We explore how the choice of interaction affects the strength of these peaks, with short-ranged interactions pushing the graviton mode far into the continuum of excitations, where it can be significantly scattered due to the increased density of states. We also analytically investigate the short lifetime of the graviton mode. In lattice systems, continuous rotational symmetry is broken, leading to highly anisotropic gapped excitations that mix different angular momentum or "spins''. This is despite the surprising emergence of a "guiding center" continuous rotational symmetry in the ground state, which is shared by the graviton mode. Consequently, the graviton mode in Chern bands can be strongly scattered by the anisotropic gapped excitations. However, the emergent rotational symmetry implies that gravitons can be robust in principle, and we propose experimental tuning strategies to lower the graviton mode energy below the continuum. We argue this is a necessary condition enabling the observation of graviton modes and geometric excitations in realistic moiré systems.

Title: Monitored interacting Dirac fermions
Authors: Thomas Martin Müller, Michael Buchhold, Sebastian Diehl
Abstract: We analytically study interacting Dirac fermions, described by the Thirring model, under weak local particle number measurements with monitoring rate $\gamma$. This system maps to a bosonic replica field theory, analyzed via the renormalization group. For a nonzero attractive interaction, a phase transition occurs at a critical measurement strength $\gamma_c$. When $\gamma>\gamma_c$, the system enters a localized phase characterized by exponentially decaying density-density correlations beyond a finite correlation length; for $\gamma<\gamma_c$, the correlations decay algebraically. The transition is of BKT-type, reflected by a characteristic scaling of the correlation length. In the non-interacting limit, $\gamma_c\to0$ shifts to zero, reducing the algebraic phase to a single point in parameter space. This identifies weak measurements in the free case as an implicit double fine-tuning to the critical endpoint of the BKT phase transition. Along the non-interacting line, we compute the entanglement entropy from density-density correlation functions and find no entanglement transition at nonzero measurement strength in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Spectral form factor and energy correlations in banded random matrices
Authors: Adway Kumar Das, Anandamohan Ghosh, Lea F. Santos
Abstract: Banded random matrices were introduced as a more realistic alternative to full random matrices for describing the spectral statistics of heavy nuclei. Initially considered by Wigner, they have since become a paradigmatic model for investigating level statistics and the localization-delocalization transition in disordered quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that, despite the absence of short-range energy correlations, weak long-range energy correlations persist in the nonergodic phase of banded random matrices. This result is supported by our numerical and analytical studies of quantities that probe both short- and long-range energy correlations, namely, the spectral form factor, level number variance, and power spectrum. We derive the timescales for the onset of spectral correlations (ramp) and for the saturation (plateau) of the spectral form factor. Unexpectedly, we find that in the nonergodic phase, these timescales decrease as the bandwidth of the matrices is reduced. We also show that the high-frequency behavior of the power spectrum of energy fluctuations can distinguish between the nonergodic and ergodic phases of the banded random matrices.

Title: Phase space fractons
Authors: Ylias Sadki, Abhishodh Prakash, S. L. Sondhi, Daniel P. Arovas
Abstract: Perhaps the simplest approach to constructing models with sub-dimensional particles or fractons is to require the conservation of dipole or higher multipole moments. We generalize this approach to allow for moments in phase space and classify all possible classical fracton models with phase-space multipole conservation laws. We focus on a new self-dual model that conserves both dipole and quadrupole moments in position and momentum; we analyze its dynamics and find quasi-periodic orbits in phase space that evade ergodic exploration of the full phase space.

Title: Enhancing the hyperpolarizability of crystals with quantum geometry
Authors: Wojciech J. Jankowski, Robert-Jan Slager, Michele Pizzochero
Abstract: We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of non-linear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced non-linear optical properties.

Title: Enhanced Cooper pairing in nano-patterned metals
Authors: Masoud Mohammadi-Arzanagh, Andrey Grankin, Victor Galitski, Mohammad Hafezi
Abstract: Nano-patterning has been shown to be a powerful tool for manipulating the vibrational modes of elastic structures, with applications such as optical-mechanical mode coupling. Inspired by these recent developments in phononic band engineering, we propose a nano-patterning scheme to enhance the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in phonon-mediated nano-film superconductors, such as aluminum. Using the finite element method, we simulate the lattice vibrational modes of nano-patterned films within the Debye model. Our results show that periodic nano-patterning softens the lattice vibrational modes compared to bulk films. It also increases the density of states at high energies, resulting in a couple of percent enhancement in $T_c$. Moreover, we investigate connections to random matrix theory and provide an experimental design prescription to optimize nano-patterning for further enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature.

Title: Dispersion of neutral collective modes in partonic fractional quantum Hall states and its applications to paired states of composite fermions
Authors: Koyena Bose, Ajit C. Balram
Abstract: The Moore-Read Pfaffian (Pf) state exhibits two distinct neutral excitation modes, the bosonic magnetoroton mode, and the neutral fermion mode. These two modes have been conjectured to be supersymmetric (SUSY) partners in the long-wavelength limit. Previous studies on these neutral excitations of the Pf state have shown evidence in favor of SUSY in the vicinity of the second Landau level (SLL) Coulomb interaction. Inspired by that, using the framework of parton theory, we test the SUSY conjecture for a state that lies in the same universality class as the particle-hole conjugate of the Pf, namely the anti-Pf (aPf) state, by constructing explicit wave functions for its magnetoroton and neutral fermion excitations and evaluating them for very large system sizes. As with the previous studies on the Pf state, we find that the long-wavelength gaps of the neutral modes of the parton state belonging to the same topological class as the aPf are close to each other for the SLL Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, using the parton wave functions, we compute the dispersion of various neutral collective excitations, including the magnetoroton, neutral fermion, and parton-excitons, for several notable non-Abelian and Abelian states. Finally, we propose a parton-exciton ansatz for the gapped neutral excitation of the composite fermion Fermi liquid at quarter filling and compute its dispersion for the Coulomb interaction in the lowest Landau level.

Title: Effects of rotation on the thermodynamic properties of a quantum dot
Authors: Luís Fernando C. Pereira, Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of rotation on the physical properties of a quantum dot described by a radial potential and subjected to a rotating reference frame. The interplay between rotation and confinement is analyzed by solving the Schrödinger equation for the system, yielding energy levels and wavefunctions as functions of angular velocity. We compute key thermodynamic properties, including the density of states, magnetization, entropy, and heat capacity, in the absence of an external magnetic field. Our results demonstrate that rotation induces significant modifications to the energy spectrum, removing degeneracies and generating oscillatory behaviors in magnetization akin to de Haas-van Alphen and Aharonov-Bohm-type oscillations. Furthermore, we observe an effect analogous to the magnetocaloric effect, where an increase in angular velocity leads to a decrease in temperature during adiabatic processes. These results reveal the potential of rotational effects to influence quantum systems and provide insights for future studies in mesoscopic physics.

Title: Critical Current, Lengthwise Fluctuations, and Flux Jumps in REBCO CC: A Torque Magnetometry Study up to 45 T
Authors: J. Jaroszynski, A-M Constantinescu, D. Kolb-Bond, A. Francis, A. Xu, R. Ries, G. Bradford, J. Bang, J. Lee, D. Larbalestier (National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Tallahassee FL)
Abstract: REBCO (Rare Earth Barium Copper Oxide) coated conductors (CCs) have emerged for future high field magnets in fields and temperatures inaccesible for Nb based superconductors. However, their exceptionally high current densities pose challenges for characterization at low temperatures. This paper presents the design and implementation of a simple torque magnetometer especially suitable for characterizing REBCO CC. It details the construction and underlying physics, with particular emphasis on its capability to assess angular critical currents Ic in high magnetic fields and low temperatures. The study includes characterizations of multiple REBCO samples from different manufacturers, performed under magnetic fields up to 45 T, demonstrating the exceptional capabilities of REBCO CCs in extreme fields. The results reveal significant lengthwise Ic variations, especially in tapes cut from the edges of 12 mm-wide production tapes compared to those cut from the center. These variations are most pronounced when the field is in the vicinity of the ab-plane. Importantly, flux jumps are observed in samples with thick REBCO layers and thin stabilizers, underscoring potential thermal instabilities. These findings provide valuable insights into REBCO tape performance under extreme magnetic fields, highlighting their relevance for high-field magnet and nuclear fusion applications.

Title: High performance vacuum annealed beta-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/Ga2O3 HFET with f_T/f_MAX of 32/65 GHz
Authors: Chinmoy Nath Saha, Noor Jahan Nipu, Uttam Singisetti
Abstract: This letter reports high performance beta-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/Ga2O3 Heterostructure FET (HFET) with improved regrowth process. Highly scaled I shaped gate have been fabricated with degenerately doped (N++) source/drain contact regrown by ozone molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Aiming to address the limitations observed in previous generation devices, this work incorporates a low-power BCl3/Ar and SF6/Ar plasma etching process to remove the AlGaO barrier layer and Ga2O3 layer respectively before regrowth. Additionally, the surface was cleaned and vacuum annealing was carried out before MBE regrowth to reduce any interface resistance between highly doped regrowth N++ and 2DEG layer. These meticulously designed fabrication steps enabled us to achieve the high DC current 0.5 A/mm at 5V drain bias with 6.1 $\mathrm{\Omega}$.mm on resistance (R\textsubscript{ON}) at V_GS=3V, peak transconductance (g_m) of 110 mS/mm at room temperature (V_DS=15V) and around 0.8 A/mm (V_DS=5V) peak I_ON} at low temperature (100K). Current gain cut-off frequency (f_T) of 32 GHz and peak power gain cut-off frequency (f_MAX) of 65 GHz were extracted from RF measurements. f_T.L_G product was estimated to be 6.1 GHz-$\mu$m for 191 nm L_G and 32 GHz f_T, which is one of the highest reported among Ga2O3 devices. With thicker Al2O3, device shows no current collapse demonstrating first time successful traps passivation with Al2O3 for Ga2O3 devices.

Title: Pore network models for the evaporation of complex fluids in porous media
Authors: Romane Le Dizès Castell, Marc Prat, Noushine Shahidzadeh, Sara Jabbari-Farouji
Abstract: Drying of fluids undergoing sol-gel transition in porous media, a process crucial for the consolidation of damaged porous structures in cultural heritage, often leads to skin formation at the surface. This phenomenon significantly hinders evaporation, yet its precise impact on drying kinetics remains poorly understood. To uncover the governing mechanisms, we develop a novel pore network model that closely replicates quasi-2D experimental porous media, incorporating spatial gradients in pore size distribution, with smaller pores near the evaporation side. We demonstrate that this pore distribution dictates the air invasion path and extends the constant-rate period of drying in Newtonian liquids, reproducing the experimental drying curves for water. We further extend our model to capture the interplay of capillary-driven liquid flows, space-dependent viscosity increases, and localized skin formation. To incorporate skin formation, we implement a viscosity-dependent evaporation pressure rule derived from experimental data on evaporation-induced sol-gel transition within a capillary tube. We identify a simple relationship: vapor pressure decreases once the meniscus fluid viscosity exceeds a critical threshold. By accounting for localized skin formation through reduced evaporation pressure at high-viscosity throats, our model successfully captures the slowdown of drying kinetics, achieving remarkable agreement with experimental drying curve.

Title: Variational Scarring in Open Two-Dimensional Quantum Dots
Authors: Fartash Chalangari, Joonas Keski-Rahkonen, Simo Selinummi, Esa Räsänen
Abstract: Quantum scars have recently been directly visualized in graphene quantum dots (Nature 635, 841 (2024)), revealing their resilience and influence on electron dynamics in mesoscopic systems. Here, we examine variational scarring in two-dimensional quantum dots and demonstrate that these states remain robust even in an open system. We show that controlled perturbations enable modulation of electronic transmission via scarred states, presenting a viable approach to tuning quantum transport. These findings provide insights into the role of scarring in mesoscopic transport and open pathways for experimental realization in quantum devices.

Title: Electronic origin of stability of 2D 1H-phase Janus transition metal dichalcogenides and beyond
Authors: Lei Li, Ji-Chun Lian, Zi-Xuan Yang, Tao Huang, Jun-Qi Xu, Jianhang Nie, Hui Wan, X. S. Wang, Gui-Fang Huang, Wangyu Hu, Wei-Qing Huang
Abstract: Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (JTMDs) monolayers have emerged as a new paradigm to broaden the family of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Despite numerous theoretical predictions of JTMDs, their experimental realization remains scarce, most probably due to intrinsic structural fragility. We identify a dependence of the structural stability of 1H-phase JTMDs on the transition metal group, with Group-VIB-based monolayers exhibiting robust stability, as evidenced by the successful synthesized MoSSe and WSSe. The group-dependent stability arises from the competition between metal-ligand ionic bonding and ligand-ligand covalent bonding, as well as the high-energy d-electron orbital splitting. We propose an electron configuration that describes the interactions of electrons near the Fermi level to correlate the stability, and introduce an electron compensation strategy to stabilize certain unstable JTMDs systems. Guided by the electronic origin of stability, we predict a family of stable 2D Janus transition metal halides with intrinsic ferromagnetic valley properties. This work bridges the gap between electronic structure and stability predictions, and extends the design rules for synthesizing 2D Janus materials.

Title: Discrete chiral ballistic polariton laser
Authors: Zuzanna Werner, Andrzej Frączak, Valtýr Kári Daníelsson, Jacek Szczytko, Barbara Piętka, Helgi Sigurðsson
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light appears when the phase of an electromagnetic wavefront winds around its direction of propagation, also known as optical vorticity. Contrary to the binary-valued photon spin, the integer-valued optical vortex charge is unbounded with many advantages in optical communication and trapping and enhancing the capacity of data encoding and multiplexing. Singular optoelectronic and chiroptic quantum technologies rely on the development of coherent and compact light sources of well-defined and reconfigurable OAM. We propose an optically tunable discrete chiral exciton-polariton microlaser that leverages strong spin-dependent polariton interactions, structured pumping, and inherent cavity photon spin-to-angular momentum conversion to emit coherent nonlinear light of variable OAM. By choosing pumping patterns with broken inversion symmetry in the microcavity plane we invoke geometric frustration between spinor ballistic condensates which spontaneously obtain a high-charge circulating current locked with the pump polarization. Our optically configurable system requires only a planar cavity thus avoiding the need for specialized irreversible cavity patterning or metasurfaces.

Title: Can one hear the shape of a crystal?
Authors: Haina Wang, Salvatore Torquato
Abstract: Isospectrality is a general fundamental concept often involving whether various operators can have identical spectra, i.e., the same set of eigenvalues. In the context of the Laplacian operator, the famous question ``Can one hear the shape of a drum?'' concerns whether different shaped drums can have the same vibrational modes. The isospectrality of a lattice in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a tantamount to whether it is uniquely determined by its theta series, i.e., the radial distribution function $g_2(r)$. While much is known about the isospectrality of Bravais lattices across dimensions, little is known about this question of more general crystal (periodic) structures with an $n$-particle basis ($n \ge 2$). Here, we ask, What is $n_{\text{min}}(d)$, the minimum value of $n$ for inequivalent (i.e., unrelated by isometric symmetries) crystals with the same theta function in space dimension $d$? To answer these questions, we use rigorous methods as well as a precise numerical algorithm that enables us to determine the minimum multi-particle basis of inequivalent isospectral crystals. Our algorithm identifies isospectral 4-, 3- and 2-particle bases in one, two and three spatial dimensions, respectively. For many of these isospectral crystals, we rigorously show that they indeed possess identical $g_2(r)$ up to infinite $r$. Based on our analyses, we conjecture that $n_{\text{min}}(d) = 4, 3, 2$ for $d = 1, 2, 3$, respectively. The identification of isospectral crystals enables one to study the degeneracy of the ground-state under the action of isotropic pair potentials.

Title: A chain stretch-based gradient-enhanced model for damage and fracture in elastomers
Authors: S. Mohammad Mousavi, Jason Mulderrig, Brandon Talamini, Nikolaos Bouklas
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel stretch-based gradient-enhanced damage (GED) model that allows the fracture to localize and also captures the development of a physically diffuse damage zone. This capability contrasts with the paradigm of the phase field method for fracture, where a sharp crack is numerically approximated in a diffuse manner. Capturing fracture localization and diffuse damage in our approach is achieved by considering nonlocal effects that encompass network topology, heterogeneity, and imperfections. These considerations motivate the use of a statistical damage function dependent upon the nonlocal deformation state. From this model, fracture toughness is realized as an output. While GED models have been classically utilized for damage modeling of structural engineering materials, they face challenges when trying to capture the cascade from damage to fracture, often leading to damage zone broadening. This deficiency contributed to the popularity of the phase-field method over the GED model for elastomers and other quasi-brittle materials. Other groups have proceeded with damage-based GED formulations that prove identical to the phase-field method (Lorentz et al., 2012), but these inherit the aforementioned limitations. To address this issue in a thermodynamically consistent framework, we implement two modeling features (a nonlocal driving force bound and a simple relaxation function) specifically designed to capture the evolution of a physically meaningful damage field and the simultaneous localization of fracture, thereby overcoming a longstanding obstacle in the development of these nonlocal strain- or stretch-based approaches. We discuss several numerical examples to understand the features of the approach at the limit of incompressibility, and compare them to the phase-field method as a benchmark for the macroscopic response and fracture energy predictions.

Title: Supercooled Liquid Water Diffusivity at Temperatures near the Glass Transition Temperature
Authors: R. Scott Smith, Wyatt A. Thornley, Greg A. Kimmel, Bruce D. Kay
Abstract: Isotopically layered amorphous solid water films were used to measure the diffusivity of deeply supercooled liquid water near the glass transition. The films, composed of separate layers of oxygen 16 and oxygen 18 labeled water, were grown by vapor deposition at low temperature and then heated to observe the intermixing of the isotopic layers. Very slow heating rates (as low as 0.0001 K/s) were used to decouple the diffusion and crystallization processes to ensure that the observed intermixing occurred at temperatures that were well-separated from the onset of crystallization. Numerical simulations of the desorption spectra were used to extract the translational diffusivities. The diffusivities obtained in this paper are consistent with translational liquid-like motion at temperatures near and above the proposed Tg of 136 K. These findings support the idea that the melt of amorphous water, above its glass transition temperature is thermodynamically continuous with normal supercooled liquid.

Title: Nudged elastic band calculations of stacking and dislocation pathways in diamond
Authors: Chunxia Chi, Hairui Ding, Xiang-Feng Zhou, Xiao Dong
Abstract: Diamond, the hardest natural crystal, has attracted significant attention for its plasticity, which is reported to be determined by its stacking faults. Studies mainly focused on one-dimensional linear pathways in stacking transitions, neglecting its transverse freedom on the main slip plane. However, in an actual stacking procedure, stacking faults can follow curve line along the slip plane rather than constrained to straight lines. In this study, using ab initio calculations, we mapped the {\gamma}-surface, defined as the landscape of generalized stacking fault energies, along the weakest direction of the {111} orientation in diamond. We then applied the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method to determine the minimum energy paths, finding significantly reduced stacking energy barriers compared to previous reports (for the glide-set, our energy barrier is only one-third of that for the traditional direct path). Our calculations reveal that the glide-set can round its high-energy peak, with a lower energy barrier within the entire stacking plane than the shuffle-set. By employing the NEB method, we have constructed the minimum energy path (MEP) for both the stacking and dislocation procedures. Our results provide new insights into the plasticity and stacking faults of diamond, advancing the understanding of superhard carbon material transition, especially the diamond under shear stress.

Title: AI-driven materials design: a mini-review
Authors: Mouyang Cheng, Chu-Liang Fu, Ryotaro Okabe, Abhijatmedhi Chotrattanapituk, Artittaya Boonkird, Nguyen Tuan Hung, Mingda Li
Abstract: Materials design is an important component of modern science and technology, yet traditional approaches rely heavily on trial-and-error and can be inefficient. Computational techniques, enhanced by modern artificial intelligence (AI), have greatly accelerated the design of new materials. Among these approaches, inverse design has shown great promise in designing materials that meet specific property requirements. In this mini-review, we summarize key computational advancements for materials design over the past few decades. We follow the evolution of relevant materials design techniques, from high-throughput forward machine learning (ML) methods and evolutionary algorithms, to advanced AI strategies like reinforcement learning (RL) and deep generative models. We highlight the paradigm shift from conventional screening approaches to inverse generation driven by deep generative models. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future perspectives of materials inverse design. This review may serve as a brief guide to the approaches, progress, and outlook of designing future functional materials with technological relevance.

Title: Quantitative thermodynamic analyses of nucleation, evolution and stabilization of surface nanobubbles
Authors: Lili Lan, Yongcai Pan, Liang Zhao, Binghai Wen
Abstract: Surface nanobubbles are complex micro- and nanoscale fluid systems. While thermodynamics is believed to dominate nanobubble dynamics, the precise mechanism by which nanobubble evolution is driven by thermodynamics remains unclear. It is essential to understand how nanobubble nucleation and growth, nanoscale contact line movement, and gas diffusion across the liquid-bubble interface are simultaneously driven by the change in free energy, leading to the ultimate thermodynamic equilibrium of surface nanobubble systems. In this paper, we first propose a quantitative theoretical model to elucidate the thermodynamic dominance behind the dynamics and stability of the fluid system with surface nanobubbles. The present model demonstrates that thermodynamic non-equilibrium drives the gas diffusion and the contact line motion of surface nanobubbles. Overcoming the nucleation energy barrier is crucial for bubble nucleation and growth. Surface nanobubbles evolve towards the reduction of the system's free energy and stabilize at the state with minimum free energy. The thermodynamic equilibrium is accompanied by the mechanical equilibrium at the contact line and the gas diffusion equilibrium at the liquid-bubble interface, and the theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the nanobubble morphology observed in experiments. The study highlights the significant influence of gas properties and ambient conditions in promoting bubble nucleation and stability.

Title: Revealing the orbital origins of exotic electronic states with Ti substitution in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5
Authors: Zihao Huang, Hui Chen, Hengxin Tan, Xianghe Han, Yuhan Ye, Bin Hu, Zhen Zhao, Chengmin Shen, Haitao Yang, Binghai Yan, Ziqiang Wang, Feng Liu, Hong-Jun Gao
Abstract: The multiband kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 exhibits complex orbital textures on the Fermi surface, making the orbital origins of its cascade of correlated electronic states and superconductivity a major scientific puzzle. Chemical doping of the kagome plane can simultaneously tune the exotic states and the Fermi-surface orbital texture, and thus offers a unique opportunity to correlate the given states with specific orbitals. In this Letter, by substituting V atoms with Ti in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, we reveal the orbital origin of a cascade of its correlated electronic states through the orbital-resolved quasiparticle interference (QPI). We analyze the QPI changes associated with different orbitals, aided by first-principles calculations. We have observed that the in-plane and out-of-plane vanadium 3d orbitals cooperate to form unidirectional coherent states in pristine CsV3Sb5, whereas the out-of-plane component disappears with doping-induced suppression of charge density wave and global electronic nematicity. In addition, the Sb pz orbital plays an important role in both the pseudo-gap and superconducting states in CsV3Sb5. Our findings offer new insights into multiorbital physics in quantum materials which are generally manifested with intriguing correlations between atomic orbitals and symmetry-encoded correlated electronic states.

Title: Exclusive Generation of Single-Atom Sulfur for Ultrahigh Quality Monolayer MoS$_2$ Growth
Authors: Yunhao Zhang, Jingwei Wang, Yumo Chen, Xian Wu, Junyang Tan, Jiarong Liu, Huiyu Nong, Liqiong He, Qinke Wu, Guangmin Zhou, Xiaolong Zou, Bilu Liu
Abstract: Preparation of high-quality two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is the precondition for realizing their applications. However, the synthesized 2D TMDCs (e.g., MoS$_2$) crystals suffer from low quality due to the massive defects formed during the growth. Here, we report the single-atom sulfur (S1) as a highly reactive sulfur species to grow ultrahigh-quality monolayer MoS$_2$. Derived from battery waste, the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is found to be exclusive and efficient in releasing S1. The monolayer MoS$_2$ prepared by SPAN exhibits an ultralow defect density of $~7\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and the narrowest photoluminescence (PL) emission peak with full-width at half-maximum of ~47.11 meV at room temperature. Moreover, the statistical resonance Raman and low-temperature PL results further verify the significantly lower defect density and higher optical quality of SPAN-grown MoS$_2$ than the conventional S-powder-grown samples. This work provides an effective approach for preparing ultrahigh-quality 2D single crystals, facilitating their industrial applications.

Title: Superconductivity and magnetic ordering in chalcogen-intercalated graphene bilayers with charge compensation
Authors: Tommy Li
Abstract: This work introduces a new class of two-dimensional crystals with the structure AC$_8$XC$_8$, consisting of two layers of graphene, a chalcogen (X = O, S, Se, Te) intercalation layer, and an alkaline earth (A = Be, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) adlayer. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that intersect the Fermi level and give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a ferromagnetic phase with critical temperatures as high as $\sim 10^3$ K that coexists with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.

Title: Pervasive symmetry-lowering nanoscale structural fluctuations in the cuprate La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$
Authors: R. J. Spieker, M. Spaić, I. Khayr, X. He, D. Zhai, Z. W. Anderson, N. Bielinski, F. Ye, Y. Liu, S. Chi, S. Sarker, M. J. Krogstad, R. Osborn, D. Pelc, M. Greven
Abstract: The cuprate superconductors are among the most widely studied quantum materials, yet there remain fundamental open questions regarding their electronic properties and the role of the structural degrees of freedom. Recent neutron and x-ray scattering measurements uncovered exponential scaling with temperature of the strength of orthorhombic fluctuations in the tetragonal phase of $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ and $Tl_2Ba_2CuO_{6+y}$, unusual behavior that closely resembles prior results for the emergence of superconducting fluctuations, and that points to a common origin rooted in inherent correlated structural inhomogeneity. Here we extend the measurements of $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ to higher temperatures in the parent compound (x=0) and to optimal doping (x=0.155), and we furthermore investigate the effects of in-situ in-plane uniaxial stress. Our neutron scattering result for undoped $La_2CuO_4$ complement prior x-ray data and reveal that the structural fluctuations persist to the maximum experimental temperature of nearly 1000K, i.e., to a significant fraction of the melting point. At this temperature, the spatial correlation length extracted from the momentum-space data is still about three lattice constants. The neutron scattering experiment enables quasistatic discrimination and reveals that the response is increasingly dynamic at higher temperatures. We also find that uniaxial stress up to 500 MPa along the tetragonal [110] direction, which corresponds to a strain of about 0.2%, does not significantly alter this robust behavior. Overall, these results support the notion that subtle, underlying inhomogeneity underpins the cuprate phase diagram. Finally, we uncover (for x=0.2) low-energy structural fluctuations at a nominally forbidden reflection. While the origin of these fluctuations is not clear, they might be related to the presence of extended defects such as dislocations or stacking faults.

Title: Dipolar and quadrupolar correlations in the $5d^2$ Re-based double perovskites Ba$_2$YReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$ScReO$_6$
Authors: Otkur Omar, Yang Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Wei Tian, Elbio Dagotto, Gang Chen, Taka-hisa Arima, Matthew B. Stone, Andrew D. Christianson, Daigorou Hirai, Shang Gao
Abstract: Double perovskites containing heavy transition metal ions are an important family of compounds for the study of the interplay between electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling. Here, by combining magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron scattering measurements, we investigate the dipolar and quadrupolar correlations in two prototype rhenium-based double perovskite compounds, Ba$_2$YReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$ScReO$_6$. A type-I dipolar antiferromagnetic ground state with a propagation vector $\mathbf{q} = (0, 0, 1)$ is observed in both compounds. At temperatures above the magnetic transitions, a quadrupolar ordered phase is identified. Weak spin excitations, which are gapped at low temperatures and softened in the correlated paramagnetic phase, are explained using a minimal model that considers both the dipolar and quadrupolar interactions. At larger wavevectors, we observe dominant phonon excitations that are well described by density functional calculations.

Title: Observation of slow relaxation due to Hilbert space fragmentation in strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard chains
Authors: Kantaro Honda, Yosuke Takasu, Shimpei Goto, Hironori Kazuta, Masaya Kunimi, Ippei Danshita, Yoshiro Takahashi
Abstract: While isolated quantum systems generally thermalize after long-time evolution, there are several exceptions defying thermalization. A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide the first experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.

Title: Elimination of substrate-induced FMR linewidth broadening in the epitaxial system YIG-GGG by microstructuring
Authors: David Schmoll, Rostyslav O. Serha, Jaganandha Panda, Andrey A. Voronov, Carsten Dubs, Michal Urbánek, Andrii V. Chumak
Abstract: Modern quantum technologies and hybrid quantum systems offer the opportunity to utilize magnons on the level of single excitations. Long lifetimes, low decoherence rates, and a strong coupling rate to other subsystems propose the ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet (YIG), grown on a gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate, as a suitable platform to host magnonic quantum states. However, the magnetic damping at cryogenic temperatures significantly increases due to the paramagnetic character and the highly inhomogeneous stray field of GGG, as recent experiments and simulations pointed out. Here, we report on temperature dependent ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy studies in YIG-GGG thin-films with different sample geometries. We experimentally demonstrate how to eliminate the asymmetric stray field-induced linewidth broadening via microstructuring of the YIG film. Additionally, our experiments reveal evidence of a non-Gilbert like behavior of the linewidth at cryogenic temperatures, independent of the inhomogeneous GGG stray field.

Title: Robust spin-orbit coupling in semi-metallic SrIrO3 under hydrostatic pressure
Authors: Dirk Fuchs, Arun Kumar Jaiswal, Fabrice Wilhelm, Di Wang, Andre Rogalev, Matthieu Le Tacon
Abstract: The semi-metallic behavior of the perovskite iridate SrIrO3 shifts the end-member of the strongly spin-orbit (SO) coupled Ruddlesden-Popper series Srn+1IrnO3n+1 away from the Mott insulating regime and the half-filled pseudospin Jeff=1/2 ground state well-established in the layered iridates (n = 1 and 2). To investigate the robustness of the SO coupled ground state of SrIrO3, X-ray absorption spectroscopy was carried out at the Ir L2,3 edges under hydrostatic pressure up to 50 GPa at room temperature. The effective SO coupling was deduced from the branching ratio of the Ir L2 and L3 white lines. With increasing pressure, the branching ratio decreases, and the Ir L2,3 peak positions shift to higher energies. The number of 5d holes remains constant indicating that the spectral weight redistribution and peak shifts arise from orbital mixing between t2g and eg related states. The expectation value of the angular part of the SO operator <LS> decreases by about 15% at 50 GPa. This reduction, which is very similar to that observed in the layered iridates, is well explained by an increase of the octahedral crystal field due to the shortening of the Ir-O bond-length under compression. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the orbital mixing and <LS> decrease as the crystal field increases. However, the effective SO coupling remains robust against pressure and does not indicate a covalency-driven breakdown within the investigated pressure range.

Title: Thermoelastic Damping Across the Phase Transition in van der Waals Magnets
Authors: Alvaro Bermejillo-Seco, Xiang Zhang, Maurits J.A. Houmes, Makars Šiškins, Herre S.J. van der Zant, Peter G. Steeneken, Yaroslav M. Blanter
Abstract: A quantitative understanding of the microscopic mechanisms responsible for damping in van der Waals nanomechanical resonators remains elusive. In this work, we investigate van der Waals magnets, where the thermal expansion coefficient exhibits an anomaly at the magnetic phase transition due to magnetoelastic coupling. Thermal expansion mediates the coupling between mechanical strain and heat flow and determines the strength of thermoelastic damping (TED). Consequently, variations in the thermal expansion coefficient are reflected directly in TED, motivating our focus on this mechanism. We extend existing TED models to incorporate anisotropic thermal conduction, a critical property of van der Waals materials. By combining the thermodynamic properties of the resonator material with the anisotropic TED model, we examine dissipation as a function of temperature. Our findings reveal a pronounced impact of the phase transition on dissipation, along with transitions between distinct dissipation regimes controlled by geometry and the relative contributions of in-plane and out-of-plane thermal conductivity. These regimes are characterized by the resonant interplay between strain and in-plane or through-plane heat propagation. To validate our theory, we compare it to experimental data of the temperature-dependent mechanical resonances of FePS$_3$ resonators.

Title: Significant Chiral Magnetotransport Magnified by Multiple Weyl Nodes
Authors: Bo Zhang, Junbo Liao, Zhentao Huang, Yanyan Shangguan, Shufan Cheng, Hao Xu, Zihang Song, Shuai Dong, Song Bao, Rui Wang, Jinsheng Wen
Abstract: The intertwining of magnetism with topology is known to give rise to exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we explore the magnetotransport properties of NdAlSi, a magnetic Weyl semimetal that spontaneously breaks inversion and time-reversal symmetries and hosts a large number of Weyl nodes. We observe a significant negative magnetoresistance, which we attribute to the chiral anomaly associated with multiple Weyl nodes. Remarkably, the extracted chiral coefficient reaches approximately $52~\mathrm{m\Omega}^{-1}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}~\mathrm{T}^{-2}$, larger than many other topological materials. Additionally, we observe an exotic anomalous Hall effect with an out-of-sync behavior, where the anomalous Hall resistance does not exactly follow the field dependence of the magnetization, in contrast to that in conventional ferromagnets. These rich quantum transport phenomena, driven by the interplay between magnetism and Weyl nodes, establish NdAlSi as a prime platform for exploring the intricate topological behaviors of magnetic Weyl semimetals.

Title: Spin-valley polarization control in WSe$_2$ monolayers using photochemical doping
Authors: E. Katsipoulaki, K. Mourzidis, V. Jindal, D. Lagarde, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, G. Kopidakis, X. Marie, M.M. Glazov, E. Stratakis, G. Kioseoglou, I. Paradisanos
Abstract: We report on the influence of a photochemical doping method on the spin-valley polarization degree ($P_{c}$) of excitons in WSe$_2$ monolayers. By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.

Title: Imprinting of skyrmions and bimerons in an antiferromagnet
Authors: Coline Thevenard, Miina Leiviskä, Richard F. L. Evans, Daria Gusakova, Vincent Baltz
Abstract: Topologically protected magnetic states in condensed matter physics, particularly antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions (Sks) and bimerons (Bms), offer promising prospects for terahertz dynamics and sustained current-induced motion, thanks to their compensating multiple sub-lattice structure. However, nucleating AFM Sks and Bms is challenging due to the lack of net magnetization. Previous attempts to imprint pre-defined Sks and Bms in a ferromagnet (FM) and transfer them to an AFM using interfacial exchange bias in FM/AFM heterostructures have been hindered by complex multilayers with discontinuities, polycrystallinity, or multipartite chiral AFMs. Employing atomistic spin simulations, we demonstrate the viability of texture imprinting for nucleating Sks and Bms in AFMs, using a prototypical bipartite AFM layer in a multilayer structure free from discontinuities. Such imprinting is a crucial step towards understanding the static and dynamic properties of natural antiferromagnetic textures and their unique properties.

Title: Optical Properties of Aluminium-Doped Zinc Oxide Thin Films Synthesized via AACVD Using Nitrogen as a Carrier Gas
Authors: Kingsley Imoni-Ogbe, Onyekachukwu Mike Osiele, Vincent Akpoveta, Queen Umudi, Bright Ugbolu, Oscar Enajite
Abstract: The study uses AACVD technology with nitrogen carrier gas to make AZO thin films through which it determines structural, optical, and morphological changes from 0 to 20 percent aluminum doping. The depositions took place at 400 degrees Celsius on soda-lime glass before the samples received an annealing process at 450 degrees Celsius inside a nitrogen chamber. The X-ray diffraction analysis identified superior crystalline structure in films processed with nitrogen gas through their strong signals at the 220, 311 and 222 peaks. The increasing levels of aluminum doping decreased the crystallite dimensions and elevated grain boundary concentrations because of intensified crystal tension and defective structural formation. The profilometry assessment determined film thickness increased mildly from 102 nanometers in undoped ZnO to 115 nanometers in 20 percent aluminum-doped ZnO. The presence of nitrogen annealing in the films led to increased absorbance while the strongest absorbance peaks occurred when the material contained 5 percent dopants. The bandgap energy expanded through the change from undoped ZnO with 3.21 electron volts to 3.33 electron volts at 20 percent aluminum doping which matched Burstein-Moss effect results. The optoelectronic devices gain enhanced optical characteristics from the doping levels exceeding 15 percent.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of interactions between cathode, electrolyte, anode, and packaging during battery operation is crucial for advancing performances but remains overlooked due to the lack of characterisation technics capable of measuring these components simultaneously. We perform a holistic investigation of a compact all-solid-state-battery using operando synchrotron X-ray micro-diffraction imaging. We image in real time and simultaneously the lattice parameter and crystal orientation of the dense LiCoO2 cathode, the Ti current collector and the electrodeposited Li metal anode. We reveal that reaction mechanism of LiCoO2 depends on the crystal orientation, and that, in dense electrodes as opposed to porous ones, the delithiation is limited by the formation of a Li-rich insulating interface. Li metal crystal orientation is found to be influenced initially by the Ti texture and to change within minutes during plating and stripping. These results demonstrate the power of X-ray imaging to link reaction mechanism and grain orientation during non-equilibrium processes.

Title: Altermagnetic spin splitting and symmetry-enforced partial spin degeneracy in hexagonal MnTe
Authors: Suman Rooj, Nirmal Ganguli
Abstract: Besides hosting several intriguing physical properties, the recently discovered time-reversal-asymmetric antiferromagnets, known as altermagnets, hold immense promise for technologies based on spintronics. Understanding the symmetry conditions leading to the spin-splitting becomes the key to further progress in the field. Hexagonal MnTe emerges as an even-parity magnet within the altermagnet family. In this work, using ab initio density functional theory (DFT) within a combination of an appropriate exchange-correlation functional and the relevant corrections, we uncover the spin-splitting features of MnTe. Our calculations reveal the spin degeneracy to be preserved in the $k_z = 0$ and $k_y = 0$ planes, while spin-splitting is observed everywhere else in the Brillouin zone, except the nodal lines identified here. To explain these findings, we provide a comprehensive symmetry analysis based on magnetic space group theory and introduce an insightful symmetry-adapted model Hamiltonian that qualitatively describes the spin-splitting behavior in different parts of the Brillouin zone. Our calculations considering spin-orbit interaction reveal no weak ferromagnetism in MnTe. Nevertheless, we discuss plausible explanations for weak ferromagnetism and anomalous Hall effect reported from experiments. Our comprehensive analysis of the magnetic space group symmetry and the DFT results leads to a thorough understanding of altermagnetism in MnTe, paving the way for possible future technology.

Title: Electronic structure property relationship in glassy Ti-Zr-Nb-(Cu,Ni,Co)
Authors: Marko Kuveždić, Emil Tafra, Emil Babić, Ramir Ristić, Krešo Zadro, Damir Starešinić, Ignacio A. Figueroa, Mario Basletić
Abstract: In this work we revisit vast amount of existing data on physical properties of Ti-Zr-Nb-(Cu,Ni,Co) glassy alloys over a broad range of concentrations (from the high entropy range to that of conventional Cu-, Ni- or Co-rich alloys). By using our new approach based on total content of late transition metal(s), we derive a number of physical parameters of a hypothetical amorphous TiZrNb alloy: lattice parameter $a = (3.42 \pm 0.02)$Å, Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma = 6.2\,$mJ/mol$\,$K$^2$, density of states at $N(E_F) = 2.6\,(\text{at eV})^{-1}$, magnetic susceptibility $(2.00 \pm 0.05)\,$mJ/T$^2\,$mol, superconducting transition temperature $T_c = (8 \pm 1)\,$K, upper critical field $\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) = (20 \pm 5)\,$T, and coherence length $\xi(0) = (40 \pm 3)\,$Å. We show that our extrapolated results for amorphous TiZrNb alloy would be similar to that of crystalline TiZrNb, except for superconducting properties (most notably the upper critical field $H_{c2}(0)$), which might be attributed to the strong topological disorder of the amorphous phase. Also, we offer an explanation of the discrepancy between the variations of $T_c$ with the average number of valency electrons in neighboring alloys of 4d transition metals and some high entropy alloys. Overall, we find that our novel method of systematic analysis of results is rather general, as it can provide reliable estimates of the properties of any alloy which has not been prepared as yet.

Title: Symmetry Preservation in Commensurate Twisted Bilayers
Authors: David T. S. Perkins
Abstract: Symmetry plays a key role in materials hosting Dirac electrons and underpins our ability to completely flatten the Dirac cone through the tuning of physical parameters such as twisting in van der Waals heterostructures. The emergent moiré patterns in twisted bilayers at small twist angles appear, at first glance, to be independent of the initial stacking order and hence are only shifted when one layer is translated with respect to the other. However, when the twist angle is large, differences can be seen at the level of both the lattice and electronic structure in the case of twisted bilayer graphene. In this work, we first address the problem of twisted Kagome bilayers and show that the rotational and dihedral symmetry of high-symmetry Kagome bilayers is preserved for all commensurate twist angles with a 6-fold symmetric twist centre. Hence, we demonstrate that the exact symmetry of small twist angle systems depends upon the initial stacking of the bilayer. We further apply the principles of our method to twisted bilayer graphene with a 3-fold symmetric twist centre to recover the results of [E. J. Mele, Phys. Rev. B 81, 161405 (2010)].

Title: Thermal transport of amorphous hafnia across the glass transition
Authors: Zezhu Zeng, Xia Liang, Zheyong Fan, Yue Chen, Michele Simoncelli, Bingqing Cheng
Abstract: Heat transport in glasses across a wide range of temperature is vital for applications in gate dielectrics and heat insulator. However, it remains poorly understood due to the challenges of modeling vibrational anharmonicity below glass transition temperature and capturing configurational dynamics across the transition. Interestingly, recent calculations predicted that amorphous hafnia (a-HfO$_2$) exhibits an unusual drop in thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) with temperature, contrasting with the typical rise or saturation observed in glasses upon heating. Using molecular dynamics simulations with a machine-learning-based neuroevolution potential, we compute the vibrational properties and $\kappa$ of a-HfO$_2$ from 50~K to 2000~K. At low temperatures, we employ the Wigner transport equation to incorporate both anharmonicity and Bose-Einstein statistics of atomic vibration in the calculation of $\kappa$. At above 1200~K, atomic diffusion breaks down the Lorentzian-shaped quasiparticle picture and makes the lattice-dynamics treatment invalid. We thus use molecular dynamics with the Green-Kubo method to capture convective heat transport in a-HfO$_2$ near the glass transition at around 1500~K. Additionally, by extending the Wigner transport equation to supercooled liquid states, we find the crucial role of low-frequency modes in facilitating heat convection. The computed $\kappa$ of a-HfO$_2$, based on both Green-Kubo and Wigner transport theories, reveals a continuous increase with temperature up to 2000~K.

Title: A Robust Machine Learned Interatomic Potential for Nb: Collision Cascade Simulations with accurate Defect Configurations
Authors: Utkarsh Bhardwaj, Vinayak Mishra, Suman Mondal, Manoj Warrier
Abstract: Niobium (Nb) and its alloys are extensively used in various technological applications owing to their favorable mechanical, thermal and irradiation properties. Accurately modeling Nb under irradiation is essential for predicting microstructural changes, defect evolution, and overall material performance. Traditional interatomic potentials for Nb fail to predict the correct self-interstitial atom (SIA) configuration, a critical factor in radiation damage simulations. We develop a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using the Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (SNAP) framework, trained on ab-initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which accurately captures the relative stability of different SIA dumbbell configurations. The resulting potential reproduces DFT-level accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency for large-scale Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Through a series of validation tests involving elastic, thermal, and defect properties -- including collision cascade simulations -- we show that our SNAP potential resolves persistent limitations in existing Embedded Atom Method (EAM) and Finnis--Sinclair (FS) potentials and is effective for MD simulations of collision cascades. Notably, it accurately captures the ground-state SIA configuration of Nb in the primary damage of a collision cascade, offering a robust tool for predictive irradiation studies.

Title: Magnetic texture control in ion-implanted metamaterials
Authors: Christina Vantaraki, Kristina Ignatova, Dmitrii Moldarev, Matías P. Grassi, Michael Foerster, Daniel Primetzhofer, Unnar B. Arnalds, Vassilios Kapaklis
Abstract: We study experimentally the impact of the additive fabrication method on the magnetic properties of Fe$^+$-implanted Pd square artificial spin ice lattices. Our findings show that these lattices undergo magnetic collapse at higher temperatures than their continuous film counterparts. This behavior is attributed to the additive fabrication process, which induces an inhomogeneous Fe concentration within the lattice building blocks. Moreover, the implantation process creates a magnetic depth profile, enabling temperature-dependent tunability of the magnetic thickness. These additional internal degrees of freedom broaden the design possibilities for magnetic metamaterials, allowing precise fine-tuning of their static and dynamic properties to achieve complex and customizable behaviors.

Title: Ultra-giant Tunneling Magnetoresistance with Two-dimensional Altermagnetic MBene electrode: from material design to device modeling
Authors: Weiwei Sun, Mingzhuang Wang, Litao Sun, Baisheng Sa, Shaui Dong, Raghottam M Sattigeri, Carmine Autieri
Abstract: Altermagnetism is an emerging series of unconventional magnetic materials characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split bands in the momentum space with zero net magnetization. Metallic altermagnets offer unique advantages for exploring applications in spintronics as conductive metals allows for serving as electrode in magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) and/or manipulation of spincurrent through external field. Through density functional theory calculations, the 2D altermagnet Cr4B3N was predicted to be stable, resulting from a N atom substitution in the FeSe-like CrB bilayer. Both intra- and inter-layered magnetic exchanges between Cr atoms are in antiferromagnetic with the first three neighbours. Leveraging the anisotropic spin-splittings with momentum dependency revealed in band structure, we designed three edge dependent Cr4B3N/square/Cr4B3N in-plane MTJs with the 7 Åvaccume the barrie. We found that the Cr-B vertical edge-assembled electrodes based MTJs exhibited giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios of 91001% , by aligning the conduction channels of the electrodes in parallel and anti-parallel states in the momentum space. Our work deepens and generalizes understanding toward altermagnetic 2D metallic electrode with a newly established metal boride (MBene), and broadens applications of the nanoscale spintronics.

Title: Thermal spin wave noise as a probe for the Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interaction
Authors: Aurore Finco, Pawan Kumar, Van Tuong Pham, Joseba Urrestarazu-Larrañaga, Rodrigo Guedas Garcia, Maxime Rollo, Olivier Boulle, Joo-Von Kim, Vincent Jacques
Abstract: Interfacial Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is a key ingredient in the stabilization of chiral magnetic states in thin films. Its sign and strength often determine crucial properties of magnetic objects, like their topology or how they can be manipulated with currents. A few experimental techniques are currently available to measure DMI quantitatively, based on the study of domain walls, spin waves, or spin-orbit torques. In this work, we propose a qualitative variant of spin wave methods. We rely on magnetic noise from confined thermal spin waves in domain walls and skyrmions in perpendicularly magnetized thin films, which we probe with scanning NV center relaxometry. We show both numerically and experimentally that the sign of the DMI can be inferred from the amplitude of the detected noise, which is affected by the non-reciprocity in the spin wave dispersion. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the noise distribution around the contour of magnetic skyrmions reveals their Néel/Bloch nature, giving therefore also insight into the strength of DMI involved in their stabilization.

Title: Cavity engineering of solid-state materials without external driving
Authors: I-Te Lu, Dongbin Shin, Mark Kamper Svendsen, Simone Latini, Hannes Hübener, Michael Ruggenthaler, Angel Rubio
Abstract: Confining electromagnetic fields inside an optical cavity can enhance the light-matter coupling between quantum materials embedded inside the cavity and the confined photon fields. When the interaction between the matter and the photon fields is strong enough, even the quantum vacuum field fluctuations of the photons confined in the cavity can alter the properties of the cavity-embedded solid-state materials at equilibrium and room temperature. This approach to engineering materials with light avoids fundamental issues of laser-induced transient matter states. To clearly differentiate this field from phenomena in driven systems, we call this emerging field cavity materials engineering. In this review, we first present theoretical frameworks, especially, ab initio methods, for describing light-matter interactions in solid-state materials embedded inside a realistic optical cavity. Next, we overview a few experimental breakthroughs in this domain, detailing how the ground state properties of materials can be altered within such confined photonic environments. Moreover, we discuss state-of-the-art theoretical proposals for tailoring material properties within cavities. Finally, we outline the key challenges and promising avenues for future research in this exciting field.

Title: Epitaxial strain tuning of electronic and spin excitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films
Authors: Hengyang Zhong, Haobo, Yuan Wei, Zhijia Zhang, Ruixian Liu, Xinru Huang, Xiao-Sheng Ni, Marli dos Reis Cantarino, Kun Cao, Yuefeng Nie, Thorsten Schmitt, Xingye Lu
Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} > 40$ K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) thin films under in-plane biaxial compressive strain underscores the pivotal role of epitaxial strain in tuning exotic electronic states and provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the strain-dependent electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with biaxial strain ranging from $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$ to $1.91\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO thin film grown on LaAlO$_3$ (with $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and enhanced spin excitation bandwidth. In contrast, the 0.4 eV and 1.6 eV $dd$ excitations associated with the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, along with the spin excitations, are significantly suppressed in the film grown on SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon\approx1.91\%$). The $c$-axis compression and the reduced out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle, induced by in-plane tensile strain in LNO/SrTiO$_3$ broaden the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ bandwidth and decrease the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization, thereby suppressing the $dd$ excitations. The evolution of spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, which can be attributed to the strain-tuned Ni-O-Ni bond angle. Since superconductivity is observed only in films with in-plane compressive strain ($\epsilon\sim-2\%$), the strain-dependent spin correlations align with the emergence of superconductivity, providing indirect evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated unconventional superconductivity in LNO.

Title: Separation between long- and short-range part of the Coulomb interaction in low dimensional systems: implications for the macroscopic screening length and the collective charge excitations
Authors: Pierluigi Cudazzo
Abstract: Collective charge excitations directly probed in electron energy loss and inelastic X rays scattering spectroscopies play a key role in different fields of condensed matter physics. Being induced by the long-range part of the Coulomb interaction between particles, in standard bulk systems they appear as well-defined features in the spectra associated to the zero crossing of the real part of the macroscopic dielectric function. However, this simple criterion cannot be used to identify collective excitations in low dimensional systems where the macroscopic dielectric function is not a well defined concept. In this work, we discuss how this problem can be traced back to the definition of the long-range Coulomb interaction and we show how the appropriate separation between long- and short-range Coulomb interaction allows one to correctly express the low dimensional macroscopic dielectric function in terms of microscopic quantities accessible in first-principles calculations. This allows disentangling collective charge excitations in low dimensional materials in analogy with what one does in standard bulk systems. In addition, we show how important macroscopic quantities, such as the screening length scale, can be extracted from full first principle calculations. As an illustrative example we perform a study of the screening effects and the collective excitations in prototypical 2D materials including metals (NbSe2) as well as semiconductors (BN and MoS2).

Title: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Au/FeCo/Au ultrathin films: Combined experimental and first-principles study
Authors: Justyn Snarski-Adamski, Hubert Głowiński, Justyna Rychły-Gruszecka, Piotr Kuświk, Mirosław Werwiński
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions with a magnetic layer with perpendicular anisotropy are currently used in computer memories that do not require voltage sustaining. An example of layers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are ultrathin FeCo films on Au substrate. Here, we present an experimental and computational study of Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ layers with a thickness up to two nanometers. The investigated FeCo layers are surrounded on both sides by Au layers. In experiment, we found perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in FeCo polycrystalline films with a thickness below 0.74 nm (five atomic monolayers). We also measured a strong surface contribution to effective magnetic anisotropy. From the density functional theory we determined structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the FeCo films. The calculations showed an irregular dependence of magnetic anisotropy on FeCo layer thickness. We observed perpendicular anisotropy for one- and three-atom FeCo monolayers and in-plane anisotropy for two- and four-atom monolayers. However, the determination of running averages of magnetic anisotropy (of three successive thicknesses of atomic monolayers) leads to a close linear thickness dependence of magnetic anisotropy, similar to the experimental result. The reason why the properties of the several-atom-thick FeCo layers differ so significantly from those of the bulk parent material is the disappearance of the central region of the layer whose properties approximate those of the bulk, and instead the existence of near-interface regions with properties altered by the presence of discontinuities.

Title: From Kernels to Features: A Multi-Scale Adaptive Theory of Feature Learning
Authors: Noa Rubin, Kirsten Fischer, Javed Lindner, David Dahmen, Inbar Seroussi, Zohar Ringel, Michael Krämer, Moritz Helias
Abstract: Theoretically describing feature learning in neural networks is crucial for understanding their expressive power and inductive biases, motivating various approaches. Some approaches describe network behavior after training through a simple change in kernel scale from initialization, resulting in a generalization power comparable to a Gaussian process. Conversely, in other approaches training results in the adaptation of the kernel to the data, involving complex directional changes to the kernel. While these approaches capture different facets of network behavior, their relationship and respective strengths across scaling regimes remains an open question. This work presents a theoretical framework of multi-scale adaptive feature learning bridging these approaches. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we derive analytical expressions for network output statistics which are valid across scaling regimes and in the continuum between them. A systematic expansion of the network's probability distribution reveals that mean-field scaling requires only a saddle-point approximation, while standard scaling necessitates additional correction terms. Remarkably, we find across regimes that kernel adaptation can be reduced to an effective kernel rescaling when predicting the mean network output of a linear network. However, even in this case, the multi-scale adaptive approach captures directional feature learning effects, providing richer insights than what could be recovered from a rescaling of the kernel alone.

Title: Automatic Generation of Maximally Localized Wannier Functions via Optimized Projection Functions and Self-projections
Authors: Sebastian Tillack, Claudia Draxl
Abstract: We present an automatized approach towards maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) applicable to both occupied and unoccupied states. We overcome limitations of the standard optimized projection function (OPF) method and its approximations by providing an exact expression for the gradient of the Wannier spread functional with respect to a single semi-unitary OPF matrix. Moreover, we demonstrate that the localization of the resulting Wannier functions (WFs) can be further improved by including projections on reasonably localized WFs, so-called self-projections.

Here, we consider a chain of diffusive processes $x_i(t)$ that interact unilaterally: at random time intervals, the process $x_n$ stochastically resets to the instantaneous value of $x_{n-1}$. We derive analytically the steady-state statistics of these nested stochastic resetting processes including the stationary distribution for each process as well as its moments. We are also able to calculate exactly the steady-state two-point correlations $\langle x_n x_{n+j}\rangle$ between processes by mapping the problem to one of the ordering statistics of random counting processes. Understanding statistics and correlations in many-particle nonequilibrium systems remains a formidable challenge and our results provide an example of such tractable correlations. We expect this framework will both help build a model-independent framework for random processes with unilateral interactions and find immediate applications, e.g. in the modelling of lossy information propagation.

Title: Easy-cone state mediating the spin reorientation in topological kagome magnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$

Abstract: We investigated temperature-driven spin reorientation (SR) in the itinerant kagome magnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ using high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, magnetometry, and magnetic force microscopy (MFM), further supported by phenomenological analysis. Our study reveals a crossover from the state with easy-plane anisotropy to the high-temperature state with uniaxial easy-axis anisotropy taking place between $\sim40-130$~ K through an intermediate easy-cone (or tilted spin) state. This state, induced by the interplay between the anisotropy constants $K_1$ and $K_2$, is clearly manifested in the thermal evolution of the magnetic structure factor, which reveals a gradual change of the SR angle $\mathbf{\theta}$ between $40-130$~K. We also found that the SR is accompanied by a magnetoelastic effect. Zero-field MFM images across the SR range show a transformation in surface magnetic patterns from a dendritic structure at 120~K, to domain wall dominated MFM contrast at 40~K.

Title: Mie-enhanced micro-focused Brillouin light scattering with wavevector resolution
Authors: Jakub Krčma, Ondřej Wojewoda, Martin Hrtoň, Jakub Holobrádek, Jon Ander Arregi, Jaganandha Panda, Michal Urbánek
Abstract: Magnons, the quanta of spin waves, are magnetic excitations of matter spanning through the entire crystal's Brillouin zone and covering a wide range of frequencies ranging from sub-gigahertz to hundreds of terahertz. Magnons play a crucial role in many condensed matter phenomena, such as the reduction of saturation magnetization with increasing temperature or Bose-Einstein condensation. However, current experimental techniques cannot resolve magnons with wavevectors between 30 and 300$\,$rad$\,\mu$m$^{-1}$. In this letter, we address this gap by tailoring the light in Brillouin light scattering process with dielectric periodic nanoresonators and thus gaining access to the previously unmeasurable spin waves with full wavevector resolution using table-top optical setup. Filling this gap can stimulate further experimental investigations of the fundamental phenomena associated with magnons but also stimulate the application of magnonics in computational and microwave devices. In addition, the same methodology can be applied to other excitations of matter, such as phonons, opening up new possibilities in e.g. mechanobiological studies.

Title: Structural dependence of quantum transport properties on topological nodal-line semimetal bilayer borophene
Authors: C. J. Páez-González, C. E. Ardila-Gutiérrez, D. A. Bahamon
Abstract: This work presents the electronic and transport properties of bilayer borophene nanoribbons. In the first part, a four-orbital tight-binding model is derived by fitting the \emph{ab initio} band structure. The transport properties of armchair and zigzag bilayer borophene nanoribbons are then analyzed, both with and without periodic boundary conditions. In both scenarios, the nodal line causes conductance to increase with width and exhibit oscillations in narrow nanoribbons. Additionally, plots of current and charge density reveal that edge states have a more pronounced impact in narrower nanoribbons. Finally, uniaxial tensile strain is introduced as a tool to engineer the number of available transport channels.

Title: Mutual control of critical temperature, RRR, stress, and surface quality for sputtered Nb films

Abstract: Superconducting single quantum logic integrated circuits traditionally exploit magnetron sputtered niobium thin films on silicon oxide substrates. The sputtering depends on multiple process parameters, which dramatically affect mechanical, electrical, and cryogenic properties of Nb thin films. In this work, we focus on the comprehensive relationship study between 200-nm Nb film characteristics and their intrinsic stress. It is shown that there is a critical value of the working pressure pcritical at the fixed sputtering power above which stress in the film relaxes whereas the film properties degrade significantly. Below pcritical one can control intrinsic stress in the wide range from -400 MPa to +600 MPa maintaining perfect film surface with a 0.8 nm roughness (Rq), electrical resistivity less than 20 uOhm*cm, critical superconducting transition temperature above 8.9 K and residual resistance ratio over 6.4. We suggest a modified kinetic model to predict Nb films stress with the linear dependence of high-energy parameters on the working pressure replaced with an exponential one, which allowed reduction of the approximation error from 20 to 8%.

Abstract: Time-resolved absorption spectroscopy as well as magnetic circular dichroism with circularly polarized soft X-rays (XAS and XMCD) are powerful tools to probe electronic and magnetic dynamics in magnetic materials element- and site-selectively. Employing these methods, groundbreaking results have been obtained for instance for magnetic alloys, which helped to fundamentally advance the field of ultrafast magnetization dynamics. At the free electron laser facility FLASH key capabilities for ultrafast XAS and XMCD experiments have recently improved: In an upgrade, an APPLE-III helical afterburner undulator was installed at FLASH2 in September 2023. This installation allows for the generation of circularly polarized soft X-ray pulses with a duration of a few tens of femtoseconds covering the L3,2-edges of the important 3d transition metal elements with pulse energies of several uJ. Here, we present first experimental results with such ultrashort X-ray pulses from the FL23 beamline employing XMCD at the L-edges of the 3d metals, Co, Fe and Ni. We obtain significant dichroic difference signals indicating a degree of circular polarization close to 100%. With the pulse-length preserving monochromator at beamline FL23 and an improved pump laser setup, FLASH can offer important and efficient experimental instrumentation for studies on ultrafast spin dynamics in 3d transition metals, multilayers, and alloys.

Title: Reversible Switching of the Environment-Protected Quantum Spin Hall Insulator Bismuthene at the Graphene/SiC Interface
Authors: Niclas Tilgner, Susanne Wolff, Serguei Soubatch, Tien-Lin Lee, Andres David Peña Unigarro, Sibylle Gemming, F. Stefan Tautz, Christian Kumpf, Thomas Seyller, Fabian Göhler, Philip Schädlich
Abstract: Quantum Spin Hall Insulators (QSHI) have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally because they exhibit robust helical edge states driven by spin-orbit coupling and offer the potential for applications in spintronics through dissipationless spin transport. However, to realize devices, it is indispensable to gain control over the interaction of the active layer with the substrate, and to protect it from environmental influences. Here we show that a single layer of elemental Bi, formed by intercalation of an epitaxial graphene buffer layer on SiC(0001), is a promising candidate for a QSHI. This layer can be reversibly switched between an electronically inactive precursor state and a ``bismuthene state'', the latter exhibiting the predicted band structure of a true two-dimensional bismuthene layer. Switching is accomplished by hydrogenation (dehydrogenation) of the sample, i.e., a partial passivation (activation) of dangling bonds of the SiC substrate, causing a lateral shift of Bi atoms involving a change of the adsorption site. In the bismuthene state, the Bi honeycomb layer is a prospective QSHI, inherently protected by the graphene sheet above and the H-passivated substrate below. Thus, our results represent an important step towards protected QSHI systems beyond graphene.

Title: Electronic properties and transport in metal/2D material/metal vertical junctions
Authors: Gaëlle Bigeard, Zineb Kerrami, François Triozon, Alessandro Cresti
Abstract: We simulate the electronic and transport properties of metal/two-dimensional material/metal vertical heterostructures, with a focus on graphene, hexagonal boron nitride and two phases of molybdenum diselenide. Using density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function, we assess how stacking configurations and material thickness impact important properties, such as density of states, potential barriers and conductivity. For monolayers, strong orbital hybridization with the metallic electrodes significantly alters the electronic characteristics, with the formation of states within the gap of the semiconducting 2D materials. Trilayers reveal the critical role of interlayer coupling, where the middle layer retains its intrinsic properties, thus influencing the overall conductivity. Our findings highlight the potential for customized multilayer designs to optimize electronic device performance based on two-dimensional materials.

Title: Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks in Polar Fluids
Authors: Hiroya Nishikawa, Yasushi Okumura, Dennis Kwaria, Atsuko Nihonyanagi, Fumito Araoka
Abstract: In soft matter, the polar orientational order of molecules can facilitate the coexistence of structural chirality and ferroelectricity. The ferroelectric nematic (NF) state, exhibited by achiral calamitic molecules with large dipole moments, serves as an ideal model for the emergence of spontaneous structural chirality. This chiral ground state arises from a left- or right-handed twist of polarization due to depolarization effects. In contrast, the ferroelectric smectic state, characterized by a polar lamellar structure with lower symmetry, experiences significantly higher energy associated with layer-twisting deformations and the formation of domain walls, thus avoiding a continuously twisted layered structure. In this study, we develop two types of achiral molecules (BOE-NO2 and DIOLT) that possess different molecular structure but exhibit a NF-ferroelectric smectic phase sequence. We demonstrate that the chiral ground state of NF is inherited in the ferroelectric smectic phases of BOE-NO2, which features larger dipole moments and a steric hindrance moiety, thereby triggering the formation of the twisted polar smectic blocks.

Title: Revealing inter-band electron pairing in a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Javier Zaldívar, Jon Ortuzar, Miguel Alvarado, Stefano Trivini, Julie Baumard, Carmen Rubio-Verdú, Edwin Herrera, Hermann Suderow, Alfredo Levy Yeyati, F. Sebastian Bergeret, Jose Ignacio Pascual
Abstract: Most superconducting mechanisms pair electrons within the same band, forming spin singlets. However, the discovery of multi-band superconductivity has opened new scenarios for pairing, particularly in systems with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we reveal inter-band pairing in the superconductor \bipd\ by mapping the amplitude of sub-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states around Vanadium adatoms deposited on its surface. The surface of \bipd\ is characterized by spin-helical-like bands near the Fermi level. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals anisotropic YSR amplitude oscillations around the impurity, driven by spin-conserving Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (BQPI). Analysis of the BQPI patterns at the YSR energy exposes inter-band pairing in this material. Interestingly, only a small subset of all possible inter-band scattering processes observed in the normal state contribute to the BQPI patterns. Combining experimental data and theory, we demonstrate that the observed band selectivity results from the hybridization of the band coupled with the impurity with other bands. Our findings reveal unconventional pairing mechanisms in \bipd\ and highlight the crucial role of spin-orbit interactions in their formation.

Title: Analytical solution for the polydisperse random close packing problem in 2D
Authors: Mathias Casiulis, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: An analytical theory for the random close packing density, $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$, of polydisperse hard disks is provided using a theoretical approach based on the equilibrium model of crowding [A. Zaccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 028002 (2022)], which was recently justified based on extensive numerical analysis of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) line in the hard-sphere phase diagram [Anzivino et al., J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044901 (2023)]. The solution relies on the underlying equations of state for the hard disk fluid and provides predictions of $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$ as a function of the ratio of the standard deviation of the disk diameter distribution to its mean $s$. For the power-law size distribution evaluated at $s=0.246$, the theory yields $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.892$, which compares well with the most recent numerical estimate $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.905$ based on the Monte-Carlo swap algorithms [Ghimenti, Berthier, van Wijland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 028202 (2024)].

Title: Photoemission electron microscopy of exciton-polaritons in thin WSe$_2$ waveguides
Authors: Tobias Eul, Miwan Sabir, Vector DeManuel-Gonzalez, Florian Diekmann, Kai Rossnagel, Michael Bauer
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings precipitate the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.

Title: Fluctuation-dissipation and virtual processes in interacting phonon systems
Authors: Aloïs Castellano, J. P. Alvarinhas Batista, Matthieu J. Verstraete
Abstract: Phonon-phonon interactions are fundamental to understanding a wide range of material properties, including thermal transport and vibrational spectra. In conventional perturbative approaches, energy conservation during each microscopic phonon interaction is enforced using delta functions. We demonstrate that these delta functions stem from an incomplete treatment, that violates the fluctuation-dissipation theorem governing systems at equilibrium. By replacing delta functions with convolutions and introducing a self-consistency condition for the phonon spectral function, we provide a more accurate and physically consistent framework. For systems where phonon dynamics can be approximated as Markovian, we simplify this approach, reducing the dissipative component to a single parameter tied to phonon lifetimes. Applying this method to boron arsenide, we find that self-consistent linewidths better capture the phonon scattering processes, significantly improving agreement with experimental thermal conductivity values. These results also challenge the conventional view of four-phonon processes as dominant in BAs, demonstrating the adequacy of a three-phonon description, provided it is self-consistent. With this method we address critical limitations of perturbative approaches, offering new insights into dissipation and phonon-mediated processes, and enabling more accurate modeling of anharmonic materials.

Title: Time scale competition in the Active Coagulation Model
Authors: Matteo Paoluzzi
Abstract: Spreading processes on top of active dynamics provide a novel theoretical framework for capturing emerging collective behavior in living systems. I consider run-and-tumble dynamics coupled with coagulation/decoagulation reactions that lead to an absorbing state phase transition. While the active dynamics does not change the location of the transition point, the relaxation toward the stationary state depends on motility parameters. Because of the competition between spreading dynamics and active motion, the system can support long-living currents whose typical time scale is a nontrivial function of motility and reaction rates. Beyond the mean-field regime, instability at finite length scales regulates a crossover from periodic to diffusive modes. Finally, it is possible to individuate different mechanisms of pattern formation on a large time scale, ranging from Fisher-Kolmogorov to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.

Title: Demagnetisation effects in single-domain particles
Authors: Mathias Zambach, Miriam Varón, Mads R. Almind, Matti Knaapila, Ziwei Ouyang, Marco Beleggia, Cathrine Frandsen
Abstract: According to the classical laws of magnetism, the shape of magnetically soft objects limits the effective susceptibility. For example, spherical soft magnets cannot display an effective susceptibility larger than 3. Although true for macroscopic multi-domain magnetic materials, we show that magnetic nanoparticles in a single-domain state do not suffer from this limitation. We find that the differences between demagnetisation factors along principal axes are relevant and can influence susceptibility for single-domain particles, but do not limit the susceptibility as in the case for multi-domain particles. We validate this result experimentally on spherical nanoparticles with varying diameter (8 to 150 nm) and varying volume fraction (0.1 to 47 vol%). In agreement with our predictions, we measure susceptibilities largely above 3, in fact up to more than 250, for single-domain particles. Moreover, contrary to an existing model, we find that the susceptibility of non-interacting single-domain particles in a non-magnetic matrix scales simply linearly with the volume fraction of particles.

Title: Symmetry Analysis of the Non-Hermitian Electro-Optic Effect in Crystals
Authors: Sylvain Lannebère, Tatiana G. Rappoport, Tiago A. Morgado, Ivo Souza, Mário G. Silveirinha
Abstract: We investigate how crystal symmetry tailors the non-Hermitian electro-optic effect driven by the Berry curvature dipole. Specifically, we demonstrate the critical influence of the material's point group symmetry and external electric biases in shaping this effect, leading to current-induced optical gain and non-reciprocal optical responses. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the crystallographic point groups, we identify how different symmetries affect the electro-optic response, enabling the engineering of polarization-dependent optical gain without the need for gyrotropic effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian electro-optic response in a broad class of crystals is characterized by linear dichroic gain. In this type of response, the eigenpolarizations that activate the gain or dissipation are linearly polarized. Depending on the specific symmetry point group, it is possible to achieve gain (or dissipation) for all eigenpolarizations or to observe polarization-dependent gain and dissipation. Weyl semimetals emerge as promising candidates for realizing significant non-Hermitian electro-optic effects and linear dichroic gain. We further examine practical applications by studying the reflectance of biased materials in setups involving mirrors, demonstrating how optical gain and attenuation can be controlled via symmetry and bias configurations.

Title: Room Temperature Dy Spin-Flop Switching in Strained DyFeO3 Thin Films
Authors: Banani Biswas, Federico Stramaglia, Ekatarina V. Pomjakushina, Thomas Lippert, Carlos A.F. Vaz, Christof W. Schneider
Abstract: Epitaxial strain in thin films can yield surprising magnetic and electronic properties not accessible in bulk. One materials system destined to be explored in this direction are orthoferrites with two intertwined spin systems where strain is predicted to have a significant impact on magnetic and polar properties by modifying the strength of the rare earth-Fe interaction. Here we report the impact of epitaxial strain is reported on the linear magneto-electric DyFeO3, a canted bulk antiferromagnet with a high Neel temperature (645 K) exhibiting a Dy-induced spin reorientation transition at approx. 50 K and antiferromagnetic ordering of the Dy spins at 4 K. An increase in the spin transition of > 20 K is found and a strictly linear, abnormal temperature magnetic response under an applied magnetic field between 100 and 400 K for [010]-oriented DyFeO3 thin films with an in-plane compressive strain between 2% and 3.5%. At room temperature and above, we found that application of approx. 0.06 T causes a spin-flop of the Dy spins coupled to the antiferromagnetic Fe spin lattice, whereby the Dy spins change from an antiferromagnetic alignment to ferromagnetic. The spin-flop field gives a lower energy bound on the Dy-Fe exchange interaction of approx. 15 microeV.

Title: Transport coefficients of a low-temperature normal Fermi gas with contact interactions: an exact perturbative expansion
Authors: Pierre-Louis Taillat, Hadrien Kurkjian
Abstract: We compute the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity of a Fermi gas with short-range interactions in the Fermi liquid regime of the normal phase, that is at temperatures $T$ much lower than the Fermi temperature $T_{\rm F}$ and much larger than the superfluid critical temperature $T_c$. Given recent advances in the precision of cold atom experiments, we provide exact results up to second-order in the interaction strength. We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ and Fermi wavenumber $k_{\rm F}$, follow $(1+\gamma k_{\rm F}a)/a^2$ up to corrections of order $O(a^0)$, with a positive coefficient $\gamma$ for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity. The inclusion of the correction linear in $k_{\rm F}a$ greatly improves the agreement with the recent measurement of the viscosity by the Yale group.

Title: Propagation of ultrashort voltage pulses through a small quantum dot
Authors: Thomas Kloss, Xavier Waintal
Abstract: The coherent transport of time-resolved ultrafast excitations in nanoelectronic interferometers is expected to exhibit an interesting interplay between the interferences and the time-dependent drive. However, the typical frequencies required to unlock this physics are in the THz range, making its observation challenging. In this work, we consider the propagation of the excitation generated by ultrashort voltage pulses through a small quantum dot, a system which we argue can display similar physics at significantly lower frequencies. We model the system with a single resonant level connected to two infinite electrodes subjected to a time-dependent voltage bias. For short pulses, we predict that the behaviour of the dot contrasts sharply with the long pulse (adiabatic) limit: the current actually oscillates with the amplitude of the voltage pulse. In the ultrafast limit, we predict that the current can even be negative, i.e. flow against the voltage drop. Our results are obtained by a combination of two approaches that are in quantitative agreement: explicit analytical expressions in the ultrafast and ultraslow limits and exact numerical simulations. We discuss the applicability of our findings and conclude that this system should be within reach of existing experimental platforms.

Title: High temperature surface state in Kondo insulator U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$

Abstract: The resurgence of interest in Kondo insulators has been driven by two major mysteries: the presence of metallic surface states and the observation of quantum oscillations. To further explore these mysteries, it is crucial to investigate another similar system beyond the two existing ones, SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$. Here, we address this by reporting on a Kondo insulator, U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$. Our transport measurements reveal that a surface state emerges below 250 K and dominates transport properties below 150 K, which is well above the temperature scale of SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$. At low temperatures, the surface conductivity is about one order of magnitude higher than the bulk. The robustness of the surface state indicates that it is inherently protected. The similarities and differences between U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$ and the other two Kondo insulators will provide valuable insights into the nature of metallic surface states in Kondo insulators and their interplay with strong electron correlations.

Title: Unconventional anomalous Hall effect in hexagonal polar magnet Y_3Co_8Sn_4
Authors: Afsar Ahmed, Jyoti Sharma, Arnab Bhattacharya, Anis Biswas, Tukai Singha, Yaroslav Mudryk, Aftab Alam, I. Das
Abstract: We report a rare realization of unconventional anomalous Hall effect (UAHE) both below and above the magnetic transition temperature (T_C) in a hexagonal noncentrosymmetric magnet Y_3Co_8Sn_4, using a combined experimental and ab-initio calculations. Occurrence of such UAHE is mainly attributed to the reciprocal (KS) topology (i.e. the presence of topological Weyl points at/near the Fermi level), along with some contribution from the topological magnetic texture, as inferred from the measured field-dependent ac susceptibility. The effect of UAHE on the measured transport behavior however evolves differently with temperature above and below T_C, suggesting different physical mechanism responsible in the two phases. A unique planar ferrimagnetic ordering is found to be the most stable state with ab-plane as the easy plane below TC, as observed experimentally. The simulated net magnetization and the moment per Co atom agrees fairly well with the measured values. A reasonably large AHC is also observed in both the phases (above and below and T_C) of the present compound, which is again not so ubiquitous. Our results underscore the family of R_3Co_8Sn_4 (R= rare earth) polar magnets as a compelling backdrop for exploring the synergy of topological magnetism and non-trivial electronic bands, pivotal for spintronic applications.

Title: E2Former: A Linear-time Efficient and Equivariant Transformer for Scalable Molecular Modeling
Authors: Yunyang Li, Lin Huang, Zhihao Ding, Chu Wang, Xinran Wei, Han Yang, Zun Wang, Chang Liu, Yu Shi, Peiran Jin, Jia Zhang, Mark Gerstein, Tao Qin
Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.

Title: Carbon Per Transistor (CPT): The Golden Formula for Green Computing Metrics
Authors: Zag ElSayed, Nelly Elsayed, Ahmed Abdelgawad
Abstract: As computing power advances, the environmental cost of semiconductor manufacturing and operation has become a critical concern. However, current sustainability metrics fail to quantify carbon emissions at the transistor level, the fundamental building block of modern processors. This paper introduces a Carbon Per Transistor (CPT) formula -- a novel approach and green implementation metric to measuring the CO$_2$ footprint of semiconductor chips from fabrication to end-of-life. By integrating emissions from silicon crystal growth, wafer production, chip manufacturing, and operational power dissipation, the CPT formula provides a scientifically rigorous benchmark for evaluating the sustainability of computing hardware. Using real-world data from Intel Core i9-13900K, AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, and Apple M1/M2/M3 processors, we reveal a startling insight-manufacturing emissions dominate, contributing 60-125 kg CO$_2$ per CPU, far exceeding operational emissions over a typical device lifespan. Notably, Apple's high-transistor-count M-series chips, despite their energy efficiency, exhibit a significantly larger carbon footprint than traditional processors due to extensive fabrication impact. This research establishes a critical reference point for green computing initiatives, enabling industry leaders and researchers to make data-driven decisions in reducing semiconductor-related emissions and get correct estimates for the green factor of the information technology process. The proposed formula paves the way for carbon-aware chip design, regulatory standards, and future innovations in sustainable computing.

Title: On the behavior of a distributed network of capacitive constant phase elements
Authors: Anis Allagui, Ahmed S. Elwakil
Abstract: As a generalization of integer-order calculus, fractional calculus has seen tremendous applications in the past few years especially in the description of anomalous viscoelastic properties, transport processes in complex media as well as in dielectric and impedance spectroscopy of materials and electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The fractional-order capacitor or constant phase element (CPE) is a fractional-order model with impedance $z_c(s) = 1/(C_{\alpha} s^{\alpha})$ ($s=j \omega$, $C_{\alpha}>0$, $0<\alpha<1$) and is widely used in modeling impedance spectroscopy data in dispersive materials. In this study, we investigate the behavior of a network of distributed-order CPEs, each of which described by a Caputo-type time fractional differential equation relating the current on the CPE to its voltage, but with a non-negative, time-invariant weight function $\phi(\alpha)$. The behavior of the distributed-order network in terms of impedance and time-domain response to a constant current excitation is derived for two simple cases of $\phi(\alpha)$: (i) $\phi(\alpha)=1$ for $0 < \alpha < 1$ and zero otherwise, and $(ii)$ $\phi(\alpha) = \sum_i C_{\alpha_i}\, \delta(\alpha-\alpha_i)$ corresponding to the general case of parallel-connected elemental CPEs of different orders $\alpha$, and pseudocapacitances $C_{\alpha}$. Our results show that the overall network is not equivalent to a single CPE, contrary to what would of been expected with ideal capacitors.

Title: Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential-in-volume tails
Authors: Ben T. McDonough, Chao Yin, Andrew Lucas, Carolyn Zhang
Abstract: Lieb-Robinson bounds demonstrate the emergence of locality in many-body quantum systems. Intuitively, Lieb-Robinson bounds state that with local or exponentially decaying interactions, the correlation that can be built up between two sites separated by distance $r$ after a time $t$ decays as $\exp(vt-r)$, where $v$ is the emergent Lieb-Robinson velocity. In many problems, it is important to also capture how much of an operator grows to act on $r^d$ sites in $d$ spatial dimensions. Perturbation theory and cluster expansion methods suggest that at short times, these volume-filling operators are suppressed as $\exp(-r^d)$ at short times. We confirm this intuition, showing that for $r > vt$, the volume-filling operator is suppressed by $\exp(-(r-vt)^d/(vt)^{d-1})$. This closes a conceptual and practical gap between the cluster expansion and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We then present two very different applications of this new bound. Firstly, we obtain improved bounds on the classical computational resources necessary to simulate many-body dynamics with error tolerance $\epsilon$ for any finite time $t$: as $\epsilon$ becomes sufficiently small, only $\epsilon^{-O(t^{d-1})}$ resources are needed. A protocol that likely saturates this bound is given. Secondly, we prove that disorder operators have volume-law suppression near the "solvable (Ising) point" in quantum phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking, which implies a new diagnostic for distinguishing many-body phases of quantum matter.

Title: ReGNet: Reciprocal Space-Aware Long-Range Modeling and Multi-Property Prediction for Crystals
Authors: Jianan Nie, Peiyao Xiao, Kaiyi Ji, Peng Gao
Abstract: Predicting properties of crystals from their structures is a fundamental yet challenging task in materials science. Unlike molecules, crystal structures exhibit infinite periodic arrangements of atoms, requiring methods capable of capturing both local and global information effectively. However, most current works fall short of capturing long-range interactions within periodic structures. To address this limitation, we leverage reciprocal space to efficiently encode long-range interactions with learnable filters within Fourier transforms. We introduce Reciprocal Geometry Network (ReGNet), a novel architecture that integrates geometric GNNs and reciprocal blocks to model short-range and long-range interactions, respectively. Additionally, we introduce ReGNet-MT, a multi-task extension that employs mixture of experts (MoE) for multi-property prediction. Experimental results on the JARVIS and Materials Project benchmarks demonstrate that ReGNet achieves significant performance improvements. Moreover, ReGNet-MT attains state-of-the-art results on two bandgap properties due to positive transfer, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of our model as a scalable and accurate solution for crystal property prediction. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Title: Strong Long-Wave Infrared Optical Response in a Topological Semiconductor with a Mexican Hat Band Structure
Authors: Mark J. Polking, Haowei Xu, Raman Sankar, Kevin Grossklaus, Ju Li
Abstract: Light sources and photodetectors operating in the far- to mid-infrared (FIR/MIR) band ($8$-$12~\rm \mu m$, $0.1$-$0.15~\rm eV$) remain relatively poorly developed compared to their counterparts operating in the visible and near-infrared ranges, despite extensive application potential for thermal imaging, standoff sensing, and other technologies. This is attributable in part to the lack of narrow-gap materials ($<0.1~\rm eV$) with high optical gain and absorption. In this work, a narrow-gap semiconductor, $\rm Pb_{0.7}Sn_{0.3}Se$, is demonstrated to exhibit an optical response $>10\times$ larger than that of $\rm Hg_{x}Cd_{1-x}Te$ (MCT), the dominant material for FIR/MIR photodetectors. A previous theoretical investigation indicated that chalcogen $p$ and metal $d$ band inversion in this material creates a Mexican hat band structure (MHBS), which results in a dramatic increase in the joint density of states at the optical transition edge compared to typical semiconductors. This prediction is experimentally validated here using single-crystal specimens of $\rm Pb_{0.7}Sn_{0.3}Se$ measured using temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry over a wavelength range of $1.7$-$20~\rm \mu m$ ($0.73$-$0.062~\rm eV$). These measurements demonstrate a large enhancement in extinction coefficient and refractive index characteristic of a MHBS in the vicinity of the absorption edge, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The realization of topological semiconductors with a MHBS is expected to lead to high-efficiency detectors operating in the FIR/MID range.

Title: Sliding of a liquid spherical droplet in an external insoluble liquid at low Reynolds numbers
Authors: Peter Lebedev-Stepanov
Abstract: The experiment shows that small liquid droplets under the action of gravity and the Archimedes force move in the external viscous liquid practically according to the Stokes drag force equation, and not in accordance with the Hadamard-Rybczynski formula, which was specially developed to describe the motion of a liquid droplet in an external viscous liquid. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain this: increased viscosity at the interface between two liquids and the presence of unaccounted surfactants. However, there is another fundamental mechanism that has not been taken into account. It can be expected that the velocities of such liquids, insoluble in each other, may not equalize at the boundary of the droplet. No slip condition may be may be unnatural at the droplet interface. Instead, one could require the continuity of all components of the viscous stress tensor on the interface without exception. In this paper, it is shown that this approach gives a droplet velocity that coincides with the Stokes drag force formula for a sphere of a given radius.

Title: Quantum theory of surface lattice resonances
Authors: Michael Reitz, Stephan van den Wildenberg, Arghadip Koner, George C. Schatz, Joel Yuen-Zhou
Abstract: The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.

Title: Gain compression in Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers
Authors: Gwenael Le Gal, Guilliam Butseraen, Arpit Ranadive, Giulio Cappelli, Bekim Fazliji, Edgar Bonet, Eric Eyraud, Luca Planat, Nicolas Roch
Abstract: Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) are increasingly used in various applications, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, and dark matter detection. However, one important characteristic of these amplifiers, gain compression, has not received much attention. As a result, there is a lack of comprehensive experimental exploration of this phenomenon in the existing literature. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of gain compression in a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier based on a four-wave mixing process. We have implemented a novel setup to monitor the complex transmission of both the pump and signal tones, which allows us to simultaneously track pump depletion and signal amplification as functions of signal power and frequency across the entire bandwidth of the device. Our findings indicate that, while pump depletion occurs during gain compression, it is not the only mechanism involved in the saturation of a TWPA. Power-induced phase-matching processes also take place within the device. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing TWPAs for applications that require high total input power, such as multiplexed qubit readout or broadband photon emission.

Title: Lattice Weyl Fermion on a Single Spherical Domain-Wall
Authors: Shoto Aoki, Hidenori Fukaya, Naoto Kan
Abstract: We investigate a single spherical domain-wall embedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean lattice. We employ the Shamir-type domain-wall fermion formulation, where the negative mass region is confined inside the $S^2$ domain-wall, while the positive mass outside is taken to the infinite limit, allowing the exterior region to be neglected effectively. In the absence of a gauge potential, Weyl fermions emerge as edge-localized modes along the $S^2$ domain-wall. When a nontrivial $U(1)$ gauge potential is present, additional zero modes with opposite chirality appears, localized at the center near the monopole. This centrally localized mode originates from the effective mass contribution of the Wilson term, which induces a domain-wall near the monopole.

Title: Investigating the Bouncing Barrier with Collision Simulations of Compressed Dust Aggregates
Authors: Haruto Oshiro, Misako Tatsuuma, Satoshi Okuzumi, Hidekazu Tanaka
Abstract: The collision outcomes of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks dictate how planetesimals form. Experimental and numerical studies have suggested that bouncing collisions occurring at low impact velocities may limit aggregate growth in the disks, but the conditions under which bouncing occurs have yet to be fully understood. In this study, we perform a suite of collision simulations of moderately compact dust aggregates with various impact velocities, aggregate radii, and filling factors ranging between 0.4 and 0.5. Unlike previous simulations, we generate compact aggregates by compressing more porous ones, mimicking the natural processes through which compact aggregates form. We find that the compressed aggregates bounce above a threshold mass, which decreases with impact velocity. The threshold mass scales with impact velocity as the $-4/3$ power, consistent with the findings of previous experiments. We also find that the threshold aggregate mass for bouncing depends strongly on filling factor, likely reflecting the strong filling-factor dependence of the compressive strength of compressed aggregates. Our energy analysis reveals that nearly 90\% of the initial impact energy is dissipated during the initial compression phase, and over 70\% of the remaining energy is dissipated during the subsequent stretching phase, regardless of whether the collision results in sticking or bouncing. Our results indicate that dust aggregates with a filling factor of 0.4 cease to grow beyond 100 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ as a result of the bouncing barrier.

Title: Cooperation, satisfaction, and rationality in social games on complex networks with aspiration-driven players
Authors: M. Aguilar-Janita, N. Khalil, I. Leyva, I. Sendiña-Nadal
Abstract: A network model based on players' aspirations is proposed and analyzed theoretically and numerically within the framework of evolutionary game theory. In this model, players decide whether to cooperate or defect by comparing their payoffs from pairwise games with their neighbors, driven by a common aspiration level. The model also incorporates a degree of irrationality through an effective temperature in the Fermi function. The level of cooperation in the system is fundamentally influenced by two social attributes: satisfaction, defined as the fraction of players whose payoffs exceed the aspiration level, and the degree of rationality in decision-making. Rational players tend to maintain their initial strategies for sufficiently low aspiration levels, while irrational agents promote a state of perfect coexistence, resulting in half of the agents cooperating. The transition between these two behaviors can be critical, often leading to abrupt changes in cooperation levels. When the aspiration level is high, all players become dissatisfied, regardless of the effective temperature. Intermediate aspiration levels result in diverse behaviors, including sudden transitions for rational agents and a non-monotonic relationship between cooperation and increased irrationality. The study also carefully examines the effects of the interaction structure, initial conditions, and the strategy update rule (asynchronous versus synchronous). Special attention is given to the prisoner's dilemma, where significant cooperation levels can be achieved in a structured environment, with moderate aspiration and high rationality settings, and following a synchronous strategy updating scheme.

Title: Optical bound states in the continuum in subwavelength gratings made of an epitaxial van der Waals material
Authors: Emilia Pruszyńska-Karbownik, Tomasz Fąs, Katarzyna Brańko, Dmitriy Yavorskiy, Bartłomiej Stonio, Rafał Bożek, Piotr Karbownik, Jerzy Wróbel, Tomasz Czyszanowski, Tomasz Stefaniuk, Wojciech Pacuski, Jan Suffczyński
Abstract: High refractive index (4.4 at 1100 nm), negligibly small absorption in near-infrared spectral range, and ease of processing make MoSe$_2$ a perfect material for applications in near-infrared photonics. So far, implementation of MoSe$_2$-based photonic structures has been hindered by the lack of large surface MoSe$_2$ substrates. The use of molecular beam epitaxy allows the production of homogeneous layers of MoSe$_2$ with a few-inch surface and a thickness controlled at the sub-nm level. In the present work, we design by theoretical calculations and fabricate by a simple lithography process an ultrathin subwavelength grating out of 42-nm thick, epitaxially-grown MoSe$_2$ layer. Our polarization-resolved reflectivity measurements confirm that the gratings host a peculiar type of a confined optical mode that is a bound state in the continuum. Moreover, the fabricated structures enhance the efficiency of the third harmonic generation by over three orders of magnitude as compared to the unstructured MoSe$_2$ layer. The presented results are promising for the realization of flat, ultra-compact devices for lasing, wavefront control, and higher-order topological states of the light.

Title: Symmetry-Aware Bayesian Flow Networks for Crystal Generation
Authors: Laura Ruple, Luca Torresi, Henrik Schopmans, Pascal Friederich
Abstract: The discovery of new crystalline materials is essential to scientific and technological progress. However, traditional trial-and-error approaches are inefficient due to the vast search space. Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled generative models to predict new stable materials by incorporating structural symmetries and to condition the generation on desired properties. In this work, we introduce SymmBFN, a novel symmetry-aware Bayesian Flow Network (BFN) for crystalline material generation that accurately reproduces the distribution of space groups found in experimentally observed crystals. SymmBFN substantially improves efficiency, generating stable structures at least 50 times faster than the next-best method. Furthermore, we demonstrate its capability for property-conditioned generation, enabling the design of materials with tailored properties. Our findings establish BFNs as an effective tool for accelerating the discovery of crystalline materials.

Title: Spin photonic topological metasurface based on kagome lattice and leaky-wave application
Authors: Sayyed Ahmad Abtahi, Mohsen Maddahali, Ahmad Bakhtafrouz
Abstract: The emerging field of topological metasurfaces offers unique advantages, particularly in robustness against backscattering in low-profile structures. The lattice configuration of these structures significantly influences the ability to achieve sharp turns in the propagation path. One of the most studied lattices in condensed matter physics is the kagome lattice, characterized by its hexagonal Brillouin zone, which displays a Dirac cone in its dispersion diagram. Previous research on kagome lattices in photonic topological insulators has primarily focused on valley types of insulators. This article introduces a spin topological metasurface based on the kagome lattice and its unit cell, enabling a broad range of sharp turns and propagation paths. The unit cell is compared to its hexagonal and 60-degree rhombic counterparts, and a parametric study of its dimensions is conducted. As a result of this research, a new X-band leaky-wave antenna designed in the kagome lattice with an armchair arrangement interface has been developed. This antenna provides two forward and two backward beams, each pair achieving an approximately 50-degree scan within the 8.8 to 11.1 GHz bandwidth.

Title: Luminescence thermometry based on photon emitters in nanophotonic silicon waveguides
Authors: Kilian Sandholzer, Stephan Rinner, Justus Edelmann, Andreas Reiserer
Abstract: The reliable measurement and accurate control of the temperature within nanophotonic devices is a key prerequisite for their application in both classical and quantum technologies. Established approaches use sensors that are attached in proximity to the components, which only offers a limited spatial resolution and thus impedes the measurement of local heating effects. Here, we therefore study an alternative temperature sensing technique that is based on measuring the luminescence of erbium emitters directly integrated into nanophotonic silicon waveguides. To cover the entire temperature range from 295 K to 2 K, we investigate two different approaches: The thermal activation of non-radiative decay channels for temperatures above 200 K and the thermal depopulation of spin- and crystal field levels at lower temperatures. The achieved sensitivity is 0.22(4) %/K at room temperature and increases up to 420(50) %/K at approximately 2 K. Within a few-minute measurement interval, we thus achieve a measurement precision that ranges from 0.04(1) K at the lowest studied temperature to 6(1) K at ambient conditions. In the future, the measurement time can be further reduced by optimizing the excitation pulse sequence and the fiber-to-chip coupling efficiency. Combining this with spatially selective implantation promises precise thermometry from ambient to cryogenic temperatures with a spatial resolution down to a few nanometers.

Title: Ultrasensitivity without conformational spread: A mechanical origin for non-equilibrium cooperativity in the bacterial flagellar motor
Authors: Henry H. Mattingly, Yuhai Tu
Abstract: Flagellar motors enable bacteria to navigate their environments by switching rotation direction in response to external cues with high sensitivity. Previous work suggested that ultrasensitivity of the flagellar motor originates from conformational spread, in which subunits of the switching complex are strongly coupled to their neighbors as in an equilibrium Ising model. However, dynamic single-motor measurements indicated that rotation switching is driven out of equilibrium, and the mechanism for this dissipative driving remains unknown. Here, based on recent cryo-EM structures, we propose that local mechanical torques on motor subunits can affect their conformation dynamics. This gives rise to a tug of war between stator-associated subunits, which produces cooperative, non-equilibrium switching responses without requiring nearest-neighbor interactions. Since subunits are effectively coupled at a distance, we call this mechanism ``Global Mechanical Coupling." Our model makes a qualitatively new prediction that the motor response cooperativity grows with the number of stators driving rotation. Re-analyzing published motor dose-response curves in varying load conditions, we find tentative experimental evidence for this prediction. Finally, we show that operating out of equilibrium enables motors to achieve high cooperativity with faster responses compared to equilibrium motors. Our results suggest a general role for mechanics in sensitive chemical regulation.

Title: Heat engines for scale invariant systems dual to black holes
Authors: Nikesh Lilani, Manus R. Visser
Abstract: According to holography, a black hole is dual to a thermal state in a strongly coupled quantum system. The principle example of holography is the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. We construct reversible heat engines where the working substance consists of a static thermal equilibrium state of a CFT. For thermal states dual to an asymptotically AdS black hole, this yields a novel realization of Johnson's holographic heat engines. We compute the efficiency for a number of idealized heat engines, such as the Carnot, Brayton, Otto, Diesel, and Stirling cycles. The efficiency of most heat engines can be derived from the CFT equation of state, which follows from scale invariance, and we compare them to the efficiencies for an ideal gas. However, the Stirling efficiency for a generic CFT is uniquely determined in terms of its characteristic temperature and volume only in the high-temperature or large-volume regime. We derive an exact expression for the Stirling efficiency for CFT states dual to AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, and compare the subleading corrections in the high-temperature regime with those in a generic CFT.

Title: Dynamics of monitored SSH Model in Krylov Space: From Complexity to Quantum Fisher Information
Authors: Nilachal Chakrabarti, Neha Nirbhan, Arpan Bhattacharyya
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that the measurement-induced transition can be detected using a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional.

Title: Fragile topology on solid grounds and the Thouless conjecture
Authors: Simon Becker, Zhongkai Tao, Mengxuan Yang
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \le 3$, vanishing Chern classes characterize the topological phases of periodic media that exhibit localized Wannier functions. However, for special symmetries $I$ of the system, such as $C_{2z}T$ (space-time reversal), the existence of a localized set of Wannier functions that is also invariant under this symmetry $I$ may not always exist. In systems with fragile topology, Wannier functions cannot respect both the symmetry $I$ and the localization constraints. Nevertheless, this obstruction can be lifted by adding Chern-trivial line bundles, invariant under the $I$-symmetry. This allows for the construction of localized Wannier functions that respect symmetry. In the last section, we take on a broader perspective and obtain Wannier localization in dimensions $d=2,3$ without symmetry constraints for Chern nontrivial Bloch bundles. For $d=2$, we obtain the Wannier decay with Thouless exponent $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-2})$; for $d=3$, we obtain the decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-7/3})$.

Title: Continuous non-equilibrium transition driven by the heat flow
Authors: Yirui Zhang, Marek Litniewski, Karol Makuch, Pawel J. Zuk, Anna Maciolek, Robert Holyst
Abstract: We discovered an out-of-equilibrium transition in the ideal gas between two walls, divided by an inner, adiabatic, movable wall. The system is driven out-of-equilibrium by supplying energy directly into the volume of the gas. At critical heat flux, we have found a continuous transition to the state with a low-density, hot gas on one side of the movable wall and a dense, cold gas on the other side. Molecular dynamic simulations of the soft-sphere fluid confirm the existence of the transition in the interacting system. We introduce a stationary state Helmholtz-like function whose minimum determines the stable positions of the internal wall. This transition can be used as a paradigm of transitions in stationary states and the Helmholtz-like function as a paradigm of the thermodynamic description of these states.

Title: Field theories of active particle systems and their entropy production
Authors: Gunnar Pruessner, Rosalba Garcia-Millan
Abstract: Active particles that translate chemical energy into self-propulsion can maintain a far-from-equilibrium steady state and perform work. The entropy production measures how far from equilibrium such a particle system operates and serves as a proxy for the work performed. Field theory offers a promising route to calculating entropy production, as it allows for many interacting particles to be considered simultaneously. Approximate field theories obtained by coarse-graining or smoothing that draw on additive noise can capture densities and correlations well, but they generally ignore the microscopic particle nature of the constituents, thereby producing spurious results for the entropy production. As an alternative we demonstrate how to use Doi-Peliti field theories, which capture the microscopic dynamics, including reactions and interactions with external and pair potentials. Such field theories are in principle exact, while offering a systematic approximation scheme, in the form of diagrammatics. We demonstrate how to construct them from a Fokker-Planck equation and show how to calculate entropy production of active matter from first principles. This framework is easily extended to include interaction. We use it to derive exact, compact and efficient general expressions for the entropy production for a vast range of interacting conserved particle systems. These expressions are independent of the underlying field theory and can be interpreted as the spatial average of the local entropy production. They are readily applicable to numerical and experimental data. In general, the entropy production due to any pair interaction draws at most on the three point, equal time density; and an $n$-point interaction on the $(2n-1)$-point density. We illustrate the technique in a number of exact, tractable examples, including some with pair-interaction as well as in a system of many interacting ABPs.

Title: Electric-field Switching of Interlayer Magnetic Order in a van der Waals Heterobilayer via Spin-potential Coupling
Authors: Chengxi Huang, Jinzhe Han, Jing Wang, Jintao Jiang, Ziyang Qu, Fang Wu, Ang Li, Yi Wan, Kaiyou Wang, Erjun Kan
Abstract: Electric-field switching of magnetic order is of significant physical interest and holds great potential for spintronic applications. However, it has rarely been reported in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets due to the inherently weak interaction between spin order and electric fields. Here we propose a general spin-potential mechanism that significantly enhances the magnetoelectric coupling. As a result, the relative stability of different interlayer magnetic orders in an asymmetric van der Waals heterobilayer can be reversed by external electric fields via spin-potential coupling. Based on this mechanism, we designed a series of 2D vdW all-magnetic heterobilayers, such as CrI3/MnSe2, in which a transition from interlayer ferromagnetic (iFM) to antiferromagnetic (iAFM) order is realized by a feasible electric field around 0.1 V/Å. Our findings not only reveal a novel magnetoelectric coupling mechanism, but also present a practical strategy for achieving pure electric-field-driven magnetic order switching

Title: Flux-tunable Kitaev chain in a quantum dot array
Authors: Juan Daniel Torres Luna, A. Mert Bozkurt, Michael Wimmer, Chun-Xiao Liu
Abstract: Connecting quantum dots through Andreev bound states in a semiconductor-superconductor hybrid provides a platform to create a Kitaev chain. Interestingly, in a double quantum dot, a pair of poor man's Majorana zero modes can emerge when the system is fine-tuned to a sweet spot, where superconducting and normal couplings are equal in magnitude. Control of the Andreev bound states is crucial for achieving this, usually implemented by varying its chemical potential. In this work, we propose using Andreev bound states in a short Josephson junction to mediate both types of couplings, with the ratio tunable by the phase difference across the junction. Now a minimal Kitaev chain can be easily tuned into the strong coupling regime by varying the phase and junction asymmetry, even without changing the dot-hybrid coupling strength. Furthermore, we identify an optimal sweet spot at $\pi$ phase, enhancing the excitation gap and robustness against phase fluctuations. Our proposal introduces a new device platform and a new tuning method for realizing quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains.

Title: Positive temperature-dependent thermal conductivity induced by wavelike phonons in complex Ag-based argyrodites
Authors: Niuchang Ouyang, Dongyi Shen, Chen Wang, Ruihuan Cheng, Qi Wang, Yue Chen
Abstract: The phonon transport mechanisms and the anomalous temperature-dependent lattice thermal conductivities (kL) in Ag-based argyrodites have not been fully understood. Herein, we systematically study the phonon thermal transport of five Ag-based crystalline argyrodites Ag7PS6, Ag7AsS6, Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6 and Ag9GaS6 utilizing perturbation theory and the unified theory thermal transport model. Our results show that, as the complexity of the unit cell increases, the proportion of the population terms falls while the coherence contributions become more significant, leading to the relatively weak temperature-dependent kL of Ag7PS6 and Ag7AsS6, while the more complex crystalline argyrodites, Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6 and Ag9GaS6, exhibiting a glass-like behavior in their temperature dependence of kL. We attribute the positive temperature-dependent and ultralow kL of Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6 and Ag9GaS6 to the dominance of wavelike phonons and the strong phonon broadening. Furthermore, using laser flash measurements and the homogeneous non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations based on accurate machine learning neuroevolution potentials, we provide further evidence for the glass-like temperature-dependent kL of Ag8SnS6 and Ag8GeS6.

Title: Permanent oscillations and solitary wave behavior in flatband Heisenberg quantum spin systems
Authors: J. Eckseler, J. Schnack
Abstract: Research on the emergence of thermodynamics in closed quantum systems under unitary time evolution arrived at the consensus that generic systems equilibrate under rather general assumptions. A new focus of the field is thus on exceptions. Persistent oscillations are one possible hallmark of non-ergodic time evolution. While time-crystalline behavior results from, e.g., many-body localization, here we show that ever-revolving solitary waves emerge in flatband Heisenberg quantum spin systems. This phenomenon is rather general for a variety of frustrated spin systems in one, two, and three dimensions as well as for Hubbard systems.

Title: (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$ : a possible zero-field Ru$^{3+}$-based Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid
Authors: Sanjay Bachhar, M. Baenitz, Hubertus Luetkens, John Wilkinson, Sumiran Pujari, A.V. Mahajan
Abstract: We report the synthesis and properties of (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$, which is shown to be a $J_{\text{eff}}=\frac{1}{2}$ system made out of Ru$^{3+}$ moments in a honeycomb geometry. Bulk magnetization, heat capacity, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) rule out the presence of static moments or any spin glass phase down to 84 mK. All techniques suggest a crossover to a liquid-like state below about 40 K. The $^{7}$Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shift data suggest a non-zero $T$-independent spin susceptibility at low $T$. In zero field, $C_m/T$ shows $T^{-0.9}$ divergence which is consistent with vacancy-induced effects on low-energy excitations of the pristine Kitaev spin liquid. With field, power-law variations in the $^{7}$Li NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T$_{1}$ and magnetic heat capacity $C_{m}$ show quantitatively new scaling behaviors. A two-step entropy release in heat capacity is also observed putatively from $Z_{2}$ flux (low-$T$ step) and itinerant Majorana fermions (high-$T$ step). Based on these findings, we propose that (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$ realizes a Kitaev spin liquid with no evidence of inherent magnetic ordering in zero field unlike $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ where approximately $8$ Tesla field is required to suppress magnetic order.

Title: Experimental signature of layer skyrmions and implications for band topology in twisted WSe2 bilayers

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) twisted homobilayers have been established as an ideal platform for studying strong correlation phenomena, as exemplified by the recent discovery of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in twisted MoTe2 and Chern insulators (CI) and unconventional superconductivity in twisted WSe2 (tWSe2). In these systems, nontrivial topology in the strongly layer-hybridized regime can arise from a spatial patterning of interlayer tunneling amplitudes and layer-dependent potentials that yields a lattice of layer skyrmions. Here we report on experimental signatures of skyrmion textures in the layer degree of freedom of Rhombohedral-stacked (R-stacked) tWSe2 homobilayers. This observation is based on scanning tunneling spectroscopy that separately resolves the Gamma-valley and K-valley moiré electronic states. We show that Gamma-valley states are subjected to a moiré potential with an amplitude of ~ 120 meV. At ~150 meV above the Gamma-valley, the K-valley states are subjected to a weaker moiré potential of ~30 meV. Most significantly, we reveal opposite layer polarizations of the K-valley at the MX and XM sites within the moiré unit cell, confirming the theoretically predicted layer skyrmion texture. The dI/dV mappings allow the parameters that enter the continuum model of moiré bands in twisted TMD bilayers to be determined experimentally, further establishing a direct correlation between the shape of the LDOS profile in real space and the topology of topmost moiré band.

Title: Orbital magnetic susceptibility of multifold fermions
Authors: D.A. Pshenay-Severin, A.T. Burkov
Abstract: Topological semimetals are intensively studied in recent years. Besides the well known Weyl and Dirac semimetals, some materials possess nodes with linear crossing of multiple bands. Low energy excitations around these nodes are called multifold fermions and can be described by $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian with pseudospin greater than 1/2. In the present work we investigate the contribution of these states into orbital magnetic susceptibility $\chi$. We have found that, similarly to Weyl semimetals, the dependence of susceptibility on chemical potential $\mu$ shows an extremum when $\mu$ is close to the band crossing energy. In the case of half-integer pseudospin, this extremum is a minimum and the susceptibility is negative (diamagnetic). While in the case of integer pseudospin, the susceptibility is large and positive (paramagnetic) due to the contribution of dispersionless band, corresponding to zero pseudospin projection. This leads also to nonmonotonic temperature dependence of $\chi$. As an example, we considered the case of cobalt monosilicide, where the states near the $\Gamma$ point correspond to pseudospin 1 without spin-orbital interaction, and to a combination of Weyl node and pseudospin-3/2 states taking into account spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Segregation to grain boundaries in disordered systems: an application to a Ni-based multi-component alloy
Authors: Dominik Gehringer, Lorenz Romaner, David Holec
Abstract: Segregation to defects, in particular to grain boundaries (GBs), is an unavoidable phenomenon leading to changed material behavior over time. With the increase of available computational power, unbiased quantum-mechanical predictions of segregation energies, which feed classical thermodynamics models of segregation (e.g., McLean isotherm), become available. In recent years, huge progress towards predictions closely resembling experimental observations was made by considering the statistical nature of the segregation process due to competing segregation sites at a single GB and/or many different types of co-existing GBs. In the present work, we further expand this field by explicitly showing how compositional disorder, present in real engineering alloys (e.g. steels or Ni-based superalloys), gives rise to a spectrum of segregation energies. With the example of a $\Sigma 5$ GB in a Ni-based model alloy (Ni-Co-Cr-Ti-Al), we show that the segregation energies of Fe, Mn, W, Nb, and Zr are significantly different from those predicted for pure elemental Ni. We further use the predicted segregation energy spectra in a statistical evaluation of GB enrichment, which allows for extracting segregation enthalpy and segregation entropy terms related to the chemical complexity in multi-component alloys.

Title: A primary quantum current standard based on the Josephson and the quantum Hall effects
Authors: Sophie Djordjevic, Ralf Behr, W. Poirier
Abstract: The new definition of the ampere calls for a quantum current standard able to deliver a flow of elementary charges, $e$, controlled with a relative uncertainty of $10^{-8}$. Despite many efforts, nanodevices handling electrons one by one have never demonstrated such an accuracy for a net flow. The alternative route based on applying Ohm's law to the Josephson voltage and quantum Hall standards recently reached the target uncertainty in the milliampere range, but this was at the expense of the application of error corrections. Here, we present a new programmable quantum current generator, which combines both quantum standards and a superconducting cryogenic amplifier in a quantum electrical circuit enabling the current scaling without errors. Thanks to a full quantum instrumentation, we demonstrate the accuracy of the generated currents, in the microampere range, at quantized values, $\pm(n/p)ef_\mathrm{J}$, with relative uncertainties less than $10^{-8}$, where $n$ and $p$ are integer control parameters and $f_\mathrm{J}$ is the Josephson frequency. This experiment sets the basis of a universal quantum realization of the electrical units, for example able of improving high-value resistance measurements and bridging the gap with other quantum current sources.

Title: Extracting the symmetries of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems
Authors: Aleksandr N. Mikheev, Viktoria Noel, Ido Siovitz, Helmut Strobel, Markus K. Oberthaler, Jürgen Berges
Abstract: Symmetries play a pivotal role in our understanding of the properties of quantum many-body systems. While there are theorems and a well-established toolbox for systems in thermal equilibrium, much less is known about the role of symmetries and their connection to dynamics out of equilibrium. This arises due to the direct link between a system's thermal state and its Hamiltonian, which is generally not the case for nonequilibrium dynamics. Here we present a pathway to identify the effective symmetries and to extract them from data in nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems. Our approach is based on exact relations between correlation functions involving different numbers of spatial points, which can be viewed as nonequilibrium versions of (equal-time) Ward identities encoding the symmetries of the system. We derive symmetry witnesses, which are particularly suitable for the analysis of measured or simulated data at different snapshots in time. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we apply our method to numerical and experimental data for a spinor Bose gas. We investigate the important question of a dynamical restoration of an explicitly broken symmetry of the Hamiltonian by the initial state. Remarkably, it is found that effective symmetry restoration can occur long before the system equilibrates. We also use the approach to define and identify spontaneous symmetry breaking far from equilibrium, which is of great relevance for applications to nonequilibrium phase transitions. Our work opens new avenues for the classification and analysis of quantum as well as classical many-body dynamics in a large variety of systems, ranging from ultracold quantum gases to cosmology.

Title: Evidence of P-wave Pairing in K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ Superconductors from Phase-sensitive Measurement
Authors: Zhiyuan Zhang, Ziwei Dou, Anqi Wang, Cuiwei Zhang, Yu Hong, Xincheng Lei, Yue Pan, Zhongchen Xu, Zhipeng Xu, Yupeng Li, Guoan Li, Xiaofan Shi, Xingchen Guo, Xiao Deng, Zhaozheng Lyu, Peiling Li, Faming Qu, Guangtong Liu, Dong Su, Kun Jiang, Youguo Shi, Li Lu, Jie Shen, Jiangping Hu
Abstract: P-wave superconductors hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and practical applications due to their unusual pairing symmetry and potential topological superconductivity. However, the exploration of the p-wave superconductors has proved to be a complex endeavor. Not only are they rare in nature but also the identification of p-wave superconductors has been an arduous task in history. For example, phase-sensitive measurement, an experimental technique which can provide conclusive evidence for unconventional pairing, has not been implemented successfully to identify p-wave superconductors. Here, we study a recently discovered family of superconductors, A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), which were proposed theoretically to be a candidate of p-wave superconductors. We fabricate superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) on exfoliated K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$, and perform the phase-sensitive measurement. We observe that such SQUIDs exhibit a pronounced second-order harmonic component sin(2$\pi$) in the current-phase relation, suggesting the admixture of 0- and $\pi$-phase. By carefully examining the magnetic field dependence of the oscillation patterns of critical current and Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation, we reveal a crossover from 0- to $\pi$-dominating phase state and conclude that the existence of the $\pi$-phase is in favor of the p-wave pairing symmetry in K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$.

Title: Fermi-liquid corrections to the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of topological metals
Authors: Ivan Pasqua, Michele Fabrizio
Abstract: We show that topological metals lacking time-reversal symmetry have an intrinsic non-quantized component of the anomalous Hall conductivity which is contributed not only by the Berry phase of quasiparticles on the Fermi surface, but also by Fermi-liquid corrections due to the residual interactions among quasiparticles, the Landau f-parametes. These corrections pair up with those that modify the optical mass with respect to the quasiparticle effective one, or the charge compressibility with respect to the quasiparticle density of states. Our result supports recent claims that the correct expressions for topological observables include vertex corrections besides the topological invariants built just upon the Green's functions. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such corrections are naturally accounted for by Landau's Fermi liquid theory, here extended to the case in which coherence effects between bands crossing the chemical potential and those that are instead away from it play a crucial role, as in the anomalous Hall conductivity, and have important implications when those metals are on the verge of a doping-driven Mott transition, as we discuss.

Title: Shortcuts to adiabaticity in open quantum critical systems
Authors: Shishira Mahunta, Victor Mukherjee
Abstract: We study shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs) through counterdiabatic driving in quantum critical systems in the presence of dissipation. We evaluate unitary as well as nonunitary controls, such that the system density matrix follows a prescribed trajectory corresponding to the eigenstates of a time-dependent reference Hamiltonian at any instant of time. The strength of the dissipator control term for the low-energy states shows universal scaling close to criticality. Using the example of free-fermionic systems, in particular, the transverse-field Ising model, we show that in contrast to STAs in closed quantum critical systems, here, STAs may require multibody interactions terms, even away from criticality, owing to the change in entropy of the time-dependent target state. Further, the associated heat current shows an extremum, while power dissipation changes curvature, close to criticality, and analogous to unitary control, no operational cost is associated with implementation of the exact counterdiabatic Hamiltonian. We believe the counterdiabatic protocol studied here could be of fundamental importance for understanding STAs in many-body open quantum systems and could be highly relevant for varied topics involving open many-body quantum systems, such as quantum computation and many-body quantum heat engines.

Title: Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for Active Field Theories
Authors: Martin Kjøllesdal Johnsrud, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is a defining property of non-equilibrium systems, such as active matter, which is composed of units that consume energy. We employ a formalism that allows us to derive a class of identities associated with the time-reversal transformation in non-equilibrium field theories, in the spirit of Ward-Takahashi identities. We present a generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid for active systems as a particular realization of such an identity, and consider its implications and applications for a range of active field theories. The field theoretical toolbox developed here helps to quantify the degree of non-equilibrium activity of complex systems exhibiting collective behavior.

Title: Entropic selection of magnetization in a frustrated 2D magnetic model
Authors: Anuradha Jagannathan, Thierry Jolicoeur
Abstract: We discuss the magnetic ground state and properties of a frustrated two-dimensional classical Heisenberg model of interacting hexagonal clusters of spins. The energy of the ground states is found exactly for arbitrary values of $J_1$ (intra-cluster couplings) and $J_2$ (inter-cluster couplings). Our main results concern a frustrated region of the phase diagram, where we show that the set of ground states has a degeneracy larger than that due to global rotation symmetry. Furthermore, the ground state manifold does not have a fixed total magnetization~: there is a range of allowed values. At finite temperature, our Monte-Carlo simulations show that the entropy selects the most probable value of the total magnetization, while the histogram of the Monte-Carlo time series is non-trivial. This model is a first step towards modelling properties of a class of frustrated magnetic structures composed of coupled spin clusters.

Title: Antiferroelectric Altermagnets: Antiferroelectricity Alters Magnets
Authors: Xunkai Duan, Jiayong Zhang, Ziye Zhu, Yuntian Liu, Zhenyu Zhang, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou
Abstract: Magnetoelectric coupling is crucial for uncovering fundamental phenomena and advancing technologies in high-density data storage and energy-efficient devices. The emergence of altermagnets, which unify the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, offers unprecedented opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling. However, electrically tuning altermagnets remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle supported by an effective model. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.

Title: Single-particle spectral function of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states
Authors: Fabian Pichler, Wilhelm Kadow, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Michael Knap
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states are the most prominent example of states with topological order, hosting excitations with fractionalized charge. Recent experiments in twisted $\text{MoTe}_2$ and graphene-based heterostructures provided evidence of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, which spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and persist even without an external magnetic field. Understanding the unique properties of these states requires the characterization of their low-energy excitations. To that end, we construct a parton theory for the energy and momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function of FQAH states. We explicitly consider several experimentally observed filling fractions as well as a composite Fermi liquid in the half-filled Chern band. The parton description qualitatively captures our numerical exact diagonalization results. Additionally, we discuss how the finite bandwidth of the Chern band and the non-ideal quantum geometry affect the fractionalized excitations. Our work demonstrates that the energy and momentum-resolved electronic single-particle spectral function provides a valuable tool to characterize fractionalized excitations of FQAH states in moiré lattices.

Title: Josephson effect and odd-frequency pairing in superconducting junctions with unconventional magnets
Authors: Yuri Fukaya, Kazuki Maeda, Keiji Yada, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Bo Lu
Abstract: We consider Josephson junctions formed by coupling two conventional superconductors via an unconventional magnet and investigate the formation of Andreev bound states, their impact on the Josephson effect, and the emergent superconducting correlations. We focus on unconventional magnets known as $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. We find that the Andreev bound states in $d$-wave altermagnet and $p_y$-wave magnet Josephson junctions strongly depend on the transverse momentum, with a spin splitting and low-energy minima as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$. In contrast, the Andreev bound states for $p_{x}$-wave magnets are insensitive to the transverse momentum. We show that the Andreev bound states can be probed by the local density of states in the middle of the junction, which also reveals that $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- and $p$-wave magnet junctions are prone to host zero energy peaks. While the zero-energy peak in $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnet junctions tends to oscillate with the magnetic order, it remains robust in $p$-wave magnet junctions. We also demonstrate that the critical currents in $d$-wave altermagnet Josephson junctions exhibit an oscillatory decay with the increase of the magnetic order, while the oscillations are absent in $p$-wave magnet junctions albeit the currents exhibit a slow decay. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the interplay of the Josephson effect and unconventional magnetic order of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets originates from odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave superconducting correlations that are otherwise absent. Our results can serve as a guide to pursue the new functionality of Josephson junctions based on unconventional magnets.

Title: Atomic-Scale Observation of Moire potential in Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride Layers by Electron Microscopy
Authors: Rina Mishima, Takuro Nagai, Hiroyo Segawa, Masahiro Ehara, Takashi Uchino
Abstract: Moire superlattices (MSLs) are an emerging class of two-dimensional functional materials whose electronic states can be tuned by the twist angle between two van der Waals layers and/or the relative placement of the layers. The intriguing properties of MSLs are closely correlated to the moiré potential, which is the electrostatic potential induced by interlayer coupling. Intensive efforts have been made to understand the nature and distribution of the moire potential by using various experimental and theoretical techniques. However, the experimental observation of the moiré potential is still challenging because of the possible presence of the surface and/or interlayer contaminants. In this work, we develop a method to obtain hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanolayers (with or without twist) using a specially designed chemical exfoliation technique. The resulting hBN nanolayers are atomically clean and strain free, hence providing ideal MSLs for the investigation of their moiré potential. Aberration-corrected high resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements on the twisted hBN nanolayers allow us to observe moiré diffraction spots in Fourier space. Then, the moire potential is reconstructed by the inverse fast Fourier transform of the moire diffraction spots. It has been revealed that the local interlayer atomic overlap plays a decisive role in determining the periodicity and distribution of the moiré potential, as supported by density functional theory calculations. This work not only provides a general strategy to observe the moire potential in MSLs, but it also expands the application of electron microscopy to the further study of MSLs with atomic resolution.

Title: $NVU$ view on energy polydisperse Lennard-Jones systems
Authors: Danqi Lang, Lorenzo Costigliola, Jeppe C. Dyre
Abstract: When energy polydispersity is introduced into the Lennard-Jones (LJ) system, there is little effect on structure and dynamics [Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 2837 (2023)]. For instance, at a given state point both the radial distribution function and the mean-square displacement as a function of time are virtually unaffected by even large energy polydispersity; this is in stark contrast to what happens when size polydispersity is introduced. We here argue -- and validate by simulations of up to 30\% polydispersity -- that this almost invariance of structure and dynamics reflects an approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface. Because $NVU$ dynamics (defined as geodesic motion at constant potential energy) is equivalent to Newtonian dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface implies virtually the same physics of energy polydisperse LJ systems as of the standard single-component version. In contrast, the constant-potential-energy surface is significantly affected by introducing size polydispersity.

Title: Xenon-metal pair formation in UO2 investigated using DFT+U
Authors: Linu Malakkal, Shuxiang Zhou, Himani Mishra, Jia Hong Ke, Chao Jiang, Lingfeng He, Sudipta Biswas
Abstract: A recent experimental study on a spent uranium dioxide (UO2) fuel sample from Belgium Reactor 3 (BR3) identified a unique pair structure formed by the noble metal phase (NMP) and fission gas (xenon [Xe]) precipitate. However, the fundamental mechanism behind this structure remains unclear. The present study aims to provide an understanding of the interaction between five different metal precipitates (molybdenum [Mo], ruthenium [Ru], palladium [Pd], technetium [Tc], and rhodium [Rh]) and the Xe fission gas atoms in UO2, by using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with the Hubbard U correction to compute the formation energies involved. All DFT+U calculations were performed with occupation matrix control to ensure antiferromagnetic ordering of UO2. The calculated formation and binding energies of the Xe and solid fission products in the NMP reveal that these metal precipitates form stable pair structures with Xe. Notably, the formation energy of Xe-metal pairs is lower than that of the isolated single defects in all instances, with Pd and Mo showing the most favourable binding energy, likely accounting for the observed pair structure formation.

Title: Anderson localization: A disorder-induced quantum bound state
Authors: Václav Janiš
Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy may lose their ability to propagate to long distances in certain disordered media. We use Green functions and solve parquet equations in high spatial dimensions to construct a conserving mean-field theory of the metallic and localized phases with the transition between them in the disordered Anderson model. We find that the static diffusion constant $D$ does not vanish at the Anderson localization transition. The divergence of a new time scale, proportional to the static electrical polarizability, signals the vanishing of diffusion. We introduce an extension of the diffusion equation to reach a consistent microscopic picture of the Anderson localization transition and the localized phase. Anderson localization is caused by the emergence of a spatially localized quantum bound state.

Title: Droplet impact on elastic substrates: force scaling crossover
Authors: Yuto Yokoyama, Hirokazu Maruoka, Yoshiyuki Tagawa
Abstract: Droplet impacts are fundamental to fluid-structure interactions, shaping processes from erosion to bioprinting. While previous scaling laws have provided insights into droplet dynamics, force scaling laws remain insufficiently understood, particularly for soft substrates where both the droplet and substrate deform significantly. Here, we show that droplet impacts on elastic substrates exhibit a scaling crossover in maximum impact force, transitioning from inertial force scaling, typical for rigid substrates under high inertia, to Hertzian impact scaling, characteristic of rigid spheres on elastic substrates. Using high-speed photoelastic tomography, we captured high-resolution dynamic stress fields and identified a similarity parameter governing the interplay between droplet inertia, substrate elasticity, and deformation time scales. Our findings redefine how substrate properties influence impact forces, demonstrating that droplets under high inertia -- long thought to follow inertial force scaling -- can instead follow Hertzian impact scaling on soft substrates. This framework provides practical insights for designing soft, impact-resistant materials.

Title: The electronic structure, crystal fields, and magnetic anisotropy in RECo$_5$ magnets
Authors: Zhen Zhang, Andrey Kutepov, Leonid Pourovskii, Vladimir Antropov
Abstract: The current progress in describing rare-earth-based magnets' electronic structure and magnetic properties is discussed. We use several currently popular electronic structure methods to show the typical values of critical parameters that define the physics of RECo$_5$ (RE = rare earth atom) materials. The magnetic moments and anisotropy of 4\textit{f} atoms are obtained using several approaches, including anisotropic 4\textit{f}-charge density-constrained DFT and DFT+HI methods. We also suggest the introduction of 'penalty' functional for obtaining correct variational total energy in the traditional Hund's rule-constrained DFT-based techniques. The applicability and future extensions are discussed. The proposed combination of methods is potentially suitable for high-throughput computational searches of new rare-earth-containing magnetic materials.

Title: Observation of topological Anderson Chern insulator phase in MnBi$_4$Te$_7$ monolayer

Abstract: The correlation of topology and disorder has attracted great intention due to appropriate disorder could induce the phase transition between trivial and nontrivial topological states. While it is widely recognized that strong disorder can produce rich phase diagrams in topological nontrivial states, moderate disorder has been proposed to induce transitions into topologically nontrivial phases counter-intuitively, leading to the concept of topological Anderson insulators. This phenomenon has been theoretically explored and simulated in various systems, yet experimental realization in solid state systems has remained elusive due to challenges in controlling disorder. Here, we report the experimental observation of Chern insulator state signed by the coexistence of quantized Hall plateau and zero longitudinal resistance in monolayer MnBi$_4$Te$_7$ Hall bar device, which originally hosts a trivial insulating state with Chern number $C$ = 0 in clean limit. We demonstrate that the observed trivial to nontrivial transition in this monolayer device can be attributed to disorder, evidenced by universal conductance fluctuations. Our findings substantiate the existence of a long-sought topological Anderson Chern insulator in real materials, a unique variant of the topological Anderson insulator characterized by broken time-reversal-symmetry.

Title: Three-dimensional spin liquid state in the frustrated $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg garnet NaCa$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(VO$_{4}$)$_{3}$

Abstract: Three-dimensional quantum spin liquids have remained elusive, hindered by reduced quantum fluctuations from larger lattice connectivity inherent to high-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a spin-liquid phase emerges from the interplay of strongly frustrated exchange interactions and subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects.

Title: Classification of pair symmetries in superconductors with unconventional magnetism
Authors: Kazuki Maeda, Yuri Fukaya, Keiji Yada, Bo Lu, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: We consider superconductors with unconventional magnetism and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductors under the influence of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.

Title: Interactive Multiscale Modeling to Bridge Atomic Properties and Electrochemical Performance in Li-CO$_2$ Battery Design
Authors: Mohammed Lemaalem, Selva Chandrasekaran Selvaraj, Ilias Papailias, Naveen K. Dandu, Arash Namaeighasemi, Larry A. Curtiss, Amin Salehi-Khojin, Anh T. Ngo
Abstract: Li-CO$_2$ batteries show promise as energy storage solutions, offering high theoretical energy density and CO$_2$ fixation. Their performance relies on the formation and decomposition of Li$_2$CO$_3$/C during discharge and charge cycles, respectively. We used a multiscale modeling framework that integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT), Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate atomic and cell-level properties. The Li-CO$_2$ battery consists of a lithium metal anode, an ionic liquid electrolyte, and a carbon cloth porous cathode with a Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ catalyst. DFT and AIMD determined the electrical conductivities of Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ and Li$_2$CO$_3$ using the Kubo-Greenwood formalism and studied the CO$_2$ reduction mechanism on the cathode catalyst. MD simulations calculated the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, Li$^+$ transference number, ionic conductivity, and Li$^+$ solvation structure. The FEA model, incorporating results from atomistic simulations, reproduced experimental voltage-capacity profiles at 1 mA/cm$^2$ and revealed spatio-temporal variations in Li$_2$CO$_3$/C deposition, porosity, and CO$_2$ concentration dependence on discharge rates in the cathode. Accordingly, Li$_2$CO$_3$ can form toroidal and thin film deposits, leading to dispersed and local porosity changes at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ and 1 mA/cm$^2$, respectively. The capacity decreases exponentially from 81,570 mAh/g at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ to 6,200 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm$^2$, due to pore clogging that limits CO$_2$ transport to the cathode interior. Therefore, the performance of Li-CO$_2$ batteries can be significantly improved by enhancing CO$_2$ transport, regulating Li$_2$CO$_3$ deposition, and optimizing cathode architecture.

Title: Landau-level composition of bound exciton states in magnetic field
Authors: Dinh Van Tuan, Hanan Dery
Abstract: We present a theory that studies the state composition of a bound exciton in magnetic field. Using a basis set made of products of free electron and hole wavefunctions in Landau gauge, we derive a secular equation which shows the relation between Landau levels (LLs) of the electron and hole when a bound exciton is formed. Focusing on excitons in the light cone, we establish a scattering selection rule for the interaction of an electron in LL $n_\text{e}$ with a hole in LL $n_\text{h}$. We solve the resulting secular equation and identify a simple pairing law, $n_\text{e} = n_\text{h} + l$, which informs us on the construction of a bound exciton state with magnetic quantum number $l$, and on the interaction of the exciton magnetic moment with magnetic field. We obtain good agreement between theory results and recent measurements of the diamagnetic shifts of exciton states in WSe$_2$ monolayers.

Title: Multi-Type Instability Processes of Periodic Orbits in Nonlinear Chains
Authors: Weicheng Fu, Zhen Wang, Yong Zhang, Hong Zhao
Abstract: Nonlinear normal modes are periodic orbits that survive in nonlinear many-body Hamiltonian systems, and their instability is crucial for relaxation dynamics. Here, we study the instability process of the $\pi/3$-mode in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-$\alpha$ chain with fixed boundary conditions. We find that three types of bifurcations -- period-doubling, tangent, and Hopf -- coexist in this system, each driving instability at specific reduced wave-number $\tilde{k}$. Our analysis reveals a universal scaling law for the instability time $\mathcal{T} \propto (\lambda - \lambda_{\rm c})^{-1/2}$, independent of bifurcation types and models, where the critical perturbation strength $\lambda_{\rm c}$ scales as $\lambda_{\rm c} \propto (\tilde{k} - \tilde{k}_{\rm c})$, with $\tilde{k}_{\rm c}$ varying across bifurcations. We also observe a double instability phenomenon for certain system sizes, meaning that larger perturbations do not always lead to faster thermalization. These results provide new insights into the relaxation and thermalization dynamics in many-body systems.

Title: Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses
Authors: Adil A. Gangat
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space, where optimization is extremely slow with state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo methods. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much harder planted-solution instances, all in less than one hour per instance. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $<$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.

Title: Diagonal superexchange in a simple square CuO$_2$ lattice
Authors: V. A. Gavrichkov, S. I. Polukeev, S. G. Ovchinnikov
Abstract: Many microscopic models with the interaction between the next-nearest neighbours as a key parameter for cuprate physics have inspired us to study the diagonal superexchange interaction in a CuO$_2$ layer. Our investigation shows that models with extended hopping provide a correct representation of magnetic interactions only in a hypothetical square CuO$_2$ layer, where the diagonal superexchange interaction with the next-nearest neighbors always has the AFM nature. The conclusions are based on the symmetry prohibition on FM contribution to the diagonal superexchange between the next-nearest neighbors for a simple square CuO$_2$ layer rather than for a real CuO$_2$ layer, where diagonal AFM superexchange may be overestimated. We also discuss the reasons for magnetic frustration effects and high sensitivity of spin nanoinhomogeneity to square symmetry breaking.

Title: Strange relaxation and metastable behaviours of the Ising ferromagnetic thick cubic shell
Authors: Ishita Tikader, Muktish Acharyya
Abstract: We have studied the equilibrium and nonequilibrium behaviours of the Ising ferromagnetic thick cubic shell by Monte Carlo simulation. Our goal is to find the dependence of the responses on the thickness of the shell. In the equilibrium results, we found that the pseudo-critical temperature of ferro-para phase transition of thick cubic shell increases with the increase of the thickness following a hyperbolic tangent relation. In the nonequilibrium studies, the relaxation time has been found to decrease with the increase of the thickness of the cubic shell. Here three different regimes are found, namely rapid fall, plateau and linear region. The metastable behaviour has been studied also as another kind of non-equilibrium response. The metastable lifetime has been studied as function of the thickness of the cubic shell. A non-monotonic variation of metastable lifetime with the thickness of the shell is observed. A specified thickness for longest-lived metastability has been identified.

Title: Searching for fixed points of dynamical systems by the Explorative Relaxation Redistribution Method
Authors: Eliodoro Chiavazzo
Abstract: Being able to effectively locate saddle (and other fixed) points in dynamical systems holds tremendous implications in a number of applications in engineering and science, among which the study of rare events in molecular simulations stands as one of the most prominent field of interest. Although there is a vast literature on methods aiming at addressing this challenge, open issues still remain in several aspects such as computational efficiency and easy implementation. In this work, we suggest that the Relaxation Redistribution Method (RRM) - formerly introduced to solve the invariance equation in the context of stiff dynamical systems ruling detailed chemical kinetics - can be reformulated to locate saddle and other fixed points even for stochastic simulators driven by effective energy gradients. This new formulation of the RRM is referred to as the Explorative Relaxation Redistribution Method (ERRM). Benchmarks based on the popular Mueller-Brown and other potentials are used to test the ERRM.

Title: Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model
Authors: Martin Kjøllesdal Johnsrud, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.

Abstract: Silicon Carbide (SiC) is a typical material for third-generation semiconductor. The thermal boundary resistance (TBR) of 4H-SiC/SiO2 interface, was investigated by both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. The structure of 4H-SiC/SiO2 was characterized by using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The TBR is measured as 8.11*10-8 m2K/W by 3-omega method. Furthermore, the diffuse mismatch model was employed to predict the TBR of different interfaces which is in good agreement with measurements. Heat transport behavior based on phonon scattering perspective was also discussed to understand the variations of TBR across different interfaces. Besides, the intrinsic thermal conductivity of SiO2 thin films (200~1,500 nm in thickness) on 4H-SiC substrates was measured by 3 omega procedure, as 1.42 W/mK at room temperature. It is believed the presented results could provide useful insights on the thermal management and heat dissipation for SiC devices.

Title: Demonstration of Robust and Efficient Quantum Property Learning with Shallow Shadows
Authors: Hong-Ye Hu, Andi Gu, Swarnadeep Majumder, Hang Ren, Yipei Zhang, Derek S. Wang, Yi-Zhuang You, Zlatko Minev, Susanne F. Yelin, Alireza Seif
Abstract: Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is a major component of quantum information processing tasks. Randomized measurements, or classical shadows, enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single-qubit measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Prepending a shallow random quantum circuit before measurements maintains this experimental friendliness, but also has favorable sample complexities for observables beyond low-weight Paulis, including high-weight Paulis and global low-rank properties such as fidelity. However, in realistic scenarios, quantum noise accumulated with each additional layer of the shallow circuit biases the results. To address these challenges, we propose the \emph{robust shallow shadows protocol}. Our protocol uses Bayesian inference to learn the experimentally relevant noise model and mitigate it in postprocessing. This mitigation introduces a bias-variance trade-off: correcting for noise-induced bias comes at the cost of a larger estimator variance. Despite this increased variance, as we demonstrate on a superconducting quantum processor, our protocol correctly recovers state properties such as expectation values, fidelity, and entanglement entropy, while maintaining a lower sample complexity compared to the random single qubit measurement scheme. We also theoretically analyze the effects of noise on sample complexity and show how the optimal choice of the shallow shadow depth varies with noise strength. This combined theoretical and experimental analysis positions the robust shallow shadow protocol as a scalable, robust, and sample-efficient protocol for characterizing quantum states on current quantum computing platforms.

Title: Asymptotic theory of in-context learning by linear attention
Authors: Yue M. Lu, Mary I. Letey, Jacob A. Zavatone-Veth, Anindita Maiti, Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: Transformers have a remarkable ability to learn and execute tasks based on examples provided within the input itself, without explicit prior training. It has been argued that this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), is a cornerstone of Transformers' success, yet questions about the necessary sample complexity, pretraining task diversity, and context length for successful ICL remain unresolved. Here, we provide a precise answer to these questions in an exactly solvable model of ICL of a linear regression task by linear attention. We derive sharp asymptotics for the learning curve in a phenomenologically-rich scaling regime where the token dimension is taken to infinity; the context length and pretraining task diversity scale proportionally with the token dimension; and the number of pretraining examples scales quadratically. We demonstrate a double-descent learning curve with increasing pretraining examples, and uncover a phase transition in the model's behavior between low and high task diversity regimes: In the low diversity regime, the model tends toward memorization of training tasks, whereas in the high diversity regime, it achieves genuine in-context learning and generalization beyond the scope of pretrained tasks. These theoretical insights are empirically validated through experiments with both linear attention and full nonlinear Transformer architectures.

Title: Observable asymptotics of regularized Cox regression models with standard Gaussian designs: a statistical mechanics approach
Authors: Emanuele Massa, Anthony Coolen
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of the Regularized Maximum Partial Likelihood Estimator (RMPLE) in the proportional limit, considering an arbitrary convex regularizer and assuming that the covariates $\mathbf{X}_i\in\mathbb{R}^{p}$ follow a multivariate Gaussian law with covariance $\mathbf{I}_p/p$ for each $i=1, \dots, n$. In order to efficiently compute the estimator under investigation, we propose a modified Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm, that we name COX-AMP, and compare its performance with the Coordinate-wise Descent (CD) algorithm, which is taken as reference. By means of the Replica method, we derive a set of six Replica Symmetric (RS) equations that we show to correctly describe the average behaviour of the estimators when the sample size and the number of covariates is large and commensurate. These equations cannot be solved in practice, as the data generating process (that we are trying to estimate) is not known. However, the update equations of COX-AMP suggest the construction of a local field that can in turn be used to accurately estimate all the RS order parameters of the theory \emph{solely from the data}, \emph{without} actually solving the RS equations. We emphasize that this approach can be applied when the estimator is computed via any method and is not restricted to COX-AMP. Once the RS order parameters are estimated, we have access to the amount of signal and noise in the RMPLE, but also its generalization error, directly from the data. Although we focus on the Partial Likelihood objective, we envisage broader application of the methodology proposed here, for instance to GLMs with nuisance parameters, which include some non-proportional hazards models, e.g. Accelerated Failure Time models.

Title: Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Algorithms for Logistics Scheduling
Authors: Archismita Dalal, Iraitz Montalban, Narendra N. Hegade, Alejandro Gomez Cadavid, Enrique Solano, Abhishek Awasthi, Davide Vodola, Caitlin Jones, Horst Weiss, Gernot Füchsel
Abstract: We study a job shop scheduling problem for an automatized robot in a high-throughput laboratory and a travelling salesperson problem with recently proposed digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO)algorithms. In DCQO, we find the solution of an optimization problem via an adiabatic quantum dynamics, which is accelerated with counterdiabatic protocols. Thereafter, we digitize the global unitary to encode it in a digital quantum computer. For the job-shop scheduling problem, we aim at finding the optimal schedule for a robot executing a number of tasks under specific constraints, such that the total execution time of the process is minimized. For the traveling salesperson problem, the goal is to find the path that covers all cities and is associated with the shortest traveling distance. We consider both hybrid and pure versions of DCQO algorithms and benchmark the performance against digitized quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). In comparison to QAOA, the DCQO solution is improved by several orders of magnitude in success probability using the same number of two-qubit gates. Moreover, we implement our algorithms on cloud-based superconducting and trapped-ion quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that circuit compression using counterdiabatic protocols is amenable to current NISQ hardware and can solve logistics scheduling problems, where other digital quantum algorithms show insufficient performance.

Title: A physics-encoded Fourier neural operator approach for surrogate modeling of divergence-free stress fields in solids
Authors: Mohammad S. Khorrami, Pawan Goyal, Jaber R. Mianroodi, Bob Svendsen, Peter Benner, Dierk Raabe
Abstract: The purpose of the current work is the development of a so-called physics-encoded Fourier neural operator (PeFNO) for surrogate modeling of the quasi-static equilibrium stress field in solids. Rather than accounting for constraints from physics in the loss function as done in the (now standard) physics-informed approach, the physics-encoded approach incorporates or "encodes" such constraints directly into the network or operator architecture. As a result, in contrast to the physics-informed approach in which only training is physically constrained, both training and output are physically constrained in the physics-encoded approach. For the current constraint of divergence-free stress, a novel encoding approach based on a stress potential is proposed. As a "proof-of-concept" example application of the proposed PeFNO, a heterogeneous polycrystalline material consisting of isotropic elastic grains subject to uniaxial extension is considered. Stress field data for training are obtained from the numerical solution of a corresponding boundary-value problem for quasi-static mechanical equilibrium. This data is also employed to train an analogous physics-guided FNO (PgFNO) and physics-informed FNO (PiFNO) for comparison. As confirmed by this comparison and as expected on the basis of their differences, the output of the trained PeFNO is significantly more accurate in satisfying mechanical equilibrium than the output of either the trained PgFNO or the trained PiFNO.

Title: Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization Model for Composite Superconductors
Authors: Julien Dular, Arjan Verweij, Mariusz Wozniak
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization (ROHM) model to describe the magnetization and instantaneous power loss of composite superconductors subject to time-varying magnetic fields. Once the parameters of the ROHM model are fixed based on reference simulations, it allows to directly compute the macroscopic response of composite superconductors without the need to solve the detailed current density distribution. It can then be used as part of a homogenization method in large-scale superconducting models to significantly reduce the computational effort compared to detailed simulations. In this contribution, we focus on the case of a strand with twisted superconducting filaments subject to a time-varying transverse magnetic field. We propose two variations of the ROHM model: (i) a rate-independent model that reproduces hysteresis in the filaments, and (ii) a rate-dependent model that generalizes the first level by also reproducing dynamic effects due to coupling and eddy currents. We then describe the implementation and inclusion of the ROHM model in a finite element framework, discuss how to deduce the model parameters, and finally demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in terms of accuracy and efficiency over a wide range of excitation frequencies and amplitudes.

Title: Geometry Dependent Localization of Surface Plasmons on Random Gold Nanoparticle Assemblies
Authors: Mohammed Fayis Kalady, Johannes Schultz, Kristina Weinel, Daniel Wolf, Axel Lubk
Abstract: Assemblies of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) support hybridized modes of localized surface plasmons (LSPs), which delocalize in geometrically well-ordered arrangements. Here, the hybridization behavior of LSPs in geometrically completely disordered arrangements of Au NPs fabricated by an e-beam synthesis method is studied. Employing electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope in combination with numerical simulations, the disorder-driven spatial and spectral localization of the coupled LSP modes that depend on the NP thickness is revealed. Below 0.4 nm sample thickness (flat NPs), localization increases towards higher hybridized LSP mode energies. In comparison, above 10 nm thickness, a decrease of localization (an increase of delocalization) with higher mode energies is observed. In the intermediate thickness regime, a transition of the energy dependence of the localization between the two limiting cases, exhibiting a transition mode energy with minimal localization, is observed. This behavior is mainly driven by the energy and thickness dependence of the polarizability of the individual NPs.

Title: Local Field Statistics in Linear Elastic Unidirectional Fibrous Composites
Authors: Tarkes Dora Pallicity, Maximillian Krause, Thomas Böhlke
Abstract: Statistical fluctuations of local tensorial fields beyond the mean are relevant to predict localized failure or overall behavior of the inelastic composites. The expression for second moments of the local fields can be established using the Hill-Mandel condition. Complete estimation of statistical fluctuations via second moments is usually ignored despite its significance. In Eshelby-based mean-field approaches, the second moments are evaluated through derivatives of Hill's Polarization tensor $ \left ( \mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{o}} \right )$ using a singular approximation. Typically, semi-analytical procedures using numerical integration are used to evaluate the derivatives of the polarization tensor $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{o}}$. Here, new analytically derived explicit expressions are presented for calculating the derivatives, specifically for unidirectional fibrous composites with isotropic phases. Full-field homogenization using finite element is used to compute the statistical distribution of local fields (exact solution) for the class of random fibrous microstructures. The mean-field estimates are validated with the exact solution across different fiber volume fractions and aspect ratios. The results indicate that the fiber volume fraction significantly influences the fluctuation of stress tensor invariants, whereas the aspect ratio has minimal effect.

Title: Microscopic Theory of Polariton Group Velocity Renormalization
Authors: Wenxiang Ying, Benjamin X. K. Chng, Milan Delor, Pengfei Huo
Abstract: Cavity exciton-polaritons exhibit ballistic transport and can achieve a distance of 100 $\mu $m in one picosecond. This ballistic transport significantly enhances mobility compared to that of bare excitons, which often move diffusively and become the bottleneck for energy conversion and transfer devices. Despite being robustly reproduced in experiments and simulations, there is no comprehensive microscopic theory addressing the group velocity of polariton transport, and its renormalization due to phonon scattering while still preserving this ballistic behavior. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory to describe the group velocity renormalization using a finite-temperature Green's function approach. Utilizing the generalized Holstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, we analytically derive an expression for the group velocity renormalization and find that it is caused by phonon-mediated transitions from the lower polariton (LP) states to the dark states, then scattering from dark states back to LP. The dark states do not have to be populated in this process, serving as the virtual state for super-exchange (especially true for a large light-matter detuning). The theory predicts that the magnitude of group velocity renormalization scales linearly with the phonon bath reorganization energy under weak coupling conditions (perturbative regime for exciton-phonon coupling) and also linearly depends on the temperature in the high-temperature regime. These predictions are numerically verified using quantum dynamics simulations, demonstrating quantitative agreement. Our findings provide theoretical insights and a predictive analytical framework that advance the understanding and design of cavity-modified semiconductors and molecular ensembles, opening new avenues for engineered polaritonic devices.

Title: Deep Linear Network Training Dynamics from Random Initialization: Data, Width, Depth, and Hyperparameter Transfer
Authors: Blake Bordelon, Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: We theoretically characterize gradient descent dynamics in deep linear networks trained at large width from random initialization and on large quantities of random data. Our theory captures the ``wider is better" effect of mean-field/maximum-update parameterized networks as well as hyperparameter transfer effects, which can be contrasted with the neural-tangent parameterization where optimal learning rates shift with model width. We provide asymptotic descriptions of both non-residual and residual neural networks, the latter of which enables an infinite depth limit when branches are scaled as $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. We also compare training with one-pass stochastic gradient descent to the dynamics when training data are repeated at each iteration. Lastly, we show that this model recovers the accelerated power law training dynamics for power law structured data in the rich regime observed in recent works.
