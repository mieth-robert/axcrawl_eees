Title: A Functional Human Liver Tissue Model: 3D Bioprinted Co-culture Discoids
Authors: Vignesh Subramaniam, Carolina Abrahan, Brett Higgins, Steven J. Chisolm, Baleigh Sweeney, Senthilkumar Duraivel, Leandro Balzano-Nogueira, Glyn D. Palmer, Thomas E. Angelini
Abstract: To reduce costs and delays related to developing new and effective drugs, there is a critical need for improved human liver tissue models. Here we describe an approach for 3D bioprinting functional human liver tissue models, in which we fabricate disc-shaped structures (discoids) 200 {\mu}m in thickness and 1-3 mm in diameter, embedded in a highly permeable support medium made from packed microgels. We demonstrate that the method is precise, accurate, and scalable; up to 100 tissues per hour can be manufactured with a variability and error in diameter of about 4%. Histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation of printed discs reveal self-organization, cell cohesion, and key liver marker expression. During the course of 3-4 weeks in culture, the tissues stably synthesize albumin and urea at high levels, outperforming spheroid tissue models. We find the tissues express more than 100 genes associated with molecular absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) at levels within the range of human liver. The liver tissue models exhibit enzymatic formation of metabolites after exposure to multiple test compounds. Together, these results demonstrate the promise of 3D printed discoids for pharmacological and toxicological applications.

Title: Theory of superconducting proximity effect in hole-based hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices
Authors: D. Michel Pino, Rubén Seoane-Souto, Maria José Calderón, Ramón Aguado, José Carlos Abadillo-Uriel
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems have received a great deal of attention in the last few years because of their potential for quantum engineering, including novel qubits and topological devices. The proximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inherits superconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of such hybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in hole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise mechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlations remains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complex strong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses to electric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance of understanding the interplay between such effects and the proximity effect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus on germanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop an effective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extract various analytical expressions and predict different types of superconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet and triplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as well as different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, together with their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows us to make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence of f-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimes caused by large in-plane magnetic fields.

Title: Evidence for a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid in the generalized Shastry-Sutherland model
Authors: Atanu Maity, Francesco Ferrari, Jong Yeon Lee, Janik Potten, Tobias Müller, Ronny Thomale, Rhine Samajdar, Yasir Iqbal
Abstract: We present a multimethod investigation into the nature of the recently reported quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase in the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. A comprehensive projective symmetry group classification of fermionic mean-field Ansätze on this lattice yields 46 U(1) and 80 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ states. Motivated by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations suggesting that the Shastry-Sutherland model and the square-lattice $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet putatively share the same QSL phase, we establish a mapping of our Ansätze to those of the square lattice. This enables us to identify the equivalent of the square-lattice QSL (Z2A$zz$13) in the Shastry-Sutherland system. Employing state-of-the-art variational Monte Carlo calculations with Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions improved upon by Lanczos steps, we demonstrate the excellent agreement of energies and correlators between a gapless (Dirac) $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid -- characterized by only few parameters -- and approaches based on neural quantum states and DMRG. Furthermore, the real-space spin-spin correlations are shown to decay with the same power law as in the $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ square lattice model, which also hosts a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. Finally, we apply the recently developed Keldysh formulation of the pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group to compute the dynamical spin structure factor; these correlations exhibit the features expected due to Dirac cones in the excitation spectrum, thus providing strong independent evidence for a Dirac QSL ground state. Our finding of a $d$-wave pairing $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac QSL is consistent with the recently observed signatures of QSL behavior in Pr$_2$Ga$_2$BeO$_7$ and outlines predictions for future experiments.

Title: Quantum Geometry in Quantum Materials
Authors: Jiabin Yu, B. Andrei Bernevig, Raquel Queiroz, Enrico Rossi, Päivi Törmä, Bohm-Jung Yang
Abstract: Quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum geometric tensor, is pivotal in diverse physical phenomena in quantum materials. In condensed matter systems, quantum geometry refers to the geoemtric properties of Bloch states in the Brillouin zone. This pedagogical review provides an accessible introduction to the concept of quantum geometry, emphasizing its extensive implications across multiple domains. Specifically, we discuss the role of quantum geometry in optical responses, Landau levels, and fractional Chern insulators, as well as its influence on superfluid weight, spin stiffness, exciton condensates, electron-phonon coupling, etc. By integrating these topics, we underscore the pervasive significance of quantum geometry in understanding emergent behaviors in quantum materials. Finally, we present an outlook on open questions and potential future directions, highlighting the need for continued exploration in this rapidly developing field.

Title: Universal Wilson loop Bound of Quantum Geometry: $Z_2$ Bound and Physical Consequences
Authors: Jiabin Yu, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, B. Andrei Bernevig
Abstract: We define the absolute Wilson loop winding and prove that it bounds the quantum metric from below. This Wilson loop lower bound naturally reproduces the known Chern and Euler bounds of the quantum metric, and provides an explicit lower bound of the quantum metric due to the time-reversal protected $Z_2$ index, answering a hitherto open question. In general, the Wilson loop lower bound can be applied to any other topological invariants characterized by Wilson loop winding, such as the particle-hole $Z_2$ index. As physical consequences of the $Z_2$ bound, we show that the time-reversal $Z_2$ index bounds superfluid weight and optical conductivity from below, and bounds the direct gap of a band insulator from above.

Title: First-principles determination of refractory binary alloy mechanical properties for the microscopic design of complex structural materials
Authors: Surya T. Bijjala, Susan R. Atlas, Pankaj Kumar
Abstract: The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Density functional theory (DFT)-based methods provide a powerful mechanism for computing and probing the microscopic features of elastic tensor-related properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), for a comprehensive set of structural refractory body-centered cubic (BCC) binary alloys of molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), and tungsten (W). Intermediate quantities (force-response internal-strain tensor, $\Lambda$, and displacement-response internal-strain tensor, $\Gamma$) needed to compute the relaxed-ion elastic tensor are used here to map heterogeneity in elastic constants at each lattice site in a given alloy and associated relaxation fields. Derived polycrystalline aggregate properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), and Poisson's ratio ($\nu$) and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all binaries. Pugh's ratio ($B/G$) and the Cauchy pressure ($C'$) derived from computed elastic moduli are analyzed in order to evaluate the effect of alloying on the mechanical properties of the refractory BCC binary alloys. The computed mechanical properties data for the parent unary materials and binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. These results, together with computed microscopic field data, establish a foundation for the principled design of compositionally-complex, high-temperature-structural refractory alloys with desired elastic properties.

Title: Roles of Structural Coordination and Strain Orientation in the Phase Stability of Ferroelectric HfO$_2$
Authors: Adedamola D. Aladese, Xiao Shen
Abstract: Phase stabilization continues to be a critical issue in hafnium oxide (HfO$_2$) due to the interdependence of various contributing factors. Using first-principles calculations, we analyze the effects of strain and doping on stabilizing the ferroelectric phase. We found that combining Y-doping, O-vacancy, and compressive biaxial strain, particularly in the (111) orientation, offers an optimal pathway for stabilizing the ferroelectric phase of HfO$_2$. Analysis of structural coordination reveals how compressive strain affects phase competition. Crystallography analysis provides insights into the advantage of the (111) strain orientation compared to the (001) orientation. The impact of dopants is discussed in the context of these findings.

Title: Effective Lagrangian for the macroscopic motion of Weyl fermions in $^3$He-A
Authors: M. Selch, M. A. Zubkov
Abstract: We consider macroscopic motion of $^3$He-A in global thermodynamic equilibrium within the context of the Zubarev statistical operator method. We formulate the corresponding effective theory in the language of the functional integral. The effective Lagrangian comprising macroscopic motion of fermionic excitations is calculated explicitly for the emergent relativistic fermions of the superfluid $^3$He-A-phase in the non-trivial bosonic background due to a space and time dependent matrix-valued vierbein featuring nonzero torsion as well as the Nieh-Yan anomaly. The matrix-valued vierbein formulation comprises an additional two dimensional internal spin space which may be replaced by one featuring a fermionic theory with a real valued vierbein, two Abelian gauge fields and a spin connection mixing the Dirac and internal spin spaces. As an application of the developed theory we consider macroscopic rotation around the axis of the pure integer mass vortices. The corresponding thermodynamical quantities of the normal component are analysed.

Title: Theoretical Investigation of Yield-Enhancing Equilibrium Sn$V^-$ Preparation Pathways in N-Doped Diamond
Authors: Aditya Bahulikar, Steven L. Richardson, Rodrick Kuate Defo
Abstract: The elucidation of the mechanism of Sn$V^-$ formation in diamond is especially important as the Sn$V^-$ color center has the potential to be a superior single-photon emitter when compared to the N$V$ and to other Group IV color centers. The typical formation of the Sn$V$ involves placing Sn in diamond by ion implantation, but the formation of a charged Sn$V$ species requires an additional complication. This complication is related to the energy cost associated with electronic transitions within the host diamond. Effectively, producing the Sn$V^-$ charge state using an electron obtained from a band edge of the host diamond is less energetically favorable than having the Sn$V^-$ receive an electron from a neighboring donor dopant. Among donor dopants, substitutional N (N$_\text{C}$) is always present in even the purest synthetic or natural diamond sample. The mechanism of electron donation by N$_\text{C}$ has been proposed by Collins for charging the N$V$ in diamond and it has been used to interpret many experimental results. Therefore, in this paper we use DFT to explore the pathways for the formation of the Sn$V^-$ charge state due to electron donation arising from the presence of N$_\text{C}$ in the host diamond. Explicitly, defect concentrations are calculated in equilibrium in each of the explored pathways to determine the yield of the Sn$V^-$ throughout each of the pathways. The importance of our work is to suggest experimental ways of enhancing the yield of charged states like the Sn$V^-$ in diamond for transformative applications in optoelectronics and quantum information.

Title: Angstrom-scale ionic streaming when electrical double-layer concept fails
Authors: Jiajia Lu (1), Shuyong Luan (2), Shenghui Guo (1), Libing Duan (1), Guanghua Du (3), Yanbo Xie (2) ((1) School of Physical Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi an, China (2) National Key Laboratory of Aircraft Configuration Design, School of Aeronautics and Institute of Extreme Mechanics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi an, China (3) Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou, China)
Abstract: A knowledge gap exists for flows and transport phenomena at the Angstrom scale when the Poisson Nernst Planck equation based on the concept of electrical double layer (EDL) fails. We discovered that streaming conductance becomes pressure dependent in Angstrom channels using latent track membranes. The streaming current emerges only when the applied pressure exceeds a threshold value, which is inconsistent with the existing knowledge as a constant. With increasing channel size, we found that the pressure dependent streaming conductance phenomenon weakens and vanishes into a constant streaming conductance regime when the mean channel radius exceeds 2 nm. The effective surface potential derived from the stream conductance that divides conduction anomalously increases as the channel narrows. We suspect the pressure dependent streaming current is due to the reinforced Coulomb interaction between counterions and deprotonated carboxyl groups at the surface, which is close to the ion channel but different from the electrified 2D materials. The streaming current emerged due to hydrodynamic friction when the counterions were released from the surface. We approximated the stochastic process of counterion dissociation by 1D Kramer escape theory framework and defined the Damkohler Number to describe the transition from nonlinear streaming conductance regime to linear regime as functions of applied pressure and channel radius and well explained the enhanced effective surface potential in confinement.

Title: Spectra of Magnetoroton and Chiral Graviton Modes of Fractional Chern Insulator
Authors: Min Long, Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model with hard-core bosons. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor, acquire a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. The sharper and more concentrated spectral weight of the roton mode is observed when approaching the FCI-CDW transition while the single-particle gap remains intact. We also resolve the graviton mode around $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone by measuring the dynamic quadrupolar density correlations. Interestingly, we not only reveal the graviton response is chiral for a certain FCI, but also show the different chiralities of the graviton of opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time. Our results offer the clear spectral observations of magnetoroton and chiral graviton in a lattice model of FCI and will have relevance towards the on-going experiments of tunable FCIs in quantum moiré materials.

Title: Pairing correlation of the Kagome-lattice Hubbard model with the nearest-neighbor interaction
Authors: Chen Yang, Chao Chen, Runyu Ma, Ying Liang, Tianxing Ma
Abstract: A recently discovered family of Kagome lattice materials, $\emph{A}\mathrm{V}_{3}\mathrm{Sb}_{5}$($\emph{A}$= $\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs}$), has attracted great interest, especially in the debate over its dominant superconducting pairing symmetry. To explore this issue, we study the superconducting pairing behavior within the Kagome-Hubbard model through the constrained path Monte Carlo method. It is found that doping around the Dirac point generates a dominant next-nearest-neighbour-$d$ pairing symmetry driven by on-site Coulomb interaction $U$. However, when considering the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$, it may induce nearest-neighbor-$p$ pairing to become the preferred pairing symmetry. Our results provide useful information to identify the dominant superconducting pairing symmetry in $\emph{A}\mathrm{V}_{3}\mathrm{Sb}_{5}$ family.

Title: Two-dimensional moir\'{e} phonon polaritons
Authors: Hao Shi, Chu Li, Ding Pan, Xi Dai
Abstract: Phonon polaritons are hybrid modes combining lattice dynamics and electromagnetic waves. Their behavior at long wavelengths is effectively described by Huang's equations. Here, we investigate phonon polaritons within 2D materials featuring twisted moiré structures. The interaction between electromagnetic waves and phonons of varying wavelengths gives rise to rich polaritons with moiré characteristics. We observe the polariton dividing into multiple branches, akin to coupled oscillators. Through numerical simulations based on realistic lattice models, we confirm the existence of these intriguing modes. A distinctive trait of moiré polar crystals is their spatially varying near-field response, offering robust signals for the experimental confirmation.

Title: Magneto-optical response of Dynes superconductors
Authors: Michal Šindler, František Herman, Filip Kadlec, Christelle Kadlec
Abstract: We investigate the terahertz conductivity of conventional superconductors in Voigt and Faraday magneto-optical configurations. In the Voigt geometry, an ultrathin superconducting film is fully penetrated by the magnetic field which interacts with the spin, thus modifying the magnitudes of the optical gap and of the density of the condensate. We provide an alternative interpretation of the recent experiments showing the gapless conductivity of a Nb film measured by Lee et al. [1] which describes better their data for magnetic field above 1 T. In the Faraday geometry, we analyze the terahertz conductivity of three NbN films with varying thicknesses using the Maxwell-Garnett model, treating vortices as normal-state inclusions within a superconducting matrix. Moreover, we effectively account for ubiquitous pair-conserving and magnetic-field-dependent pair-breaking disorder scattering processes using the model of Herman and Hlubina [2].

Title: Spin waves in magnetic nanodisks, nanorings, and 3D nanovolcanoes
Authors: Oleksandr Dobrovolskiy, Gleb Kakazei
Abstract: Patterned magnetic nanostructures are advanced materials characterized by their unique magnetic properties at the nanoscale, which are the result of tailored geometric configurations and compositional engineering. As interest in nanotechnology continues to grow exponentially, the exploration of patterned magnetic nanostructures turns into a vibrant and critical area of study for both industry professionals and academic researchers. Here, we review investigations of standing spin waves (collective spin precessions) in magnetic elements by the technique of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). The presentation encompasses earlier studies of arrays of magnetic nanodisks and nanoringes by cavity-based FMR as well as more recent studies of individual nanodisks and 3D nanovolcanoes by a broadband FMR method which implies the use of a coplanar waveguide. Overall, the manuscript outlines the development of FMR studies along the two major lines: (i) downscaling from multiple to individual magnetic nanoelements and (ii) extending planar nanomagnets into the third dimension.

Title: The simplest spin glass revisited: finite-size effects of the energy landscape can modify aging dynamics in the thermodynamic limit
Authors: Bin Li, Yuliang Jin
Abstract: The random energy model is one of the few glass models whose asymptotic activated aging dynamics are solvable. However, the existing aging theory, i.e., Bouchaud's trap model, does not agree with dynamical simulation results obtained in finite-sized systems. Here we show that this discrepancy originates from non-negligible finite-size corrections in the energy barrier distributions. The finite-size effects add a logarithmic decay term in the time-correlation aging function, which destroys the asymptotic large-time plateau predicted by Bouchaud's trap model in the spin glass phase. Surprisingly, the finite-size effects also give corrections, preserved even in the thermodynamic limit, to the value of the asymptotic plateau. It results in an unexpected dynamical transition where weak ergodicity breaking occurs, at a temperature $T_{\rm d}$ above the thermodynamic spin-glass transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$. Based on the barrier distributions obtained by a numerical barrier-tree method and an expansion theory, we propose a generalized trap model to incorporate such finite-size effects. The theoretically derived aging behavior of the generalized trap model explains the Monte-Carlo dynamical simulation data of random energy models with Gaussian and exponential random energies. Our results suggest that the double limits of large system size and long time are not interchangeable for the activated aging dynamics.

Title: Density of electronic states in density-wave compounds with imperfect nesting
Authors: A. V. Tsvetkova, Ya. I. Rodionov, P. D. Grigoriev
Abstract: We study the effects of imperfect nesting in a simple 2D tight-binding model on the electronic properties in the density-wave (DW) state. The discussed model reflects the main features of quasi-1D metals, where the DW emerges. We show that an imperfect nesting leads to unusual singularities in the quasi-particle density of states, leading to a strong renormalization of the superconducting critical temperature. We also compute the conductivity tensor of the normal state and obtain a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data on rare-earth tritellurides and many other DW materials.

Title: Observation of nonreciprocal transverse localization of light
Authors: Shun Liang, Changchang Li, Wenqing Yu, Zhenzhi Liu, Changbiao Li, Yanpeng Zhang, Guillaume Malpuech, Dmitry Solnyshkov, Hui Jing, Zhaoyang Zhang
Abstract: Magnetic-free nonreciprocal optical devices that can prevent backscattering of signals are essential for integrated optical information processing. The achieved nonreciprocal behaviors mostly rely on various dispersive effects in optical media, which give rise to dispersive modulations of the transverse beam profile, such as spatial broadening and discretization, of the incident signals. Such deformation inevitably reduces the matching with subsequent components for information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate the nonreciprocal transverse localization of light in a moiré photonic lattice induced in atomic vapors. When the probe field is set to co- or counter-propagate with the coupling field formed by superposing two identical honeycomb beams in a certain rotation angle, the output pattern can exhibit localized or dispersive behavior. The localization in the forward case is derived from the moiré structure, and the nonreciprocal behaviors (in both beam size and transmitted intensity) are introduced by the thermal motion of atoms. The thermal-motion-induced Doppler effect can destroy the coherent condition for electromagnetically induced transparency in the backward case, because of which the probe beam becomes immune to the modulation of the coupling field. The current work provides an approach to control the transverse beam profile in one-way transmission.

Title: Topic Review: Hatsugai-Kohmoto models: Exactly solvable playground for Mottness and Non-Fermi Liquid
Authors: Miaomiao Zhao, Wei-Wei Yang, Yin Zhong
Abstract: This pedagogic review aims to give a gentle introduction to an exactly solvable model, the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model, which has infinite-ranged interaction but conserves the center of mass. Although this model is invented in 1992, intensive studies on its properties ranging from unconventional superconductivity, topological ordered states to non-Fermi liquid behaviors are made since 2020. We focus on its emergent non-Fermi liquid behavior and provide discussion on its thermodynamics, single-particle and two-particle correlation functions. Perturbation around solvable limit has also been explored with the help of perturbation theory, renormalization group and exact diagonalization calculation. We hope the present review will be helpful for graduate students or researchers interested in HK-like models or more generic strongly correlated electron systems.

Title: Alternative harmonic detection approach for quantitative determination of spin and orbital torques
Authors: Y. Xu, B. Bony, S. Krishnia, R. Torrão Victor, S. Collin, A. Fert, J.-M. George, V. Cros, H. Jaffrès
Abstract: In this study, the spin-orbit torque (SOT) in light metal oxide systems is investigated using an experimental approach based on harmonic Hall voltage techniques in out-of-plane (OOP) angular geometry for samples with in-plane magnetic anisotropy. In parallel, an analytical derivation of this alternative OOP harmonic Hall detection geometry has been developed, followed by experimental validation to extract SOT effective fields. In addition, to accurately quantifying SOT, this method allows complete characterization of thermoelectric effects, opening promising avenues for accurate SOT characterization in related systems. In particular, this study corroborates the critical role of naturally oxidized copper interfaced with metallic Cu in the generation of orbital current in Co(2)|Pt(4)|CuOx(3), demonstrating a two-fold increase in damping-like torques compared to a reference sample with an oxidized Al capping layer. These findings offer promising directions for future research on the application aspect of non-equilibrium orbital angular momentum.

Title: Nematic liquid crystal flow driven by time-varying active surface anchoring
Authors: Seyed Reza Seyednejad, Miha Ravnik
Abstract: We demonstrate the generation of diverse material flow regimes in nematic liquid cells as driven by time-variable active surface anchoring, including no-net flow, oscillatory flow, steady flow, and pulsating flow. Specifically, we numerically simulate a passive nematic fluid inside a cell bounded with two flat solid boundaries at which the time-dependent anchoring is applied with the dynamically variable surface anchoring easy axis. We show that different flow regimes emerge as the result of different anchoring driving directions (i.e. co-rotating or counter-rotating) and relative phase of anchoring driving. The flow magnitude is tunable by cell thickness and anchoring driving frequency. More generally, this work aims towards possible applications of responsive time-variable surfaces, including photonics or synthetic active matter.

Title: Majorana Flat Bands in the Vortex Line of Superconducting Weyl Semimetals
Authors: Zhicheng Zhang, Kou-Han Ma
Abstract: We find that there exist Majorana flat bands (MFBs) in the vortex line of superconducting (SC) Weyl semimetals which break time reversal symmetry. Since a Weyl semimetal can be regarded as Chern insulators stacked along one (z) direction, so we decompose the vortex bound states of SC Weyl semimetals into the vortex bound states of SC Chern insulators labelled by kz. After calculating the topological phase diagram of the SC Chern insulators both analytically and numerically, we can explain the appearance of MFBs and determine the exact boundaries of them in SC Weyl semimetals. What's more, tuning the chemical potential or the pairing strength can result in the MFBs along the whole kz axis. Based on the above understanding, we propose a kz-dependent Z2 Chern-Simons invariant to characterize the MFBs. Finally, if we further consider an attractive Hubbard interaction, the aforementioned SC Weyl semimetal and MFBs can be realized under appropriate parameters.

Title: Clifford circuits Augmented Matrix Product States for fermion systems
Authors: Jiale Huang, Xiangjian Qian, Mingpu Qin
Abstract: Clifford circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) was recently proposed to leverage the advantages of both Clifford circuits and Matrix Product States (MPS). Clifford circuits can support large entanglement and can be efficiently simulated classically according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. So in CAMPS, MPS needs only to handle the so-called Non-stabilizerness Entanglement Entropy which significantly improves the simulation accuracy for a given bond dimension. In this work, we generalize CAMPS to study the Fermion system by taking advantage of the Jordan-Wigner transformation which can map the studied Fermion system to a spin system. We benchmark the method on both the spinless $t-V$ model and the spinful Hubbard model. Our test results show significant improvement of the accuracy of CAMPS over MPS, especially when the interactions are strong. Fermionic CAMPS provides a useful tool for the accurate study of many-body fermion systems in the future and has the potential to help resolve long-standing issues.

Title: Cavity-mediated hybridization of several molecules in the strong coupling regime
Authors: Jahangir Nobakht, André Pscherer, Jan Renger, Stephan Götzinger, Vahid Sandoghdar
Abstract: Molecular complexes are held together via a variety of bonds, but they all share the common feature that their individual entities are in contact. In this work, we introduce and demonstrate the concept of a \textit{molecular optical bond}, resulting from the far-field electromagnetic coupling of several molecules via a shared mode of an optical microcavity. We discuss a collective enhancement of the vacuum Rabi splitting and study super- and sub-radiant states that arise from the cavity-mediated coupling both in the resonant and dispersive regimes. Moreover, we demonstrate a two-photon transition that emerges between the ground and excited states of the new optical compound. Our experimental data are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian and open the door to the realization of hybrid light-matter materials.

Title: Defect-mediated electron-phonon coupling in halide double perovskite
Authors: Aprajita Joshi, Sajid Saikia, Shalini Badola, Angshuman Nag, Surajit Saha
Abstract: Optically active defects often play a crucial role in governing the light emission as well as the electronic properties of materials. Moreover, defect-mediated states in the mid-gap region can trap electrons, thus opening a path for the recombination of electrons and holes in lower energy states that may require phonons in the process. Considering this, we have probed electron-phonon interaction in halide perovskite systems with the introduction of defects and investigated the thermal effect on this interaction. Here, we report Raman spectroscopy study of the thermal evolution of electron-phonon coupling, which is tunable with the crystal growth conditions, in the halide perovskite systems Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2NaInCl6. The signature of electron-phonon coupling is observed as a Fano anomaly in the lowest frequency phonon mode (51 cm-1) which evolves with temperature. In addition, we observe a broad band in the photoluminescence (PL) measurements for the defect-mediated systems, which is otherwise absent in defect-free halide perovskite. The simultaneous observation of the Fano anomaly in the Raman spectrum and the emergence of the PL band suggests the defect-mediated mid-gap states and the consequent existence of electron-phonon coupling in the double perovskite.

Title: The Physics of Quantum 2.0: Challenges in understanding Quantum Matter
Authors: Siddhartha Lal, Mayank Shreshtha
Abstract: Almost a century on from the culmination of the first revolution in quantum physics, we are poised for another. Even as we engage in the creation of impactful quantum technologies, it is imperative for us to face the challenges in understanding the phenomenology of various emergent forms of quantum matter. This will involve building on decades of progress in quantum condensed matter physics, and going beyond the well-established Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson paradigm for quantum matter. We outline and discuss several outstanding challenges, including the need to explore and identify the organisational principles that can guide the development of theories, key experimental phenomenologies that continue to confound, and the formulation of methods that enable progress. These efforts will enable the prediction of new quantum materials whose properties facilitate the creation of next generation technologies.

Title: Deterministic role of chemical bonding in the formation of altermagnetism: Reflection from correlated electron system NiS
Authors: Arijit Mandal, Arindom Das, B.R.K. Nanda
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new collinear magnetic state that has traits of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, has gained significant attention in the last few years and the underlying mechanisms driving this quantum phase are still evolving. Going beyond the phenomenological models and group theoretical analyses, which focus on providing a binary explanation of the presence or absence of the altermagnetic state, in this work, we explored the role of crystal chemical bonding. As the latter successfully integrates the crystal and orbital symmetries and is tunable, it provides a quantitative and more realistic mechanism to explain the formation of altermagnetism. From the first principle calculations and tight-binding models within the framework of the linear combination of atomic orbitals on NiS, belonging to the hexagonal NiAs family (e.g. CrSb, MnTe, etc.), we reveal that the second neighbor interaction between the orbitals of the non-magnetic atoms is the most deterministic in inducing altermagnetism. These second-neighbor bondings modulate the intra-sublattice interactions differently for the opposite spin sublattices. As a consequence, the antiferromagnetic sublattice band degeneracy is lifted and it results in momentum dependent altermagnetic spin split (ASS). We further reveal that the strong altermagnetism is observed in these materials due to the participation of multiple and selective orbitals, both from Ni and S, in the chemical bonding. We proposed twelve antinodal regions in the NiAs type hexagonal crystals, where ASS split is maximum. Specific to NiS, ASS increases with correlation, and for the edge valence and conduction bands it can go beyond 1eV, which makes this compound ideal for carrying out altermagnetic experiments and for exploring non-trivial quantum transport through electron and hole doping. The present study opens up new pathways to tailor tunable altermagnetism.

Title: Non-perturbative self-consistent electron-phonon spectral functions and transport
Authors: Jae-Mo Lihm, Samuel Poncé
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling often dominates the electron spectral functions and carrier transport properties. However, studies of this effect in real materials have largely relied on perturbative one-shot methods due to the lack of a first-principles theoretical and computational framework. Here, we present a self-consistent theory and implementation for the non-perturbative calculations of spectral functions and conductivity due to electron-phonon coupling. Applying this method to monolayer InSe, we demonstrate that self-consistency qualitatively affects the spectral function and transport properties compared to state-of-the-art one-shot calculations and allow one to reconcile experimental angle-resolved photoemission experiments. The developed method can be widely applied to materials with dominant electron-phonon coupling at moderate computational cost.

Title: On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems
Authors: Ashutosh Dwibedi, Subhalaxmi Nayak, Sathe Subodh Kiran, Sabyasachi Ghosh, Sesha Vempati
Abstract: A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in Heavy ion collisions (HIC) with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net carrier density emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the hydrodynamic domain's transport variables. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature. In searching whether the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law is obeyed or violated by checking the Lorenz ratio as one or deviated from one, we find that the Lorenz ratio determined from the fluid-based framework will always be responsible for the violation of the WF law. The reason is the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per particle in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene, and QGP, both systems at low net charge density, exhibit WF law violation due to their fluid nature. However, graphene at high net charge density obeys the WF law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high-density domain. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of QGP at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic matter (CBM) and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) experiments.

Title: Angle-resolved photoemission of topological materials
Authors: Jaime Sánchez-Barriga, Oliver J. Clark, Oliver Rader
Abstract: Topological materials have gained significant attention in condensed matter physics due to their unique electronic and transport properties. Three-dimensional (3D) topological materials are characterized by robust electronic states that are protected by symmetries and exhibit peculiar spin textures. They offer a rich platform for for future information technology including spintronics and topological quantum computing. Here, we review the investigation by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) of topological phases such as strong topological insulators, topological crystalline insulators, magnetic topological insulators, and 3D Dirac, Weyl, nodal, and chiral semimetals and address the status of correlated topological insulators and topological superconductors. A special emphasis is laid on examples from the transition metal dichalcogenide family. Moreover, insights from ultrafast pump-probe experiments are reviewed and a brief outlook is provided.

Title: Thick liquid crystalline cholesteric shells
Authors: Arda Bulut, Yusuf Sariyar, Giuseppe Negro, Livio Nicola Carenza
Abstract: We numerically investigate the phase behavior of thick shells of cholesteric liquid crystals with tangential anchoring at the shell boundary. For achiral liquid crystal, we demonstrate a thickness-dependent transition from a configuration featuring four disclination line connecting the inner and outer surfaces to a state free of defect in the bulk, where each surface is topologically isolated and features two boojums. Incorporating chirality stabilizes novel defect arrangements, including a mixed state combining boojums and disclination lines and blue phases at high chirality and we demonstrate that shell thickness strongly modulates these transitions. Finally, we exploit the metastability features of the observed phases to obtain an elastically induced rearrangement of the shell surfaces during a cholesteric hysteresis cycle, stabilizing an alternative configuration that minimizes the free energy at low chirality. Our work paves the way for exploring dynamic behaviors under external fields, mixed anchoring conditions, or active flows.

Title: Thermal Induced Structural Competitiveness and Metastability of Body-centered Cubic Iron under Non-Equilibrium Conditions
Authors: Shuai Zhang, Aliza Panjwani, Penghao Xiao, Maitrayee Ghosh, Tadashi Ogitsu, Yuan Ping, S. X. Hu
Abstract: The structure and stability of iron near melting at multi-megabar pressures are of significant interest in high pressure physics and earth and planetary sciences. While the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase is generally recognized as unstable at lower temperatures, its stability relative to the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phase at high temperatures (approximately 0.5 eV) in the Earth's inner core (IC) remains a topic of ongoing theoretical and experimental debate. Our ab initio calculations show a significant drop in energy, the emergence of a plateau and a local minimum in the potential energy surface, and stabilization of all phonon modes at elevated electron temperatures (>1-1.5 eV). These effects increase the competition among the BCC, HCP, and the face-centered cubic (FCC) phases and lead to the metastability of the BCC structure. Furthermore, the thermodynamic stability of BCC iron is enhanced by its substantial lattice vibration entropy. This thermally induced structural competitiveness and metastability under non-equilibrium conditions provide a clear theoretical framework for understanding iron phase relations and solidification processes, both experimentally and in the IC.

Title: Non-reciprocal neutral ferroelectric domain walls in BiFeO3
Authors: M. A. P. Goncalves, M. Graf, M. Pasciak, J. Hlinka
Abstract: This paper analyzes a peculiar phenomenon of non-reciprocal domain wall pairs and illustrate the implications in ab-initio-based atomistic computational experiments with (112)-oriented planar R180 domain walls within the canonical multiferroic ferroelectric crystal of BiFeO3. Results show that parallel walls on the opposite sides of a given domain within a simply twinned lamellar domain structure can have considerably different polarization and oxygen octahedra tilt profiles, different thickness and energy densities. The spontaneous formation of zigzag walls and triangular domains suggests that these domain walls are actually the lowest energy planar R180 walls in pure insulating BiFeO3 crystals and films.

Title: Phase behavior of Cacio and Pepe sauce
Authors: Giacomo Bartolucci, Daniel Maria Busiello, Matteo Ciarchi, Alberto Corticelli, Ivan Di Terlizzi, Fabrizio Olmeda, Davide Revignas, Vincenzo Maria Schimmenti
Abstract: "Pasta alla Cacio e pepe" is a traditional Italian dish made with pasta, pecorino cheese, and pepper. Despite its simple ingredient list, achieving the perfect texture and creaminess of the sauce can be challenging. In this study, we systematically explore the phase behavior of Cacio and pepe sauce, focusing on its stability at increasing temperatures for various proportions of cheese, water, and starch. We identify starch concentration as the key factor influencing sauce stability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically, we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1% (relative to cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition determining what we term the "Mozzarella Phase" and corresponding to an unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level, observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model. Finally, we present a scientifically optimized recipe based on our findings, enabling a consistently flawless execution of this classic dish.

Title: Measurement-Induced Phase Transition in State Estimation of Chaotic Systems and the Directed Polymer
Authors: Federico Gerbino, Guido Giachetti, Pierre Le Doussal, Andrea De Luca
Abstract: We introduce a solvable model of a measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) in a deterministic but chaotic dynamical system with a positive Lyapunov exponent. In this setup, an observer only has a probabilistic description of the system but mitigates chaos-induced uncertainty through repeated measurements. Using a minimal representation via a branching tree, we map this problem to the directed polymer (DP) model on the Cayley tree, although in a regime dominated by rare events. By studying the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution estimated by the observer, we demonstrate a phase transition distinguishing a chaotic phase with reduced Lyapunov exponent from a strong-measurement phase where uncertainty remains bounded. Remarkably, the location of the MIPT transition coincides with the freezing transition of the DP, although the critical properties differ. We provide an exact universal scaling function describing entropy growth in the critical regime. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical predictions, highlighting a simple yet powerful framework to explore measurement-induced transitions in classical chaotic systems.

Title: Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays
Authors: Ye-bing Zhang, Xin-Chi Zhou, Bao-Zong Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model in understanding various strongly correlated phases like cuprate high-Tc superconductivity. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.

Title: Observation of superconductivity in a nontrivial $\mathcal{Z}_2$ approximant quasicrystal
Authors: Pavan Kumar Meena, Rahul Verma, Arushi, Sonika Jangid, Roshan Kumar Kushwaha, Rhea Stewart, Adrian D. Hillier, Bahadur Singh, Ravi Prakash Singh
Abstract: Superconductivity and nontrivial topology are highly sought-after phenomena in quantum materials. While many topological crystalline materials have been found to exhibit superconductivity, their presence in quasicrystals - materials with a unique aperiodic yet ordered structure - has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we report the discovery of superconductivity in a monoclinic approximant to the decagonal quasicrystal Al$_{13}$Os$_{4}$, that exhibits a high superconducting transition temperature and a nontrivial electronic structure. The resistivity, magnetization, specific heat, and $\mu$SR measurements confirm superconductivity with a critical temperature of $\sim5.47$ K. Detailed electronic structure and symmetry analysis reveal nontrivial state with $\mathcal{Z}_{2}=1$ and spin-polarized conducting surface states. Importantly, we identify three-dimensional saddle point van Hove singularities with substantial flat energy dispersion at the Fermi level, which can enhance superconductivity. Our results highlight a rich interplay between superconductivity and nontrivial electronic states in Al$_{13}$Os$_{4}$, demonstrating it as a unique platform for exploring unconventional superconducting states in quasicrystalline materials.

Title: Characterization of Chromium Impurities in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$
Authors: Mark E. Turiansky, Sai Mu, Lukas Razinkovas, Kamyar Parto, Sahil D. Patel, Sean Doan, Ganesh Pokharel, Steven J. Gomez Alvarado, Stephen D. Wilson, Galan Moody, Chris G. Van de Walle
Abstract: Chromium is a common transition-metal impurity that is easily incorporated during crystal growth. It is perhaps best known for giving rise to the 694.3 nm (1.786 eV) emission in Cr-doped Al$_2$O$_3$, exploited in ruby lasers. Chromium has also been found in monoclinic gallium oxide, a wide-bandgap semiconductor being pursued for power electronics. In this work, we thoroughly characterize the behavior of Cr in Ga$_2$O$_3$ through theoretical and experimental techniques. $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ samples are grown with the floating zone method and show evidence of a sharp photoluminescence signal, reminiscent of ruby. We calculate the energetics of formation of Cr from first principles, demonstrating that Cr preferentially incorporates as a neutral impurity on the octahedral site. Cr possesses a quartet ground-state spin and has an internal transition with a zero-phonon line near 1.8 eV. By comparing the calculated and experimentally measured luminescence lineshape function, we elucidate the role of coupling to phonons and uncover features beyond the Franck-Condon approximation. The combination of strong emission with a small Huang-Rhys factor of 0.05 and a technologically relevant host material render Cr in Ga$_2$O$_3$ attractive as a quantum defect.

Title: Large Language Model-Driven Database for Thermoelectric Materials
Authors: Suman Itani, Yibo Zhang, Jiadong Zang
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials provide a sustainable way to convert waste heat into electricity. However, data-driven discovery and optimization of these materials are challenging because of a lack of a reliable database. Here we developed a comprehensive database of 7,123 thermoelectric compounds, containing key information such as chemical composition, structural detail, seebeck coefficient, electrical and thermal conductivity, power factor, and figure of merit (ZT). We used the GPTArticleExtractor workflow, powered by large language models (LLM), to extract and curate data automatically from the scientific literature published in Elsevier journals. This process enabled the creation of a structured database that addresses the challenges of manual data collection. The open access database could stimulate data-driven research and advance thermoelectric material analysis and discovery.

Title: Intrinsic (Axion) Statistical Topological Insulator
Authors: Xi Chen, Fa-Jie Wang, Zhen Bi, Zhi-Da Song
Abstract: Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries, leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states (ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of intrinsic STI - which has no band insulator correspondence - characterized by the half-quantized magneto-electric polarization $P_3\!=\!\theta/(2\pi)$. A $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\theta$ angle, hence seems to protect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of $\theta\!=\!0,\pi$. However, we prove that, if $(C_{4}T)^4 \!=\! 1$, the topological state with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ cannot be realized in band insulators where $C_{4}T$ is exact. Surprisingly, using a real space construction (topological crystal), we find that an STI with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ can arise in Anderson insulators with disorders respecting $C_{4}T$ on average. To illustrate this state, we construct a lattice model and examine its phase diagram using the transfer matrix method up to the largest numerically accessible system size. An STI phase is identified through delocalized surface states and a half-quantized magneto-electric polarization in the bulk. As expected, an unavoidable gapless phase separates the STI from both clean insulators and trivial Anderson insulators, revealing the intrinsic nature of the STI. Moreover, we argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron interactions, i.e., interactions cannot open an adiabatic path connecting the STI to a gapped clean system. Thus, our work provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and its lattice realization. We also generalize the discussion to other crystalline symmetries.

Title: Efficient training of machine learning potentials for metallic glasses: CuZrAl validation
Authors: Antoni Wadowski, Anshul D.S. Parmar, Jesper Jesper Byggmästar, Jan S. Wróbel, Mikko J. Alava, Silvia Bonfanti
Abstract: Interatomic potentials play a vital role in revealing microscopic details and structure-property relations, which are fundamental for multiscale simulations and to assist high-throughput experiments. For metallic glasses, developing these potentials is challenging due to the complexity of their unique disordered structure. As a result, chemistry-specific interaction potentials for this important class of materials are often missing. Here, we solve this gap by implementing an efficient methodology for designing machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for metallic glasses, and we benchmark it with the widely studied CuZrAl system. By combining a Lennard-Jones surrogate model with swap-Monte Carlo sampling and Density Functional Theory (DFT) corrections, we capture diverse amorphous structures from 14 decades of supercooling. These distinct structures provide robust and efficient training of the model and applicability to the wider spectrum of energies. This approach reduces the need for extensive DFT and ab initio optimization datasets, while maintaining high accuracy. Our MLIP shows results comparable to the classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) available for CuZrAl, in predicting structural, energetic, and mechanical properties. This work paves the way for the development of new MLIPs for complex metallic glasses, including emerging multicomponent and high entropy metallic glasses.

Title: Coexistence of Commensurate and Incommensurate Antiferromagnetic Groundstates in Co$_x$NbSe$_2$ Single Crystal
Authors: H. Cein Mandujano, Peter Y. Zavalij, Alicia Manjón-Sanz, Huibo Cao, Efrain E. Rodriguez
Abstract: In Co$_x$NbSe$_2$, crystal symmetry, and cobalt site occupation drive the formation of two distinct magnetic phases. At $x = 1/4$, the centrosymmetric structure ($P$6$_3$/$mmc$) promotes Co-Co interactions leading to the formation of an $A$-type antiferromagnetic structure phase with a transition temperature of $T_N^A$ = 169 K. At $x = 1/3$, the non-centrosymmetric structure ($P$6$_3$22) induces a lower-temperature magnetic phase with $T_N^S$ = 28 K. We report the coexistence of both substructures within a superlattice, with a nuclear propagation vector of (1/3, 1/3, 0) relative to the host lattice. Single crystals of Co$_{0.28}$NbSe$_2$ exhibit both magnetic transitions, with $T_N^A$ corresponding to the $x \sim 1/4$ phase and $T_N^S$ corresponding to the $x \sim 1/3$ phase. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements confirm these transitions, although only the high-temperature $T_N^A$ phase significantly affects resistivity. We successfully isolate each phase in powder samples, while single crystals with an intercalation ratio of $x = 0.28$ display the coexistence of both phases in a single sample. Using single-crystal neutron diffraction, we solved the magnetic structure of the high-temperature centrosymmetric phase ($T_N^A$), and neutron powder diffraction revealed the double-$q$ magnetic structure of the low-temperature noncentrosymmetric phase ($T_N^S$)

Title: Constriction and contact impedance of ceramic solid electrolytes
Authors: Md Salman Rabbi Limon, Curtis Duffee, Zeeshan Ahmad
Abstract: The development of solid-state batteries is hindered by the degradation of the solid-solid interface during cycling which can cause void formation and contact loss. Here, we systematically investigate the effect of unrecoverable and real interfacial contact area at the electrode/Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl interface on the impedance spectrum. By varying applied stack pressures and controlling contact geometries, we identify their distinct signatures in the impedance spectrum and quantify their influence on the interfacial resistance and effective ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte. Experimental results demonstrate that higher pressures and improved contact areas significantly reduce interfacial resistance. The interfacial resistance scales with pressure according to power law with exponent of -0.5, providing insights into the variation of real contact area. Further, distributed contacts lead to lower impedance compared to concentrated contacts due to smaller potential gradients and a more uniform potential distribution. Our simulations predict interfacial resistances of the contact geometries in agreement with experiments. Our work emphasizes the distinct roles of unrecoverable and recoverable contact losses in controlling the impedance of solid-state batteries.

Title: A Novel Velocity Discretization for Lattice Boltzmann Method: Application to Compressible Flow
Authors: Navid Afrasiabian, Colin Denniston
Abstract: The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has emerged as a powerful tool in computational fluid dynamics and material science. However, standard LBM formulation imposes some limitations on the applications of the method, particularly compressible fluids. In this paper, we introduce a new velocity discretization method to overcome some of these challenges. In this new formulation, the particle populations are discretized using a bump function that has a mean and a variance. This introduces enough independent degrees of freedom to set the equilibrium moments to the moments of Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution up to and including the third moments. Consequently, the correct macroscopic fluid dynamics equations for compressible fluids are recovered. We validate our method using several benchmark simulations.

Title: Inhomogeneous evolution of a dense ensemble of optically pumped excitons to the excitonic insulator state
Authors: Natasha Kirova, Serguei Brazovskii
Abstract: Phase transformations induced by short optical pulses is a mainstream in studies of of dynamics of cooperative electronic states. We present a semi-phenomenological modeling of spacio-temporal effects expected when optical excitons are intricate with the order parameter as it happens e.g. in organic compounds with neutral-ionic ferroelectric phase transitions. A conceptual complication appears here, where both the excitation and the ground syate ordering are built from the intermolecular electronic transfer. To describe both thermodynamic and dynamic effects on the same root, we adopt for the phase transition a view of the Excitonic Insulator - a hypothetical phase of a semiconductor which appears if the exciton energy becomes negative. After the initial pumping pulse, a quasi-condensate of excitons can appear as a macroscopic quantum state which then evolves interacting with other degrees of freedom prone to an instability. The self-trapping of excitons enhances their density which can locally surpass a critical value to trigger the phase transformation. The system is stratified in domains which evolve through dynamical phase transitions and may persist even after the initiating excitons have recombined.

Title: Gating and tunable confinement of active colloids within patterned environments
Authors: Carolina van Baalen, Stefania Ketzetzi, Anushka Tintor, Lucio Isa
Abstract: Active colloidal particles typically exhibit a pronounced affinity for accumulating and being captured at boundaries. Here, we engineer long-range repulsive interactions between colloids that self-propel under an electric field and patterned obstacles. As a result of these interactions, particles turn away from obstacles and avoid accumulation. We show that by tuning the applied field frequency, we precisely and rapidly control the effective size of the obstacles and therefore modulate the particle approach distance. This feature allows us to achieve gating and tunable confinement of our active particles whereby they can access regions between obstacles depending on the applied field. Our work provides a versatile means to directly control confinement and organization, paving the way towards applications such as sorting particles based on motility or localizing active particles on demand.

Title: Measuring the effective stress parameter using the multiphase lattice Boltzmann method and investigating the source of its hysteresis
Authors: Reihaneh Hosseini, Krishna Kumar
Abstract: The effective stress parameter, $\chi$, is essential for calculating the effective stress in unsaturated soils. Experimental measurements have captured different relationships between $\chi$ and the degree of saturation, $S_r$; however, they have not been able to justify the particular shapes of the $\chi$-$S_r$ curves. Theoretical solutions express $\chi$ as a function of $S_r$ and the air-water interfacial area, $a_{wn}$; however, $a_{wn}$ is difficult to predict, limiting further investigation of $\chi$ variation. We seek an alternative approach for studying $\chi$ by simulating the pore-scale distribution of the two fluid phases in unsaturated soils using the multiphase lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We develop an algorithm for measuring $\chi$ based on the suction and surface tension forces applied to each grain. Using this algorithm, we simulate the $\chi$-$S_r$ curve over a full hydraulic cycle for a synthetic 3D granular soil column with immobile grains. We find that $\chi=1$ at $S_r=1$ and $\chi=0$ at $S_r=0$, while $\chi>S_r$ for all other saturations. The maximum divergence of $\chi$ from $S_r$ happens at the transition from/to the pendular regime. We also observe that the $\chi$-$S_r$ curve is hysteretic; $\chi$ is larger during wetting (imbibition) compared to drying (drainage) due to larger contribution of surface tension forces.

Title: Self-reconfiguring colloidal active matter
Authors: Stefania Ketzetzi, Lorenzo Caprini, Vivien Willems, Laura Alvarez, Hartmut Löwen, Lucio Isa
Abstract: Cells and microorganisms employ dynamic shape changes to enable steering and avoidance for efficient spatial exploration and collective organization. In contrast, active colloids, their synthetic counterparts, currently lack similar abilities and strategies. Through physical interactions alone, here we create active colloidal molecules that spontaneously reconfigure their structure, unlike traditional active particles. We find that self-reconfiguration decouples reorientational dynamics from rotational diffusivity and bestows our active molecules additional reorientation capabilities. During encounters with neighbors, rapid conformational changes lead to self-steering and avoidance. At higher area fractions, reconfiguration-induced avoidance fully inhibits characteristic dynamic clustering, motility-induced phase separation and flocking; instead, the system retains a homogeneous structure comprising well-separated active units. Self-reconfiguring systems therefore present an exciting path towards autonomous motion beyond that of classical synthetic active matter.

Title: Exploiting Parallelism for Fast Feynman Diagrammatics
Authors: John Sturt, Evgeny Kozik
Abstract: Diagrammatic expansions are a paradigmatic and powerful tool of quantum many-body theory. Their evaluation to high order, e.g., by the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique, can provide unbiased results in strongly correlated and challenging regimes. However, calculating a factorial number of terms to acceptable precision remains very costly even for state-of-the-art methods. We achieve a dramatic acceleration of evaluating Feynman's diagrammatic series by use of specialised hardware architecture within the recently introduced combinatorial summation (CoS) framework. We present how exploiting the massive parallelism and concurrency available from GPUs leads to orders of magnitude improvement in computation time even on consumer-grade hardware. This provides a platform for making probes of novel phenomena of strong correlations much more accessible.

Title: Theory of Transient Heat Conduction
Authors: David E. Crawford, Yi Zeng, Judith Vidal, Jianjun Dong
Abstract: Ultrafast and nanoscale heat conduction demands a unified theoretical framework that rigorously bridges macroscopic transport equations with microscopic material properties derived from statistical this http URL empirical generalizations of Fourier's law often lack a solid microscopic foundation, failing to connect observed non-Fourier behavior with underlying atomic scale mechanisms. In this work, we present a time-domain theory of transient heat conduction rooted in Zwanzig's statistical theory of irreversible processes. Central to this framework is the time-domain transport function, Z(t), defined through equilibrium time-correlation functions of heat fluxes. This function generalizes the conventional concept of steady-state thermal conductivity, governing the transition of conduction dynamics from onset second sound type wave propagation at finite speeds to diffusion-dominated behavior across broad temporal and spatial scales. Unlike phonon hydrodynamic models that rely on mesoscopic constructs such as phonon drift velocity, our approach provides a quantitative and microscopic description of intrinsic memory effects in transient heat fluxes and applies universally to bulk materials at any temperature or length scale. By integrating atomistic-scale first-principles calculations with continuum-level macroscopic equations, this framework offers a robust foundation for numerical simulations of transient temperature fields. Furthermore, it facilitates the interpretation and design of transient thermal grating experiments using nanometer-scale heat sources and ultrafast laser systems in the extreme ultraviolet and x-ray wavelength ranges, advancing our understanding of heat dissipation dynamics.

Title: BiFeO$_3$ nanoparticles at low-temperature using atomistic simulations -- surface charge distribution and terminations
Authors: Mauro A. P. Goncalves, Monica Graf, Marek Pasciak, Jiri Hlinka
Abstract: This paper analyzes how the ferroelectric properties of cubic-like BiFeO$_3$ nanoparticles are affected by different terminations and charge distributions at the surface using ab-initio-based atomistic computational experiments. Our findings unveil multiple multidomain configurations and illustrate how the different order parameters evolve towards the surface. Interestingly, for neutral terminations, a non-rhombohedral phase of BiFeO$_3$ with a stripe-like polarization arrangement was stabilized. We evaluate the polarization, oxygen octahedra rotation, and volume variation for all the configurations obtained, taking advantage of the atomic-scale details provided by the methods used in this study.

Title: Unconventional Coherence Peak in Cuprate Superconductors
Authors: Zheng Li, Chao Mu, Pengfei Li, Wei Wu, Jiangping Hu, Tao Xiang, Kun Jiang, Jianlin Luo
Abstract: The Hebel-Slichter coherence peak, observed in the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ just below the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, serves as a crucial experimental validation of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing symmetry in conventional superconductors. However, no coherence peak in $1/T_1$ has been observed in unconventional superconductors like cuprates. In this study, an unconventional coherence peak is identified for the first time using nuclear quadrupole resonance on YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$, pointing to a distinctive pairing symmetry. The spin-lattice relaxation rate in nuclear quadrupole resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance with nuclear spin $I>1/2$ comprises the magnetic relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$, which probes magnetic fluctuations, and the quadrupole relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\rm quad}$, which probes charge fluctuations. By utilizing $^{63}$Cu and $^{65}$Cu isotopes, we successfully distinguish $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$ and $1/T_{1 }^{\rm quad}$ of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ and reveal the presence of the coherence peak in $1/T_{1 }^{\rm quad}$ but not in $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$, in contrast to conventional superconductors. Our finding demonstrates that unconventional superconductors do not exhibit a coherence peak in $1/T_{1}$ when the relaxation is due to fluctuations of the hyperfine field. Conversely, a coherence peak is expected when the relaxation is caused by electric field gradient fluctuations, due to the different coherence factors between charge and magnetic fluctuations. Our successful measurements of $1/T_{1}$ for the chains of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ suggest that, should the conditions for predominant quadrupole relaxation be satisfied, this phenomenon could provide a novel approach to exploring the unconventional nature of the pairing mechanism in other superconductors.

Title: Essentially degenerate hidden nodal lines in two-dimensional magnetic layer groups
Authors: Xiao-Ping Li, Chaoxi Cui, Lei Wang, Weikang Wu, Zeying Zhang, Zhi-Ming Yu, Yugui Yao
Abstract: According to the theory of group representations, the types of band degeneracy can be divided into accidental degeneracy and essential degeneracy. The essentially degenerate nodal lines (NLs) are typically resided on the high-symmetry lines of the Brillouin zone. Here, we propose a type of NL in two dimension that is essentially degenerate but is hidden within the high-symmetry planes, making it less observable, dubbed a hidden-essential nodal line (HENL). The existence of HENL is guaranteed as long as the system hosts a horizontal glide-mirror symmetry, hence such NLs can be widely found in both non-magnetic and magnetic systems. We perform an exhaustive search over all 528 magnetic layer groups (MLGs) for HENL that can be enforced by glide-mirror symmetry with both spinless and spinfull systems. We find that 122 candidate MLGs host spinless HENL, while 63 candidate MLGs demonstrate spinful HENL. In addition, we reveal that horizontal mirror and time-reversal symmetry in type-II and type-IV MLGs with spin-orbital coupling can enforce HENL formed. The 15 corresponding candidate MLGs have also been presented. Furthemore, we derive a few typical lattice models to characterize the existence for the HENL. For specific electronic fillings in real materials, namely 4$N$+2 in spinless systems (and 2$N$+1 in spinful systems), the presence of the HENLs in candidate MLGs is required regardless of the details of the systems. Using \emph{ab-initio} calculations, we further identify possible material candidates that realize spinless and spinful HENL. Moreover, spinful HENLs exhibit a novel persistent spin texture wih the characteristic of momentum-independent spin configuration. Our findings uncover a new type of topological semimetal state and offer an ideal platform to study the related physics of HENLs.

Title: Spin Hall effect in 3d ferromagnetic metals for field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization: A first-principles investigation
Authors: Fanxing Zheng, Jianting Dong, Yizhuo Song, Meng Zhu, Xinlu Li, Jia Zhang
Abstract: Ferromagnetic metals, with the potential to generate spin current with unconventional spin polarization via the spin Hall effect, offer promising opportunities for field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization and for the spin-orbit torque devices. In this study, we investigate two distinct spin Hall mechanisms in 3d ferromagnetic metals including spin-orbit coupling driven spin Hall effect in Fe, Co, Ni and their alloys, and non-relativistic spin Hall effect arising from anisotropic spin-polarized transport by taking L10-MnAl as an example. By employing first-principles calculations, we examine the temperature and alloy composition dependence of spin Hall conductivity in Fe, Co, Ni and their alloys. Our results reveal that the spin Hall conductivities with out-of-plane spin polarization in 3d ferromagnetic metals are at the order of 1000 \frac{\hbar}{2e} \left( \Omega \, \text{cm} \right)^{-1} at 300 K, but with a relatively low spin Hall angles around 0.01~0.02 due to the large longitudinal conductivity. For L10-MnAl(101), the non-relativistic spin Hall conductivity can reach up to 10000\frac{\hbar}{2e} \left( \Omega \, \text{cm} \right)^{-1}, with a giant spin Hall angle around 0.25 at room temperature. By analyzing the magnetization switching process, we demonstrate deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization without an external magnetic field by using 3d ferromagnetic metals as spin current sources. Our work may provide an unambiguous understanding on spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals and pave the way for their potential applications in related spintronic devices.

Title: Braiding rule of boundary Majorana-like zero mode
Authors: Qiyun Ma, Hailong He, Meng Xiao, Zhengyou Liu
Abstract: The study of topological states has become an important topic in both solid-state systems and artificial structures such as photonic crystals and phononic crystals. Among them, Majorana zero modes, which exhibit nontrivial braiding process, have attracted extensive research interest. The analog of Majorana zero modes in classical waves, or the Majorana-like zero modes (MLZMs), have also got a lot of attention recently. However, the vast majority of previous works concerned with MLZMs that were bounded to vortexes inside the bulk. Here in this work, we unveil the braiding rule of MLZMs that are tunable around the boundary of a vortex-texture Kekule modulated graphene. We show that the existence of these zero-dimensional boundary MLZMs is protected by the Zak phase of 1D boundary states. As such, we are able to construct multiple MLZMs and analyze the corresponding braiding process. In addition, we also provide an implementation scheme of the boundary MLZMs in acoustic crystals. The tunability of the boundary MLZMs proposed herein offer new freedom for topological states braiding in both solid-state systems and artificial structures.

Title: Genuine and Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling Effect in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions
Authors: Zhi Yan, Xujin Zhang, Jianhua Xiao, Cheng Fang, Xiaohong Xu
Abstract: Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) are promising candidates for data storage devices due to their tunable thickness and capability to exhibit multiple nonvolatile resistance states. However, existing vdW-MFTJs utilize ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism independently, failing to achieve true magnetoelectric coupling, which leads to unnecessary energy dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative vdW-MFTJ design based on a CrBr$_3$/MnPSe$_3$/CrBr$_3$ vertical heterostructure, enabling genuine magnetoelectric coupling without relying on atomic migration induced by inversion symmetry breaking for ferroelectric polarization reversal. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, the highest value reported to date. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.

Title: Longitudinal Spin Hall Magnetoresistance from Spin Fluctuations
Authors: Ping Tang
Abstract: Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), the variation in resistance in a heavy metal (HM) with the magnetization orientation of an adjacent ferromagnet (FM), has been extensively studied as a powerful tool for probing surface magnetic moments in a variety of magnetic materials. However, the conventional SMR theory assumes rigid magnetization of a fixed magnitude, an assumption that breaks down close to the FM's Curie temperature \(T_c\), where the magnetic susceptibility diverges. Here, we report an unconventional SMR effect arising from the magnetic-field modulation of spin fluctuations in the FM, while its magnetization remaining collinear to the spin Hall accumulation in the HM. In contrast to the conventional SMR, which scales with the magnetization and vanishes near $T_{c}$, such ``longitudinal" SMR (LSMR), though suppressed at low temperatures, becomes critically enhanced at \(T_c\), reaching a magnitude comparable to conventional SMR amplitudes. Our findings suggest a promising method for electrically detecting enhanced spin fluctuations in magnetic systems.

Title: Chiral induced Spin Polarized Electron Current: Origin of the Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity Effect
Authors: J. Fransson
Abstract: The discovery of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect has provided a novel tool to study how active physical and chemical mechanism may differ in chiral enantiomers, however, the origin of the effect itself is yet an open question. In this article, it is theoretically shown that two aspects have to be fulfilled for the chiral induced spin selectivity effect to arise. First, chirality is a necessary condition for breaking spin-degeneracy in molecular structures that do not comprise heavy elements. Second, dissipation is indispensable for the molecule to develop a non-vanishing spin-polarization. These theoretical conclusions are illustrated in terms of a few examples, showing the necessity of the two aspects to be coordinated for the emergence of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect.

Title: Morphogenesis of cheese flowers through scraping
Authors: J. Zhang, A. Ibarra, B. Roman, M. Ciccotti
Abstract: The "Tete de moine" Swiss cheese is generally served by scraping the surface of a cylindrical loaf with a sharp tool. This produces thin sheets of cheese that are strongly wrinkled at the edge, resembling frilly flowers and enhancing the tasting experience. In this work we unveil the physical mechanisms at play in this scraping-induced morphogenesis. We measure the deformation of the cheese during scraping and show that plastic deformation occurs everywhere, but find a larger plastic contraction in the inner part of the flower, causing its buckling into shape. We show that it surprisingly derives from the lower friction coefficient evidenced on the cheese close to its crust. Our analysis provides the tools for a better control of chip morphogenesis through plasticity in the shaping of other delicacies, but also in metal cutting.

Title: Sputtering Current Driven Growth & Transport Characteristics of Superconducting Ti40V60 Alloy Thin Films
Authors: Shekhar Chandra Pandey, Shilpam Sharma, K. K. Pandey, Pooja Gupta, Sanjay Rai, Rashmi Singh, M. K. Chattopadhyay
Abstract: The room temperature growth, characterization, and electrical transport properties of magnetron sputtered superconducting Ti40V60 alloy thin films are presented. The films exhibit low surface roughness and tunable transport properties. As the sputtering current increases, the superconducting transition move towards higher temperatures. Rietveld refinement of two dimensional XRD (2D XRD) pattern reveals the presence of stress in the films, which shifts from tensile to compressive as the sputtering current increases. Additionally, the crystallite size of the films increases with higher sputtering currents. The films exhibit a strong preferential orientation, contributing to their texturing. The crystallite size and texturing are found to be correlated with the superconducting transition temperature (TC) of the films. As the crystallite size and texturing increase, the TC of the films also rises.

Title: Role of Chalcogen atoms in In Situ Exfoliation for Large-Area 2D Semiconducting Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Zhiying Dan, Ronak Sarmasti Emami, Giovanna Feraco, Melina Vavali, Dominic Gerlach, Petra Rudolf, Antonija Grubišić-Čabo
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as a promising platform for next-generation optoelectronic and spintronic devices. Mechanical exfoliation using adhesive tape remains the dominant method for preparing 2D materials of highest quality, including transition metal dichalcogenides, but always results in small-sized flakes. This limitation poses a significant challenge for investigations and applications where large scale flakes are needed. To overcome these constraints, we explored the preparation of 2D WS2 and WSe2 using a recently developed kinetic in situ single-layer synthesis method (KISS). In particular, we focused on the influence of different substrates, Au and Ag, and chalcogen atoms, S and Se, on the yield and quality of the 2D films. The crystallinity and spatial morphology of the 2D films were characterized using optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy, providing a comprehensive assessment of exfoliation quality. Low-energy electron diffraction verified that there is no preferential orientation between the 2D film and the substrate, while optical microscopy revealed that WSe2 consistently outperformed WS2 in producing large monolayers, regardless of the substrate used. Finally, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that no covalent bonds are formed between the 2D material and the underlying substrate. These results identify KISS method as a non-destructive approach for a more scalable approach of high-quality 2D transition metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Current-induced re-entrant superconductivity and extreme nonreciprocal superconducting diode effect in valley-polarized systems
Authors: Yu-Chen Zhuang, Qing-Feng Sun
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to the nonreciprocity of superconducting critical currents for the metal-superconductor transition. Generally, the SDE has a positive and a negative critical current $j_{c\pm}$ corresponding to two opposite directions whose amplitudes are unequal. It is demonstrated that an extreme nonreciprocity where two critical currents can become both positive (or negative) has been observed in a recent experiment. In this work, we theoretically propose a possible mechanism to realize an extreme nonreciprocal SDE. Based on a microscopic theory and a simple valley-polarized model, we demonstrate that depairing currents required to dissolve Cooper pairs can be remodulated under the interplay between the valley polarization and the applied current. Near the disappearance of the superconductivity, the remodulation is shown to induce the extreme nonreciprocity and also the current-induced re-entrant superconductivity where the system has two different critical current intervals. Our study may provide new horizons for understanding the coexistence of superconductivity and spontaneous ferromagnetism and pave a new way to designing the SDE with 100% efficiency.

Title: Extended Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss
Authors: Chao Yang, Yucheng Wang
Abstract: The Landauer-Büttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.

Title: Robustness of quantum many-body scars in the presence of Markovian bath
Authors: Xiang-Ping Jiang, Mingdi Xu, Xuanpu Yang, Yucheng Wang, Lei Pan
Abstract: A generic closed quantum many-body system will inevitably tend to thermalization, whose local information encoded in the initial state eventually scrambles into the full space, known as quantum ergodicity. A paradigmatic exception in closed quantum systems for strong ergodicity breaking is known as many-body localization, where strong disorder-induced localization prevents the occurrence of thermalization. It is generally recognized that a localized quantum system would be delocalized under dissipation induced by the environment. However, this consequence recently has received challenges where an exotic dissipation-induced localization mechanism is proposed, and transitions between localized and extended phases are found. In this Letter, we promote this mechanism to systems for weak ergodicity breaking hosting quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We find that the system relaxes to a steady state dominated by QMBS, and the dissipative dynamics exhibit dynamic revivals by suitably preparing an initial state. We point out an experimental realization of the controlled dissipation with a cold atomic setup. This makes the signature of ergodicity breaking visible over dissipative dynamics and offers potential possibilities for experimentally preparing stable QMBS with associated coherent dynamics.

Title: Is a phonon excitation of a superfluid Bose gas a Goldstone boson?
Authors: Maksim Tomchenko
Abstract: It is generally accepted that phonons in a superfluid Bose gas are Goldstone bosons. This is justified by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), which is usually defined as follows: the Hamiltonian of the system is invariant under the $U(1)$ transformation $\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)\rightarrow e^{i\alpha}% \hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)$, whereas the order parameter $\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$ is not. However, the strict definition of SSB is different: the Hamiltonian and the boundary conditions are invariant under a symmetry transformation, while the \emph{ground state} is not. Based on the latter criterion, we study a finite system of spinless, weakly interacting bosons using three approaches: the standard Bogoliubov method, the particle-number-conserving Bogoliubov method, and the approach based on the exact ground-state wave function. Our results show that the answer to the question in the title is \textquotedblleft no\textquotedblright. Thus, phonons in a real-world (finite) superfluid Bose gas are similar to sound in a classical gas: they are not Goldstone bosons, but quantised collective vibrational modes arising from the interaction between atoms. In the case of an infinite Bose gas, however, the picture becomes paradoxical: the ground state can be regarded as either infinitely degenerate or non-degenerate, making the phonon both similar to a Goldstone boson and different from it.

Title: Understanding Memristive Behavior: An Atomistic Study of the Influence of Grain Boundaries on Surface and Out-of-Plane Diffusion of Metallic Atoms
Authors: Mohit D. Ganeriwala, Daniel Luque-Jarava, Francisco Pasadas, Juan J. Palacios, Francisco G. Ruiz, Andres Godoy, Enrique G. Marin
Abstract: Atomic migration from metallic contacts, and subsequent filament formation, is recognised as a prevailing mechanism leading to resistive switching in memristors based on two-dimensional materials (2DMs). This study presents a detailed atomistic examination of the migration of different metal atoms across the grain boundaries (GBs) of 2DMs, employing Density Functional Theory in conjunction with Non-Equilibrium Green's Function transport simulations. Various types of metallic atoms, Au, Cu, Al, Ni, and Ag, are examined, focusing on their migration both in the out-of-plane direction through a MoS\textsubscript{2} layer and along the surface of the MoS\textsubscript{2} layer, pertinent to filament formation in vertical and lateral memristors, respectively. Different types of GBs usually present in MoS\textsubscript{2} are considered to assess their influence on the diffusion of metal atoms. The findings are compared with structures based on pristine MoS\textsubscript{2} and those with mono-sulfur vacancies, aiming to understand the key elements that affect the switching performance of memristors. Furthermore, transport simulations are carried out to evaluate the effects of GBs on both out-of-plane and in-plane electron conductance, providing valuable insights into the resistive switching ratio.

Title: Achievable Information-Energy Exchange in a Brownian Information Engine through Potential Profiling
Authors: Rafna Rafeek, Debasish Mondal
Abstract: The information engine extracts work from a single heat bath using mutual information obtained during the operation cycle. This study investigates the influence of the potential shaping in a Brownian information engine (BIE) in harnessing the information from thermal fluctuations. We have designed a BIE by considering an overdamped Brownian particle inside a confined potential and introducing an appropriate symmetric feedback cycle. We find that the upper bound of the extractable work for a BIE with a monostable centrosymmetric confining potential, with a stable state at the potential centre, depends on the bath temperature and the convexity of the confinement. A concave confinement is more efficient for an information-energy exchange. For a bistable confinement with an unstable centre and two symmetric stable basins, one can find an engine-to-refrigeration transition beyond a certain barrier height related to the energy difference between the energy barrier and the stable basins. Finally, we use the concavity-induced gain in information harnessing to device a BIE in the presence of a multistable potential that can harvest even more energy than monostable confinement.

Title: Anisotropic Raman scattering and lattice orientation identification of 2M-WS2
Authors: Sabin Gautam, Sougata Mardanya, Joseph McBride, A K M Manjur Hossain, Qian Yang, Wenyong Wang, John Ackerman, Brian M. Leonard, Sugata Chowdhury, Jifa Tian
Abstract: Anisotropic materials with low symmetries hold significant promise for next-generation electronic and quantum devices. 2M-WS2, a candidate for topological superconductivity, has garnered considerable interest. However, a comprehensive understanding of how its anisotropic features contribute to unconventional superconductivity, along with a simple, reliable method to identify its crystal orientation, remains elusive. Here, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches to investigate angle- and polarization-dependent anisotropic Raman modes of 2M-WS2. Through first-principles calculations, we predict and analyze phonon dispersion and lattice vibrations of all Raman modes in 2M-WS2. We establish a direct correlation between their anisotropic Raman spectra and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. Finally, we demonstrate that anisotropic Raman spectroscopy can accurately determine the crystal orientation and twist angle between two stacked 2M-WS2 layers. Our findings provide insights into the electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic properties of 2M-WS2, paving the way for the use of anisotropic materials in advanced electronic and quantum devices.

Title: Active and transfer learning with partially Bayesian neural networks for materials and chemicals
Authors: Sarah I. Allec, Maxim Ziatdinov
Abstract: Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most informative data points for exploration, is crucial for efficient characterization of materials and chemicals property space. Neural networks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertainty quantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. Fully Bayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probability distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost. Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), where only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remain deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active learning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower computational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions with weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions to accelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate these approaches on both molecular property prediction and materials science tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning with limited, complex datasets.

Title: New Insights into the Dependence of Glass Transition Temperature and Dynamic Fragility on Molecular Weight in Oligomers and Polymers
Authors: Valeriy V. Ginzburg, Oleg V. Gendelman, Riccardo Casalini, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: In an earlier preprint (V. V. Ginzburg, O. V. Gendelman, R. Casalini, and A. Zaccone, arXiv:2409.17291), we demonstrated that the dynamic (relaxation time) and volume equations of state for many amorphous polymers are near-universal -- each material is characterized by two governing parameters -- the glass transition temperature, T_{g}, and the elementary relaxation time, /tau_{el}. The dynamic fragility, m, is uniquely related to /tau_{el}. The earlier analysis was based on the data for high polymers (degree of polymerization, N > 200, and molecular weight, Mw > 20,000 g/mol). Here, we investigate the dependence of T_{g} and /tau_{el} on N (or, equivalently, on the molecular weight, M). We consider the dielectric spectroscopy data for homologous series of four polymers: polystyrene (PS), poly-(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP), poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), and polybutadiene (PB). It is shown that the relaxation time curves for various oligomers can be successfully collapsed onto the same master curve as the high polymers. The glass transition temperature and the dynamic fragility are found to be linear functions of 1/M, in agreement with the Fox-Flory equation. The scaling results are interpreted based on the SL-TS2 theory, ensuring that the model description is consistent with the Boyer rules for the coefficients of thermal expansion above and below T_{g}, as well as the thermodynamical scaling for the pressure dependence of the relaxation time.

Title: Optical signatures of Euler superconductors
Authors: Chun Wang Chau, Wojciech J. Jankowski, Robert-Jan Slager
Abstract: We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a non-trivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a non-trivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topologically quantized jump and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the non-interacting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order nonlinear optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced steady dc currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.

Title: Strain Mediated Voltage Control of Magnetic Anisotropy and Magnetization Reversal in Bismuth Substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet Films and Meso-structures
Authors: Walid Al Misba, Miela Josephine Gross, Kensuke Hayashi, Daniel B. Gopman, Caroline A. Ross, Jayasimha Atulasimha
Abstract: We report on magnetic anisotropy modulation in Bismuth substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet (Bi-YIG) thin films and mesoscale patterned structures deposited on a PMN-PT substrate with the application of voltage-induced strain. The Bi content is selected for low coercivity and higher magnetostriction than that of YIG, yielding significant changes in the hysteresis loops through the magnetoelastic effect. The piezoelectric substrate is poled along its thickness, which is the [011] direction, by applying a voltage across the PMN-PT/SiO2/Bi-YIG/Pt heterostructure. In-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy (MOKE) shows the modulation of magnetic anisotropy with voltage-induced strain. Furthermore, voltage control of the magnetic domain state of the Bi-YIG film at a fixed magnetic field produces a 90° switching of the magnetization easy axis above a threshold voltage. The magnetoelectric coefficient of the heterostructure is 1.05x10^(-7)s/m which is competitive with that of other ferromagnetic oxide films on ferroelectric substrates such as La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/PMNPT and YIG/PMN-PZT. Voltage-control of magnetization reversal fields in 5-30 microns wide dots and racetracks of Bi-YIG show potential for energy efficient non-volatile memory and neuromorphic computing devices.

Title: Critical Dynamics and Cyclic Memory Retrieval in Non-reciprocal Hopfield Networks
Authors: Shuyue Xue, Mohammad Maghrebi, George I. Mias, Carlo Piermarocchi
Abstract: We study Hopfield networks with non-reciprocal coupling inducing switches between memory patterns. Dynamical phase transitions occur between phases of no memory retrieval, retrieval of multiple point-attractors, and limit-cycle attractors. The limit cycle phase is bounded by two critical regions: a Hopf bifurcation line and a fold bifurcation line, each with unique dynamical critical exponents and sensitivity to perturbations. A Master Equation approach numerically verifies the critical behavior predicted analytically. We discuss how these networks could model biological processes near a critical threshold of cyclic instability evolving through multi-step transitions.

Title: Kagome Metal GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$: A 4d Playground for Topological Magnetism and Electron Correlations
Authors: Yusen Xiao, Qingchen Duan, Zhaoyi Li, Shu Guo, Hengxin Tan, Ruidan Zhong
Abstract: Magnetic kagome metals have garnered considerable attention as an ideal platform for investigating intrinsic topological structures, frustrated magnetism, and electron correlation effects. In this work, we present the synthesis and detailed characterization of GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$, a metal that features a niobium-based kagome lattice and a frustrated triangular gadolinium network. The compound adopts the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type crystal structure, with lattice parameters of a = b = 5.765(4) Å and c = 9.536(8) Å. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements reveal a magnetic transition near 2.3 K. Electrical transport data confirm metallic behavior, unsaturated positive magnetoresistance, and a hole-dominated multiband Hall effect. Furthermore, first-principles calculations indicate that Nb-4d orbitals predominantly contribute to the electronic states near the Fermi energy, with the band structure showing multiple topologically nontrivial crossings around the Fermi surface. This study also compares GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$ with GdV$_6$Sn$_6$, highlighting their similarities and differences. Our findings pave the way for exploring RNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = rare earth) with customized substitutions of R sites to fine-tune their properties.

Title: Spatial Correlation Unifies Nonequilibrium Response Theory for Arbitrary Markov Jump Processes
Authors: Jiming Zheng, Zhiyue Lu
Abstract: Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is a fundamental challenge in physics, particularly for non-equilibrium and non-stationary processes. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides a complete framework for near-equilibrium systems, and various bounds are recently reported for specific non-equilibrium regimes. Here, we present an exact response equality for arbitrary Markov processes that decompose system response into spatial correlations of local dynamical events. This decomposition reveals that response properties are encoded in correlations between transitions and dwelling times across the network, providing a natural generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to generic non-equilibrium processes. Our theory unifies existing response bounds, extends them to time-dependent processes, and reveals fundamental monotonicity properties of the tightness of multi-parameter response inequalities. Beyond its theoretical significance, this framework enables efficient numerical evaluation of response properties from unperturbed trajectory data, offering practical advantages for studying complex networks and biological systems far from equilibrium.

Title: Fluctuations of topological charges in two-dimensional classical Heisenberg model
Authors: Shan-Chang Tang, Yu Shi
Abstract: Binding and unbinding of vortices drives Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in two-dimensional XY model. Here we investigate whether similar mechanism works in two-dimensional Heisenberg model, by using the fluctuation of the topological charge inside a loop to characterize the nature of binding versus unbinding of defects. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the fluctuation is proportional to the perimeter of the loop at low temperatures while to the area of the loop at high temperatures, implying binding of the defects at low temperatures and unbinding at high temperatures.

Title: Is there Kibble-Zurek scaling of topological defects in first-order phase transitions?
Authors: Fan Zhong
Abstract: Kibble-Zurek scaling is the scaling of the density of the topological defects formed via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism with respect to the rate at which a system is cooled across a continuous phase transition. Recently, the density of the topological defects formed via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism was computed for a system cooled through a first-order phase transition instead of the usual continuous transitions. Here we address the problem of whether such defects generated across a first-order phase transition exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling similar to the case in continuous phase transitions. We show that any possible Kibble-Zurek scaling for the topological defects can only be a very rough approximation due to an intrinsic field for the scaling. However, complete universal scaling for other properties does exist.

Title: Machine Learning-Driven Insights into Excitonic Effects in 2D Materials
Authors: Ahsan Javed, Sajid Ali
Abstract: Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.

Title: Tensor network method for solving the Ising model with a magnetic field
Authors: Myung-Hoon Chung
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional square lattice Ising ferromagnet and antiferromagnet with a magnetic field by using tensor network method. Focusing on the role of guage fixing, we present the partition function in terms of a tensor network. The tensor has a different symmetry property for ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. The tensor network of the partition function is interpreted as a multiple product of the one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian. We perform infinite density matrix renormalization group to contract the two-dimensional tensor network. We present the numerical result of magnetization and entanglement entropy for the Ising ferromagnet and antiferromagnet side by side. In order to determine the critical line in the parameter space of temperature and magnetic field, we use the half-chain entanglement entropy of the one-dimensional quantum state. The entanglement entropy precisely indicates the critical line forming the parabolic shape for the antiferromagnetic case, but shows the critical point for the ferromagnetic case.

Title: On Computational Complexity of 3D Ising Spin Glass: Lessons from D-Wave Annealer
Authors: Hao Zhang, Alex Kamenev
Abstract: Finding an exact ground state of a 3D Ising spin glass is proven to be an NP-hard problem. There is a widespread belief that this statement implies an exponential scaling, $\sim 2^{N/\beta}$, of necessary computational efforts (classical or quantum), with the number of spins, $N$. Yet, what is a factor $\beta$ here and are there any fundamental limits on how large it can be? Here we report results of extensive experimentation with D-Wave 3D annealer with $N\leq 5627$. We found exact ground states (in a probabilistic sense) for typical realizations of 3D spin glasses with the efficiency, characterized by $\beta\approx 10^{3}$. We argue that with a further improvement of annealing protocols, post-processing algorithms and device noise reduction, $\beta$ can be increased even further. We provide a theoretical argumentation for this observation based on statistical analysis of low energy states.

Title: Native antisite defects in h-BN
Authors: Song Li, Pei Li, Adam Gali
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.

Title: Partial versus total resetting for L\'evy flights in d dimensions: similarities and discrepancies
Authors: Costantino Di Bello, Aleksei Chechkin, Tomasz Grzywny, Karol Szczypkowski, Bartosz Trojan, Zbigniew Palmowski
Abstract: While stochastic resetting (or total resetting) is less young and more established concept in stochastic processes, partial stochastic resetting (PSR) is a relatively new field. PSR means that, at random moments in time, a stochastic process gets multiplied by a factor between 0 and 1, thus approaching but not reaching the resetting position. In this paper, we present new results on PSR highlighting the main similarities and discrepancies with total resetting. Specifically, we consider both symmetric $\alpha$-stable Lévy processes (Lévy flights) and Brownian motion with PSR in arbitrary d dimensions. We derive explicit expressions for the propagator and its stationary measure, and discuss in detail their asymptotic behavior. Interestingly, while approaching to stationarity, a dynamical phase transition occurs for the Brownian motion, but not for Lévy flights. We also analyze the behavior of the process around the resetting position and find significant differences between PSR and total resetting.

Title: Terahertz Magnon Excitations and Switching in Non-Collinear Antiferromagnets
Authors: Durga Prasad Goli, Se Kwon Kim
Abstract: We investigate how spatiotemporal spin polarized current can lead to terahertz frequency excitations in non-collinear antiferromagnets. By solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation numerically for non-collinear antiferromagnet, we show that the magnon frequency spectrum exhibits standing spin wave modes and depends on the thickness of Mn$_3$Ge in heterostructure Fe|Au|Mn$_3$Ge. Also, we analyze the switching process of ground state as a function of a spin current. We show a switching phase diagram, which contains switching and non-switching regions. Our work suggests non-collinear antiferromagnets as an efficient platform for terahertz magnonics and ultrafast memory devices.

Title: Characteristic oscillations in frequency-resolved heat dissipation of linear time-delayed Langevin systems: Approach from the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation
Authors: Xin Wang, Ruicheng Bao, Naruo Ohga
Abstract: Time-delayed effects are widely present in nature, often accompanied by distinctive nonequilibrium features such as negative apparent heat dissipation. To elucidate detailed structures of the dissipation, we study the frequency decompositions of the heat dissipation in linear time-delayed Langevin systems. We analytically solve Langevin equations with a single linear time-delayed feedback force and calculate the spectrum of the heat dissipation in the frequency domain using the Harada-Sasa equality, which relates the heat dissipation to the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR). We find a characteristic oscillatory behavior in the spectrum, which asymptotically oscillates sinusoidally with a decaying envelope proportional to the strength of the time-delayed force and the inverse of the frequency. We confirm the generality of the results by extending our analysis to systems with multiple delay times and continuously distributed delay times. Since the violation of FDR is experimentally accessible, our results suggest an experimental direction for detecting and analyzing detailed characteristics of dissipation in time-delayed systems.

Title: Revisiting Impurity Induced In-gap Bound States In Unconventional Superconductors
Authors: Junkang Huang, Z. D. Wang, Tao Zhou
Abstract: This study revisits the effects of single impurity scattering in unconventional superconductors, with a specific emphasis on intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. We reveal that in the context of a square lattice near half-filling doping, there exists an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the appearance of mid-gap states. This relationship is determined by the $C_4$ rotational symmetry of both the $d$-wave gap amplitude and the square lattice itself. Furthermore, we identify an intrinsic link between the in-gap states and the sign change of the order parameter. In systems with interlayer pairing, strong resonant peaks are observed, despite the absence of sign-reversal characteristics in the pairing order parameter. By utilizing the $T$-matrix approach, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying these impurity-induced states. Our theoretical framework is pertinent to the analysis of newly discovered nickel-based high-temperature superconductors, providing a powerful tool for distinguishing their pairing properties. The results of this study shed light on the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity effects in unconventional superconductors, paving the way for future investigations into the unique properties of these emerging materials.

Title: Simultaneous Spin and Point-Group Adaptation in Exact Diagonalization of Spin Clusters
Authors: Shadan Ghassemi Tabrizi, Thomas D. Kühne
Abstract: While either spin or point-group adaptation is straightforward when considered independently, the standard technique for factoring isotropic spin Hamiltonians by the total spin S and the irreducible representation of the point-group is limited by the complexity of transformations between different coupling-schemes that are related by site-permutations. To overcome these challenges, we apply projection-operators directly to uncoupled basis-states, enabling the simultaneous treatment of spin and point-group symmetry without the need for recoupling-transformations. This provides a simple and efficient approach for the exact diagonalization of isotropic spin-models that we illustrate with applications to Heisenberg spin-rings and polyhedra, including systems that are computationally inaccessible with conventional coupling-techniques.

Title: Atomic-scale observation of $d$-$\pi$-$d$ spin coupling in coordination structures
Authors: Xue Zhang, Xin Li, Jie Li, Haoyang Pan, Minghui Yu, Yajie Zhang, Gui-Lin Zhu, Zhen Xu, Ziyong Shen, Shimin Hou, Yaping Zang, Bingwu Wang, Kai Wu, Shang-Da Jiang, Ivano E. Castelli, Lianmao Peng, Per Hedegård, Song Gao, Jing-Tao Lü, Yongfeng Wang
Abstract: Spin coupling between magnetic metal atoms and organic radicals plays a pivotal role in high-performance magnetic materials. The complex interaction involving multi-spin centers in bulk materials makes it challenging to study spin coupling at the atomic scale. Here, we investigate the $d$-$\pi$-$d$ spin interaction in well-defined metal-organic coordinated structures composed of two iron (Fe) atoms and four all-trans retinoic acid (ReA) molecules, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The ReA molecule is turned into a spin-$1/2$ radical state by dehydrogenation, facilitating strong magnetic coupling with the coordinated Fe atoms. Comprehensive theoretical analysis, based on density functional theory and valence bond theory, further elucidates the intrinsic mechanism of ferrimagnetic spin coupling in the coordination structure. Specifically, simultaneous antiferromagnetic coupling of Fe dimer to ReA radicals parallelizes the dimer spin orientation. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of spin interaction in metal-organic coordination structures and provides microscopic insights for designing advanced magnetic materials.

Title: Formation of Magnonic Waveguides via Surface Anisotropy-Induced Bragg Mirrors
Authors: Grzegorz Centała, Jarosław W. Kłos
Abstract: Waveguides are fundamental components for signal transmission in integrated wave-based processing systems. In this paper, we address the challenges associated with designing magnonic waveguides and propose a novel type with promising properties. Specifically, we study a magnonic waveguide formed within a uniform ferromagnetic layer (Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$) through surface anisotropy applied in stripe regions, creating Bragg mirror structures. The proposed waveguide enables the propagation of high-frequency spin waves with high velocities in the ferromagnetic layer while avoiding static demagnetizing effects. Using finite element simulations, we calculate the dispersion relation of the waveguide modes and analyze their spatial profiles. Additionally, we evaluate the group velocity and localization characteristics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the waveguide's performance.

Title: On modeling global grain boundary energy functions
Authors: Adam Morawiec
Abstract: Grain boundaries affect properties of polycrystalline materials. The influence of a boundary is largely determined by its energy. Grain boundary energy is often portrayed as a function of macroscopic boundary parameters representing grain misorientation and boundary plane inclination. In grain boundary simulation and modeling, many studies neglect structural multiplicity of boundaries, i.e., existence of metastable states, and focus on minimum energy. The minimum energy function restricted to constant misorientation should satisfy Herring's condition for interface stability. This requirement has been ignored in recent works on grain boundary energy functions. Example violations of the stability condition are shown. Moreover, a simple and natural procedure for constructing a continuous function satisfying the condition is described. Cusps in the energy as a function of boundary plane inclinations arise because of the imposition of the stability condition, and their locations and shapes result from properties of input data. An example of applying the procedure to simulated data is presented.

Title: Pyramidal charged domain walls in ferroelectric BiFeO$_3$
Authors: Pavel Marton, Marek Paściak, Mauro Gonçalves, Ondřej Novák, Jiří Hlinka, Richard Beanland, Marin Alexe
Abstract: Domain structures play a crucial role in the electric, mechanical and other properties of ferroelectric materials. In this study, we uncover the physical origins of the enigmatic zigzag domain structure in the prototypical multiferroic material BiFeO$_3$. Using phase-field simulations within the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire framework, we demonstrate that spatially-homogeneous defect charges result in domain structures that closely resemble those observed experimentally. The acquired understanding of the underlying physics of pyramidal-domain formation may enable the engineering of new materials with self-assembled domain structures exhibiting defined domain periodicity at the nanometre scale, opening avenues for advanced applications.

Title: A Magnon Band Analysis of GdRu2Si2 in the Field-Polarized State
Authors: G. D. A. Wood, J. R. Stewart, D. A. Mayoh, J. A. M. Paddison, J. Bouaziz, S. M. Tobin, O. A. Petrenko, M. R. Lees, P. Manuel, J. B. Staunton, G. Balakrishnan
Abstract: Understanding the formation of skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials is a problem of fundamental and technological interest. GdRu2Si2 is one such candidate material which has been shown to host a variety of multi-Q magnetic structures, including in zero-field. Here, inelastic neutron scattering is used to measure the spin excitations in the field-polarized phase of GdRu2Si2. Linear spin wave theory and a method of interaction invariant path analysis are used to derive a Hamiltonian accounting for the observed spectra, and comparisons to \textit{ab initio} calculations are made. No evidence for anisotropic or higher order-exchange terms beyond bilinear Heisenberg exchange is found. This is discussed in the context of the multi-Q states existing at lower fields, for which these types of terms have previously been conceived to be significant in the formation of multi-Q ground states.

Title: Many-Body Dissipative Particle Dynamics Simulations of Lipid Bilayers with the MDPD-MARTINI Force-Field
Authors: Natalia Kramarz, Luís H. Carnevale, Panagiotis E. Theodorakis
Abstract: Many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD) offers a significant speed-up in the simulation of various systems, including soft matter, in comparison with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on Lennard-Jones nteractions, which is crucial for describing phenomena characterized by large time and length scales. Moreover, it has recently been shown that the MARTINI force-field coarse-graining approach is applicable in MDPD, thus rendering feasible the simulation of complex systems as in MD MARTINI for ever larger systems for longer physical times. Here, simulations of various lipid membranes were performed by using the MDPD-MARTINI coarse-grained (CG) force-field, relevant properties were calculated, and comparison with standard MD MARTINI CG simulations and experimental data was made. Thus insights into structural properties of these bilayer systems and further evidence regarding the transferability of the MDPD-MARTINI models are provided. In this regard, this is a natural next step in the development of the general-purpose MDPD-MARTINI CG force-field, which generally provides significant speed-ups in both computational and physical simulated times, in comparison with standard CG MD simulations.

Title: Revealing diatom-inspired materials multifunctionality
Authors: Ludovico Musenich, Daniele Origo, Filippo Gallina, Markus J. Buehler, Flavia Libonati
Abstract: Diatoms have been described as nanometer-born lithographers because of their ability to create sophisticated three-dimensional amorphous silica exoskeletons. The hierarchical architecture of these structures provides diatoms with mechanical protection and the ability to filter, float, and manipulate light. Therefore, they emerge as an extraordinary model of multifunctional materials from which to draw inspiration. In this paper, we use numerical simulations, analytical models, and experimental tests to unveil the structural and fluid dynamic efficiency of the Coscinodiscus species diatom. Then we propose a novel 3D printable multifunctional biomimetic material for applications such as porous filters, heat exchangers, drug delivery systems, lightweight structures, and robotics. Our results demonstrate the role of Nature as a material designer for efficient and tunable systems and highlight the potential of diatoms for engineering materials innovation. Additionally, the results reported in this paper lay the foundation to extend the structure-property characterization of diatoms.

Title: Self-diffusive dynamics of active Brownian particles at moderate densities
Authors: Rodrigo Soto
Abstract: The Active Brownian Particle (ABP) model has become a prototype of self-propelled particles. ABPs move persistently at a constant speed $V$ along a direction that changes slowly by rotational diffusion, characterized by a coefficient $\Dr$. Persistent motion plus random reorientations generate a random walk at long times with a diffusion coefficient that, for isolated ABPs in two dimensions, is given by $D_0=V^2/(2\Dr)$. Here we study the density effects on the self-diffusive dynamics using a recently proposed kinetic theory for ABPs, in which persistent collisions are described as producing a net displacement on the particles. On intermediate timescales, where many collisions have taken place but the director of the tagged particle has not yet changed, an effective stochastic dynamics emerges, characterized by an effective reduced streaming velocity $V_\text{eff}$ and anisotropic diffusion, with coefficients explicitly depending on density. Based on this result, an effective theoretical and numerical approach is proposed in which the particles follow stochastic dynamics with mean-field interactions based on the local density. Finally, on time scales larger than $\Dr^{-1}$, the tagged particle shows an effective diffusive motion with a coefficient $D=V_\text{eff}^2/(2\Dr)$. The dependence of $V_\text{eff}$ on density indicates that the kinetic theory is limited to are fractions smaller than 0.42, and beyond this limit unphysical results appear.

Title: Momentum tunnelling between nanoscale liquid flows
Authors: Baptiste Coquinot, Anna T. Bui, Damien Toquer, Angelos Michaelides, Nikita Kavokine, Stephen J. Cox, Lydéric Bocquet
Abstract: The world of nanoscales in fluidics is the frontier where the continuum of fluid mechanics meets the atomic, and even quantum, nature of matter. While water dynamics remains largely classical under extreme confinement, several experiments have recently reported coupling between water transport and the electronic degrees of freedom of the confining materials. This avenue prompts us to reconsider nanoscale hydrodynamic flows under the perspective of interacting excitations, akin to condensed matter frameworks. Here we show, using a combination of many-body theory and molecular simulations, that the flow of a liquid can induce the flow of another liquid behind a separating wall, at odds with the prediction of continuum hydrodynamics. We further show that the range of this 'flow tunnelling' can be tuned through the solid's electronic excitations, with a maximum occurring when these are at resonance with the liquid's charge density fluctuations. Flow tunnelling is expected to play a role in global transport across nanoscale fluidic networks, such as lamellar graphene oxide or MXene membranes. It further suggests exploiting the electronic properties of the confining walls for manipulating liquids via their dielectric spectra, beyond the nature and characteristics of individual molecules.

Title: Heitler effect and resonance fluorescence in quantum magnonics
Authors: Enes Ilbuğa, V. V. Dobrovitski, Ya. M. Blanter
Abstract: We consider a coupled system of a qubit and a magnon mode in which the qubit is weakly driven. We demonstrate that the spectral steady-state responses of both the qubit and the magnon show, in addition to two sidebands split by the coupling, also a peak at the driving frequency with virtually zero linewidth. This phenomenon, which persists at both strong and weak coupling, is an analog of the Heitler effect in atomic physics, and shows the path towards building of coherent magnon sources.

Title: Competing Hexagonal and Square Lattices on a Spherical Surface
Authors: Han Xie, Wenyu Liu, Zhenyue Lu, Jeff Z.Y. Chen, Yao Li
Abstract: The structural properties of packed soft-core particles provide a platform to understand the cross-pollinated physical concepts in solid-state- and soft-matter physics. Confined on spherical surface, the traditional differential geometry also dictates the overall defect properties in otherwise regular crystal lattices. Using molecular dynamics simulation of the Hertzian model as a tool, we report here the emergence of new types of disclination patterns: domain and counter-domain defects, when hexagonal and square patterns coexist. A new angle is presented to understand the incompatibility between tiling lattice shapes and the available spherical areal shapes, which is common in nature -- from molecular systems in biology to backbone construction in architectures.

Title: Transport Signatures of Inverted Andreev Bands in Topological Josephson Junctions
Authors: Jonathan Sturm, Raffael L. Klees, Ewelina M. Hankiewicz, Daniel Gresta
Abstract: We study the thermoelectrical transport transverse to conventional and topological Josephson junctions with a central quantum dot (QD). For that purpose, we derive an effective resonant tunneling model where the QD is renormalized with an induced superconducting gap. By applying Keldysh Green's function technique, we compute the local density of states as well as the transmission functions. In the latter case, we observe that the Andreev bound states forming on the QD are inverted if the junction has $p$-wave symmetry, meaning that electron and hole orbitals switch roles. We calculate the thermoelectric transport coefficients both analytically and numerically and show how the induced gaps and the band inversion are reflected in the electrical and heat conductance as well as the Seebeck coefficient, the latter experiencing a sign change in the topological case.

Title: Launching Focused and Spatially Confined Phonon-Polaritons in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Bogdan Borodin, Sergey Lepeshov, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Petr Stepanov
Abstract: Launching and focusing phonon-polaritons present novel opportunities for low-loss guiding of subdiffractionally confined light at the nanoscale. Despite significant efforts to improve control in polaritonic media, focused and spatially confined phonon-polariton waves have only been achieved in the in-plane anisotropic crystals (such as MoO$_3$) and remain elusive in the in-plane isotropic crystals (such as hexagonal boron nitride). In this study, we present a previously unexplored approach to launching phonon-polaritons by employing hBN subwavelength resonators coupled to gold nanoantennas. The integration of gold nanoantennas enables efficient coupling to the far-field component of mid-infrared light, while the geometry of the resonators defines the wavefront curvature, spatial confinement, and focusing of the launched polaritons. Using standard lithographic protocols, we achieve strong field enhancement and resonant mode localization, generating phonon-polaritons with precise spatial definition. Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy reveals the real-space optical contrast of these modes. This innovative and practical approach introduces a new paradigm for fabricating nanoresonators that actively launch and focus phonon-polaritons, opening avenues for advanced nanophotonic devices.

Title: Can hydrodynamic interactions destroy travelling waves formed by non-reciprocity?
Authors: Giulia Pisegna, Navdeep Rana, Ramin Golestanian, Suropriya Saha
Abstract: The collective chasing dynamics of non-reciprocally coupled densities leads to stable travelling waves which can be mapped to a model for emergent flocking. In this work, we couple the non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model (NRCH) to a fluid to minimally describe scalar active mixtures in a suspension, with the aim to explore the stability of the waves, i.e. the emergent flock in the presence of self-generated fluid flows. We show that the emergent polarity is linearly unstable to perturbations for a specific sign of the active stress recalling instabilities of orientational order in a fluid. Using numerical simulations, we find however that non-reciprocity stabilizes the waves against the linear instability in a large region of the phase space.

Title: Chiral electronic network within skyrmionic lattice on topological insulator surfaces
Authors: Matteo Wilczak, Dmitry K. Efimkin, Victor Gurarie
Abstract: We consider a proximity effect between Dirac surface states of a topological insulator and the skyrmion phase of an insulating magnet. A single skyrmion results in the surface states having a chiral gapless mode confined to the perimeter of the skyrmion. For the lattice of skyrmions, the tunneling coupling between confined states leads to the formation of low energy bands delocalized across the whole system. We show that the structure of these bands can be investigated with the help of the phenomenological chiral network model with a kagome lattice geometry. While the network model by itself can be in a chiral Floquet phase unattainable without external periodic driving, we show how to use a procedure known as band reconstruction to obtain the low energy bands of the electrons on the surface of the topological insulator for which there is no external driving. We conclude that band reconstruction is essential for the broad class of network models recently introduced to describe the electronic properties of different nanostructures.

Title: Close-contact melting on hydrophobic textured surfaces: Confinement and meniscus effects
Authors: Nan Hu, Liwu Fan, Xiang Gao, Howard A. Stone
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of close-contact melting (CCM) on gas-trapped hydrophobic surfaces, with specific focus on the effects of geometrical confinement and the liquid-air meniscus below the liquid film. By employing dual-series and perturbation methods, we obtain numerical solutions for the effective slip lengths associated with velocity $\lambda$ and temperature $\lambda_t$ fields, across various values of aspect ratio $\Lambda$ (defined as the ratio of the film thickness $h$ to the structure's periodic length $l$) and gas-liquid fraction $\phi$. Asymptotic solutions of $\lambda$ and $\lambda_t$ for $\Lambda\ll 1$ and $\Lambda \gg 1$ are derived and summarized for different surface structures, interface shapes and $\Lambda$, which reveal a different trend for $\lambda$ and $\Lambda \ll 1$ and the presence of a meniscus. In the context of constant-pressure CCM, our results indicate that transverse-grooves surfaces consistently reduced the heat transfer. However, longitudinal grooves can enhance heat transfer under the effects of confinement and meniscus when $\Lambda \lessapprox 0.1$ and $\phi < 1 - 0.5^{2/3} \approx 0.37$. For gravity-driven CCM, the parameters of $l$ and $\phi$ determine whether the melting rate is enhanced, reduced, or nearly unaffected. We construct a phase diagram based on the parameter matrix $(\log_{10} l, \phi)$to delineate these three regimes. Lastly, we derived two asymptotic solutions for predicting the variation in time of the unmelted solid height.

Title: Magnetic frustration and weak Mn magnetic ordering in EuMn$_2$P$_2$
Authors: Sarah Krebber, Jörg Sichelschmidt, Pierre Chailloleau, Asmaa El Mard, Marvin Kopp, Michael Baenitz, Kurt Kummer, Denis V. Vyalikh, Jens Müller, Cornelius Krellner, Kristin Kliemt
Abstract: We report on the electron spin resonance (ESR), heat capacity, magnetization, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic circular and linear dichroism (XMCD, XMLD), as well as the electrical resistivity of EuMn$_{2}$P$_{2}$ single crystals. Antiferromagnetic order of Eu was observed in several quantities at $T^{\rm Eu}_{\rm N}\,=\,18\,\rm K$. The temperature dependencies of ESR linewidth and resonance shift show, when approaching the Eu-ordered state, a divergence towards $T^{\rm Eu}_{\rm N}$, indicating the growing importance of magnetic correlations and the build-up of internal magnetic fields. An additional temperature scale of $\approx 47\,\rm K$ has considerable impact on linewidth, resonance field and intensity. This points to the presence of weak Mn-based ordering. The observed ESR line is interpreted as an Eu$^{2+}$ resonance, which probes the weak magnetic background of the Mn subsystem. Such picture is suggested by the lineshape which keeps to be Lorentzian across the $47\,\rm K$ scale and by the ESR intensity which can be described by the same Curie-Weiss temperature above and below $47\,\rm K$. In the same temperature range anomalies were observed at $48.5\,\rm K$ and $51\,\rm K$ in the heat capacity data as well as a pronounced broadening of the NMR signal of the EuMn$_{2}$P$_{2}$ samples. In XMCD and XMLD measurements, this weak magnetic order could not be detected in the same temperature range which might be due to the small magnetic moment, with a potential $c$-component or frustration.

Title: Three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall effect in Weyl semimetals
Authors: Zhi-Qiang Zhang, Yu-Hang Li, Ming Lu, Hongfang Liu, Hailong Li, Hua Jiang, X. C. Xie
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.

Title: Sample shape dependence of magnetic noise
Authors: Steven T. Bramwell
Abstract: Zero-field magnetic noise, characterised by the magnetic autocorrelation function $S_s(t)$, has been observed, perhaps surprisingly, to depend on sample shape $s$. The reasons for this are identified and general expressions are derived that relate the autocorrelation functions for systems of different shape to an underlying `intrinsic' form. Assuming the flcutuatiopn-dissipation theorem, it is shown that, for any noise that relaxes monotonically, the effect of sample shape is to reduce both the noise amplitude and mean relaxation time by a factor of $1+N\chi_i$, where $N$ is the demagnetizing factor and $\chi_i$ the intrinsic susceptibility. In frequency space, where $S_s(t)$ Fourier transforms into the power spectrum $S_s(\omega)$, the above two factors combine to suppress the zero frequency amplitude of $S_s(\omega)$ by $(1+N\chi_i)^2$, while at high frequency, sample shape dependence becomes negligible. These results suggest simple and robust experimental tests of the fluctuation--dissipation theorem in magnetic systems that may be useful in distinguishing bulk from surface effects.

Title: Strain-Induced Activation of Symmetry-Forbidden Exciton-Phonon Couplings for Enhanced Phonon-Assisted Photoluminescence in MoS$_2$ Monolayers
Authors: Rishabh Saraswat, Rekha Verma, Sitangshu Bhattacharya
Abstract: Phonon-assisted photoluminescence (PL) in molybdenum-based two-dimensional dichalcogenides is typically weak due to the dormant phonon coupling with optically inactive momentum-dark (intervalley) excitons, unlike in tungsten-based dichalcogenides where such processes are more prominent. Despite this inefficiency, we revisit excitons in MoS$_2$ using rigorous finite-momentum Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations to identify ways to enhance phonon-assisted recombination channels. Our ab-initio results, complemented by group-theoretic analyses, reveal that while unstrained MoS$_2$ exhibits no phonon-assisted PL emissions at cryogenic temperatures due to forbidden A$^{\prime\prime}$ phonon modes, biaxial strain opens a pathway to significantly intensify this emission by activating hole-phonon A$^{\prime}$-mediated scattering channels. By calculating allowed exciton-phonon matrix elements and scattering rates, we demonstrate how strain redistributes oscillator strengths toward radiative recombination. These findings provide a promising route to improving PL emission efficiency in various metal dichalcogenide monolayers through strain engineering and offer valuable insights for further exploration of exciton-phonon dynamics, including time-resolved spectroscopic studies.

Title: Thermodynamic and Real-time Dynamic Properties of Complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model
Authors: Sizheng Cao, Xian-Hui Ge, Yi-Cheng Rui
Abstract: We study the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (cSYK) numerically and investigate thermodynamic behavior of cSYK model across varying chemical potentials. We discover that the cSYK model remarkably mirrors the first-order phase transition seen in the van der Waals-Maxwell system, culminating at a non-mean-field critical point with distinctively different critical exponents. We analyze in detail the similarity between the van der Waals phase transition and the cSYK model, and further explore the mechanism by which the chemical potential drives the phase transition in the system. Exact diagonalization for the cSYK model reveals the significant impact of chemical potential on energy distribution, with observable energy gaps in the gapped phase. Quantum chaos indicators, including spectral form factors, suggest more stable energy states in the neutral case. Real-time dynamics, analyzed via analytical continuation of Schwinger-Dyson equations, show rapid decay in the gapless phase and prolonged oscillation lifetimes in the gapped regime. Spectral functions imply a shift from a continuous to a discrete energy level distribution, emphasizing the critical role of chemical potential in shaping spectral properties.

Title: Average mutual information for random fermionic Gaussian quantum states
Authors: Lucas Hackl, Mario Kieburg, Joel Maldonado
Abstract: Studying the typical entanglement entropy of a bipartite system when averaging over different ensembles of pure quantum states has been instrumental in different areas of physics, ranging from many-body quantum chaos to black hole evaporation. We extend such analysis to open quantum systems and mixed states, where we compute the typical mutual information in a bipartite system averaged over the ensemble of mixed Gaussian states with a fixed spectrum. Tools from random matrix theory and determinantal point processes allow us to compute arbitrary k-point correlation functions of the singular values of the corresponding complex structure in a subsystem for a given spectrum in the full system. In particular, we evaluate the average von Neumann entropy in a subsystem based on the level density and the average mutual information. Those results are given for finite system size as well as in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: On-the-Fly Path Planning of Compositional Gradients in High Dimensions
Authors: Samuel Price, Zhaoxi Cao, Ian McCue
Abstract: Functional gradients have recently experienced an explosion in activity due to advances in manufacturing, where compositions can now be spatially varied on-the-fly during fabrication. In addition, modern computational thermodynamics has reached sufficient maturity -- with respect to property databases and the availability of commercial software -- that gradients can be designed with specific sets of properties. Despite these successes, there are practical limitations on the calculation speeds of these thermodynamic tools that make it intractable to model every element in an alloy. As a result, most path planning is carried out via surrogate models on simplified systems (e.g., approximating Inconel 718 as Ni$_{59}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$ instead of Ni$_{53}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$Nb$_{3}$Mo$_{2}$Ti$_{1}$). In this work, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome using a combination of on-the-fly sampling and a conjectured corollary of the lever rule for transformations of isothermal paths in arbitrary compositional dimensions. We quantitatively benchmark the effectiveness of this new method and find that it can be as much as 106 times more efficient than surrogate modeling.

Title: Nonlinear topological pumping of edge solitons
Authors: Xinrui You, Liaoyuan Xiao, Yongguan Ke, Chaohong Lee
Abstract: We study how nonlinear strength affects topological pumping of edge solitons by using nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation. For weak nonlinear strength, the introduction of nonlinearity breaks the symmetry of the energy spectrum, which makes the topological pumping from the left edge to the right edges differ from the inverse process. For moderate nonlinear strength, self-crossing structures appear in the spectrum, the right-to-left adiabatic pumping channel is destroyed, and only left-to-right topological pumping can be achieved under slow modulation. As the nonlinear strength further inreases, although left-to-right topological pumping in one pumping cycle also breaks down, we find that a thin soliton which is located in a single left edge can be mixed with the bulk soliton, and hybridized topological pumping of edge and bulk solitons can be realized after multiple pumping cycles. For stronger nonlinear strength, edge solitons are self-trapped and all topological pumping channels are shut down. Our work could trigger further studies of the interplay between nonlinearity and topology.

Title: Hydrodynamics without Boost-Invariance from Kinetic Theory: From Perfect Fluids to Active Flocks
Authors: Kevin T. Grosvenor, Niels A. Obers, Subodh P. Patil
Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.

Title: Robust Dynamics of Rogue waves, Breathers and Mixed Bound State Solutions in Spin-Orbit and Rabi Coupled Condensates
Authors: P.S.Vinayagam, R.Radha
Abstract: In this paper, based on an integrable model governed by four system parameters, namely, spin-orbit coupling and Rabi coupling which are constants while the other two parameters, namely the harmonic trap and scattering lengths which are time dependent, we investigate the spin orbit-Rabi coupled condensates governed by the two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii(GP) equation. Employing Darboux transformation approach with nontrivial seed solution, we generate rogue waves, breathers, mixed rogue-dark-bright and classical dark-bright solitons. While the addition of SOC contributes to rapid oscillations in the amplitude of the rogue waves, Rabi coupling results in the appearance of stripes in the temporal direction. When the transient trap is switched on, these stripes which remain stable within the confining region, begin to overlap exponentially in the expulsive domain and eventually shrink leading to instability. We have shown that the instability arising in the rogue waves in a transient trap can be completely overcome by manipulating the scattering length through Feshbach resonance. In the case of breathers, the Rabi coupling introduces temporal stripes with single and double mode peaks around the origin while under the influence of the transient trap, the breathers get compressed and tilted. On the other hand, the amplitude of breathers which stays constant between a maxima and minima despite oscillating with time undergoes rapid fluctuations in a given spatial domain under the influence of SOC. In the case of classical dark-bright solitons, we see the flipping of dark solitons to attain positive density much similar to bright solitons under the impact of Rabi coupling. One also witnesses a 45 degree shift in the trajectory of dark and bright solitons when the transient trap is switched on. The width of the solitons widen in the confining trap while they shrink in the expulsive domain.

Title: Community detection by simulated bifurcation
Authors: Wei Li, Yi-Lun Du, Nan Su, Konrad Tywoniuk, Kyle Godbey, Horst Stöcker
Abstract: Community detection, also known as graph partitioning, is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with applications in diverse fields such as complex network theory, transportation, and smart power grids. The problem's solution space grows drastically with the number of vertices and subgroups, making efficient algorithms crucial. In recent years, quantum computing has emerged as a promising approach to tackling NP-hard problems. This study explores the use of a quantum-inspired algorithm, Simulated Bifurcation (SB), for community detection. Modularity is employed as both the objective function and a metric to evaluate the solutions. The community detection problem is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling seamless integration with the SB algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that SB effectively identifies community structures in benchmark networks such as Zachary's Karate Club and the IEEE 33-bus system. Remarkably, SB achieved the highest modularity, matching the performance of Fujitsu's Digital Annealer, while surpassing results obtained from two quantum machines, D-Wave and IBM. These findings highlight the potential of Simulated Bifurcation as a powerful tool for solving community detection problems.

Title: Deep learning optimal molecular scintillators for dark matter direct detection

Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.

Title: Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators
Authors: David Poland, Gordon Rogelberg
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to transform the correlation function into a classical moment-generating function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 = \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into deformed higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit. We further compute tree-level perturbations on saddles in 1/2 BPS Wilson line defect correlators in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM, making predictions about deformations of families of long operators.

Title: Towards the BBGKY hierarchy: a scheme beyond the Boltzmann equation and application to a weakly confined QCD gas
Authors: Sašo Grozdanov, Alexander Soloviev
Abstract: In classical kinetic theory, the BBGKY hierarchy is an infinite chain of integro-differential equations that describes the full time-reversal-invariant (Liouville) system of interacting (quasi)-particles in terms of $N$-particle distribution functions. In this work, instead of truncating the hierarchy at the lowest level, as is done by the Boltzmann equation, we develop a scheme similar to the relaxation time approximation that is in principle able to account for the entire chain of equations. We then explicitly investigate its truncation at the second level of the BBGKY hierarchy and, within this scheme, study the spectra of conserved operator correlation functions in a gas of weakly confined hadrons. We also discuss how these higher levels account for parts of the operator spectra `deeper in the ultra-violet regime' and compare them to known results derived from the holographic duality.

Title: Development of a linac-based LEPD experimental station for surface structure analysis and coordination with synchrotron radiation ARPES
Authors: Rezwan Ahmed, Izumi Mochizuki, Toshio Hyodo, Tetsuroh Shirasawa, Seigi Mizuno, Yoshinari Kondo, Kenichi Ozawa, Miho Kitamura, Kenta Amemiya, Bartlomiej Checinski, Jozef Ociepa, Achim Czasch, Ottmar Jagutzki, Ken Wada
Abstract: We report on the development of a low-energy positron diffraction (LEPD) experimental station for surface structure analysis using a linac-based slow-positron beam. LEPD, the positron counterpart of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), offers higher accuracy in surface structure determination. The station enables acquisition of LEPD I-V curves within a few hours, allowing measurements before surface degradation occurs. It consists of two ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers: one for sample preparation and the other for LEPD observations. The preparation chamber includes an Ar+ sputtering system, a triple-pocket electron beam evaporator, three gas introduction systems, additional user-configurable ports, and a LEED/Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) system. Sample manipulators enable rapid cooling, precise positioning, and orientation adjustments. In the preparation chamber, the manipulator also supports direct current heating up to 1200 °C. The sample holder is compatible with the LEPD station at SPF-A4 and the ARPES station at PF BL-13B, both located at the Tsukuba campus of the Institute of Materials Structure Science (IMSS), KEK. Design concepts and experimental demonstrations are presented.

Title: Analysis of memory effects in the dynamic evolution of the spin-boson model
Authors: Rayees A Mala, Mehboob Rashid, Muzaffar Qadir Lone
Abstract: Quantum information processing relies on how dynamics unfold in open quantum systems. In this work, we study the non-Markovian dynamics in the single mode spin-boson model at strong couplings. In order to apply perturbation theory, we transform our Hamiltonian to polaron frame, so that the effective system-bath coupling gets reduced. We employ coherence defined by l1-norm to analyze the non-Markovian effects in the spin-boson model. In the transformed frame of reference, the correlation timescales for the bath are significantly shorter than the system's relaxation timescale-a key assumption for Markovian dynamics. However, intriguingly, we demonstrate that under the large polaron theory, the reduced dynamics exhibit effective non-Markovian behaviour within a specific range of couplings, while remaining Markovian beyond this range.

Title: Decoherence dynamics in a polaron system with collective dephasing
Authors: Saima Bashir, Muzaffar Qadir Lone, Prince A Ganai
Abstract: Within quantum information frameworks, managing decoherence stands as a pivotal task. The present work delves into decoherence dynamics of a dressed qubit, represented by a spinless fermion hopping between two lattice sites that are strongly coupled to a collective bosonic bath. To simplify calculations under strong coupling, we adopt the Lang-Firsov transformation, effectively minimizing system-bath interactions. Within the polaron perspective using Ohmic bath spectral density with a Gaussian cutoff, we identify a fundamental timescale $s$ (equivalently a length scale $l$), dictating coherence decay. Utilizing a quantum master equation in the energy eigen basis while maintaining fixed particle number, we demonstrate that coherence persists for small $s$ values but diminishes for larger ones. Additionally, we explore the utilization of $\pi$-pulses to manipulate decoherence within the system.

Title: Evolution of Pulse width modulation techniques of modular multilevel converter
Authors: Khushbu Saradva, Meeta Matnani, Tapankumar Trivedi
Abstract: The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a promising converter technology for various highvoltage high-power applications. The reason to that is low-distortion output quantities can be achieved with low average switching frequencies per switch and without output filters. Modular multilevel converter pulse width modulation based control approaches are evaluated. The multicarrier PWM techniques such as Phase disposition PWM (PDPWM), Phase opposition disposition PWM (PODPWM), Alternate phase opposition disposition PWM (APODPWM) is employed and a comparative study is done based on the quality of the load voltage and load current output. This paper presents the simulation of single phase modular multilevel converter based on Half-Bridge sub module topology. Simulation has been carried out for various modulation techniques using MATLAB/Simulink and the results are observed.

Title: Analytical model of metasurfaces comprising meta-atoms with anisotropic polarizabilities
Authors: Izzatjon Allayarov, Vladimir R. Tuz, Antonio Calà Lesina, Andrey B. Evlyukhin
Abstract: A general analytical approach to the study of electromagnetic resonances of metasurfaces consisting of meta-atoms with anisotropic electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities and irradiated with obliquely incident light is developed in the direct dipole-moment representation. The presented approach allows us to clearly trace and explain the features of the electromagnetic coupling between electric and magnetic dipole moments in the metasurface and to identify its role in the formation of optical resonances. For these purposes, the dependence of the dipole lattice sums on the angle of illumination is also presented. Expressions for the transmittance and reflectivity corresponding to the specular reflectance are presented with explicit inclusion of the dipole moments of particles in the array, which allows using these expressions for multipole analysis of purely numerical results concerning the optical response of metasurfaces. The developed analytical method is tested to characterize the spectral resonances of dielectric metasurfaces composed of rectangular silicon nanoprisms. In addition, we discuss the relationship and similarity between the results of coupled dipole and coupled dipole-quadrupole methods. Our analytical representation of electromagnetic dipole coupling is an insightful and fast method for the characterization of collective resonances in metasurfaces under illumination at oblique incidence. It could be especially useful for designing planar nanophotonic devices consisting of arbitrary-shaped building blocks and operating under special irradiation conditions.

Title: Tricritical behavior of a relativistic field theory in one dimension
Authors: Heron Caldas, A. L. Mota
Abstract: The tricritical behavior in a class of one-dimensional (1D) field theories that exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking at zero temperature and chemical potential is analyzed. In the Gross-Neveu (GN)-type models of massless fermions the discrete chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. After doping, the symmetry is restored at a critical chemical potential. We investigate the temperature effects on this doped 1D system under an external constant Zeeman magnetic field $B_0$. We find that $B_0$ suppresses the gapless behavior present for certain values of chemical potential and is able to induce a gapless-gapped phase transition at a critical field strength. We also discuss about the consequences of the consideration of inhomogeneous condensates to the tricritical point, within the Ginzburg-Landau expansion.

Title: String breaking dynamics in Ising chain with local vibrations
Authors: Arindam Mallick, Maciej Lewenstein, Jakub Zakrzewski, Marcin Płodzień
Abstract: We consider the dynamics in the one-dimensional quantum Ising model in which each spin coherently interacts with its phononic mode. The model is motivated by quantum simulators based on Rydberg atoms in tweezers or trapped ions. The configuration of two domain walls simulates the particle-antiparticle connecting string. We concentrate on the effect the local vibrations have on the dynamics of this initial state. Our study supplements recent investigations of string breaking, traditionally studied within quantum chromodynamics (QCD), to quantum many-body systems. Two regimes are identified depending on the strength of the coupling with local vibrations. For weak coupling, the string breaking is slowed down as compared to the dynamics in an isolated Ising string. The strong coupling leads to complicated dynamics in which the domain wall character of excitation is dissolved among many coupled states.

Title: Electronic Noise Considerations for Designing Integrated Solid-State Quantum Memories
Authors: Tzu-Yung Huang, David A. Hopper, Kaisarbek Omirzakhov, Mohamad Hossein Idjadi, S. Alexander Breitweiser, Firooz Aflatouni, Lee C. Bassett
Abstract: As quantum networks expand and are deployed outside research laboratories, a need arises to design and integrate compact control electronics for each memory node. It is essential to understand the performance requirements for such systems, especially concerning tolerable levels of noise, since these specifications dramatically affect a system's design complexity and cost. Here, using an approach that can be easily generalized across quantum-hardware platforms, we present a case study based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We model and experimentally verify the effects of phase noise and timing jitter in the control system in conjunction with the spin qubit's environmental noise. We further consider the impact of different phase noise characteristics on the fidelity of dynamical decoupling sequences. The results demonstrate a procedure to specify design requirements for integrated quantum control signal generators for solid-state spin qubits, depending on their coherence time, intrinsic noise spectrum, and required fidelity.

Title: Swimming mode determines how well mesoscale swimmers shield their odor in turbulence
Authors: Martin James, Francesco Viola, Agnese Seminara
Abstract: Marine organisms manipulate their surrounding flow through their swimming dynamics, which affects the transport of their own odor cues. We demonstrate by direct numerical simulations how a group of mesoscale swimmers immersed in a turbulent flow alters the shape of the odor plume they release in the water. Odor mixing is enhanced by increased velocity fluctuations and a swimmer-induced flow circulation which widen the odor plume at close range while speeding up dilution of the chemical trace. Beyond a short-range increase in the likelihood of being detected, swimming considerably reduces detections with effects that can persist at distances of the order of ten times the size of the group or more. We find that puller-like swimmers are more effective at olfactory shielding than pusher-like swimmers. We trace this difference back to the dynamics at the swimmer location, which tends to trap odor at the source for pushers and to dilute it for pullers. Olfactory shielding is robust to changes in the conditions, and is more pronounced for weak turbulent Reynolds numbers and large swimmer Reynolds numbers. Our results suggest that olfactory shielding may play a role in the emergence of different swimming modalities by marine organisms.

Title: Photon-photon coupling induced bound state in the continuum and transparency
Authors: Ekta Tunwal, Kuldeep Kumar Shrivastava, Rakesh Kumar Nayak, Ravi Kumar, Somak Bhattacharyya, Rajeev Singh, Biswanath Bhoi
Abstract: This study presents the coherent and dissipative coupling realized in the hybrid photonic resonators that have been achieved via the constructive and destructive interference of the photonic resonator fields with the radiation of a common transmission line fed with microwave photons. In the dissipative coupling regime we have found the coexistence of a peculiar phenomenon bound state in the continuum (BIC) near the crossing of frequency of the uncoupled resonators by satisfying the Friedrich-Wintgen BICs condition. Again just by rotating one of the samples and with the dynamic adjustment of a parameter we have achieved coupling induced transparency between the photonic resonators. This transition from BIC in the absorption regime to transparency opens avenues for different sorts of plain or programmable oscillators, filters, quantum information processors, sensors etc.

Title: Breakdown of broken-symmetry approach to exchange interaction
Authors: Naoya Iwahara, Zhishuo Huang, Akseli Mansikkamäki, Liviu F. Chibotaru
Abstract: Broken-symmetry (BS) approaches are widely employed to evaluate Heisenberg exchange parameters, primarily in combination with DFT calculations. For many magnetic materials, BS-DFT calculations give reasonable estimations of exchange parameters although systematic failures have also been reported. While the latter were attributed to deficiencies of approximate exchange-correlation functional, we prove here by treating a simple model system that the broken-symmetry methodology has serious problems. Detailed analysis clarifies the intrinsic issue with the broken-symmetry treatment of low-spin states. It shows, in particular, that the error in the BS calculation of exchange parameter scales with the degree of covalency between the magnetic and the bridging orbitals. As a possible tool to overcome this intrinsic drawback of single-determinant BS approaches, we propose their extension to a minimal multiconfigurational version.

Title: Design and construction of the multiplexing cold neutron spectrometer BOYA with double-column Rowland focusing analyzers
Authors: Jinchen Wang, Daye Xu, Juanjuan Liu, Wei Luo, Peng Cheng, Hongxia Zhang, Wei Bao
Abstract: Developing neutron spectrometers with higher counting efficiency has been an essential pursuit in neutron instrumentation. In this work, we present BOYA, a multiplexing cold neutron spectrometers designed and implemented at the China Advanced Research Reactor. Equipped with 34 angular analyzing channels spanning 119°, each containing 5 inelastic channels and 1 diffraction channel, BOYA enhances the measurement efficiency by two orders of magnitude over a traditional triple-axis spectrometer. To optimize both intensity and energy resolution, innovative double-column Rowland focusing analyzers have been developed. By filling the crystal gaps in the traditional Rowland focusing geometry, our design enhances the neutron beam coverage without introducing appreciable double-scattering. Our commissioning results on vanadium and MnWO4 have confirmed the success of the design, establishing BOYA as a successful multiplexing instrument for neutron spectroscopy.

Title: Measurable Improvement in Multi-Qubit Readout Using a Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier
Authors: M.A. Castellanos-Beltran, L. Howe, A. Giachero, M.R. Vissers, D. Labranca, J.N. Ullom, P.F. Hopkins
Abstract: Increasing the size and complexity of quantum information systems requires highly-multiplexed readout architectures, as well as amplifier chains operating near the quantum limit (QL) of added noise. While documented prior efforts in KITWPA integration in quantum systems are scarce, in this work we demonstrate integration of a KI-TWPA with a multiplexed-qubit device. To quantify the system noise improvement we perform an ac Stark shift calibration to precisely determine noise power levels on-chip (at each cavity's reference plane) and the total system gain. We then characterize the qubit state measurement fidelity and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To conduct the most faithful measurement of the benefits offered by the KI-TWPA we perform these measurements for readout chains where the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier is the first-stage amplifier (FSA) - with none of the external hardware required to operate the KI-TWPA - and with the KI-TWPA as the FSA. While some readout cavities fall outside the KI-TWPA bandwidth, for those inside the bandwidth we demonstrate a maximum improvement in the state measurement SNR by a factor of 1.45, and increase the fidelity from 96.2% to 97.8%. These measurements demonstrate a system noise below 5 quanta referenced on-chip and we bound the KI-TWPA excess noise to be below 4 quanta for the six cavities inside its bandwidth. These results show a promising path forward for realizing quantum-limited readout chains in large qubit systems using a single parametric amplifier.

Title: D-HAT: a Diatom-inspired structure for a Helmet concept Against Trauma
Authors: Ludovico Musenich, Lorenzo Strozzi, Massimiliano Avalle, Flavia Libonati
Abstract: The primary objective of helmet design continues to be the prevention of traumatic brain injuries. Yet, achieving an optimal user experience, including aspects such as fit, thermal comfort, breathability, waterproofing, and reusability, is increasingly significant. Thus, designing helmets with multifunctional performance represents the latest technological frontier for safety devices. This study draws inspiration from the morphology of Coscinodiscus species diatoms to develop a biomimetic material replicating their cellular structure and multifunctionality. Unlike its biological counterpart, the synthetic material is engineered as the inner liner for multi impact helmets, suited for urban sports and micro mobility applications. The architecture of the material is modeled using computer aided design tools, and its energy absorption capabilities are analyzed through finite element modeling and quasi static compression tests on 3D printed elastomeric samples. Performance optimization is achieved through a parametric approach. The results demonstrate that the material exhibits energy absorption comparable to cellular materials like honeycombs, while offering lightweight properties, breathability, and resistance to atmospheric agents. This biomimetic design marks a significant advancement in high performance safety equipment.

Title: Modulational Instability and Dynamical Growth Blockade in the Nonlinear Hatano-Nelson Model
Authors: Stefano Longhi
Abstract: The Hatano-Nelson model is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian physics, describing asymmetric hopping dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice, which gives rise to fascinating phenomena such as directional transport, non-Hermitian topology, and the non-Hermitian skin effect. It has been widely studied in both classical and quantum systems, with applications in condensed matter physics, photonics, and cold atomic gases. Recently, nonlinear extensions of the Hatano-Nelson model have opened a new avenue for exploring the interplay between nonlinearity and non-Hermitian effects. Particularly, in lattices with open boundary conditions, nonlinear skin modes and solitons, localized at the edge or within the bulk of the lattice, have been predicted. In this work, we examine the nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and reveal a novel dynamical phenomenon arising from the modulational instability of nonlinear plane waves: growth blockade. This phenomenon is characterized by the abrupt halt of norm growth, as observed in the linear Hatano-Nelson model, and can be interpreted as a stopping of convective motion arising from self-induced disorder in the lattice.

Title: Integrative Learning of Intensity Fluctuations of Quantum Dots under Excitation via a Tailored Mixture Hidden Markov Model
Authors: Xin Yang, Hawi Nyiera, Yonglei Sun, Jing Zhao, Kun Chen
Abstract: Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have garnered significant interest in various scientific fields due to their unique fluorescence properties. One captivating characteristic of QDs is their ability to emit photons under continuous excitation. The intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different dots even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. As such, conventional approaches in the chemistry literature, typified by single-dot analysis of raw intensity data with Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM), cannot meet the many analytical challenges and may fail to capture any novel yet rare fluctuation patterns among QDs. Collaborating with scientists in the chemistry field, we have developed an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series of multiple QDs. Our approach still inherits the HMM as the skeleton to model the intensity fluctuations of each dot, and based on the data structure and the hypothesized collective behaviors of the QDs, our approach asserts that (i) under each hidden state, the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, (ii) the state distributions are shared across all the QDs, and (iii) the patterns of transitions can vary across QDs. These unique features allow for a precise characterization of the intensity fluctuation patterns and facilitate the clustering of the QDs. With experimental data collected on 128 QDs, our methods reveal several QD clusters characterized by unique transition patterns across three intensity states. The results provide deeper insight into QD behaviors and their design/application potentials.

Title: Constructive impact of Wannier-Stark field on environment-boosted quantum batteries
Authors: Animesh Ghosh, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: Using the ground states of the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard model as the battery's initial state, we demonstrate that using the Wannier-Stark (WS) field for charging in addition to onsite interactions can increase the maximum power of the battery. Although the benefit is not ubiquitous, bosonic batteries are more affected by the WS field than fermionic ones. In particular, there exists a critical WS field strength above which the power gets increased in the battery. Further, we determine a closed form expression of the stored work when the battery is in the ground state of the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard model with only hopping term and the charging is carried out with onsite interactions and WS field irrespective of lattice-size of the battery. Moreover, we exhibit that it is possible to extract work in the fermionic batteries even without charging when the edge sites are attached to two local thermal baths having high temperatures -- this process we refer to as {\it environment-assisted ergotropy}. Note, however, that the bosonic batteries are able to exhibit such an environmental benefit in the transient regime when the lattice-size is increased and when Wannier-Stark field is present. Nonetheless, if the onsite interaction or WS potential with a critical strength is utilized as a charger, energy can be stored and extracted from both bosonic and fermionic batteries in the presence of the thermal baths.

Title: Photon Bose-Condensate as a Tunable Terahertz Laser Source without Inversion
Authors: Timofey V. Maximov, Igor V. Bondarev, Igor L. Kurbakov, Yurii E. Lozovik
Abstract: We develop a theoretical model for a tunable coherent terahertz radiation source based on the long-lived Bose condensate of photons. In the device we propose, the original photon pumping is performed incoherently by a blackbody radiation emitter. The photons thus produced Bose-condense by the inelastic relaxation on a two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetostatic field. The process involves neither population inversion nor light wave amplification the standard laser sources are built on. The coherence and tunability of the light emitted by such a photon condensate are provided and supported by the discrete spectrum of the electron gas in the quantizing magnetic field. The device is a compact-size semiconductor crystal. We propose the design and perform the realistic calculations of the physical properties and limiting factors for the terahertz photon Bose-condensate resonator. We show that our terahertz source can deliver the highly coherent light emission in the frequency range of 3-30 THz for the magnetic field induction of the order of 2 T, with the upper emission frequency limit adjustable by the strength of the magnetic field applied.

Title: Evidence of Dirac Quantum Spin Liquid in YbZn2GaO5
Authors: Rabindranath Bag, Sijie Xu, Nicholas E. Sherman, Lalit Yadav, Alexander I. Kolesnikov, Andrey A. Podlesnyak, Eun Sang Choi, Ivan da Silva, Joel E. Moore, Sara Haravifard
Abstract: The emergence of a quantum spin liquid (QSL), a state of matter that can result when electron spins are highly correlated but do not become ordered, has been the subject of a considerable body of research in condensed matter physics. Spin liquid states have been proposed as hosts for high-temperature superconductivity and can host topological properties with potential applications in quantum information science. The excitations of most quantum spin liquids are not conventional spin waves but rather quasiparticles known as spinons, whose existence is well established experimentally only in one-dimensional systems; the unambiguous experimental realization of QSL behavior in higher dimensions remains challenging. Here, we investigate the novel compound YbZn2GaO5, which hosts an ideal triangular lattice of effective spin-1/2 moments with no detectable inherent chemical disorder. Thermodynamic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements performed on high-quality single crystal samples of YbZn2GaO5 exclude the possibility of long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.06 K, demonstrate a quadratic power law for the specific heat and reveal a continuum of magnetic excitations in parts of the Brillouin zone. Both low-temperature thermodynamics and inelastic neutron scattering spectra suggest that YbZn2GaO5 is a U(1) Dirac QSL with spinon excitations concentrated at certain points in the Brillouin zone. We advanced these results by performing additional specific heat measurements under finite fields, further confirming the theoretical expectations for a Dirac QSL on the triangular lattice of YbZn2GaO5.

Title: Evolution of entanglement entropy at SU($N$) deconfined quantum critical points
Authors: Menghan Song, Jiarui Zhao, Meng Cheng, Cenke Xu, Michael M. Scherer, Lukas Janssen, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP between Néel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$ smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.

Authors: Valentin John, Francesco Borsoi, Zoltán György, Chien-An Wang, Gábor Széchenyi, Floor van Riggelen, William I. L. Lawrie, Nico W. Hendrickx, Amir Sammak, Giordano Scappucci, András Pályi, Menno Veldhorst
Abstract: Electrically driven spin resonance is a powerful technique for controlling semiconductor spin qubits. However, it faces challenges in qubit addressability and off-resonance driving in larger systems. We demonstrate coherent bichromatic Rabi control of quantum dot hole spin qubits, offering a spatially selective approach for large qubit arrays. By applying simultaneous microwave bursts to different gate electrodes, we observe multichromatic resonance lines and resonance anticrossings that are caused by the ac Stark shift. Our theoretical framework aligns with experimental data, highlighting interdot motion as the dominant mechanism for bichromatic driving.

Title: Slow dissipation and spreading in disordered classical systems: A direct comparison between numerics and mathematical bounds
Authors: Wojciech De Roeck, François Huveneers, Oskar A. Prośniak
Abstract: We study the breakdown of Anderson localization in the one-dimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon chain, a prototypical example of a disordered classical many-body system. A series of numerical works indicate that an initially localized wave packet spreads polynomially in time, while analytical studies rather suggest a much slower spreading. Here, we focus on the decorrelation time in equilibrium. On the one hand, we provide a mathematical theorem establishing that this time is larger than any inverse power law in the effective anharmonicity parameter $\lambda$, and on the other hand our numerics show that it follows a power law for a broad range of values of $\lambda$. This numerical behavior is fully consistent with the power law observed numerically in spreading experiments, and we conclude that the state-of-the-art numerics may well be unable to capture the long-time behavior of such classical disordered systems.

Title: Electron Interactions in Rashba Materials
Authors: Yasha Gindikin, Alex Kamenev
Abstract: We present a bunch of novel phenomena stemming from the pair spin-orbit interaction (PSOI), which does not rely on structure inversion asymmetry but instead arises from Coulomb fields of interacting electrons in materials with a strong Rashba effect. First, PSOI can induce $p-$wave superconducting order without the need for any mediators of attraction. Depending on the sign and strength of the PSOI coupling, two distinct superconducting phases emerge in 3D systems, analogous to the A and B phases observed in superfluid $^3\mathrm{He}$. In contrast, 2D systems exhibit $p^x\pm i p^y$ order parameter, leading to the time-reversal-invariant topological superconductivity. Second, a sufficiently strong PSOI can induce ferromagnetic ordering. It is associated with a deformation of the Fermi surface, which eventually leads to a Lifshitz transition from a spherical to a toroidal Fermi surface, with a number of experimentally observable signatures. Finally, in sufficiently clean Rashba materials, ferromagnetism and $p-$wave superconductivity may coexist. This state resembles the $\mathrm{A}_1$ phase of $^3\mathrm{He}$, yet it may avoid nodal points due to the toroidal shape of the Fermi surface.

Title: The Influence of Fractional Derivatives on Thermodynamic Properties by Studying the CPSEHP Interaction
Authors: M. Abu-Shady, Sh. Y. Ezz-Alarab
Abstract: The parametric Nikiforov-Uvarov (N-U) method is employed in conjunction with a generalized fractional derivative (GFD) to investigate the energy eigenvalues and the total normalized wave function associated with the Coulomb plus screened exponential hyperbolic potential (CPSEHP) in terms of Jacobi polynomials. This potential exhibits maximum effectiveness at lower values of the screening parameter. To explore the thermal and superstatistical characteristics, the derived energy eigenvalues are directly incorporated into the partition function (Z) and subsequently used to determine other thermodynamic quantities, including vibrational mean energy (U), specific heat capacity (C), entropy (S), and free energy (F). Comparisons with previous studies are conducted. The classical case is recovered from the fractional case by setting alpha = beta = 1, consistent with prior work. Our results demonstrate that the fractional parameter plays a crucial role in governing the thermal and superstatistical properties within the framework of this model.

Title: Derivation of an effective plate theory for parallelogram origami from bar and hinge elasticity
Authors: Hu Xu, Ian Tobasco, Paul Plucinsky
Abstract: Periodic origami patterns made with repeating unit cells of creases and panels bend and twist in complex ways. In principle, such soft modes of deformation admit a simplified asymptotic description in the limit of a large number of cells. Starting from a bar and hinge model for the elastic energy of a generic four parallelogram panel origami pattern, we derive a complete set of geometric compatibility conditions identifying the pattern's soft modes in this limit. The compatibility equations form a system of partial differential equations constraining the actuation of the origami's creases (a scalar angle field) and the relative rotations of its unit cells (a pair of skew tensor fields). We show that every solution of the compatibility equations is the limit of a sequence of soft modes -- origami deformations with finite bending energy and negligible stretching. Using these sequences, we derive a plate-like theory for parallelogram origami patterns with an explicit coarse-grained quadratic energy depending on the gradient of the crease-actuation and the relative rotations of the cells. Finally, we illustrate our theory in the context of two well-known origami designs: the Miura and Eggbox patterns. Though these patterns are distinguished in their anticlastic and synclastic bending responses, they show a universal twisting response. General soft modes captured by our theory involve a rich nonlinear interplay between actuation, bending and twisting, determined by the underlying crease geometry.

Title: Hund's Rule, Interorbital Hybridization, and High-$T_c$ Superconductivity in the Bilayer Nickelate

Abstract: Understanding the pairing mechanism in bilayer nickelate superconductors constitutes a fascinating quest. Using density matrix renormalization group for $T=0$ and thermal tensor networks for $T>0$ properties, along with density functional theory calculations, we investigate the intriguing interplay between the Hund's rule coupling and interorbital hybridization that explains the pressure-dependent high-$T_c$ superconductivity in bilayer nickelates. By studying a two-orbital model, we identify three distinct superconductive (SC) regimes: hybridization dominant, Hund's rule dominant, and the hybrid-Hund synergistic SC regimes. In these SC regimes, both $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit algebraic pairing correlations with similar Luttinger parameters $K_{\rm SC}$. In particular, the former always exhibits a much stronger amplitude than the latter, with a distinctly higher SC characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Below this temperature, the pairing susceptibility diverges as $\chi_{\rm SC}(T) \sim 1/T^{2-K_{\rm SC}}$. With realistic model parameters, we find the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ falls into the Hund's rule dominated SC regime. As hybridization further enhances under pressure, it leads to significant interorbital frustration and in turn suppresses the SC correlations, explaining the rise and fall of high-$T_c$ superconductivity under high pressure [J. Li, et al., arXiv:2404.11369 (2024)]. Our results offer a comprehensive understanding of the interlayer pairing in superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Analytical Model for Atomic Relaxation in Twisted Moir\'e Materials
Authors: Mohammed M. Al Ezzi, Gayani N. Pallewela, Christophe De Beule, E. J. Mele, Shaffique Adam
Abstract: By virtue of being atomically thin, the electronic properties of heterostructures built from two-dimensional materials are strongly influenced by atomic relaxation. The atomic layers behave as flexible membranes rather than rigid crystals. Here we develop an analytical theory of lattice relaxation in twisted moiré materials. We obtain analytical results for the lattice displacements and corresponding pseudo gauge fields, as a function of twist angle. We benchmark our results for twisted bilayer graphene and twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Our \textit{single-parameter} theory is valid in graphene bilayers for twist angles $\theta ~\gtrsim 0.7^\circ$, and in twisted WSe$_2$ for $\theta ~\gtrsim 1.6^\circ$. We also investigate how relaxation alters the electronic structure in twisted bilayer graphene, providing a simple extension to the continuum model to account for lattice relaxation.

Title: Quasicrystalline Spin Liquid
Authors: Sunghoon Kim, Mohammad Saad, Dan Mao, Adhip Agarwala, Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: The interplay of electronic interactions and frustration in crystalline systems leads to a panoply of correlated phases, including exotic Mott insulators with non-trivial patterns of entanglement. Disorder introduces additional quantum interference effects that can drive localization phenomena. Quasicrystals, which are neither disordered nor perfectly crystalline, are interesting playgrounds for studying the effects of interaction, frustration, and quantum interference. Here we consider a solvable example of a quantum spin liquid on a tri-coordinated quasicrystal. We extend Kitaev's original construction for the spin model to our quasicrystalline setting and perform a large scale flux-sampling to find the ground-state configuration in terms of the emergent majorana fermions and flux excitations. This reveals a fully gapped and time-reversal symmetric quantum spin liquid, regardless of the exchange anisotropies, accompanied by a tendency towards non-trivial (de-)localization at the edge and the bulk. The advent of moiré materials and a variety of quantum simulators provide a new platform to bring phases of quasicrystalline quantum matter to life in a controlled fashion.

Title: Direct Visualization of a Disorder Driven Electronic Smectic Phase in Dirac Nodal Line Semimetal GdSbTe
Authors: Balaji Venkatesan, Syu-You Guan, Jen-Te Chang, Shiang-Bin Chiu, Po-Yuan Yang, Chih-Chuan Su, Tay-Rong Chang, Kalaivanan Raju, Raman Sankar, Somboon Fongchaiya, Ming-Wen Chu, Chia-Seng Chang, Guoqing Chang, Hsin Lin, Adrian Del Maestro, Ying-Jer Kao, Tien-Ming Chuang
Abstract: Electronic liquid crystal (ELC) phases are spontaneous symmetry breaking states believed to arise from strong electron correlation in quantum materials such as cuprates and iron pnictides. Here, we report a direct observation of a smectic phase in a weakly correlated Dirac nodal line (DNL) semimetal GdSbxTe2-x. Incommensurate smectic charge modulation and intense local unidirectional nanostructure are visualized by using spectroscopic imaging - scanning tunneling microscopy. As topological materials with symmetry protected Dirac or Weyl fermions are mostly weakly correlated, the discovery of such an ELC phase are anomalous and raise questions on the origin of their emergence. Specifically, we demonstrate how chemical substitution generates these symmetry breaking phases before the system undergoes a charge density wave (CDW) - orthorhombic structural transition. Our results highlight the importance of impurities in realizing ELC phases and present a new material platform for exploring the interplay among quenched disorder, topology and electron correlation.

Title: Instantaneous Response and Quantum Geometry of Insulators
Authors: Nishchhal Verma, Raquel Queiroz
Abstract: We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum rules of electronic conductivity. It therefore enables a systematic framework for computing the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and dielectric constant. This construction guarantees a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in a low-energy description of an infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated flat bands.

Title: Automated Tabletop Exfoliation and Identification of Monolayer Graphene Flakes
Authors: Elijah D.S. Courtney, Mihir Pendharkar, Nathan J. Bittner, Aaron L. Sharpe, David Goldhaber-Gordon
Abstract: Over the past two decades, graphene has been intensively studied because of its remarkable mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. Initial studies were enabled by manual ``Scotch Tape'' exfoliation; nearly two decades later, this method is still widely used to obtain chemically-pristine flakes of graphene and other 2D van der Waals materials. Unfortunately, the yield of large, pristine flakes with uniform thickness is inconsistent. Thus, significant time and effort are required to exfoliate and locate flakes suitable for fabricating multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we describe a relatively affordable tabletop device (the ``eXfoliator'') that can reproducibly control key parameters and largely automate the exfoliation process. In a typical exfoliation run, the eXfoliator produces 3 or more large ($\ge400\ \mu$m$^2$) high-quality graphene monolayer flakes, allowing new users to produce such flakes at a rate comparable to manual exfoliation by an experienced user. We use an automated mapping system and a computer vision algorithm to locate candidate flakes. Our results provide a starting point for future research efforts to more precisely identify which parameters matter for the success of exfoliation, and to optimize them.

Title: Irreversibility as divergence from equilibrium
Authors: David Andrieux
Abstract: The entropy production is commonly interpreted as measuring the distance from equilibrium. However, this explanation lacks a rigorous description due to the absence of a natural equilibrium measure. The present analysis formalizes this interpretation by expressing the entropy production of a Markov system as a divergence with respect to particular equilibrium dynamics. These equilibrium dynamics correspond to the closest reversible systems in the information-theoretic sense. This result yields new lower bounds for the entropy production and novel links between thermodynamics and information geometry.

Title: Extended Metal-Insulator Crossover with Strong Antiferromagnetic Spin Correlation in Half-Filled 3D Hubbard Model
Authors: Yu-Feng Song, Youjin Deng, Yuan-Yao He
Abstract: The Hubbard model at temperatures above the Néel transition, despite being a paramagnet, can exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of Fermi surface, on-site interaction $U$ and thermal fluctuations. Nevertheless, the understanding of the crossover physics remains only at a qualitative level, because of the intrinsically smooth behavior. Employing an improved variant of the {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm equipped with numerical analytic continuation, we obtain a broad variety of thermodynamic and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional Hubbard model at half filling, quantitatively determine the crossover boundaries, and observe that the metal-insulator crossover regime, in which antiferromagnetic spin correlations appear strongest, exists over an extended regime in between the Fermi liquid for small $U$ and the Mott insulator for large $U$. In particular, the location of the most rapid suppression of double occupancy as $U$ increases, is found to fully reside in the metallic Fermi liquid regime, in contrast to the conventional intuition that it is a representative feature for entering the Mott insulator. Beside providing a reliable methodology for numerical study of crossover physics, our work can also serve as a timely and important guideline for the most recent optical lattice experiments.

Title: Optical and transport properties of NbN thin films revisited
Authors: Samuel Kern, Pavol Neilinger, Magdaléna Poláčková, Martin Baránek, Tomáš Plecenik, Tomáš Roch, Miroslav Grajcar
Abstract: Highly disordered NbN thin films exhibit promising superconducting and optical properties. Despite extensive study, discrepancies in its basic electronic properties persist. Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.

Title: Nonlinear response theory of molecular machines
Authors: Michalis Chatzittofi, Jaime Agudo-Canalejo, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: Chemical affinities are responsible for driving active matter systems out of equilibrium. At the nano-scale, molecular machines interact with the surrounding environment and are subjected to external forces. The mechano-chemical coupling which arises naturally in these systems reveals a complex interplay between chemical and mechanical degrees of freedom with strong impact on their active mechanism. By considering various models far from equilibrium, we show that the tuning of applied forces give rise to a nonlinear response that causes a non-monotonic behaviour in the machines' activity. Our findings have implications in understanding, designing, and triggering such processes by controlled application of external fields, including the collective dynamics of larger non-equilibrium systems where the total dissipation and performance might be affected by internal and inter-particle interactions.

Title: Generating Lattice Non-invertible Symmetries
Authors: Weiguang Cao, Linhao Li, Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: Lattice non-invertible symmetries have rich fusion structures and play important roles in understanding various exotic topological phases. In this paper, we explore methods to generate new lattice non-invertible transformations/symmetries from a given non-invertible seed transformation/symmetry. The new lattice non-invertible symmetry is constructed by composing the seed transformations on different sites or sandwiching a unitary transformation between the transformations on the same sites. In addition to known non-invertible symmetries with fusion algebras of Tambara-Yamagami $\mathbb Z_N\times\mathbb Z_N$ type, we obtain a new non-invertible symmetry in models with $\mathbb Z_N$ dipole symmetries. We name the latter the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry because it arises from gauging the dipole symmetry. We further study the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry in depth, including its topological defect, its anomaly and its associated generalized Kennedy-Tasaki transformation.

Title: Spinless topological chirality from Umklapp scattering in twisted 3D structures
Authors: Cong Chen, Xu-Tao Zeng, Wang Yao
Abstract: Spinless systems exhibit unique topological characteristics compared to spinful ones, stemming from their distinct algebra. Without chiral interactions typically linked to spin, an intriguing yet unexplored interplay between topological and structural chirality may be anticipated. Here we discover spinless topological chiralities solely from structural chiralities that lie in the 3D spatial patterning of structureless units, exemplified using two types of twisted graphite systems. In a 3D screw twisted structure without periodicity in all directions, we find a chiral Weyl semimetal phase where bulk topology and chiral surface states are both determined by the screw direction. And in a 3D periodic structure formed with layer-alternating twist angle signs, a higher-order Dirac semimetal with chiral hinge states is discovered. Underlying these novel topological states is the intervalley Umklapp scattering that captures the chirality of the twisted interfaces, leading effectively to a sign-flipped chiral interlayer hopping, thereby introducing $\pi$-flux Z2 lattice gauge field that alters the symmetry algebra. Our findings point to a new pathway for engineering topological chirality through patterning twisted arrays of featureless units, which can expand the design principles for topological photonics and acoustics.

Title: Landau Level Single-Electron Pumping
Authors: E. Pyurbeeva, M.D. Blumenthal, J.A. Mol, H. Howe, H. E. Beere, T. Mitchell, D. A. Ritchie, M. Pepper
Abstract: We present the first detailed study of the effect of a strong magnetic field on single-electron pumping in a device utilising a finger-gate split-gate configuration. In the quantum Hall regime, we demonstrate electron pumping from Landau levels in the leads, where the measurements exhibit pronounced oscillations in the lengths of the pumping plateaus with the magnetic field, reminiscent of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. This similarity indicates that the pumping process is dependent on the density of states of the 2D electron gas over a narrow energy window. Based on these observations, we develop a new theoretical description of the operation of single-electron pumps which for the first time allows for the determination of the physical parameters of the experiment; such as the capture energy of the electrons, the broadening of the quantised Landau levels in the leads, and the quantum lifetime of the electrons.

Title: Representing arbitrary ground states of toric code by a restricted Boltzmann machine
Authors: Penghua Chen, Bowen Yan, Shawn X. Cui
Abstract: We systematically analyze the representability of toric code ground states by Restricted Boltzmann Machine with only local connections between hidden and visible neurons. This analysis is pivotal for evaluating the model's capability to represent diverse ground states, thus enhancing our understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we modify the Restricted Boltzmann Machine to accommodate arbitrary ground states by introducing essential non-local connections efficiently. The new model is not only analytically solvable but also demonstrates efficient and accurate performance when solved using machine learning techniques. Then we generalize our the model from $Z_2$ to $Z_n$ toric code and discuss future directions.

Title: Coulomb drag by motion of a monolayer polar crystal through graphene nanoconstriction
Authors: A. L. Chudnovskiy
Abstract: We theoretically predict that the motion of a polar crystalline layer between two graphene planes exerts Coulomb drag on electrons in graphene, inducing a DC drag current. The physical mechanism underlying this drag arises from intervalley scattering of charge carriers in graphene caused by the time-dependent potential of the moving crystalline layer. This drag effect manifests above a finite threshold doping of the graphene layers, which is determined by the lattice structure and the relative orientation of the crystalline layer with respect to the graphene lattice. Additionally, the drag current exhibits a nonlinear Hall effect due to the interplay between the induced nonequilibrium pseudospin and the intrinsic pseudospin-orbit coupling in graphene. In turn, the drag exerted on electrons in graphene produces a backaction on the crystalline layer, which can be described as an increase in its dynamic viscosity.

Abstract: We perform readout of a quantum-dot hybrid qubit coupled to a superconducting resonator through a parametric, longitudinal interaction mechanism. Our experiments are performed with the qubit and resonator frequencies detuned by $\sim$10 GHz, demonstrating that longitudinal coupling can facilitate semiconductor qubit operation in the 'ultra-dispersive' regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics.

Title: Temperature mediated back-action in micro- and nanomechanical resonators
Authors: Ludovic Bellon, Pierre Verlot
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermally induced back-action effects in absorption-sensitive micro- and nanomechanical resonators. We propose a unified approach, enabling to simultaneously address both the effective dynamics and non-equilibrium phononic state, depending on the position of a punctual sensing (and heating) probe at the surface of the mechanical device. We present an analytical solution in terms of green functions for a unidimensional resonator whose thermomechanical deformation profile generally follows that of the mechanical losses. In particular, we find that both the dynamics and the mechanical fluctuations strongly depend on the loss distribution. The effect of the quantum fluctuations of the heat source is also discussed. Our approach provides the first steps towards a thorough, general platform for analyzing thermal back-action effects and their consequences, which may be of significance for future development in ultrasensitive nanomechanical research.

Title: Flat-band FFLO State from Quantum Geometric Discrepancy
Authors: Zi-Ting Sun, Ruo-Peng Yu, Shuai A. Chen, Jin-Xin Hu, K. T. Law
Abstract: We propose a new scheme for the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) Cooper pairing states within ultraflat bands. Central to our approach is the concept of "quantum geometric discrepancy" (QGD), which characterizes the discrepancy in the quantum geometry of paired electrons, giving rise to the flat-band FFLO instability. Remarkably, we find that this instability is directly related to a new quantum geometric quantity we term "anomalous quantum distance", which formally captures QGD. To model both QGD and the anomalous quantum distance, we examine a flat-band electronic Hamiltonian with tunable spin-dependent quantum metrics. Utilizing the band-projection method, we analyze the QGD-induced FFLO instability from pair susceptibility near the superconducting critical temperature. Furthermore, we perform self-consistent mean-field calculations to obtain the phase diagram of the BCS-FFLO transition driven by QGD, which aligns well with our analytical results. We emphasize that QGD serves as a distinctive protocol for stabilizing the flat-band FFLO phase.

Title: Topological phase transitions in perovskite superlattices driven by temperature, electric field, and doping
Authors: Jiyuan Yang, Shi Liu
Abstract: Many dipolar topological structures have been experimentally demonstrated in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices, such as flux-closure, vortice, and skyrmion. In this work, we employ deep potential molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the dynamical response of the (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice, supporting polar vortex arrays, to temperature and electric field at the atomic level. Our simulations reveal a unique phase transition sequence from ferroelectric-like to antiferroelectric-like to paraelectric in the in-plane direction as temperature increases. In the ferroelectric-like state, we observe field-driven reversible switching of in-plane polarization coupled with out-of-plane movements of vortex cores during MD simulations. In the antiferroelectric-like region, the polarization-electric field hysteresis loop exhibits a superparaelectric feature, showing nearly no loss. This behavior is attributed to a strong recovering force to form polar vortex arrays, dictated by the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions within the superlattice. The (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice in the antiferroelectric-like state also demonstrates large in-plane susceptibility and tunability. The effect of Pb doping in the SrTiO$_3$ layer on the topological structural transition in the superlattice is investigated. The weakened depolarization field in the PbTiO$_3$ layers leads to new dipolar configurations, such as enlarged skyrmion bubble within $c$ domains in (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$TiO$_3$)$_{10}$, and we quantify their thermal and electrical responses through MD simulations. These quantitative atomistic insights will be useful for the controlled optimization of perovskite superlattices for various device applications.

Title: Predicting topological invariants and unconventional superconducting pairing from density of states and machine learning
Authors: Flavio Noronha, Askery Canabarro, Rafael Chaves, Rodrigo G. Pereira
Abstract: Competition between magnetism and superconductivity can lead to unconventional and topological superconductivity. However, the experimental confirmation of the presence of Majorana edge states and unconventional pairing currently poses a major challenge. Here we consider a two-dimensional lattice model for a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling to randomly distributed magnetic impurities. Depending on parameters of the model, this system may display topologically trivial or nontrivial edge states. We map out the phase diagram by computing the Bott index, a topological invariant defined in real space. We then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the Bott index from the local density of states (LDOS) at zero energy, obtaining high-accuracy results. We also train ML models to predict the amplitude of odd-frequency pairing in the anomalous Green's function at zero energy. Once the ML models are trained using the LDOS, which is experimentally accessible via scanning tunneling spectroscopy, our method could be applied to predict the number of Majorana edge states and to estimate the magnitude of odd-frequency pairing in real materials.

Title: Spin-hydrodynamics of electrons in graphene and magnetization due to thermal vorticity
Authors: Amaresh Jaiswal
Abstract: We examine the framework of relativistic spin-hydrodynamics in the context of electron hydrodynamics in graphene. We develop a spin-hydrodynamic model for a (2 + 1)-dimensional system of fermions under the condition of small spin polarization. Our analysis confirms that thermal vorticity, which satisfies the global equilibrium condition, is also a solution to the spin-hydrodynamic equations. Additionally, we calculate the magnetization of the system in global equilibrium and introduce a novel phenomenon - thermovortical magnetization - resulting from thermal vorticity, which can be experimentally observed in graphene.

Title: Spatiotemporal Patterns in Active Four-State Potts Models
Authors: Hiroshi Noguchi
Abstract: Many types of spatiotemporal patterns have been observed under nonequilibrium conditions. Cycling through four or more states can provide specific dynamics, such as the spatial coexistence of multiple phases. However, transient dynamics have only been studied by previous theoretical models, since absorbing transition into a uniform phase covered by a single state occurs in the long-time limit. Here, we reported steady long-term dynamics using cyclic Potts models, wherein nucleation and growth play essential roles. Under the cyclic symmetry of the four states, the cyclic changes in the dominant phases and the spatial coexistence of the four phases are obtained at low and high flipping energies, respectively. Under asymmetric conditions, the spatial coexistence of two diagonal phases appears in addition to non-cyclic one-phase modes. The circular domains of the diagonal state are formed by the nucleation of other states, and they slowly shrink to reduce the domain boundary. When three-state cycling is added, competition between the two cycling modes changes the spatiotemporal patterns.

Title: Magnetically Tuned Metal-Insulator Transition in LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Nanowire Arrays
Authors: Ranjani Ramachandran, Shashank Anand, Kitae Eom, Kyoungjun Lee, Dengyu Yang, Muqing Yu, Sayanwita Biswas, Aditi Nethwewala, Chang-Beom Eom, Erica Carlson, Patrick Irvin, Jeremy Levy
Abstract: A wide family of two dimensional (2D) systems, including stripe-phase superconductors, sliding Luttinger liquids, and anisotropic 2D materials, can be modeled by an array of coupled one-dimensional (1D) electron channels or nanowire arrays. Here we report experiments in arrays of conducting nanowires with gate and field tunable interwire coupling, that are programmed at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. We find a magnetically-tuned metal-to-insulator transition in which the transverse resistance of the nanowire array increases by up to four orders of magnitude. To explain this behavior, we develop a minimal model of a coupled two-wire system which agrees well with observed phenomena. These nanowire arrays can serve as a model systems to understand the origin of exotic behavior in correlated materials via analog quantum simulation.

Title: Single-Particle Universality of the Many-Body Spectral Form Factor
Authors: Michael O. Flynn, Lev Vidmar, Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda
Abstract: We consider systems of fermions evolved by non-interacting unitary circuits with correlated on-site potentials. When these potentials are drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular random matrix ensemble, the single-particle sector exhibits chaotic dynamics. We study the corresponding many-body spectral statistics and show that the spectral form factor (SFF) can be computed \textit{exactly}. Due to the absence of interactions the SFF grows exponentially in time, a result which we demonstrate through simple arguments, scaling collapses, and closed-form evaluation of the SFF. We study the role of interactions by numerically analyzing a kicked Ising model and find that the SFF crosses over to a linear growth regime consistent with many-body random matrix universality. Our exact results for the SFF provide a baseline for future studies of the crossover between single-particle and many-body random matrix behavior.

Title: Exact spectral form factors of non-interacting fermions with Dyson statistics
Authors: Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda, Lev Vidmar, Michael O. Flynn
Abstract: The spectral form factor (SFF) is a powerful diagnostic of random matrix behavior in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a family of random circuit ensembles whose SFFs can be computed \textit{exactly}. These ensembles describe the evolution of non-interacting fermions in the presence of correlated on-site potentials drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular ensemble. For disorder parameters drawn from the circular unitary ensemble (CUE), we derive an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for any choice of system size $L$ and integer time $t$. When the disorder is drawn from the circular orthogonal or symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively), we carry out the disorder averages analytically and reduce the computation of the SFF at integer times to a combinatorial problem amenable to transfer matrix methods. In each of these cases the SFF grows exponentially in time, which we argue is a signature of random matrix universality at the single-particle level. Finally, we develop matchgate circuit representations of our circuit ensembles, enabling their experimental realization in quantum simulators.

Title: Surface Furrowing Instability in Everting Soft Solids
Authors: Jonghyun Hwang, Mariana Altomare, Howard A. Stone
Abstract: We report a surface instability observed during the extrusion of extremely soft elastic solids in confined geometries. Due to their unique rheological properties, these soft solids can migrate through narrow gaps by continuously everting the bulk material. The extrusion front spontaneously buckles in the direction transverse to the flow, resulting in a furrow-like morphology that deepens over time. We characterize the distinct features of this instability using experiments and theory and contrast the results with known elastic surface instabilities. Our study may provide insights into various processes involving the extrusion-like deformations of soft solids, including biomaterials.

Title: Tuning electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ by stacking two layers
Authors: Dylan Shearsby, Jiaqi Wu, Dekun Yang, Bo Peng
Abstract: Benefiting from improved stability due to stronger interlayer van der Waals interactions, few-layer fullerene networks are experimentally more accessible compared to monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. However, there is a lack of systematic theoretical studies on the material properties of few-layer C$_{60}$ networks. Here, we compare the structural, electronic and optical properties of bilayer and monolayer fullerene networks. The band gap and band-edge positions remain mostly unchanged after stacking two layers into a bilayer, enabling the bilayer to be almost as efficient a photocatalyst as the monolayer. The effective mass ratio along different directions is varied for conduction band states due to interlayer interactions,leading to enhanced anisotropy in carrier transport. Additionally, stronger exciton absorption is found in the bilayer than that in the monolayer over the entire visible light range, rendering the bilayer a more promising candidate for photovoltaics. Moreoever, the polarisation dependence of optical absorption in the bilayer is increased in the red-yellow light range, offering unique opportunities in photonics and display technologies with tailored optical properties over specific directions. Our study provides strategies to tune electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ via the introduction of stacking degrees of freedom.

Title: Chiral phonons of honeycomb-type bilayer Wigner crystals
Authors: Dingrui Yang, Lingyi Li, Na Zhang, Hongyi Yu
Abstract: We theoretically investigated the chiral phonons of honeycomb-type bilayer Wigner crystals recently discovered in van der Waals structures of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. These chiral phonons can emerge under the inversion symmetry breaking introduced by an effective mass imbalance between the two layers or a moiré potential in one layer, as well as under the time-reversal symmetry breaking realized by applying a magnetic field. Considering the wide tunability of layered materials, the frequencies and chirality values of phonons can both be tuned by varying the system parameters. These findings suggest that bilayer honeycomb-type Wigner crystals can serve as an exciting new platform for studying chiral phonons.

Title: Evidence of orbital Hall current induced correlation in second harmonic response of longitudinal and transverse voltage in light metal-ferromagnet bilayers
Authors: Dhananjaya Mahapatra, Abu Bakkar Miah, HareKrishna Bhunia, Soumik Aon, Partha Mitra
Abstract: We investigate the effect of orbital current arising from orbital Hall effect in thin films of Nb and Ti in ohmic contact with ferromagnetic Ni in the second harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltages in response to an a.c. current applied to the bilayer structures. Our experiments were analogous to those on Heavy Metal-Ferromagnet bilayers and we extract the Orbital Hall Torque efficiency and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR). Through second-harmonic measurements, we investigate orbital Hall torque and UMR in bilayer devices composed of ferromagnetic materials (FM), such as Ni and NiFe, paired with light metals (LM), such as Ti and Nb. Our results demonstrate that LM/Ni bilayers exhibit enhanced damping-like torque and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) compared to LM/NiFe bilayers. This enhancement suggests that angular momentum is generated via the orbital Hall effect within the light metal, where it undergoes orbital-to-spin conversion within the Ni ferromagnet, ultimately transferring to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. Torque and UMR are also absent in single-layer devices, highlighting the necessity of the bilayer structure for orbital current generation.

Title: Temperature dependent spin dynamics in La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$/Pt bilayers
Authors: Biswajit Sahoo, Akilan K, Katherine Matthews, Alexandre Pofelski, Alex Frano, Eric E Fullerton, Sebastien Petit-Watelot, Juan-Carlos Rojas Sanchez, Sarmistha Das
Abstract: Complex ferromagnetic oxides such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) offer pathways for creating energy efficient spintronic devices with new functionalities. LSMO exhibits high-temperature ferromagnetism, half metallicity, sharp resonance linewidth, low damping and a large anisotropic magnetoresistance response. Combined with Pt, a proven material with high spin-charge conversion efficiency, LSMO can be used to create robust nano-oscillators for neuromorphic computing. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and device level spin-pumping FMR measurements are performed to investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin transport in NdGaO3(110)/LSMO(15 nm)/Pt(0 and 5 nm) thin films ranging from 300K to 90K and compare the device performance with Py(7 nm)/Pt(5 nm) sample. The spin current pumped into Pt is quantified to determine the temperature dependent influence of interfacial interactions. The generated spin current in the micro-device is maximum at 170K for the optimally grown LSMO/Pt films. Additionally, this bilayer system exhibits low magnetic Gilbert damping (0.002), small linewidth (12 Oe) and a large spin Hall angle ($\approx$ 3.2%) at 170K. By fine-tuning the LSMO/Pt interface quality and integrating it into the device structure, the system exhibits a fourfold enhancement in signal output for LSMO/Pt devices compared to the Pt/Py system. Such robust device level performance can pave way for energy-efficient spintronic based devices.

Title: Itinerant Ferromagnetism from One-Dimensional Mobility
Authors: Kyung-Su Kim, Veit Elser
Abstract: We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- a metallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-site Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional (1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped electron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two examples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic phase.

Title: On the construction of explicit analytical driving forces for crack nucleation in the phase field approach to brittle fracture with application to Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager strength surfaces
Authors: Chockalingam Senthilnathan
Abstract: A series of recent papers have modified the classical variational phase-field fracture models to successfully predict both the nucleation and propagation of cracks in brittle fracture under general loading conditions. This is done through the introduction of a consistent crack nucleation driving force in the phase field governing equations, which results in the model being able to capture both the strength surface and fracture toughness of the material. This driving force has been presented in the literature for the case of Drucker-Prager strength surface and specific choice of stress states on the strength surface that are captured exactly for finite values of the phase field regularization length parameter $\varepsilon$. Here we present an explicit analytical expression for this driving force given a general material strength surface when the functional form of the strength locus is linear in the material parameter coefficients. In the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$, the formulation reproduces the exact material strength surface and for finite $\varepsilon$ the strength surface is captured at any n 'distinct' points on the strength surface where n is the minimum number of material coefficients required to describe it. The presentation of the driving force in the current work facilitates the easy demonstration of its consistent nature. Further, in the equation governing crack nucleation, the toughness in the classical models is shown to be replaced by an effective toughness in the modified theory, that is dependent on the stress. The derived analytical expressions are verified via application to the widely employed Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager strength surfaces.

Title: Revisiting Endo-reversible Carnot engine: Extending the Yvon engine
Authors: Xiu-Hua Zhao, Yu-Han Ma
Abstract: A famous paper [Am. J. Phys. 43, 22 (1975)] unveiled the efficiency at maximum power (EMP) of the endo-reversible Carnot heat engine, now commonly referred to as the Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) engine, pioneering finite-time thermodynamics. Historically, despite the significance of the CA engine, similar findings had emerged at an earlier time, such as the Yvon engine proposed by J. Yvon in 1955 sharing the exact same EMP. However, the special setup of the Yvon engine has circumscribed its broader influence. This paper extends the Yvon engine model to achieve a level of generality comparable to that of the CA engine. A rigorous comparison reveals that the extended Yvon engine and CA engine represent the steady-state and cyclic forms of the endo-reversible Carnot heat engine, respectively, and are equivalent. Our work provides a pedagogical example for the teaching of thermodynamics and engineering thermodynamics, given that the simple and lucid derivation of the extended Yvon engine helps students initiate their understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

Title: Active matter as the underpinning agency for extraordinary sensitivity of biological membranes to electric fields
Authors: Anand Mathew, Yashashree Kulkarni
Abstract: Interaction of electric fields with biological cells is indispensable for many physiological processes. Thermal electrical noise in the cellular environment has long been considered as the minimum threshold for detection of electrical signals by cells. However, there is compelling experimental evidence that the minimum electric field sensed by certain cells and organisms is many orders of magnitude weaker than the thermal electrical noise limit estimated purely under equilibrium considerations. We resolve this discrepancy by proposing a non-equilibrium statistical mechanics model for active electromechanical membranes and hypothesize the role of activity in modulating the minimum electrical field that can be detected by a biological membrane. Active membranes contain proteins that use external energy sources to carry out specific functions and drive the membrane away from equilibrium. The central idea behind our model is that active mechanisms, attributed to different sources, endow the membrane with the ability to sense and respond to electric fields that are deemed undetectable based on equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our model for active membranes is capable of reproducing different experimental data available in the literature by varying the activity. Elucidating how active matter can modulate the sensitivity of cells to electric signals can open avenues for a deeper understanding of physiological and pathological processes.

Title: Heavy Hole vs. Light Hole Spin Qubits: A Strain-Driven Study of SiGe/Ge and GeSn/Ge
Authors: Kelvin Dsouza, Patrick Del Vecchio, Nicolas Rotaru, Oussama Moutanabbir, Daryoosh Vashaee
Abstract: This work investigates and compares the impact of strain on heavy hole (HH) spin qubits in SiGe/Ge and light hole (LH) spin qubits in GeSn/Ge heterostructures, focusing on energy states, g-factor, Rabi frequency, spin relaxation, and dephasing times. By exploring the distinct properties of HH and LH spin qubits under strain, we demonstrate how strain serves as a tunable parameter to optimize qubit performance. The study highlights that LH spin qubits in Ge quantum dots exhibit lower relaxation rates and higher Rabi frequencies, offering significant advantages for addressing current challenges in gate-defined spin qubits. A significant difference is observed in the g-factor anisotropy, where for HHs the out-of-plane g-factor is larger than the in-plane g-factor, whereas for LHs, the in-plane g-factor dominates both in GeSn/Ge and SiGe/Ge quantum dots. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of HH and LH spin dynamics, advancing the development of scalable quantum technologies based on strained Ge systems.

Title: Robust altermagnetism and compensated ferrimagnetism in MnPX$_3$-based (X = S or Se) heterostructures
Authors: Yunsong Liu, Yanlong Liu, Xuefei Wang, Nan Xia, Guifang Xu, Yi Wang, Haifeng Wang, Weiwei Gao, Jijun Zhao
Abstract: The recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the exploration of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of materials with intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic orders and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a Néel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures. For the AB-stacking heterostructures that are semiconducting, ferrimagnetic-type spin splitting emerges, and the fully compensated magnetization is protected by the Luttinger theorem. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP$_2$S$_6$, MnPX$_3$-based heterostructures can show tunable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on the electronic band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional magnets.

Title: PyAtoms: An interactive tool for rapidly simulating atomic scanning tunneling microscopy images of 2D materials, moir\'e systems and superlattices
Authors: Christopher Gutiérrez, Asari G. Prado
Abstract: We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that quickly and easily simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moiré systems, and superlattices. Rooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for tuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist angles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides time estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users to efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of PyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and then demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with variable sub-lattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moiré systems, and charge- and bond-density wave systems (2$H$-NbSe$_2$, 1$T$-TaS$_2$, Kekulé-distorted graphene, K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$). Finally, we show that PyAtoms can be used as a useful educational tool in entry- and senior-level physics courses.

Title: Advancing Surface Chemistry with Large-Scale Ab-Initio Quantum Many-Body Simulations
Authors: Zigeng Huang, Zhen Guo, Changsu Cao, Hung Q. Pham, Xuelan Wen, George H. Booth, Ji Chen, Dingshun Lv
Abstract: Predictive simulation of surface chemistry is of paramount importance for progress in fields from catalysis to electrochemistry and clean energy generation. Ab-initio quantum many-body methods should be offering deep insights into these systems at the electronic level, but are limited in their efficacy by their steep computational cost. In this work, we build upon state-of-the-art correlated wavefunctions to reliably converge to the `gold standard' accuracy in quantum chemistry for application to extended surface chemistry. Efficiently harnessing graphics processing unit acceleration along with systematically improvable multiscale resolution techniques, we achieve linear computational scaling up to 392 atoms in size. These large-scale simulations demonstrate the importance of converging to these extended system sizes, achieving a validating handshake between simulations with different boundary conditions for the interaction of water on a graphene surface. We provide a new benchmark for this water-graphene interaction that clarifies the preference for water orientations at the graphene interface. This is extended to the adsorption of carbonaceous molecules on chemically complex surfaces, including metal oxides and metal-organic frameworks, where we consistently achieve chemical accuracy compared to experimental references, and well inside the scatter of traditional density functional material modeling approaches. This pushes the state of the art for simulation of molecular adsorption on surfaces, and marks progress into a post-density functional era for more reliable and improvable approaches to first-principles modeling of surface problems at an unprecedented scale and accuracy using ab-initio quantum many-body methods.

Title: Discovery of an Ultra-Stable Antiferromagnetic Two-Dimensional CrF3 Phase with Anisotropic Quasi-1D Mechanical, Electronic, and Thermal Properties
Authors: Xin Chen, Fengyi Zhou, Yan Suo, Cheng Shao, Xu Cheng, Duo Wang, Biplab Sanyal
Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.

Title: The balance between paraelectricity and ferroelectricity in non-chiral smectic homologs
Authors: Dorota Węgłowska, Michał Czerwiński, Robert Dzienisiewicz, Paweł Perkowski, Jadwiga Szydłowska, Damian Pociecha, Mateusz Mrukiewicz
Abstract: Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.

Title: Response of superfluid fermions at finite temperature
Authors: Sumit Bhattacharjee, Elena Litvinova
Abstract: A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete $4\times 4$ block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. The least correlated static kernel reproduces the known finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation, while the dynamical kernel was previously largely unknown in the finite-temperature superfluid theory. The major focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is completed and advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem with keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex as well as the components of the dynamical kernel acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.

Title: Wear and corrosion properties of Mg(OH)$_2$ compound layer formed on magnesium alloy in superheated water vapor
Authors: Tianxiang Peng, Liang Wang
Abstract: The wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys is very poor due to their inherent low hardness and poor tribological properties. Improving the wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys plays a significant role in expanding their application range. Various surface treatments have been used to produce protective coatings or layers for solving this problem. In this work, the Mg(OH)$_2$ layer with a thickness about 25 microns was directly formed on AZ91 magnesium alloy by oxidizing in superheated water vapor. SEM and XRD were employed to characterize the microstructure and phase composition of oxidized layer. The effect of oxidized layer on the friction and wear properties of magnesium alloy against the bearing steel ball were evaluated by using a reciprocating friction and wear test apparatus. The results showed that layer exhibited low friction coefficients and extremely small wear loss compared to the untreated substrate. Keywords: Magnesium alloy; Mg(OH)$_2$ layer; superheated water vapor; wear resistance.

Title: First-principles Spin and Optical Properties of Vacancy Clusters in Lithium Fluoride
Authors: Mariano Guerrero Perez, Keegan Walkup, Jordan Chapman, Pranshu Bhaumik, Giti A. Khodaparast, Brenden A. Magill, Patrick Huber, Vsevolod Ivanov
Abstract: Vacancy-cluster color centers in lithium fluoride have been studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally for over a century, giving rise to various applications in solid-state lasers, broadband photonic devices, and radiation dosimeters. These color centers are also attractive candidate platforms for applications in quantum information science, due to their spin properties and strong coupling to the crystal lattice, which allows their properties to be easily tuned. Here we present hybrid functional calculations of common vacancy defects in lithium fluoride, including their energetic, spin, and optical properties. We show that for a wide range of hybrid functional parameters tuned to match the experimental band gap, certain defects have little variation in their predicted optical properties. We further demonstrate that the parameters needed to satisfy the generalized Koopman's theorem and correctly position defect levels within the gap, can vary dramatically, even for different charge states of the same defect. Our work establishes the accuracy of the computationally lightweight hybrid-functional approach for predicting the optical and energetic properties of color centers in polar materials.

Title: Connecting NTK and NNGP: A Unified Theoretical Framework for Wide Neural Network Learning Dynamics
Authors: Yehonatan Avidan, Qianyi Li, Haim Sompolinsky
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, but a complete theoretical framework for their learning process is still lacking. Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits.

Title: Quantum theory of molecular orientations: topological classification, complete entanglement, and fault-tolerant encodings
Authors: Victor V. Albert, Eric Kubischta, Mikhail Lemeshko, Lee R. Liu
Abstract: We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, we reproduce a molecule's admissible angular momentum states known from spectroscopy, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how the state space of a molecular species is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify molecular species whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed.

Title: Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction
Authors: Jiaxiang Xu, Jiangke Tao, Bin Chen
Abstract: Although the power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) are pivotal in the conversion of ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work occurring in various biological processes, the precise sequence of these two events remains a subject of heated debate due to the involved tiny spatiotemporal scale. Here, we take a different path and choose to investigate how Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the power stroke affects muscle contraction in silico. Utilizing a mechanics model developed for the structural unit of muscle that systematically integrates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosins, we find that relatively slow Pi-release can markedly improve energy efficiency during muscle contraction. Our model's predictions are largely consistent with experimental data and our analysis suggests that a gradual Pi-release may offer a route to finely adjust the stability of a working myosin on the actin filament, thereby indirectly modulating the power stroke to influence muscle performance. We believe that this work can provide important insights into the kinetics and the function of Pi-release in the regulation of forces and motions generated by myosins for cellular processes.

Title: Universal Upper Bound on Ergotropy and No-Go Theorem by the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis
Authors: Akihiro Hokkyo, Masahito Ueda
Abstract: We show that the maximum extractable work (ergotropy) from a quantum many-body system is constrained by local athermality of an initial state and local entropy decrease brought about by quantum operations. The obtained universal upper bound on ergotropy implies that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis prohibits work extraction from energy eigenstates by means of finite-time unitary operations. This no-go property implies that Planck's principle, a form of the second law of thermodynamics, holds even for pure quantum states. Our result bridges two independently studied concepts of quantum thermodynamics, the second law and thermalization, via intrasystem correlations in many-body systems as a resource for work extraction.

Title: Quantum inverse scattering for the 20-vertex model up to Dynkin automorphism: crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, weak integrability
Authors: Pete Rigas
Abstract: We initiate a novel application of the quantum-inverse scattering method for the 20-vertex model, building upon seminal work from Faddeev and Takhtajan on the study of Hamiltonian systems, with applications to crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, and integrability. In comparison to a previous work of the author in late $2023$ which characterized integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the 6-vertex model from integrability of inhomogeneous limit shapes, formalized in a work of Keating, Reshetikhin and Sridhar, notions similar to those of integrability can be realized for the 20-vertex model by studying new classes of higher-dimensional L-operators. In comparison to two-dimensional L-operators expressed in terms of Pauli basis elements, three-dimensional L-operators provided by Boos and colleagues have algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric, qualities, all of which impact leading order approximations of correlations, products of L-operators, the transfer matrix, and the quantum monodromy matrix in finite volume. In comparison to the inhomogeneous 6-vertex model, the 20-vertex model does not enjoy as strong of an integrability property through the existence of suitable action-angle variables, which is of interest to further explore, possibly from information on limit shapes given solutions to the three-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations.

Title: Electrically pumped h-BN single-photon emission in van der Waals heterostructure
Authors: Mihyang Yu, Jeonghan Lee, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jieun Lee
Abstract: Atomic defects in solids offer a versatile basis to study and realize quantum phenomena and information science in various integrated systems. All-electrical pumping of single defects to create quantum light emission has been realized in several platforms including color centers in diamond and silicon carbide, which could lead to the circuit network of electrically triggered single-photon sources. However, a wide conduction channel which reduces the carrier injection per defect site has been a major obstacle. Here, we realize a device concept to construct electrically pumped single-photon emission using a van der Waals stacked structure with atomic plane precision. Defect-induced tunneling currents across graphene and NbSe2 electrodes sandwiching an atomically thin h-BN layer allow robust and persistent generation of non-classical light from h-BN. The collected emission photon energies range between 1.4 and 2.9 eV, revealing the electrical excitation of a variety of atomic defects. By analyzing the dipole axis of observed emitters, we further confirm that emitters are crystallographic defect structures of h-BN crystal. Our work facilitates implementing efficient and miniaturized single-photon devices in van der Waals platforms toward applications in quantum optoelectronics.

Title: Higher-order triadic percolation on random hypergraphs
Authors: Hanlin Sun, Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework combining percolation theory with nonlinear dynamics in order to study hypergraphs with a time-varying giant component. We consider in particular hypergraphs with higher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the hyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory interaction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit synaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may not only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also between regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to higher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction networks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here we propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs showing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this percolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component, undergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In hierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order to treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the non-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical phenomena and the dynamical properties of the process. Finally, we consider other generalizations of the model studying the effect of considering interdependencies and node regulation instead of hyperedge regulation.

Title: Fast and scalable finite-element based approach for density functional theory calculations using projector-augmented wave method
Authors: Kartick Ramakrishnan, Sambit Das, Phani Motamarri
Abstract: In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology that utilizes a local real-space formulation of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method discretized with a finite-element (FE) basis to enable accurate and large-scale electronic structure calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-space approach for DFT calculations, combining the efficiency of PAW formalism involving smooth electronic fields with the ability of systematically improvable higher-order finite-element basis to achieve significant computational gains. In particular, we have developed efficient strategies for solving the underlying FE discretized PAW generalized eigenproblem by employing the Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration approach to compute the desired eigenspace in each self-consistent field iteration. These strategies leverage the low-rank perturbation of the FE basis overlap matrix in conjunction with reduced order quadrature rules to invert the discretized PAW overlap matrix while also exploiting the sparsity of both the local and non-local parts of the discretized PAW Hamiltonian and overlap matrices. Using the proposed approach, we benchmark the accuracy and performance on various representative examples involving periodic and non-periodic systems with plane-wave-based PAW implementations. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a considerable computational advantage ($\sim$ 5$\times$ -- 10$\times$) over state-of-the-art plane-wave methods for medium to large-scale systems ($\sim$ 6,000 -- 35,000 electrons). Finally, we show that our approach (PAW-FE) significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to achieve the desired accuracy, thereby enabling large-scale DFT simulations ($>$ 50,000 electrons) at an order of magnitude lower computational cost compared to norm-conserving pseudopotential calculations using finite-element discretized calculations.

Title: Algebraic classification of Hietarinta's solutions of Yang-Baxter equations~:~invertible $4\times 4$ operators
Authors: Somnath Maity, Vivek Kumar Singh, Pramod Padmanabhan, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: In order to examine the simulation of integrable quantum systems using quantum computers, it is crucial to first classify Yang-Baxter operators. Hietarinta was among the first to classify constant Yang-Baxter solutions for a two-dimensional local Hilbert space (qubit representation). Including the one produced by the permutation operator, he was able to construct eleven families of invertible solutions. These techniques are effective for 4 by 4 solutions, but they become difficult to use for representations with more dimensions. To get over this limitation, we use algebraic ansätze to generate the constant Yang-Baxter solutions in a representation independent way. We employ four distinct algebraic structures that, depending on the qubit representation, replicate 10 of the 11 Hietarinta families. Among the techniques are partition algebras, Clifford algebras, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and a collection of commuting operators. Using these techniques, we do not obtain the $(2,2)$ Hietarinta class.

Title: Flexible framework of computing binding free energy using the energy representation theory of solution
Authors: Kazuya Okita, Yusei Maruyama, Kento Kasahara, Nobuyuki Matubayasi
Abstract: Host-guest binding plays a crucial role in the functionality of various systems, and its efficiency is often quantified using the binding free energy, which represents the free-energy difference between the bound and dissociated states. Here, we propose a methodology to compute the binding free energy based on the energy representation (ER) theory of solution that enables us to evaluate the free-energy difference between the systems of interest with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Unlike the other free-energy methods, such as the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR), the ER theory does not require the MD simulations for hypothetical intermediate states connecting the systems of interest, leading to reduced computational costs. By constructing the thermodynamic cycle of the binding process that is suitable for the ER theory, a robust calculation of the binding free energy is realized. We apply the present method to the self-association of \textit{N}-methylacetamide (NMA) in different solvents and the binding of aspirin to $\beta$-cyclodextrin (CD) in water. In the former case, the present method estimates that the binding free energy decreases as the solvent polarity decreases. This trend is consistent with the experimental finding. For the latter system, the binding free energies for the two representative CD-aspirin bound complexes, primary (P) and secondary (S) complexes, are estimated to be $-5.2\pm 0.1$ and $-5.03\pm 0.09~\mathrm{kcalmol^{-1}}$, respectively. These values are satisfactorily close to those from the BAR method [$-4.2\pm 0.2$ and $-4.1\pm 0.2\mathrm{kcal~mol^{-1}}$ for P and S, respectively]. Furthermore, the interaction-energy component analysis reveals that the van der Waals interaction between aspirin and CD dominantly contributes to the stabilization of the bound complexes, that is in harmony with the well-known binding mechanism in the CD systems.

Title: Macroscopic stress, couple stress and flux tensors derived through energetic equivalence from microscopic continuous and discrete heterogeneous finite representative volumes
Authors: Jan Eliáš, Gianluca Cusatis
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous derivation of equations to evaluate the macroscopic stress tensor, the couple stress tensor, and the flux vector equivalent to underlying microscopic fields in continuous and discrete heterogeneous systems with independent displacements and rotations. Contrary to the classical asymptotic expansion homogenization, finite size representative volume is considered. First, the macroscopic quantities are derived for a heterogeneous Cosserat continuum. The resulting continuum equations are discretized to provide macroscopic quantities in discrete heterogeneous systems. Finally, the expressions for discrete system are derived once again, this time considering the discrete nature directly. The formulations are presented in two variants, considering either internal or external forces, couples, and fluxes. The derivation is based on the virtual work equivalence and elucidates the fundamental significance of the couple stress tensor in the context of balance equations and admissible virtual deformation modes. Notably, an additional term in the couple stress tensor formula emerges, explaining its dependence on the reference system and position of the macroscopic point. The resulting equations are verified by comparing their predictions with known analytical solutions and results of other numerical models under both steady state and transient conditions.

Title: Enhancing Dynamic Range of Sub-Quantum-Limit Measurements via Quantum Deamplification
Authors: Qi Liu, Ming Xue, Xinwei Li, Denis V. Vasilyev, Ling-Na Wu, Vladan Vuletić
Abstract: Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large dynamic range is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends dynamic range at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of dynamic range is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.

Title: Robust phase correction techniques for terahertz time-domain reflection spectroscopy
Authors: Kasturie D. Jatkar, Tien-Tien Yeh, Matteo Pancaldi, Stefano Bonetti
Abstract: We introduce a systematic approach that enables two robust methods for performing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in reflection geometry. Using the Kramers-Kronig relations in connection to accurate experimental measurements of the amplitude of the terahertz electric field, we show how the correct phase of the same field can be retrieved, even in the case of partly misaligned measurements. Our technique allows to accurately estimate the optical properties of in principle any material that reflects terahertz radiation. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach by extracting the complex refractive index of InSb, a material with a strong plasma resonance in the low-terahertz range. Our technique applies to arbitrary incidence angles and polarization states.

Title: Quantum tunneling and its absence in deep wells and strong magnetic fields
Authors: Charles L. Fefferman, Jacob Shapiro, Michael I. Weinstein
Abstract: We present new results on quantum tunneling between deep potential wells, in the presence of a strong constant magnetic field. We construct a family of double well potentials containing examples for which the low-energy eigenvalue splitting vanishes, and hence quantum tunneling is eliminated. Further, by deforming within this family, the magnetic ground state can be made to transition from symmetric to anti-symmetric. However, for typical double wells in a certain regime, tunneling is not suppressed, and we provide a lower bound for the eigenvalue splitting.
