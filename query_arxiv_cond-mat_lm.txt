Title: Novel Experimental Platform to realize One-dimensional Quantum Fluids
Authors: Stephanie McNamara, Prabin Parajuli, Sutirtha Paul, Garfield Warren, Adrian Del Maestro, Paul E. Sokol
Abstract: Templated porous materials, such as MCM-41, due to the uniformity of their onedimensional structure and scalability in synthesis, have emerged as an attractive medium for studying one-dimensional quantum fluids. However, the experimental challenge of synthesizing these materials with pore radii smaller than 15 Angstroms hinders the realization of a one-dimensional quantum liquid of helium within such systems, as the coherence length of helium is shorter than the pore radius. Recently, DelMaestro et. al. have preplated MCM-41 with Ar resulting in a reduction of the pore size and a softening of the adsorption potential allowing them to observe 1D Tomanga-Luttinger liquid like behavior. In this paper we present a novel method to obtain an even more ideal environment for studying the behavior of 1D 4He. We propose preplating MCM-41 pores with cesium (Cs) metal. The non-wetting nature of helium on a Cs-coated surface, coupled with the large atomic radius of cesium, creates an optimal environment for confining a quantum liquid of helium in one-dimensional geometry. We present preliminary measurements of adsorption isotherms and Small Angle X-ray Scattering studies that 1reveal a reduction in pore radius upon preplating MCM-41 with Cs, demonstrating promising prospects for facilitating the realization of one-dimensional quantum fluids in templated porous materials.

Title: Tensor Renormalization Group Meets Computer Assistance
Authors: Nikolay Ebel, Tom Kennedy, Slava Rychkov
Abstract: Tensor renormalization group, originally devised as a numerical technique, is emerging as a rigorous analytical framework for studying lattice models in statistical physics. Here we introduce a new renormalization map - the 2x1 map - which coarse-grains the lattice anisotropically by a factor of two in one direction followed by a 90-degree rotation. We develop a novel graphical language that translates the action of the 2x1 map into a system of inequalities on tensor components, with rigorous estimates in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. We define a finite-dimensional "bounding box" called the hat-tensor, and a master function governing its RG flow. Iterating this function numerically, we establish convergence to the high-temperature fixed point for tensors lying within a quantifiable neighborhood. Our main theorem shows that tensors with deviations bounded by 0.02 in 63 orthogonal sectors flow to the fixed point. We also apply the method to specific models - the 2D Ising and XY models - obtaining explicit bounds on their high-temperature phase. This work brings the Tensor RG program closer towards a rigorous, computer-assisted construction of critical fixed points.

Title: Phonon-Mediated Intrinsic Topological Superconductivity in Fermi Arcs
Authors: Kristian Mæland, Masoud Bahari, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: We propose that phonons can mediate topological superconductivity on the surface of Weyl semimetals. Weyl semimetals are gapless topological materials with nondegenerate zero energy surface states known as Fermi arcs. We derive the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling in an effective model of a Weyl semimetal and apply weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. In a slab geometry, we demonstrate that surface superconductivity dominates over bulk superconductivity in a wide range of chemical potentials. The superconducting gap function realizes spinless chiral $p$-wave superconductivity in the Fermi arcs, leading to Majorana bound states in the core of vortices. Furthermore, we show a suppression of the absolute value of the gap in the center of the arc, which is not captured by a local Hubbard attraction. The suppression is due to the nonlocal origin of electron-phonon coupling, leading to a layer dependence which has important consequences for topological surface states.

Title: Control of intervalley scattering in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ via temperature-dependent band renormalization
Authors: A. Jabed, F. Goto, B. Frimpong, D. Armanno, A. Longa, M. Michiardi, A. Damascelli, P. Hofmann, G. Jargot, H. Ibrahim, F. Légaré, N. Gauthier, S. Beaulieu, F. Boschini
Abstract: The control of out-of-equilibrium electron dynamics in topological insulators is essential to unlock their potential in next-generation quantum technologies. However, the role of temperature on the renormalization of the electronic band structure and, consequently, on electron scattering processes is still elusive. Here, using high-resolution time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES), we show that even a modest ($\sim$15 meV) renormalization of the conduction band of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ can critically affect bulk and surface electron scattering processes. Supported by a kinetic Monte Carlo toy-model, we show that temperature-induced changes in the bulk band structure modulate the intervalley electron-phonon scattering rate, reshaping the out-of-equilibrium response. This work establishes temperature as an effective control knob for engineering scattering pathways in topological insulators.

Title: Altermagnetic polarons
Authors: Maria Daghofer, Krzysztof Wohlfeld, Jeroen van den Brink
Abstract: While a spin-dependent band splitting is one of the characteristic features of altermagnets, the conventional band picture itself breaks down in the many altermagnets that are correlated Mott materials. We employ two numerical many-body methods, the self-consistent Born approximation and variational cluster approach, to explore this strongly correlated regime and investigate hole motion in Mott altermagnets. Our results reveal that spin-dependent spectral-weight transfer is the dominant signature of Mott altermagnetism. This pronounced spin-momentum locking of the quasiparticle spectral weight arises from the formation of altermagnetic polarons, whose dynamics are governed by the interplay between free hole motion and the coupling of the hole to magnon excitations in the altermagnet. We demonstrate this effect by calculating ARPES spectra for two canonical altermagnetic systems: the checkerboard $J$-$J'$ model and the Kugel-Khomskii spin-orbital altermagnet based on cubic vanadates $R$VO$_3$ ($R$=La, Pr, Nd, Y).

Title: Spin-glass state in nickelate superconductors
Authors: David R. Saykin, Martin Gonzalez, Jennifer Fowlie, Steven A. Kivelson, Harold Hwang, Aharon Kapitulnik
Abstract: Magneto-optical measurements in La${}_{0.8}$Sr${}_{0.2}$NiO${}_2$ and Nd${}_{0.825}$Sr${}_{0.175}$NiO${}_2$ reveal an intriguing new facet of infinite-layer nickelate superconductors: the onset of spin-glass behavior at a temperature far exceeding the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$. This discovery sharply contrasts with copper oxide superconductors, where magnetism and superconductivity remain largely exclusive. Moreover, the magnitude and onset temperature of the polar Kerr effect in Nd${}_{0.825}$Sr${}_{0.175}$NiO${}_2$ fabricated on SrTiO${}_3$ and (LaAlO${}_3$)${}_{0.3}$(Sr${}_2$TaAlO${}_6$)${}_{0.7}$ substrates differ dramatically, while $T_c$ does not.

Title: Theory of Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy of Altermagnetic Mott Insulators
Authors: Lorenzo Lanzini, Purnendu Das, Michael Knap
Abstract: Altermagnetism has emerged as an unconventional form of collinear magnetism with spatial rotational symmetries, that give rise to strongly spin-split bands despite of an underlying fully-compensated antiferromagnetic order. Here, we develop a theory for the Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) response of altermagnetic Mott insulators. Crucially, the spectrum does not simply reflect the non-interacting band structure, but instead a magnetic polaron is formed at low energies, that can be interpreted as a spinon-holon bound state. We develop a spinon-holon parton theory and predict a renormalized bandwidth that we confirm by tensor network simulations. We analyze the characteristic spin-split spectrum and identify a spin-dependent spectral weight of the magnetic polaron, resulting from the altermagnetic symmetry. Our work paves the way for a systematic study of doping effects and correlation phenomena in altermagnetic Mott insulators.

Abstract: The increasing demand for energy-efficient hardware for artificial intelligence (AI) and data centres requires integrated photonic solutions delivering optical transceivers with Tbit/s data rates and energy consumption$<$1pJ/bit. Here, we report double single-layer graphene electro-absorption modulators on Si optimized for energy-efficient and ultra-fast operation, demonstrating 67GHz bandwidth and 80Gbit/s data rate, in both O and C bands, using a fabrication tailored for wafer-scale integration. We measure a data rate$\sim$1.6 times larger than previously reported for graphene. We scale the modulator's active area down to 22$\mu$m$^2$, achieving a dynamic power consumption$\sim$58fJ/bit, $\sim$3 times lower than previous graphene modulators and Mach-Zehnder modulators based on Si or lithium niobate. We show devices with$\sim$0.037dB/V$\mu$m modulation efficiency,$\sim$16 times better than previous demonstrations based on graphene. This paves the way to wafer-scale production of graphene modulators on Si useful for Tbit/s optical transceivers and energy-efficient AI

Title: Nanoconfinement Effects on Intermolecular Forces Observed via Dewetting
Authors: Tara (Tera)Huang, Evon S. Petek, Reika Katsumata
Abstract: Although wettability is a macroscopic manifestation of molecular-level forces, such as van der Waals (vdW) forces, the impact of nanoconfinement on material properties in reduced film thickness remains unexplored in predicting film stability. In this work, we investigate how nanoconfinement influences intermolecular interactions using a model trilayer system composed of a thick polystyrene (PS) base, a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) middle layer with tunable thickness (15-95 nm), and a 10 nm top PS film. We find that the dewetting behavior of the top PS layer is highly sensitive to middle PMMA thickness, deviating from classical vdW-based predictions that assume bulk material properties. By incorporating nanoconfinement-induced changes in PMMA refractive index into the calculation of the Hamaker constant, we present a modified theoretical framework that successfully captures the observed behavior. This study links dewetting behavior and material property change as a function of underlayer thickness, providing direct evidence that nanoconfinement in soft matter systems significantly influences long-range intermolecular interactions. We show that film stability can be tuned solely by adjusting underlying layer thickness, while preserving both chemistry and thickness of top functional film. This finding carries broad implications for thin-film technologies across scientific and engineering disciplines by enabling performance-targeted interface design.

Title: Itinerant versus localized magnetism in spin gapped metallic half-Heusler compounds: Stoner criterion and magnetic interactions
Authors: E. Sasıoglu, W. Beida, S. Ghosh, M. Tas, B. Sanyal, S. Lounis, S. Blugel, I. Mertig, I. Galanakis
Abstract: Spin gapped metals have recently emerged as promising candidates for spintronic and nanoelectronic applications, enabling functionalities such as sub-60mV/dec switching, negative differential resistance, and non-local spin-valve effects in field-effect transistors. Realizing these functionalities, however, requires a deeper understanding of their magnetic behavior, which is governed by a subtle interplay between localized and itinerant magnetism. This interplay is particularly complex in spin gapped metallic half-Heusler compounds, whose magnetic properties remain largely unexplored despite previous studies of their electronic structure. In this work, we systematically investigate the magnetic behavior of spin gapped metallic half-Heusler compounds XYZ (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt; Y = Ti, V, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta; Z = In, Sn, Sb), revealing clear trends. Co- and Ni-based compounds predominantly exhibit itinerant magnetism, whereas Ti-, V-, and Fe-based systems may host localized moments, itinerant moments, or a coexistence of both. To uncover the origin of magnetism, we apply the Stoner model, with the Stoner parameter I estimated from Coulomb interaction parameters (Hubbard U and Hund's exchange J) computed using the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). Our analysis shows that compounds not satisfying the Stoner criterion tend to remain non-magnetic. On the contrary compounds, which satisfy the Stoner criterion, generally exhibit magnetic ordering highlighting the crucial role of electronic correlations and band structure effects in the emergence of magnetism. For compounds with magnetic ground states, we compute Heisenberg exchange parameters, estimate Curie temperatures (T_C), and analyze spin-wave properties, including magnon dispersions and stiffness constants.

Title: Efficient implementation of the quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ method on GPU
Authors: Masao Obata, Takao Kotani, Tatsuki Oda
Abstract: We have developed a multi-GPU version of the quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ (QSGW), a cutting-edge method for describing electronic excitations in a first-principles approach. While the QSGW calculation algorithm is inherently well-suited for GPU computation due to its reliance on large-scale tensor operations, achieving a maintainable and extensible implementation is not straightforward. Addressing this, we have developed a GPU version within the \texttt{ecalj} package, utilizing module-based programming style in modern Fortran. This design facilitates future development and code sustainability. Following the summary of the QSGW formalism, we present our GPU implementation approach and the results of benchmark calculations for two types of systems to demonstrate the capability of our GPU-supported QSGW calculations.

Title: Explicit Symplectic Integrators for Massive Point Vortex Dynamics in Binary Mixture of Bose--Einstein Condensates
Authors: Tomoki Ohsawa
Abstract: We construct explicit integrators for massive point vortex dynamics in binary mixture of Bose--Einstein condensates proposed by Richaud et al. The integrators are symplectic and preserve the angular momentum of the system exactly. Our main focus is the small-mass regime in which the minor component of the binary mixture comprises a very small fraction of the total mass. The solution behaviors in this regime change significantly depending on the initial momenta: they are highly oscillatory unless the momenta satisfy certain conditions. The standard Runge--Kutta method performs very poorly in preserving the Hamiltonian showing a significant drift in the long run, especially for highly oscillatory solutions. On the other hand, our integrators nearly preserve the Hamiltonian without drifts. We also give an estimate of the error in the Hamiltonian by finding an asymptotic expansion of the modified Hamiltonian for our 2nd-order integrator.

Title: Only the Ambidextrous Can Flock: Two-dimensional Chiral Malthusian Flocks, Time crystals, and the KPZ Equation
Authors: Leiming Chen, Chiu Fan Lee, John Toner
Abstract: We study two-dimensional chiral dry Malthusian flocks; that is, chiral polar-ordered active matter with neither number nor momentum conservation. In the absence of fluctuations, these form a "time crystal", in which the velocity rotates uniformly at a fixed frequency. Fluctuations are described by the (2+1)-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which implies short-ranged orientational order. For weak chirality, the system is in the linear regime of the KPZ equation for a wide range of length scales, over which it exhibits quasi-long-ranged orientational order. Our predictions for velocity and density correlations are testable in both simulations and experiments.

Title: Propylenidene: A New Carbon Two-dimensional Material Featuring Tilted Dirac Cones
Authors: Jose A. S. Laranjeira, K. A. L. Lima, Nicolas F. Martins, Luis A. Cabral, L.A. Ribeiro Junior, Julio R. Sambrano
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have drawn significant interest owing to their impressive physical and chemical characteristics. Following graphene's isolation, a wide range of 2D carbon materials has been suggested, each with distinct electronic, mechanical, and optical traits. Rational design and synthesis of new 2D carbon structures hinge on experimentally reported precursors. Here, we present a 2D carbon allotrope, propylenidene (PPD), originating from the highly strained bicyclopropylidene precursor. PPD forms a rectangular lattice with 3, 8, and 10-membered carbon rings. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations investigate its structural, electronic, mechanical, and optical properties. Our study shows PPD is semi-metallic, featuring three tilted Dirac cones at the Fermi level. PPD exhibits absorption in the infrared and visible range, showing directional dependence in its response. Mechanically, PPD exhibits marked anisotropy; Young's modulus ($Y$) of 219.71 N/m in one direction and 106.16 N/m in the opposite, with an anisotropy ratio of 2.07. The shear modulus ($G$) ranges from 65.38 N/m to 32.39 N/m, yielding an anisotropy ratio of 2.02, reflecting strong directional dependence. These findings underscore the potential of this novel monolayer in applications such as energy storage, gas sensing, and optoelectronics.

Title: High-pressure Induced Phase Transition and Laser Characterization Response of MAPbBr3 Thin Films
Authors: Xin Tang, Ruilin Li, Shuaiqi Li, Dingke Zhang
Abstract: The high-pressure behavior of 3D metal halide chalcogenides (MHPs) has been widely studied. In the field of high-pressure technology, the studies on 3D MHPs have focused on the structural and optical properties, where the optical properties are mainly investigated on the photoluminescence behavior, while the laser properties of the materials have not been studied yet. In this paper, MAPbBr3-MAAc films with ionic liquid methylammonium acetate (MAAc) as solvent and conventional MAPbBr3-DMF:DMSO films with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvents were prepared using solvent engineering method. In-situ pressurization testing of both materials using a small-cavity hydrostatic high-pressure device (DAC) was used to investigate the high-pressure optical behavior of the MAPbBr3 films, especially the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties, which, combined with high-pressure in-situ Raman, revealed that the changes in the optical properties of the films under pressure are due to the changes in the crystal structure of the materials. This paper also emphasizes that the optical properties and phase structure stability of MAPbBr3-MAAc films are superior to those of MAPbBr3-DMF:DMSO films under high pressure.

Title: Stable supersolids and boselets in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with three-body interactions
Authors: Rajamanickam Ravisankar, Sanu Kumar Gangwar, Henrique Fabrelli, Yongping Zhang, Paulsamy Muruganandam, Pankaj Kumar Mishra, Emmanuel Kengne, Gao Xianlong, Boris A. Malomed
Abstract: We explore the stability of supersolid striped waves, plane-wave boselets, and other extended states in one-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with repulsive three-body interactions (R3BIs), modeled by quintic terms in the framework of the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii equations. In the absence of R3BIs, the extended states are susceptible to the modulational instability (MI) induced by the cubic attractive nonlinearity. Using the linearized Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations, we identify multiple new types of MI, including baseband, passband, mixedband, and zero-wavenumber-gain ones, which give rise to deterministic rogue waves and complex nonlinear wave patterns. Our analysis reveals that R3BIs eliminate baseband and zero-wavenumber-gain MIs, forming, instead, phonon modes that enable stable boselets. Additionally, mixedband and passband MIs are suppressed, which results in a lattice-like phonon-roton mode that supports a stable supersolid phase. These stable supersolids can be realized using currently available ultracold experimental setup.

Title: Multiband superconductivity in the topological Kramers nodal-line semimetals
Authors: Tian Shang, Jianzhou Zhao, Keqi Xia, Lun-Hui Hu, Yang Xu, Qingfeng Zhan, Dariusz Jakub Gawryluk, Toni Shiroka
Abstract: Recent band-structure calculations predict that the ruthenium-based ternary silicides are three-dimensional Kramers nodal line semimetals. Among them, NbRuSi and TaRuSi show bulk superconductivity (SC) below $T_c \sim 3$ K and 4 K, as well as spontaneous magnetic fields. The latter indicates the breaking of time-reversal symmetry and, thus, unconventional SC in both compounds. Previous temperature-dependent muon-spin spectroscopy studies failed to distinguish whether such compounds exhibit single-gap or multi-gap SC. Here, we report on systematic measurements of the field-dependent muon-spin relaxation rates in the superconducting state and on temperature-dependent electrical resistivity and specific heat under applied magnetic fields. Both the upper critical field and the field-dependent superconducting relaxation are well described by a two-band model. By combining our experimental results with numerical band-structure calculations, we provide solid evidence for multiband SC in NbRuSi and TaRuSi, and thus offer further insight into the unconventional- and topological nature of their superconductivity.

Title: Three-Majorana Cotunneling Interferometer for Non-Abelian Braiding and Topological Quantum Gate Implementation
Authors: Zhen Chen, Yijia Wu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.

Title: Enhanced and modulable induced superconducting gap and effective Landé g-factor in Pb-InSb hybrid devices
Authors: Guoan Li, Xiaofan Shi, Ziwei Dou, Guang Yang, Jiayu Shi, Marco Rossi, Ghada Badawy, Yuxiao Song, Ruixuan Zhang, Yupeng Li, Zhiyuan Zhang, Anqi Wang, Xingchen Guo, Xiao Deng, Bingbing Tong, Peiling Li, Zhaozheng Lyu, Guangtong Liu, Fanming Qu, Erik P. A. M. Bakkers, Michał P. Nowak, Paweł Wójcik, Li Lu, Jie Shen
Abstract: The hybrid system of a conventional superconductor (SC) on a semiconductor (SM) nanowire with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) represents a promising platform for achieving topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) towards topological quantum computation. While aluminum (Al)-based hybrid nanowire devices have been widely utilized, their limited superconducting gap and intrinsic weak SOC as well as small Landé g-factor may hinder future experimental advancements. In contrast, we demonstrate that lead (Pb)-based hybrid quantum devices exhibit a remarkably large and hard proximity-induced superconducting gap, exceeding that of Al by an order of magnitude. By exploiting electrostatic gating to modulate wavefunction distribution and SC-SM interfacial coupling, this gap can be continuously tuned from its maximum value (~1.4 meV, matching the bulk Pb gap) down to nearly zero while maintaining the hardness. Furthermore, magnetic-field-dependent measurements reveal a radial evolution of the gap structure with anti-crossing feature, indicative of strong SOC and huge effective g-factors up to 76. These findings underscore the superior functionality of Pb-based hybrid systems, significantly advancing their potential for realizing and stabilizing MZMs and the further scalable topological quantum architectures.

Title: The isostructural alpha-gamma phase transition in cerium from the perspective of meta-generalized gradient approximations
Authors: Ashesh Giri, Chandra Shahi, Adrienn Ruzsinszky
Abstract: Meta-generalized gradient approximations (meta-GGAs) on the third rung of the functional hierarchy are gaining increasing relevance for the electronic structure. Meta-GGAs are constructed from numerous ingredients including the orbital kinetic energy density that make them more flexible than generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) including the heavily used PBE-GGA. Still, most meta-GGAs cope with the expected limitations of a semilocal density functional when band gaps or localization of electrons are needed. On the other hand, meta-GGAs are implicit functionals of the orbitals. This feature resembles hybrid density functionals with exact exchange. Efforts in recent years demonstrate that some meta-GGAs can rise beyond the accuracy of semilocal approximation when band gaps are computed. Cerium is an ideal testbed to challenge some recent meta-GGAs. Cerium shows an isostructural alpha - gamma phase transition with delocalized and localized f electrons in each phase, respectively. Since the phonon entropy term was found negligible in the alpha - gamma phase transition of cerium by accurate experiments, all changes in the transition are driven by electronic correlation. The correlation of f electron systems is hardly captured by semilocal approximations but the recent LAK meta-GGA with ultranonlocality steps out of the framework of conventional semilocal density functionals and delivers spectacular accuracy for the phase transition of cerium. LAK and further meta-GGAs inspired by the success of LAK can open a forefront of meta-GGAs for quantum materials with localized electrons.

Title: Gefitinib-Induced Interface Engineering Enhances the Defect Formation Energy for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells
Authors: Xianhu Wu, Guanglei Cui, Jieyu Bi, Gaojie Xia, Zewen Zuo, Min Gu
Abstract: Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely used as a hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the high interface defect density and energy level mismatch between PEDOT:PSS and perovskite can lead to significant open-circuit voltage loss. Additionally, the free PSS chains on the surface of PEDOT:PSS can absorb water molecules, promoting the degradation of perovskite at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface. Here, gefitinib is used to modify the surface of PEDOT:PSS, removing a portion of the free PSS chains from the surface, reducing the PSS/PEDOT ratio, and enhancing the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Gefitinib has altered the energy level structure of PEDOT:PSS, facilitating hole transport at the interface. The Cl, F, and NH groups in gefitinib also passivated defects in the perovskite, reducing the defect density at the interface and significantly enhancing the stability of PSCs. This modification increased the open-circuit voltage from 1.077 to 1.110 V and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 17.01% to 19.63%. When gefitinib was used to modify the interface between SnO2 and perovskite, the PCE of PSCs (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMETAD/Au) increased from 22.46% to 23.89%. This approach provides new perspectives and strategies for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs.

Title: One dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with long range hopping
Authors: Edmond Orignac
Abstract: Interacting one-dimensional bosons with long range hopping decaying as a power law $r^{-\alpha}$ with distance $r$ are considered with the renormalization group and the self-consistent harmonic approximation. For $\alpha\ge 3$, the ground state is always a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, whereas for $\alpha <3$, a ground state with long range order breaking the continuous global gauge symmetry becomes possible for sufficiently weak repulsion. At positive temperature, continuous symmetry breaking becomes restricted to $\alpha<2$, and for $2<\alpha<3$, a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with the Tomonaga-Luttinger exponent diverging at low temperature is found.

Title: Edge polaritons at metal-insulator boundaries in a phase separated correlated oxide
Authors: Weiwei Luo, Adrien Bercher, Claribel Dominguez, Javier del Valle, Jeremie Teyssier, Javier Taboada-Gutierrez, Alexey B. Kuzmenko
Abstract: Correlated transition metal oxides, such as cuprates, nickelates, and manganites, are typically considered "bad metals", where high electromagnetic losses suppress the conventional plasmonic effects observed in noble metals, 2D electron gases, and graphene. Nevertheless, using mid-infrared near-field optical nanoscopy, we demonstrate the emergence of strongly confined and long-propagating edge polaritons (EPs) of mixed phonon-plasmon nature at the boundaries between conducting and insulating regions in thin NdNiO$_{3}$ films, fingerprinted as a pronounced peak of the near-field signal phase. Our simulations reveal that the electromagnetic nature of the EPs depends significantly on the edge smoothness, being caused by a one-dimensional optical edge state (ES) at abrupt edges while being governed by the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) absorption in the case of broad boundaries. Our findings highlight the critical role of nonlocal plasmonic effects in near-field imaging of phase-separated correlated oxides and open new avenues for infrared plasmonics in this family of materials.

Title: Critical transport behavior in quantum dot solids
Authors: Zachary Crawford, Adam Goga, Mikael Kovtun, Gergely Zimanyi
Abstract: Due to recent advances, silicon solar cells are rapidly approaching the Shockley-Queisser limit of 33% efficiency. Quantum Dot (QD) solar cells have the potential to surpass this limit and enable a new generation of photovoltaic technologies beyond the capabilities of any existing solar energy modalities. The creation of the first epitaxially-fused quantum dot solids showing broad phase coherence and metallicity necessary for solar implementation has not yet been achieved, and the metal-insulator transition in these materials needs to be explored. We have created a new model of electron transport through QD solids, informed by 3D-tomography of QD solid samples, which considers disorder in both the on-site and hopping terms of the commonly studied Anderson Hamiltonian. We used the transfer matrix method and finite-size scaling to create a dynamic metal-insulator transition phase diagram. For a surprisingly large portion of the parameter space, our model shows a critical exponent distinct from the expected value for the Anderson transition. We show the existence of a crossover region from the universality class of the Anderson transition (AI) to the Chiral Orthogonal class (BDI) due to the addition of weak kinetic (hopping) disorder.

Title: Dynamic formation of supersolid phase in a mixture of ultracold bosonic and fermionic atoms
Authors: Maciej Lewkowicz, Tomasz Karpiuk, Mariusz Gajda, Mirosław Brewczyk
Abstract: We numerically study the dynamical properties of a mixture consisting of a dipolar condensate and a degenerate Fermi gas in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. In particular, we focus on the system's response to a temporal variation in the interaction strength between bosons and fermions. When the interspecies attraction becomes sufficiently strong, we observe a phase transition to a supersolid state. This conclusion is supported by the emergence of an out-of-phase Goldstone mode in the excitation spectrum.

Title: Physics-Based Compact Modeling for the Drain Current Variability in Single-Layer Graphene FETs
Authors: N. Mavredakis, A. Pacheco-Sanchez, R. Garcia Cortadella, Anton-Guimerà-Brunet, J. A. Garrido, D. Jiménez
Abstract: For the growth of emerging graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) technologies, a thorough characterization of on-wafer variability is required. Here, we report for the first time a physics-based compact model, which precisely describes the drain current (ID) fluctuations of monolayer GFETs. Physical mechanisms known to generate 1/f noise in transistors, such as carrier number and Coulomb scattering mobility fluctuations, are also revealed to cause ID variance. Such effects are considered in the model by being activated locally in the channel and the integration of their contributions from source to drain results in total variance. The proposed model is experimentally validated from a statistical population of three different-sized solution-gated (SG) GFETs from strong p- to strong n-type bias conditions. A series resistance ID variance model is also derived mainly contributing at high carrier densities.

Title: Ultrafast switching of photoinduced phonon chirality in the antiferrochiral BPO$_{4}$ crystal
Authors: Hao Chen, Hanyu Wang, Tingting Wang, Yongsen Tang, Haoshu Li, Xiaohong Yan, Lifa Zhang
Abstract: In crystalline systems, chiral crystals cannot interconvert to their enantiomorph post-synthesis without undergoing melting-recrystallization processes. However, recent work indicates that ultrafast terahertz-polarized light has been shown to enable dynamic control of structural chirality in the antiferrochiral boron phosphate (BPO$_4$) crystal. Here, using first-principles calculations and nonlinear phonon dynamics simulations, we investigate the underlying physics of lattice dynamics in this system. The results demonstrate that polarized optical pumping not only induces chiral phonons but also establishes a chirality-selective filtering mechanism, both of which can be reversibly switched by tuning the polarization of the excitation pulse. Furthermore, under a temperature gradient, the pump-induced chiral phonons give rise to ultrafast phonon magnetization, with its direction also controllable via light polarization. Our findings establish a new paradigm for ultrafast optical control of phonon chirality via dynamic chirality switching, offering promising opportunities for chiral information transfer and the design of chiral phononic devices.

Title: Magic of nonlocal geometric force: lighting up optical transition and transporting angular momentum by chiral phonons
Authors: Hao Chen, Haoshu Li, Lifa Zhang, Qian Niu
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the nonlocal geometric force -- arising from the molecular Berry curvature -- on the lattice dynamics of magnetic materials with broken time-reversal symmetry. A first-principles computational framework is established to evaluate this force across the entire Brillouin zone. We apply it to monolayer CoCl$_2$, a ferromagnetic half-semiconductor with a narrow bandgap forbidding direct dipolar optical transition. At the phonon Brillouin zone center, the pronounced nonlocal geometric force leads to a splitting of the two upper optical phonon branches by $3 \times 10^{-2}$ THz, transforming the phonons into chiral modes. Optical chiral phonons can light up the intravalley dark exciton via absorpting circularly polarized photons. Furthermore, acoustic chiral phonons induced by the nonlocal geometric force can transport angular momentum and contribute to a non-dissipative phonon Hall viscosity.

Title: Efficient and standardized interface energy calculations in hybrid heterostructures using fictitious atoms surface passivation
Authors: Sreejith Pallikkara Chandrasekharan, Sofia Apergi, Charles Cornet, Laurent Pedesseau
Abstract: Heterostructures combining diverse physico-chemical properties are increasingly in demand for a wide range of applications in modern science and technology. However, despite their importance in materials science, accurately determining absolute interface energies remains a major challenge. This difficulty arises from periodic boundary conditions, high computational costs of plane-wave methods, multipolar interactions in heterostructures, the need for thick slabs for interface convergence, and reconstructed surfaces on both slab faces. Here, we introduce a standardized and computationally efficient fictitious H* charge passivation method for the surface termination, designed to accurately determine absolute interface energies in heterogeneous materials associations. This approach effectively addresses issues associated with surface reconstructions while significantly reducing computational costs within the framework of density functional theory. To demonstrate its reliability, we calculate the absolute interface energies for various quasi-lattice-matched and lattice-mismatched abrupt III-V/Si interfaces using the H* passivation technique and benchmark the results against those obtained using conventional reconstructed surface methods. We further explore the early stages of strained epitaxial GaAs on Si(001). Finally, we assess the fictitious H* passivation method, showing its effectiveness in minimizing electric dipole errors, reducing computational costs, and thus decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from high-performance computing. Finally, the potential of the approach to compute interface energies across a broad spectrum of materials is emphasized.

Title: Spin waves in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ studied by high-frequency/high-field ESR: Successes and failures of the triple-$\mathbf{q}$ model
Authors: Luca Bischof, Jan Arneth, Raju Kalaivanan, Raman Sankar, Kwang-Yong Choi, Rüdiger Klingeler
Abstract: The Kitaev candidate material Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ is proposed to be proximate to a quantum spin liquid state but a suitable spin model and the nature of its ground states are still under debate. Our high-frequency/high-field electron spin resonance spectroscopy studies of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ single-crystals under in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields elucidate the ground state by investigating its low-energy spin wave excitations. Several excitation modes are observed in the low-field phase and in the phases induced by $B\parallel a^*$. In addition, the spectra exhibit a frequency-independent feature at the phase boundary connected to the putative quantum phase transition. For magnetic fields applied along the $c$ axis, the observation of three distinct spin wave modes in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state reveals a previously unresolved splitting of the zero-field excitation gap into $\Delta = 211\,$GHz and $\Delta_2 = 237\,$GHz. The softening of one of these modes evidences a field-induced phase transition at $B_{\rm c1} = 4.7\,$T, which is corroborated by a clear anomaly in the isothermal magnetization. Spin wave calculations based on the extended Heisenberg-Kitaev model exclude a zigzag ground state of the AFM phase. A triple-q spin configuration correctly predicts two spin wave modes, but fails to reproduce the softening mode. Our analysis shows that the triple-q ground state model of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ is incomplete and suggests the relevance of interlayer interactions.

Title: Scanning gate microscopy probing of anisotropic electron flow in a two dimensional electron gas at the (110) $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ interface
Authors: M. P. Nowak, M. Zegrodnik, D. Grzelec, B. Szafran, R. Citro, P. Wójcik
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the anisotropic dispersion features of a two dimensional electron gas at the (110) oriented $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ interfaces, as revealed by scanning gate microscopy of electronic flow from a quantum point contact. The dispersion relation of the (110) $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ interface is characterized by a highly non-circular Fermi surface. Here, we develop an efficient tight-binding model for the electron gas at the interface. We show that the anisotropy of the Fermi surface causes both the direction of the electron flux from the quantum point contact and the periodicity of the self-interference conductance fringes to depend strongly on the orientation of the constriction relative to the crystal lattice. We show that the radially non-uniform distribution of the Fermi velocity on the Fermi surface results in skewing of electron trajectories when the quantum point contact gates are not aligned with the in-plane primitive vectors. We show that this effect results in the separation of electrons belonging to different orbitals for wide (110) $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ quantum wells.

Title: Phase stabilization and phase tuning of an optical lattice with a variable period

Abstract: Optical lattices play a significant role in the field of cold atom physics, particularly in quantum simulations. Varying the lattice period is often a useful feature, but it presents the challenge of maintaining lattice phase stability in both stationary and varying-period regimes. Here, we report the realization of a feedback loop for a tunable optical lattice. Our scheme employs a CCD camera, a computer, and a piezoelectric actuator mounted on a mirror. Using this setup, we significantly improved the long-term stability of an optical lattice over durations exceeding 10 seconds. More importantly, we demonstrated a rapid change in the optical lattice period without any loss of phase.

Title: Non-invasive measurement of local stress inside soft materials with programmed shear waves
Authors: Zhaoyi Zhang, Guo-Yang Li, Yuxuan Jiang, Yang Zheng, Artur L. Gower, Michel Destrade, Yanping Cao
Abstract: Mechanical stresses in soft materials across different length scales play a fundamental role in understanding the function of biological systems and in the use of artificial materials for engineering soft machines and biomedical devices. Yet it remains a great challenge to probe local mechanical stresses in situ in a non-invasive, non-destructive manner, in particular when the mechanical properties are unknown. To address this challenge, we propose an acoustoelastic imaging-based method to infer the local mechanical stresses in soft materials by measuring the speed of shear waves induced by custom-programmed acoustic radiation force. Using a medical ultrasound transducer to excite and track the shear waves remotely, we demonstrate the application of the method by imaging uniaxial stress and bending stress in an isotropic hydrogel, and the passive uniaxial stress in a skeletal muscle. These measurements were all done without the knowledge of the constitutive parameters of the materials. These examples indicate that our method will find broad applications, ranging from health monitoring of soft structures and machines, to the diagnosis of diseases that alter stresses in soft tissues.

Title: Understanding Flow Behaviors of Supercooled Liquids by Embodying Solid-Liquid Duality at Particle Level
Authors: Dong-Xu Yu, Ke-Qi Zeng, Zhe Wang
Abstract: Supercooled liquids exhibit intricate flow behaviors, which progressively become nonlinear as flow rate increases. Conceptually, this complexity can be understood by the solid-liquid duality in Maxwell's understanding of materials' response to external load. Nevertheless, the microscopic foundation of this duality in supercooled liquids remains elusive, thereby impeding the modeling of flow behaviors from a microscopic viewpoint. The existence of dynamic heterogeneity adds to this difficulty. To tackle these problems, we propose the concept of local configurational relaxation time $\tau_\rm{LC}$, which is defined at the particle level. The spatial distribution of $\tau_\rm{LC}$ in flow is heterogeneous. Depending on the comparison between the local mobility measured by $\tau_\rm{LC}$ and the external shear rate, the response of local regions is either solid-like or liquid-like. In this way, $\tau_\rm{LC}$ plays a role similar to the Maxwell time. By applying this microscopic solid-liquid duality to different conditions of shear flow, we describe the emergence of shear thinning in steady shear, and predict the major characteristics of the transient response to start-up shear. Furthermore, we reveal a clear structural foundation for $\tau_\rm{LC}$ and the solid-liquid duality associated with it by introducing an order parameter extracted from local configuration. Thus, we establish a framework that connects microscopic structure, dynamics, local mechanical response, and flow behaviors for supercooled liquids. Finally, we rationalize our framework by leveraging the connection among structure, dynamics, and potential energy landscape (PEL). The PEL model illustrates how local structure, convection and thermal activation collectively determine $\tau_\rm{LC}$. Notably, it predicts two distinct response groups, which well correspond to the microscopic solid-liquid duality.

Title: Canceling the elastic Poynting effect with geometry
Authors: M. Destrade, Y. Du, J. Blackwell, N. Colgan, V. Balbi
Abstract: The Poynting effect is a paragon of nonlinear soft matter mechanics. It is the tendency (found in all incompressible, isotropic, hyperelastic solids) exhibited by a soft block to expand vertically when sheared horizontally. It can be observed whenever the length of the cuboid is at least four times its thickness. Here we show that the Poynting effect can be easily reversed and the cuboid can shrink vertically, simply by reducing this aspect ratio. In principle, this discovery means that for a given solid, say one used as a seismic wave absorber under a building, an optimal ratio exists where vertical displacements and vibrations can be completely eliminated. Here we first recall the classical theoretical treatment of the positive Poynting effect, and then show experimentally how it can be reversed. Using Finite Element simulations, we then investigate how the effect can be suppressed. We find that cubes always provide a reverse Poynting effect, irrespective of their material properties (in the third-order theory of weakly nonlinear elasticity).

Title: HTSC-2025: A Benchmark Dataset of Ambient-Pressure High-Temperature Superconductors for AI-Driven Critical Temperature Prediction
Authors: Xiao-Qi Han, Ze-Feng Gao, Xin-De Wang, Zhenfeng Ouyang, Peng-Jie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconducting materials holds great significance for human industry and daily life. In recent years, research on predicting superconducting transition temperatures using artificial intelligence~(AI) has gained popularity, with most of these tools claiming to achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the lack of widely accepted benchmark datasets in this field has severely hindered fair comparisons between different AI algorithms and impeded further advancement of these methods. In this work, we present the HTSC-2025, an ambient-pressure high-temperature superconducting benchmark dataset. This comprehensive compilation encompasses theoretically predicted superconducting materials discovered by theoretical physicists from 2023 to 2025 based on BCS superconductivity theory, including the renowned X$_2$YH$_6$ system, perovskite MXH$_3$ system, M$_3$XH$_8$ system, cage-like BCN-doped metal atomic systems derived from LaH$_{10}$ structural evolution, and two-dimensional honeycomb-structured systems evolving from MgB$_2$. The HTSC-2025 benchmark has been open-sourced at this https URL and will be continuously updated. This benchmark holds significant importance for accelerating the discovery of superconducting materials using AI-based methods.

Title: Beyond Diamond: Interpretable Machine Learning Discovery of Coherent Quantum Defect Hosts in Semiconductors
Authors: Mohammed Mahshook, Rudra Banerjee
Abstract: Quantum point defects in wide bandgap semiconductors-such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond are leading candidates for solid-state spin qubits due to their long coherence times and optically addressable spin states. Yet, identifying host materials capable of supporting such deep-level defects remains a significant challenge, owing to the complex interplay between chemical composition, crystal structure, and electronic environment. Here, we present a scalable, interpretable machine learning framework that combines density functional theory (DFT)-informed descriptors with a structure-agnostic ensemble model to predict quantum-compatible defect-host materials. Trained on a curated dataset from the Materials Project and ICSD, our model achieves a high Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC > 0.95) and assigns confidence scores to guide prioritization of candidates. First-principles calculations of coherence-relevant properties, including static dielectric constants and defect formation energetics, validate key predictions. While high dielectric response is a necessary but not sufficient condition for spin coherence, our model successfully recovers known hosts such as diamond and SiC, and reveals previously overlooked candidates such as WS2 , MgO, CaS and TiO2 . This approach establishes a robust path for discovering next-generation quantum materials, bridging data-driven screening with physically interpretable design principles.

Title: «Anticommuting» $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquids
Authors: Sumiran Pujari, Harsh Nigam
Abstract: We discuss a class of lattice $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum Hamiltonians with bond-dependent Ising couplings with a mutually «anticommuting» algebra of extensively many local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ conserved charges that was introduced in [arXiv:2407.06236] including the nomenclature. This mutual algebra is reminiscent of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Pauli matrix algebra but encoded in the structure of \emph{local conserved charges}. These models have finite residual entropy density in the ground state with a simple but non-trivial degeneracy counting and concomitant quantum spin liquidity as proved in [arXiv:2407.06236]. The spin liquidity relies on a geometrically site-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that is rather natural in presence of an «anticommuting» structure. One may contrast this with say the bond-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges on the hexagonal plaquettes of the Kitaev honeycomb spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ model which leads to a mutually commuting local algebra. In this work, we elucidate the differences of this kind of quantum spin liquidity in relation to many-body topological order found in some gapped quantum spin liquids whose canonical example is the Kitaev toric code. The toric code belongs to the more general class of Levin-Wen or string net constructions that possess mutually commuting algebras for the local conserved charges. We will make several exact statements on the kinds of many-body order that can be present within the class of «anticommuting» $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquids co-existing with extensive residual ground state entropy. We will also point out a mutually commuting algebra with local support that are naturally expressed as multi-linear Majorana forms in the Kitaev representation of these quantum spin liquids.

Title: Large Berry curvature effects induced by extended nodal structures: Rational design strategy and high-throughput materials predictions
Authors: Wencheng Wang, Minxue Yang, Wei Chen, Xiangang Wan, Feng Tang
Abstract: Berry curvature can drastically modify the electron dynamics, thereby offering an effective pathway for electron manipulation and novel device applications. Compared to zero-dimensional nodal points in Weyl/Dirac semimetals, higher-dimensional extended nodal structures, such as nodal lines and nodal surfaces, are more likely to intersect the Fermi surface, leading to large Berry curvature effects without fine-tuning the chemical potential. In this work, we propose a strategy that utilizes straight nodal lines (SNLs) and flat nodal surfaces (FNSs) to design large Berry curvature effects, and we exhaustively tabulate SNLs and FNSs within the 1651 magnetic space groups (MSGs). We demonstrate that SNLs and FNSs can generate large Berry curvature widely distributed in the Brillouin zone. As an application, we identify 158 MSGs that host FNSs, SNLs, or both and allow for nonvanishing anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). Based on these 158 MSGs, we screen materials from the MAGNDATA magnetic material database for high-throughput calculations, identifying 60 materials with AHC values exceeding $500\,\Omega^{-1}{\rm cm}^{-1}$. We select the candidate materials $\rm SrRuO_3$ and $\rm Ca_2NiOsO_6$ to demonstrate the contributions of FNSs and SNLs to one and two nonvanishing AHC components, respectively. We also investigate the tuning of AHC through symmetry breaking, outlining all possible symmetry-breaking pathways, and select the candidate material HoNi to demonstrate this approach by applying an external magnetic field. Additionally, we identify Berry curvature quadrupoles in the candidate materials, indicating that our strategy can be generalized to Berry curvature multipole effects. Our work will guide both the theoretical and experimental design of materials with large Berry curvature effects, with significant implications for a wide range of device applications.

Title: Unveiling the different scaling regimes of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang--Burgers equation using the functional renormalisation group
Authors: Liubov Gosteva, Nicolás Wschebor, Léonie Canet
Abstract: The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is a celebrated non-linear stochastic equation featuring non-equilibrium scaling. Although in one dimension, its statistical properties are very well understood, a new scaling regime has been reported in recent numerical simulations. This new regime is characterised by a dynamical exponent $z=1$, markedly different from the expected one $z=3/2$ for the KPZ universality class, and it emerges when approaching the inviscid limit. The origin of this scaling has been traced down to the existence of a new fixed point, termed the inviscid Burgers (IB) fixed point, which was uncovered using the functional renormalisation group (FRG). The FRG equations can be solved analytically in the asymptotic regime of vanishing viscosity and large momenta, showing that indeed $z=1$ exactly at the IB fixed point. In this work, we set up an advanced method to numerically solve the full FRG flow equations in a certain approximation, which allows us to determine in a unified way the correlation function over the whole range of momenta, not restricted to some particular regime. We analyse the crossover between the different fixed points, and quantitatively determine the extent of the IB regime.

Title: Mechanical Degradation of Unentangled Polymer Melts under Uniaxial Extensional Flow
Authors: Mingchao Wang, Stephen Sanderson, Debra J. Searles
Abstract: Complex flow fields govern the deformation of polymers in various manufacturing processes. However, high flow rates may trigger reaction events (i.e., bond breaking or undesirable reaction of mechanophores) in raw polymeric materials, leading to the mechanical or functional debasement of manufactured structures. Additionally, it is difficult to fully characterize such molecular-level flow in the laboratory due to time- and length-scale limits. In this study, we perform non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to explore the rheological and mechanical degradation of unentangled polymer melts under uniaxial extensional flow (UEF), allowing for chain breaking. Our simulations demonstrate shear thickening-thinning-thickening stages with the increase of UEF extension rates, resulting from flow-induced changes of chain conformation. With further increasing UEF extension rates, a bond-breaking potential leads to another flow thinning stage. Interestingly, fracture kinetics is originally first-order owing to the need for highly stretched polymer chains before bond fracture. It is no longer first-order when bond fracture is instigated before chains are stretched. Our computational work provides insight into the optimal design of the manufacturing process for polymeric materials.

Title: Quantum-Hall Spectroscopy of Elliptically Deformed Graphene Nanobubble Qubits
Authors: Myung-Chul Jung, Nojoon Myoung
Abstract: With recent advances in strain-engineering technology of graphene and 2D materials, graphene quantum dots (QDs) defined by the strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields (PMFs) have been of interest, with the feasibility of tunable graphene qubits. Here, we theoretically investigate how the electronic states of the nanobubble QDs are influenced by the geometrical anisotropy of the elliptical-shape nanobubbles. We examine the energy levels of the single QD (SQD) and double QD (DQD) spectra by varying the elliptical deformation in the $x$ and $y$ axes, respectively. We found that the SQD and DQD show distinguished behavior with respect to the direction of the elliptical deformation. While the SQD levels are substantially affected by the $y$-directional deformation, the DQD levels are largely shifted by the $x$-directional deformation.

Title: Tailoring the resonant spin response of a stirred polariton condensate
Authors: Ivan Gnusov, Alexey Yulin, Stepan Baryshev, Sergey Alyatkin, Pavlos G. Lagoudakis
Abstract: We report on the enhancement of the spin coherence time (T2) by almost an order-of-magnitude in exciton-polariton condensates through driven spin precession resonance. Using a rotating optical trap formed by a bichromatic laser excitation, we synchronize the trap stirring frequency with the condensate intrinsic Larmor precession, achieving an order of magnitude increase in spin coherence. By tuning the optical trap profile via excitation lasers intensity, we precisely control the resonance width. Here we present a theoretical model that explains our experimental findings in terms of the mutual synchronization of the condensate circular polarization components. Our findings underpin the potential of polariton condensates for spinoptronic devices and quantum technologies.

Title: Flat-band compactons in a two-dimensional driven-dissipative Lieb lattice
Authors: Seth Lovett, Paul M. Walker, Anthony Ellul, Edmund Clarke, Maurice S. Skolnick, Dmitry N. Krizhanovskii
Abstract: We experimentally study the effect of inter-particle interactions on the flat-band states of a two-dimensional Lieb lattice with drive and dissipation. Exploiting the giant nonlinear interactions of exciton polaritons we observe compactly localised solitons (compactons) embedded within the continuum of propagating state bands - a form of nonlinear bound state in the continuum (BIC). The driven-dissipative nature of the system leads to a sudden self-localisation into the compacton state above a threshold power. The experimental results agree well with numerical simulations. These results have implications for the physics of interacting quantum particles in flat-band systems and for generation of quantum-correlated light and spatially multiplexed coherent information transport.

Title: Nernst effect and its thickness dependence in superconducting NbN films
Authors: Thomas Bouteiller, Arthur Marguerite, Ramzy Daou, Dmitry Yakovlev, Cheryl Feuillet-Palma, Dimitri Roditchev, Benoît Fauqué, Kamran Behnia
Abstract: Superconducting thin films and layered crystals display a Nernst signal generated by short-lived Cooper pairs above their critical temperature. Several experimental studies have broadly verified the standard theory invoking Gaussian fluctuations of a two-dimensional superconducting order parameter. Here, we present a study of the Nernst effect in granular NbN thin films with a thickness varying from 4 to 30 nm, exceeding the short superconducting coherence length and putting the system in the three-dimensional limit. We find that the Nernst conductivity decreases linearly with reduced temperature ($\alpha_{xy}\propto \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$), but the amplitude of $\alpha_{xy}$ scales with thickness. While the temperature dependence corresponds to what is expected in a 2D picture, scaling with thickness corresponds to a 3D picture. We argue that this behavior indicates a 2+1D situation, in which the relevant coherence length along the thickness of the film has no temperature dependence. We find no visible discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the Nernst conductivity across T$_c$. Explaining how the response of the superconducting vortices evolves to the one above the critical temperature of short-lived Cooper pairs emerges as a challenge to the theory.

Title: Note on the interpretation of magnetic diffraction in NdAlSi: helical or fan?
Authors: Takashi Kurumaji
Abstract: We revisit the magnetic structure analysis reported in Nat. Mater. 20, 1650 (2021), which concluded that a Weyl semimetal candidate NdAlSi hosts a helical magnetic order. This conclusion was based on magnetic neutron diffraction peaks corresponding to modulation vectors $\vec{k}_{in} = (1/3, 1/3, 0)$ and $\vec{k}_{out} = (2/3, 2/3, 0)$, attributed to in-plane and out-of-plane components of the magnetic moments, respectively. Upon careful reanalysis, we suggest that a fan-type magnetic structure--rather than the helix--provides a more consistent interpretation of these data. Unlike a helical structure, fan structures do not exhibit handedness. The distinction has significant implications for interpreting the electromagnetic responses in this material. We believe that our suggestions motivate a re-examination of magnetic structures in NdAlSi and other tetragonal siblings, where the interplay between magnetism and topology is under active investigation.

Title: Dreaming up scale invariance via inverse renormalization group
Authors: Adam Rançon, Ulysse Rançon, Tomislav Ivek, Ivan Balog
Abstract: We explore how minimal neural networks can invert the renormalization group (RG) coarse-graining procedure in the two-dimensional Ising model, effectively "dreaming up" microscopic configurations from coarse-grained states. This task-formally impossible at the level of configurations-can be approached probabilistically, allowing machine learning models to reconstruct scale-invariant distributions without relying on microscopic input. We demonstrate that even neural networks with as few as three trainable parameters can learn to generate critical configurations, reproducing the scaling behavior of observables such as magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Binder ratios. A real-space renormalization group analysis of the generated configurations confirms that the models capture not only scale invariance but also reproduce nontrivial eigenvalues of the RG transformation. Surprisingly, we find that increasing network complexity by introducing multiple layers offers no significant benefit. These findings suggest that simple local rules, akin to those generating fractal structures, are sufficient to encode the universality of critical phenomena, opening the door to efficient generative models of statistical ensembles in physics.

Title: Complex rheology of condensin in entangled DNA
Authors: Filippo Conforto, Antonio Valdes, Willem Vanderlinden, Davide Michieletto
Abstract: Structural-Maintenance-of-Chromosome (SMC) complexes such as condensins are well-known to dictate the folding and entanglement of interphase and mitotic chromosomes. However, their role in modulating the rheology and viscoelasticity of entangled DNA is not fully understood. In this work, we discover that physiological concentrations of yeast condensin increase both the effective viscosity and elasticity of dense solutions of $\lambda$-DNA even in absence of ATP. By combining biochemical assays and single-molecule imaging, we discover that yeast condensin can proficiently bind double-stranded DNA through its hinge domain, in addition to its heads. We further discover that presence of ATP fluidifies the entangled solution possibly by activating loop extrusion. Finally, we show that the observed rheology can be understood by modelling SMCs as transient crosslinkers in bottle-brush-like entangled polymers. Our findings help us to understand how SMCs affect the rheology and dynamics of the genome.

Title: Violation of Luttinger's theorem in one-dimensional interacting fermions
Authors: Meng Gao, Yin Zhong
Abstract: Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we systematically investigate the evolution of the Luttinger integral in the one-dimensional generalized t-V model as a function of filling and interaction strength, identifying three representative phases. In the weak-coupling regime, the zero-frequency Green's function shows a branch-cut structure at the Fermi momentum, and the Luttinger integral accurately reflects the particle density. As the interaction increases, the spectral weight near the Fermi momentum is gradually suppressed. In the strong-coupling regime near half-filling, the singularity is progressively destroyed, accompanied by zeros in the real part of the Green's function. This leads to a non-Fermi-liquid metallic phase beyond the Luttinger liquid paradigm. While spectral weight remains at the original Fermi momentum, the singularity fades. Meanwhile, zeros with negligible spectral weight appear elsewhere, significantly affecting the integral. At half-filling, a single-particle gap opens, and the Green's function vanishes across momentum space, indicating the suppression of low-energy states, consistent with an insulating charge-density-wave phase. These results suggest that the breakdown of the Luttinger theorem arises from the interplay of interaction-driven excitation evolution and particle-hole symmetry breaking, leading to a continuous reconstruction of the generalized Fermi surface from topologically protected to correlation-driven.

Title: Lattice and Orientational Defects Mediate Collective Transport of Confluent Cells
Authors: Jiusi Zhang, Chung Wing Chan, Bo Li, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Confluent tissues are a type of foam-like biological active matter. There is a recent interest in using active nematic liquid crystal framework to understand confluent cells, where topological (orientational) defects are believed to play a crucial role. However, how to reconcile the physical picture of lattice defects in Voronoi polygons with that of orientational defects in the nematic field$-$particularly in the context of cellular transport$-$remains elusive. Here, we employ the Active Vertex model to investigate the physics of lattice and orientational defects in the dynamics of confluent cells. We find a spatio-orientational correlation between lattice defects and $+1/2$ defects, unveiling a correspondence between the two physical perspectives. Next, we simulate the behavior of a dragged cell within a hexagonal-lattice tissue. Our results reveal that while the drag coefficient is anisotropic, the threshold drag force to mobilize the cell is isotropic, indicating the presence of a caging energy barrier. We further analyze the defect pattern in the wake of the dragged cell or cells. Remarkably, we discover that dragging two neighboring cells along the least-drag direction can substantially minimize the destruction of the lattice structure during cell transport. We find that this is due to the cooperative and periodic self-healing of the lattice defects. Taken together, our work sheds new light on the topological structure of confluent cells during their collective motion, advancing our physical understanding of cellular transport in processes such as wound healing, cancer cell metastasis, and other physiological events.

Title: Magneto-photoelectric effect in graphene via tailored potential landscapes
Authors: Joris Josiek, Friedemann Queisser, Stephan Winnerl, Ralf Schützhold
Abstract: We consider the propagation of charge carriers in planar graphene under the combined influence of a constant transversal magnetic field $B$ and an in-plane varying electric potential $\phi(x)$. By suitably designing the potential landscape $\phi(x)$, we may effectively steer charge carriers generated by photo-excitation, for example, in order to achieve an efficient charge separation. These finding may pave the way for transport schemes or photoelectric/photovoltaic applications.

Title: Phase Transition of Topological Index driven by Dephasing
Authors: Thomas G. Kiely, Cenke Xu
Abstract: We study topological insulators under dephasing noise. With examples of both a $2d$ Chern insulator and a $3d$ topological insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry, we demonstrate that there is a phase transition at finite dephasing strength between phases with nontrivial and trivial topological indices. Here the topological index is defined through the correlation matrix. The transition can be diagnosed through the spectrum of the whole correlation matrix or of a local subsystem. Interestingly, even if the topological insulator is very close to the topological-trivial critical point in its Hamiltonian, it still takes finite strength of dephasing to change the topological index, suggesting the robustness of topological insulators under dephasing. In the case of Chern insulator, this robustness of the phase with nontrivial Chern number persists near the critical point between the topological and Anderson insulator, which is tuned by the strength of disorder in the Hamiltonian.

Title: Atomic scale structure and dynamical properties of (TeO$_2$)$_{1-x}$-(Na$_2$O)$_{x}$ glasses through first-principles modeling and XRD measurements
Authors: Firas Shuaib, Assil Bouzid, Remi Piotrowski, Gaelle Delaizir, Pierre-Marie Geffroy, David Hamani, Raghvender Raghvender, Steve Dave Wansi Wendji, Carlo Massobrio, Mauro Boero, Guido Ori, Philippe Thomas, Olivier Masson
Abstract: We resort to first-principles molecular dynamics, in synergy with experiments, to study structural evolution and Na$^+$ cation diffusion inside (TeO$_2$)$_{1-x}$-(Na$_2$O)$_{x}$ (x = 0.10-0.40) glasses. Experimental and modeling results show a fair quantitative agreement in terms of total X-ray structure factors and pair distribution functions, thereby setting the ground for a comprehensive analysis of the glassy matrix evolution. We find that the structure of (TeO$_2$)$_{1-x}$-(Na$_2$O)$_{x}$ glasses deviates drastically from that of pure TeO$_2$ glass. Specifically, increasing the Na$_2$O concentration leads to a reduction of the coordination number of Te atoms, reflecting the occurrence of a structural depolymerization upon introduction of the Na$_2$O modifier oxide. The depolymerization phenomenon is ascribed to the transformation of Te-O-Te bridges into terminal Te-O non bridging oxygen atoms (NBO). Consequently, the concentration of NBO increases in these systems as the concentration of the modifier increases, accompanied by a concomitant reduction in the coordination number of Na atoms. The structure factors results show a prominent peak at 1.4 A, that becomes more and more pronounced as the Na2O concentration increases. The occurrence of this first sharp diffraction peak is attributed to the growth of Na-rich channels inside the amorphous network, acting as preferential routes for alkali-ion conduction inside the relatively stable Te-O matrix. These channels enhance the ion mobility.

Title: Programmable wrinkling for functionally-graded auxetic circular membranes

Abstract: Materials with negative Poisson's ratio, also known as auxetic materials, display exotic properties such as expansion in all directions under uni-axial tension. For their unique properties, these materials find a broad range of applications in robotic, structural, aerospace, and biomedical engineering. In this work we study the wrinkling behavior of thin and soft auxetic membranes, subjected to edge tractions. We show that spatial inhomogeneities of the Young modulus and of the Poisson ratio can be suitably tailored to produce non-trivial wrinkling patterns, with wrinkled regions that can appear, broaden, merge, and eventually disappear again, as the magnitude of applied tractions is increased monotonically. To model wrinkling in a functionally graded membrane, we employ the mathematically elegant and physically transparent tension field theory, an approximated method that we implement in commercially available software. Beyond unveiling the challenging technological potential to achieve non-standard wrinkling on-demand in auxetic membranes, our study also confirms the potential of using tension field theory to study, analytically and numerically, instabilities in functionally graded materials.

Title: Signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction of a doped Mott insulator in a slab geometry
Authors: Gregorio Staffieri, Michele Fabrizio
Abstract: We investigate a hole-doped Mott insulator in a slab geometry using the dynamical cluster approximation. We show that the enhancement of the correlation strength at the surface results in the remarkable evolution of the layer-projected Fermi surface, which exhibits hole-like pockets in the superficial layers, but gradually evolves into a single electron-like surface in the innermost layers. We further analyze the behavior of the Friedel oscillations induced by the surface and identify distinct signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction as function of hole-doping. In addition, we introduce a computationally tractable quantity that diagnoses the same Fermi surface variation by the concurrent breakdown of Luttinger's theorem. Both the latter quantity and the Friedel oscillations serve as reliable indicators of the change in Fermi surface topology, without the need for any periodization in momentum space.

Title: Fluctuations in the number of local minima in discrete-time fractional Brownian motion
Authors: Maxim Dolgushev, Olivier Bénichou
Abstract: The analysis of local minima in time series data and random landscapes is essential across numerous scientific disciplines, offering critical insights into system dynamics. Recently, Kundu, Majumdar, and Schehr derived the exact distribution of the number of local minima for a broad class of Markovian symmetric walks [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{110}, 024137 (2024)]; however, many real-world systems are non-Markovian, typically due to interactions with possibly hidden degrees of freedom. This work investigates the statistical properties of local minima in discrete-time samples of fractional Brownian motion (fBm), a non-Markovian Gaussian process with stationary increments, widely used to model complex, anomalous diffusion phenomena. We derive expressions for the variance of the number of local minima $m_N$ in an $N$-step discrete-time fBm. In contrast to the mean of $m_N$, which depends solely on nearest-neighbor correlations, the variance captures all long-range correlations inherent in fBm. Remarkably, we find that the variance exhibits two distinct scaling regimes: for Hurst exponent $H < 3/4$, $\mathrm{Var}(m_N) \propto N$, conforming to the central limit theorem (CLT); whereas for $H > 3/4$, $\mathrm{Var}(m_N) \propto N^{4H-2}$, resulting in the breakdown of the CLT. These findings are supported by numerical simulations and provide deeper insight into the interplay between memory effects and statistical fluctuations in non-Markovian processes.

Title: Exactly solvable spin liquids in Kitaev bilayers and moiré superlattices
Authors: Ivan Dutta, Anamitra Mukherjee, Onur Erten, Kush Saha
Abstract: Building on the recent advancements on moiré superlattices, we propose an exactly solvable model with Kitaev-type interactions on a bilayer honeycomb lattice for both AA stacking and moiré superlattices. Employing Monte Carlo simulations and variational analysis, we uncover a rich variety of phases where the intra and interlayer $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes (visons) are arranged in a periodic fashion in the ground state, tuned by interlayer coupling and out-of-plane external magnetic field. We further extend our model to moiré superlattices at various commensurate twist angles around two distinct twist centers represented by $C_{3z}$ and $C_{6z}$ of the honeycomb lattice. Our simulations reveal generalized patterns of plaquette values correlated with the AA or AB stacking regions across the moiré unit cell. In addition, depending on the twist angle, twist center and interlayer coupling, moiré superlattices exhibit to a variety of gapped and gapless spin liquid phases and can also host corner and edge modes. Our results highlight the rich physics in bilayer and twisted bilayer models of exactly solvable quantum spin liquids.

Title: Topological Mixed States: Axiomatic Approaches and Phases of Matter
Authors: Tai-Hsuan Yang, Bowen Shi, Jong Yeon Lee
Abstract: For closed quantum systems, topological orders are understood through the equivalence classes of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. The generalization of this conceptual paradigm to open quantum systems, however, remains elusive, often relying on operational definitions without fundamental principles. Here, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on three axioms: ($i$) local recoverability, ($ii$) absence of long-range correlations, and ($iii$) spatial uniformity. States that satisfy these axioms are fixed points; requiring the axioms only after coarse-graining promotes each fixed point to an equivalence class, i.e. a phase, presenting the first step towards the axiomatic classification of mixed-state phases of matter: \emph{mixed-state bootstrap program}. From these axioms, a rich set of topological data naturally emerges. For example, each topological mixed state supports locally indistinguishable classical and/or quantum logical memories with distinct responses to topological operations. These data label distinct mixed-state phases, allowing one to distinguish them. We further uncover a hierarchy of secret-sharing constraints: in non-Abelian phases, reliable recovery-even of information that looks purely classical -- demands a specific coordination among spatial subregions, a requirement different across non-Abelian classes. This originates from non-Abelian fusion rules that can stay robust under decoherence. Finally, we performed large-scale numerical simulations to corroborate stability-weakly decohered fixed points respect the axioms once coarse-grained. These results lay the foundation for a systematic classification of topological states in open quantum systems.

Title: Asymptotics of SGD in Sequence-Single Index Models and Single-Layer Attention Networks
Authors: Luca Arnaboldi, Bruno Loureiro, Ludovic Stephan, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborova
Abstract: We study the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for a class of sequence models termed Sequence Single-Index (SSI) models, where the target depends on a single direction in input space applied to a sequence of tokens. This setting generalizes classical single-index models to the sequential domain, encompassing simplified one-layer attention architectures. We derive a closed-form expression for the population loss in terms of a pair of sufficient statistics capturing semantic and positional alignment, and characterize the induced high-dimensional SGD dynamics for these coordinates. Our analysis reveals two distinct training phases: escape from uninformative initialization and alignment with the target subspace, and demonstrates how the sequence length and positional encoding influence convergence speed and learning trajectories. These results provide a rigorous and interpretable foundation for understanding how sequential structure in data can be beneficial for learning with attention-based models.

Title: A planning tool for neutron powder diffraction experiments
Authors: Joseph A. M. Paddison, Stuart Calder, Danielle R. Yahne, Malcolm J. Cochran, Si Athena Chen, Matthias D. Frontzek, Yuanpeng Zhang
Abstract: We introduce a computer program to simulate the results of neutron powder-diffraction experiments at the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The program is freely available as a web application at this http URL, and is designed to be straightforward to use for researchers who are new to neutron diffraction. The input includes the crystal structure of the proposed sample, the sample mass, and the instrument configuration. The results include a plot of the simulated data -- including realistic estimates of background and the error bars due to counting statistics -- and suggestions of how to resolve potential problems with the experiment. Here, we explain the design and implementation of this program and demonstrate its performance using comparisons of simulated and experimental data. We hope that this program will enable researchers to plan neutron-scattering experiments more effectively, increasing the likelihood of successful experiments and improving the productivity of neutron-diffraction research.

Title: Universal Resources for QAOA and Quantum Annealing
Authors: Pablo Díez-Valle, Fernando J. Gómez-Ruiz, Diego Porras, Juan José García-Ripoll
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a variational ansatz that resembles the Trotterized dynamics of a Quantum Annealing (QA) protocol. This work formalizes this connection formally and empirically, showing the angles of a multilayer QAOA circuit converge to universal QA trajectories. Furthermore, the errors in both QAOA circuits and QA paths act as thermal excitations in pseudo-Boltzmann probability distributions whose temperature decreases with the invested resource -- i.e. integrated angles or total time -- and which in QAOA also contain a higher temperature arising from the Trotterization. This also means QAOA and QA are cooling protocols and simulators of partition functions whose target temperature can be tuned by rescaling the universal trajectory. The average cooling power of both methods exhibits favorable algebraic scalings with respect to the target temperature and problem size, whereby in QAOA the coldest temperature is inversely proportional to the number of layers, $T\sim 1/p$, and to the integrated angles -- or integrated interactions in QA.

Title: Fast offline decoding with local message-passing automata
Authors: Ethan Lake
Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.

Title: Thermodynamics and Statistical Equilibrium of Large-Scale Hydroelastic Wave Turbulence
Authors: Marlone Vernet, Eric Falcon
Abstract: Understanding how statistical equilibrium can occur in out-of-equilibrium systems is of paramount interest, as it would enable the use of statistical mechanics tools to these systems. Here, we report the first experimental evidence of statistical equilibrium of the large scales of hydroelastic turbulent waves driven by small-scale random forcing. The wave field statistics at scales larger than the forcing scale, resolved in space and time, align well with the predictions of Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium spectra over more than a decade. We measure zero net energy flux in this regime, as expected. We also determine the effective temperature, entropy, and heat capacity of this nonequilibrium system, demonstrating that classical thermodynamic concepts apply to describe large scales in statistical equilibrium of turbulent systems.

Title: Model for the Thermodynamics of Iron at High Pressures Near Melting
Authors: Rann Shikler, Noya Dimanstein Firman, Yinon Ashkenazy
Abstract: The Fe pressure-temperature phase diagram and its melting line have a wide range of applications, including providing constraints for iron-core planetary models. We propose an equation of state (EOS) model based on the interstitial theory of simple condensed matter (ITCM), as suggested by A.V. Granato. When applied to Fe, this model enables the extrapolation of measured melting lines to the conditions of the Earth's inner core boundary (ICB). The ITCM describes the solid-liquid phase transition in metals as resulting from a strong structural perturbation due to a high concentration of interstitial-like defects. The strong nonlinearity of their self-interaction causes the stabilization of this interstitial-rich phase. The original model is expanded to describe melting over a wide range of pressures and temperatures rather than focusing on a specific isobaric transition. Using this model, we fit the measured melting data, extrapolate it to cover ICB conditions, and develop a multiphase equation of state that encompasses this regime. The model is used to explain contradictory data regarding the location of the melting line, resulting from a novel phase transition between two separate liquid phases, specifically between FCC-based and HCP-based liquids. This additional liquid phase offers a new interpretation of the previously suggested near-melting high-pressure phase and may also provide a solution to the inner core nucleation paradox.

Title: Superatomic hydrogen: achieving effective aggregation of hydrogen atoms at pressures lower than that of metallic hydrogen
Authors: Jia Fan, Chenxi Wan, Rui Liu, Zhen Gong, Hongbo Jing, Baiqiang Liu, Siyang Liu, Zhigang Wang
Abstract: Metal hydrogen exhibiting electron delocalization properties has been recognized as an important prospect for achieving controlled nuclear fusion, but the extreme pressure conditions required exceeding hundreds of GPa remain a daunting challenge. Here, we propose a model of superatomic hydrogen, aiming to reduce the pressure conditions required for the effective aggregation of elemental hydrogen atoms. High-precision ab initio calculations indicate that the pressure required to compress the H13 system with one central atom and 12 surrounding atoms into a superatomic state is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of metallic hydrogen. Atomic-level analyses reveal that in the superatomic state of compressed H13, the central H atom donates its electron, and all electrons are delocalized on the superatomic molecular orbitals, which conforms to properties of metallic hydrogen. Our discovery in principle opens up the prospect of superatomic hydrogen in areas such as nuclear fusion.

Title: Ultralong Room-Temperature Qubit Lifetimes of Covalent Organic Frameworks
Authors: Zhecheng Sun, Weibin Ni, Denan Li, Xiya Du, Shi Liu, Lei Sun
Abstract: Molecular electron spin qubits offer atomic-level tunability and room-temperature quantum coherence. Their integration into engineered solid-state matrices can enhance performance towards ambient quantum information technologies. Herein, we demonstrate covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as programmable matrices of stable organic radical qubits allowing strategic optimization of spin-phonon and spin-spin interactions. Using two classic boronate-ester frameworks, COF-5 and COF-108, to host semiquinone-like radical qubits, we achieve ultralong spin relaxation time (T1 > 300 {\mu}s) at 298 K, which outperforms most molecular qubits and rivals inorganic spin defects. The suppression of spin relaxation is attributed to rigid and neutral structures as well as carbon-centered spin distributions that effectively weaken spin-phonon coupling. Employing dynamical decoupling methods to both COFs improves their quantum coherence and enables room-temperature detection of nuclear spins including 1H, 11B, and 13C. Our work establishes COFs as designer quantum materials, opening new avenues for quantum sensing of nuclear spins at room temperature.

Title: An 11-qubit atom processor in silicon

Abstract: Phosphorus atoms in silicon are an outstanding platform for quantum computing as their nuclear spins exhibit coherence time over seconds. By placing multiple phosphorus atoms within a radius of a few nanometers, they couple via the hyperfine interaction to a single, shared electron. Such a nuclear spin register enables multi-qubit control above the fault-tolerant threshold and the execution of small-scale quantum algorithms. To achieve quantum error correction, fast and efficient interconnects have to be implemented between spin registers while maintaining high fidelity across all qubit metrics. Here, we demonstrate such integration with a fully controlled 11-qubit atom processor composed of two multi-nuclear spin registers which are linked via electron exchange interaction. Through the development of scalable calibration and control protocols, we achieve coherent coupling between nuclear spins using a combination of single- and multi-qubit gates with all fidelities ranging from 99.5% to 99.99%. We verify the efficient all-to-all connectivity by preparing both local and non-local Bell states with a record state fidelity beyond 99% and extend entanglement through the generation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states over all data qubits. By establishing high-fidelity operation across interconnected nuclear-spin registers, we realise a key milestone towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with atom processors.

Title: Robust Scaling in Human Brain Dynamics Despite Latent Variables and Limited Sampling Distortions
Authors: Rubén Calvo, Carles Martorell, Adrián Roig, Miguel A. Muñoz
Abstract: The idea that information-processing systems operate near criticality to enhance computational performance is supported by scaling signatures in brain activity. However, external signals raise the question of whether this behavior is intrinsic or input-driven. We show that autocorrelated inputs and temporal resolution influence observed scaling exponents in simple neural models. We also demonstrate analytically that under subsampling, non-critical systems driven by independent autocorrelated signals can exhibit strong signatures of apparent criticality. To address these pitfalls, we develop a robust framework and apply it to pooled neural data, revealing resting-state brain activity at the population level is slightly sub-critical yet near-critical. Notably, the extracted critical exponents closely match predictions from a simple recurrent firing-rate model, supporting the emergence of near-critical dynamics from reverberant network activity, with potential implications for information processing and artificial intelligence.

Title: The Yang-Baxter integrability of the critical Ising chain
Authors: Akash Sinha, Tinu Justin, Pramod Padmanabhan, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.

Title: Learning-at-Criticality in Large Language Models for Quantum Field Theory and Beyond
Authors: Xiansheng Cai, Sihan Hu, Tao Wang, Yuan Huang, Pan Zhang, Youjin Deng, Kun Chen
Abstract: Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.

Title: Direct laser ablation of 2D material films for fabricating multi-functional flexible and transparent devices
Authors: Yigit Sozen, Yu Kyoung Ryu, Javier Martinez, Andres Castellanos-Gomez
Abstract: We present a scalable method for direct patterning of graphite and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) films on polycarbonate (PC) and other transparent substrates using fiber laser ablation. This process facilitates the fabrication of various functional devices, including strain gauges, supercapacitors, and photodetector arrays, without the need for photolithography or solvents, thereby simplifying device production and enhancing environmental sustainability. Utilizing roll-to-roll mechanical exfoliation, homogeneous nanosheet films are created and then patterned with a laser engraving system. Electrical and optical characterization confirms that the laser-processed films maintain their crystallinity, with no observable damage to the underlying substrate. We demonstrate the scalability of this approach by constructing a WSe2/graphite photodetector array on PC, which exhibits high sensitivity, low noise, and uniform photocurrent response across its active channels. As a proof-of-concept, this array is used as an image sensor to capture light patterns, showcasing its potential for flexible and semi-transparent imaging applications. These findings open up new avenues for incorporating all-van der Waals devices into wearable electronics, optoelectronics, and imaging technologies.

Title: Defect states in compressible active polar fluids with turnover
Authors: Ludovic Dumoulin, Carles Blanch-Mercader, Karsten Kruse
Abstract: Biological active matter like the cytoskeleton or tissues are characterized by their ability to transform chemical energy into mechanical stress. In addition, it often exhibits orientational order, which is essential for many cellular and morphogenetic processes. Experimental evidence suggests that defects in the orientational order field play an important role in organizing active stress. However, defects tend to annihilate unless the material is in a chaotic state or hydrodynamic interactions are suppressed. Using a hydrodynamic description of compressible active polar fluids, we show that turnover readily leads to a stabilization of defects. Depending on the turnover rate, topological defects arrange in a multitude of different phases, including lattices, active foams, and vortex glasses. Our work suggests that turnover plays a crucial role for organizing biological active matter.

Title: Molecular Dynamics Simulations on Nuclear Recoils in Silicon Crystals towards Single Electron-Hole Pair Ionization Yields
Authors: Chang-Hao Fang, Shin-Ted Lin, Shu-Kui Liu, Henry Tsz-King Wong, Hao-Yang Xing, Li-Tao Yang, Qian Yue, Jing-Jun Zhu
Abstract: We have developed a novel methodology utilizing molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the ionization yields of nuclear recoils in crystalline silicon. This approach enables analytical exploration of atomic-scale transport within the lattice without necessitating parameterization. The quenching factors across the nuclear recoil energy range from 20 eV to 10 keV have been thoroughly investigated. A remarkable agreement with experimental data is achieved, particularly for the minimal energy regime conducted to date, reaching the level of a single electron-hole pair. This work presents evidence of a crucial and fundamental distribution of the quenching factor, which can be associated to the collisional interactions underlying the transport phenomena. The region below 4 keV of the quenching factor, where discrepancies have been observed with the Lindhard's model, is found to be significantly attributed to the lattice binding effect and the specific crystal structure. In contrast, a gradual functional relationship is identified below approximately 100 eV, indicating that the quenching factor is influenced by the crystallographic orientation of the target material. From a distributional perspective, our analysis allows for the determination of the minimum exclusion mass for the dark matter nucleon elastic scattering channel at 0.29 $\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity for the sub-$\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass region.

Title: Topological Jackiw-Rebbi States in Photonic Van der Waals Heterostructures

Abstract: Topological phenomena, first studied in solid state physics, have seen increased interest for applications in nanophotonics owing to highly controllable light confinement with inherent robustness to defects. Photonic crystals can be designed to host topologically protected interface states for directional light transport, localization and robust lasing via tuning of the bulk topological invariant. At the same time, van der Waals (vdW) materials, in both their monolayer and quasi-bulk forms, are emerging as exciting additions to the field of nanophotonics, with a range of unique optoelectronic properties and intrinsic adherence to any type of host material, allowing fabrication of complex multi-layer structures. We present here a 1D topological photonic platform made from stacked nanostructured and planar layers of quasi-bulk WS$_2$ to achieve Jackiw-Rebbi (JR) interface states between two topologically distinct gratings in the near-infrared range around 750 nm. Such states are measured in the far-field with angle-resolved reflectance contrast measurements, exhibiting linewidth of 10 meV and highly directional emission with an angular bandwidth of 8.0$^\circ$. Subsequent local mapping of the structure via sub-wavelength resolution scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) reveals strong spatial confinement of the JR state to the grating interface region. Finally, we couple in the JR state the photoluminescence of monolayer WSe$_2$ incorporated in a five-layer vdW grating heterostructure, giving rise to directional enhancement of the excitonic emission of up to 22 times that of uncoupled monolayer, thus demonstrating the potential of the topological interface states for highly directional light emission in addition to light scattering.

Abstract: When Anderson localization entered the QCD landscape, it was almost immediately thought about in connection with thermal phases, namely as a factor in the chiral transition. However, recent developments revealed an additional structure that made Anderson-like features central to the genesis of the entirely new thermal phase: the IR phase. I will explain these developments.

Title: Deep-learned error mitigation via partially knitted circuits for the variational quantum eigensolver
Authors: Simone Cantori, Andrea Mari, David Vitali, Sebastiano Pilati
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is generally regarded as a promising quantum algorithm for near-term noisy quantum computers. However, when implemented with the deep circuits that are in principle required for achieving a satisfactory accuracy, the algorithm is strongly limited by noise. Here, we show how to make VQE functional via a tailored error mitigation technique based on deep learning. Our method employs multilayer perceptrons trained on the fly to predict ideal expectation values from noisy outputs combined with circuit descriptors. Importantly, a circuit knitting technique with partial knitting is adopted to substantially reduce the classical computational cost of creating the training data. We also show that other popular general-purpose quantum error mitigation techniques do not reach comparable accuracies. Our findings highlight the power of deep-learned quantum error mitigation methods tailored to specific circuit families, and of the combined use of variational quantum algorithms and classical deep learning.

Title: Estimation of the reduced density matrix and entanglement entropies using autoregressive networks
Authors: Piotr Białas, Piotr Korcyl, Tomasz Stebel, Dawid Zapolski
Abstract: We present an application of autoregressive neural networks to Monte Carlo simulations of quantum spin chains using the correspondence with classical two-dimensional spin systems. We use a hierarchy of neural networks capable of estimating conditional probabilities of consecutive spins to evaluate elements of reduced density matrices directly. Using the Ising chain as an example, we calculate the continuum limit of the ground state's von Neumann and Rényi bipartite entanglement entropies of an interval built of up to 5 spins. We demonstrate that our architecture is able to estimate all the needed matrix elements with just a single training for a fixed time discretization and lattice volume. Our method can be applied to other types of spin chains, possibly with defects, as well as to estimating entanglement entropies of thermal states at non-zero temperature.

Title: Entanglement renormalization circuits for $2d$ Gaussian Fermion States
Authors: Sing Lam Wong, Andrew C. Potter
Abstract: The simulation of entangled ground-states of quantum materials remains challenging for classical computational methods in more than one spatial dimension, and is a prime target for quantum computational advantage. To this end, an important goal is to identify efficient quantum state preparation protocols that minimize the physical qubit number and circuit depth resources required to capture higher-dimensional quantum correlations. This work introduces a quantum circuit compression algorithm for Gaussian fermion states based on the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), which provides an exponential reduction in the circuit depth required to approximate highly-entangled ground-states relevant for quantum materials simulations. The algorithm, termed two-dimensional Gaussian MERA ($2d$ GMERA), extends MERA techniques to compress higher-dimensional Gaussian states. Through numerical simulations of the Haldane model on a honeycomb lattice, the method is shown to accurately capture area-law entangled states including topologically trivial insulators, Chern insulators, and critical Dirac semimetals. While Gaussian states alone are classically simulable, this approach establishes empirical upper bounds on quantum resources needed to prepare free fermion states that are adiabatically connected to correlated ground states, providing guidance for implementing these protocols on near-term quantum devices and offering a foundation for simulating more complex quantum materials. Finally, we develop a novel fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme, based on an expanding $2d$ topological order, that enables implementing fermionic rotations via qubit Pauli rotations with constant Pauli weight independent of system size.

Title: Finding signatures of low-dimensional geometric landscapes in high-dimensional cell fate transitions
Authors: Maria Yampolskaya, Laertis Ikonomou, Pankaj Mehta
Abstract: Multicellular organisms develop a wide variety of highly-specialized cell types. The consistency and robustness of developmental cell fate trajectories suggests that complex gene regulatory networks effectively act as low-dimensional cell fate landscapes. A complementary set of works draws on the theory of dynamical systems to argue that cell fate transitions can be categorized into universal decision-making classes. However, the theory connecting geometric landscapes and decision-making classes to high-dimensional gene expression space is still in its infancy. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model that allows us to identify gene expression signatures of decision-making classes from single-cell RNA-sequencing time-series data. Our model combines low-dimensional gradient-like dynamical systems and high-dimensional Hopfield networks to capture the interplay between cell fate, gene expression, and signaling pathways. We apply our model to the maturation of alveolar cells in mouse lungs to show that the transient appearance of a mixed alveolar type 1/type 2 state suggests the triple cusp decision-making class. We also analyze lineage-tracing data on hematopoetic differentiation and show that bipotent neutrophil-monocyte progenitors likely undergo a heteroclinic flip bifurcation. Our results suggest it is possible to identify universal decision-making classes for cell fate transitions directly from data.

Title: Bridging Quantum Chemistry and MaxCut: Classical Performance Guarantees and Quantum Algorithms for the Hartree-Fock Method
Authors: Alexis Ralli, Tim Weaving, Peter V. Coveney, Peter J. Love
Abstract: In quantum chemistry, self-consistent field (SCF) algorithms define a nonlinear optimization problem, with both continuous and discrete components. In this work, we derive Hartree-Fock-inspired SCF algorithms that can be exactly written as a sequence of Quadratic Unconstrained Spin/Binary Optimization problems (QUSO/QUBO). We reformulate the optimization problem as a series of MaxCut graph problems, which can be efficiently solved using semi-definite programming techniques. This procedure provides performance guarantees at each SCF step, irrespective of the complexity of the optimization landscape. We numerically demonstrate the QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF methods by studying the hydroxide anion OH- and molecular Nitrogen N2. The largest problem addressed in this study involves a system comprised of 220 qubits (equivalently, spin-orbitals). Our results show that QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF suffer much less from internal instabilities compared with conventional SCF calculations. Additionally, we show that the new SCF algorithms can enhance single-reference methods, such as configuration interaction. Finally, we explore how quantum algorithms for optimization can be applied to the QUSO problems arising from the Hartree-Fock method. Four distinct hybrid-quantum classical approaches are introduced: GAS-SCF, QAOA-SCF, QA-SCF and DQI-SCF.

Title: Surface Local Impurity Scattering as a Probe for Topological Kondo Insulators
Authors: C.-C. Joseph Wang, Jean-Pierre Julien, A. V. Balatsky, Jian-Xin Zhu
Abstract: Shortly after the discovery of topological band insulators, topological Kondo insulators (TKIs) have also been theoretically predicted. The latter has ignited revival interest in the properties of Kondo insulators. Currently, the feasibility of topological nature in SmB$_6$ has been intensively analyzed by several complementary probes. Here by starting with a minimal-orbital Anderson lattice model, we explore the local electronic structure in a Kondo insulator. We show that the two strong topological regimes sandwiching the weak topological regime give rise to a single Dirac cone, which is located near the center or corner of the surface Brillouin zone. We further find that, when a single impurity is placed on the surface, low-energy resonance states are induced in the weak scattering limit for the strong TKI regimes and the resonance level moves monotonically across the hybridization gap with the strength of impurity scattering potential; while low energy states can only be induced in the unitary scattering limit for the weak TKI regime, where the resonance level moves universally toward the center of the hybridization gap. These impurity-induced low-energy quasiparticles will lead to characteristic signatures in scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, which has recently found success in probing into exotic properties in heavy fermion systems.

Title: Phonon-limited valley life times in single-particle bilayer graphene quantum dots
Authors: Luca Banszerus, Katrin Hecker, Lin Wang, Samuel Möller, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Guido Burkard, Christian Volk, Christoph Stampfer
Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in 2D semiconductors, such as gapped bilayer graphene (BLG) and transition metal dichalcogenides, is a promising carrier of quantum information in the emerging field of valleytronics. While valley dynamics have been extensively studied for moderate band gap 2D~semiconductors using optical spectroscopy techniques, very little is known about valley lifetimes in narrow band gap BLG, which is difficult to study using optical techniques. Here, we report single-particle valley relaxation times ($T_1$) exceeding several microseconds in electrostatically defined BLG quantum dots (QDs) using a pulse-gating technique. The observed dependence of $T_1$ on perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively by a model in which $T_1$ is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify the coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation potential as the limiting mechanisms.

Title: Observation of vortices in a dipolar supersolid
Authors: Eva Casotti, Elena Poli, Lauritz Klaus, Andrea Litvinov, Clemens Ulm, Claudia Politi, Manfred J. Mark, Thomas Bland, Francesca Ferlaino
Abstract: Supersolids are states of matter that spontaneously break two continuous symmetries: translational invariance due to the appearance of a crystal structure and phase invariance due to phase locking of single-particle wave functions, responsible for superfluid phenomena. While originally predicted to be present in solid helium, ultracold quantum gases provided a first platform to observe supersolids, with particular success coming from dipolar atoms. Phase locking in dipolar supersolids has been probed through e.g. measurements of the phase coherence and gapless Goldstone modes, but quantized vortices, a hydrodynamic fingerprint of superfluidity, have not yet been observed. Here, with the prerequisite pieces at our disposal, namely a method to generate vortices in dipolar gases and supersolids with two-dimensional crystalline order, we report on the theoretical investigation and experimental observation of vortices in the supersolid phase. Our work reveals a fundamental difference in vortex seeding dynamics between unmodulated and modulated quantum fluids. This opens the door to study the hydrodynamic properties of exotic quantum systems with multiple spontaneously broken symmetries, in disparate domains such as quantum crystals and neutron stars.

Title: Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets
Authors: Phillip Popp, Arthur P. Ramirez, Sergey Syzranov
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.

Title: Gaussian approximation of dynamic cavity equations for linearly-coupled stochastic dynamics
Authors: Mattia Tarabolo, Luca Dall'Asta
Abstract: Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.

Title: A new quadrature for the generalized hydrodynamics equation and absence of shocks in the Lieb-Liniger model
Authors: Friedrich Hübner, Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: In conventional fluids, it is well known that Euler-scale equations are plagued by ambiguities and instabilities. Smooth initial conditions may develop shocks, and weak solutions, such as for domain wall initial conditions (the paradigmatic Riemann problem of hydrodynamics), are not unique. The absence of shock formation experimentally observed in quasi-one-dimensional cold-atomic gases, which are described by the Lieb-Liniger model, provides perhaps the strongest pointer to a modification of the hydrodynamic equation due to integrability. Generalised hydrodynamics (GHD) is the required hydrodynamic theory, taking into account the infinite number of conserved quantities afforded by integrability. We provide a new quadrature for the GHD equation -- a solution in terms of a Banach fixed-point problem where time has been explicitly integrated. The quadrature is an efficient numerical solution tool; and it allows us, in the Lieb-Liniger model, to rigorously show that no shock may appear at all times, and, when combined with recent hydrodynamic fluctuation theories, to obtain new expressions for correlations in non-stationary states, establishing for the first time the presence of discontinuities characteristic of the non-equilibrium dynamics.

Title: Mechanism of $E'_γ$ Defect Generation in Ionizing-irradiated $a$-SiO$_2$: The Nonradiative Carrier Capture-Structural Relaxation Model
Authors: Yu Song, Chen Qiu, Su-Huai Wei
Abstract: The total ionizing dose (TID) effect of semiconductor devices stems from radiation-induced $E'_\gamma$ defects in the $a$-SiO$_2$ dielectrics, but the conventional ``hole transport-trapping'' model of defect generation fails to explain recent basic experiments. Here, we propose an essentially new ``nonradiative carrier capture-structural relaxation'' (NCCSR) mechanism that can consistently explain the puzzling temperature/electric-field dependence, based on spin-polarized HSE06 hybrid functional calculations and existing experimental alignment of defect formation energies and charge capture cross-sections of large-sample oxygen vacancies in $a$-SiO$_2$. It is revealed that, the long-assumed $V_{O\gamma}$ precursors with high formation energy cannot survive in high temperature-grown $a$-SiO$_2$; whereas the stable $V_{O\delta}$ can capture irradiation-induced holes via strong electron-phonon coupling, generating metastable $E'_\delta$ that most relax into stable $E'_\gamma$. A fractional power-law (FPL) dynamic model is derived based on the mechanism and the Kohlrausch-Williams Watts (KWW) decay function. It can uniformly describe nonlinear data over a wide dose and temperature range. This work not only provides a solid cornerstone for prediction and hardening of TID effects of SiO$_2$-based semiconductor devices, but also offers a general approach for studying ionizing radiation physics in alternative dielectrics with intrinsic electronic metastability and dispersion.

Title: Two-dimensional many-body localized systems coupled to a heat bath
Authors: Joey Li, Amos Chan, Thorsten B. Wahl
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effect of coupling a two-dimensional many-body localized system to a finite heat bath, using shallow quantum circuits as a variational ansatz. Specifically, we simulate optical lattice experiments with two components of ultracold bosons, where only one species is subject to a random disorder potential and the other acts as a heat bath. We obtain a filling fraction dependent phase diagram with a critical filling consistent with experiments. We also calculate two-point correlation functions and the quantum mutual information between sites. We observe a distribution of the quantum mutual information in the many-body localized regime which is consistent with the presence of resonances, similar to those observed in one-dimensional many-body localized systems.

Title: Why Grain Growth is Not Curvature Flow
Authors: Caihao Qiu, David J. Srolovitz, Gregory S. Rohrer, Jian Han, Marco Salvalaglio
Abstract: Grain growth in polycrystals is traditionally considered a capillarity-driven process, where grain boundaries (GBs) migrate toward their centers of curvature (i.e., mean curvature flow) with a velocity proportional to the local curvature (including extensions to account for anisotropic GB energy and mobility). Experimental and simulation evidence shows that this simplistic view is untrue. We demonstrate that the failure of the classical mean curvature flow description of grain growth mainly originates from the shear deformation naturally coupled with GB motion (i.e., shear coupling). Our findings are built on large-scale microstructure evolution simulations incorporating the fundamental (crystallography-respecting) microscopic mechanism of GB migration. The nature of the deviations from curvature flow revealed in our simulations is consistent with observations in recent experimental studies on different materials. This work also demonstrates how to incorporate the mechanical effects that are essential to the accurate prediction of microstructure evolution.

Title: Multiparty Entanglement Microscopy of Quantum Ising models in 1d, 2d and 3d
Authors: Liuke Lyu, Menghan Song, Ting-Tung Wang, Zi Yang Meng, William Witczak-Krempa
Abstract: Entanglement microscopy reveals the true quantum correlations among the microscopic building blocks of many-body systems [Nat. Commun. 16, 96 (2025)]. Using this approach, we study the multipartite entanglement of the quantum Ising model in 1d, 2d, and 3d. We first obtain the full reduced density matrix (tomography) of subregions that have at most 4 sites via quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, and the exact solution in 1d. We then analyze both bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) among the sites in the subregion. To do so, we use a variety of measures including the negativity, as well as a true measure of GME: the genuinely multipartite concurrence (or GME concurrence), and its computationally cheaper lower bound, $I_2$. We provide a complete proof that $I_2$ bounds the GME concurrence, and show how the symmetries of the state simplify its evaluation. For adjacent sites, we find 3- and 4-spin GME present across large portions of the phase diagram, reaching maximum near the quantum critical point. In 1d, we identify the singular scaling of the derivative $dI_2/dh$ approaching the critical point. We observe a sharp decrease of GME with increasing dimensionality, coherent with the monogamous nature of entanglement. Furthermore, we find that GME disappears for subregions consisting of non-adjacent sites in both 2d and 3d, offering a stark illustration of the short-ranged nature of entanglement in equilibrium quantum matter arXiv:2402.06677. Finally, we analyze the most collective form of entanglement by evaluating the GME concurrence among all spins in the lattice, which can be obtained from a simple observable: the single-site transverse magnetization. This global concurrence is larger in 1d compared to 2d/3d, but it is relatively less robust against perturbations such as local measurements.

Title: Dynamic structure factor of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with long-range interactions
Authors: Sibin Yang, Gabe Schumm, Anders W. Sandvik
Abstract: We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi-long-range-ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as a ``model selection'' tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This study serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.

Title: Abelian Spectral Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points
Authors: Marcus Stålhammar, Lukas Rødland
Abstract: The advent of non-Hermitian physics has enriched the plethora of topological phases to include phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. Despite being among the most well-studied uniquely non-Hermitian features, the topological properties of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s) at which also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce, were only recently revealed in terms of topological resultant winding numbers and concomitant Abelian doubling theorems. Nevertheless, a more mathematically fundamental description of EP$n$s and their topological nature has remained an open question. To fill this void, in this article, we revisit the topological classification of EP$n$s in generic systems and systems with local symmetries, generalize it in terms of more mathematically tractable (local) similarity relations, and extend it to include all such similarities as well as non-local symmetries. Through the resultant vector, whose components are given in terms of the resultants between the corresponding characteristic polynomial and its derivatives, the topological nature of the resultant winding number is understood in several ways: in terms of i) the tenfold classification of (Hermitian) topological matter, ii) the framework of Mayer--Vietoris sequence, and iii) the classification of vector bundles. The classification scheme further predicts the existence of topological bulk Fermi arcs protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant, induced by non-local symmetries, dubbed $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Fermi arcs. Our work reveals the mathematical foundations on which the topological nature of EP$n$s resides, enriches the theoretical understanding of non-Hermitian spectral features, and will therefore find great use in modern experiments within both classical and quantum physics.

Title: Tailoring Robust Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect via Entropy-Engineering
Authors: Syeda Amina Shabbir, Frank Fei Yun, Muhammad Nadeem, Xiaolin Wang
Abstract: The development of quantum materials and the tailoring of their functional properties is of fundamental interest in materials science. Here, a new design concept is proposed for the robust quantum anomalous Hall effect via entropy engineering in 2D magnets. As a prototypical example, the configurational entropy of monolayer transition metal trihalide VCl$_3$ is manipulated by incorporating four different transition-metal cations [Ti,Cr,Fe,Co] into the honeycomb structure made of vanadium, such that all in-plane mirror symmetries, inversion and/or roto-inversion are broken. Monolayer VCl$_3$ is a ferromagnetic Dirac half-metal in which spin-polarized Dirac dispersion at valley momenta is accompanied by bulk states at the $\Gamma$-point and thus the spin-orbit interaction-driven quantum anomalous Hall phase does not exhibit fully gapped bulk band dispersion. Entropy-driven bandstructure renormalization, especially band flattening in combination with red- and blue-shifts at different momenta of the Brillouin zone and crystal-field effects, transforms Dirac half-metal to a Dirac spin-gapless semiconductor and leads to a robust quantum anomalous Hall phase with fully gapped bulk band dispersion and, thus, a purely topological edge state transport without mixing with dissipative bulk channels. These findings provide a paradigm for designing entropy-engineered 2D materials for the realization of robust quantum anomalous Hall effect and quantum device applications.

Title: Electrical switching of altermagnetism
Authors: Yiyuan Chen, Xiaoxiong Liu, Hai-Zhou Lu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: Switching magnetism using only electricity is of great significance for industrial applications but remains challenging. We find that, altermagnetism, as a newly discovered unconventional magnetism, may open an avenue along this effort. Specifically, to have deterministic switching, i.e., reversing current direction must reverse magnetic structure, parity symmetry has to be broken. We discover that, due to their symmetry which depends on chemical environments, altermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required for deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we identify MnTe bilayers (Te-Mn-Te-Mn-Te) as candidate devices, with the help of symmetry analysis, first-principles calculations, and magnetic dynamics simulations. This scheme will inspire further explorations on unconventional magnetism.

Title: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of superconducting (La,Pr)3Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 heterostructures
Authors: Peng Li, Guangdi Zhou, Wei Lv, Yueying Li, Changming Yue, Haoliang Huang, Lizhi Xu, Jianchang Shen, Yu Miao, Wenhua Song, Zihao Nie, Yaqi Chen, Heng Wang, Weiqiang Chen, Yaobo Huang, Zhen-Hua Chen, Tian Qian, Junhao Lin, Junfeng He, Yu-Jie Sun, Zhuoyu Chen, Qi-Kun Xue
Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate thin film superconductors discovered under ambient pressure enable vast possibilities for investigating electronic structures of the superconducting state. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of 1, 2, and 3 unit-cell epitaxial La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 films grown on SrLaAlO4 substates, through pure-oxygen in situ sample transportation. Evidence obtained using photons with distinct probing depths shows that conduction is localized primarily at the first unit cell near the interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), indicates that interfacial Sr diffusion and pronounced p-d hybridization gradient may collectively account for the interfacial confinement of conduction. Fermi surface maps reveal hole doping compared to non-superconducting ambient-pressure bulk crystals. Measurements of dispersive band structures suggest the contributions from both Ni dx2-y2 and dz2 orbitals at the Fermi level. Density functional theory (DFT) + U calculations capture qualitative features of the ARPES results, consistent with a hole-doped scenario. These findings constrain theoretical models of the superconducting mechanism and suggest potential for enhancing superconductivity in nickelates under ambient pressure.

Title: Bridging conformal field theory and parton approaches to SU(n)_k chiral spin liquids
Authors: Tong Liu, Ying-Hai Wu, Hong-Hao Tu, Tao Xiang
Abstract: We employ the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. The spins on all lattice sites are chosen to transform under the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ irreducible representation with a single row and $k$ boxes in the Young tableau. It is demonstrated that the wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ series are derived. The $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the $k=2$ member hosts Fibonacci anyons.

Title: Radial Stabilization of Magnetic Skyrmions Under Strong External Magnetic Field
Authors: Emir Syahreza Fadhilla, M Shoufie Ukhtary, Ardian Nata Atmaja, Bobby Eka Gunara
Abstract: The skyrmion number density, $q\equiv\vec{n}\cdot\left(\partial_x\vec{n}\times\partial_y\vec{n}\right)/(4\pi)$, is one of the key quantities that characterizes the topological properties of a magnetic skyrmion. In this work, we propose a model for a two-dimensional magnetic system with Hamiltonian that contains an interaction term proportional to $q^2$ which preserves inversion symmetry. The proposed $q^2$ term is also known as the Skyrme term and is a two-dimensional version of the well-known quartic term in models of three-dimensional Hopfions. In contrast with the usual exchange interaction, the $q^2$ term persists at the strong external magnetic field limit. Using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for micromagnetic calculations, we show that the minimum energy configuration of this model exhibits skyrmion properties. Furthermore, this configuration remains stable under small linear radially symmetric perturbations, and we demonstrate that the total energy of the system is bounded from below, ensuring that it remains above the vacuum energy. This implies a topologically protected configuration. Our model provides a framework for describing skyrmions in materials without broken inversion symmetry, particularly in systems subjected to strong external magnetic fields, where conventional exchange interactions are significantly weaker than the Zeeman effect.

Title: Quantum correlations and spatial localization in trapped one-dimensional ultra-cold Bose-Bose-Bose mixtures
Authors: Tran Duong Anh-Tai, Miguel A. García-March, Thomas Busch, Thomás Fogarty
Abstract: We systematically investigate and illustrate the complete ground-state phase diagram for a one-dimensional, three-species mixture of a few repulsively interacting bosons trapped harmonically. To numerically obtain the solutions to the many-body Schrödinger equation, we employ the improved Exact Diagonalization method [T. D. Anh-Tai {\it et al.}, SciPost Physics 15, 048 (2023)], which is capable of treating strongly-correlated few-body systems from first principles in an efficiently truncated Hilbert space. We present our comprehensive results for all possible combinations of intra- and interspecies interactions in the extreme limits that are either the ideal limit ($g=0$) or close to the hard-core limit ($g\to\infty$). These results show the emergence of unique ground-state properties related to correlations, coherence and spatial localization stemming from strongly repulsive interactions.

Title: Towards numerically exact computation of conductivity in the thermodynamic limit of interacting lattice models
Authors: Jeremija Kovačević, Michel Ferrero, Jakša Vučičević
Abstract: Computing dynamical response functions in interacting lattice models is a long standing challenge in condensed matter physics. In view of recent results, the dc resistivity $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ in the weak coupling regime of the Hubbard model is of great interest, yet it is not fully understood. The challenge lies in having to work with large lattices while avoiding analytical continuation. The weak-coupling $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ results were so far computed at the level of the Boltzmann theory and at the level of the Kubo bubble approximation, which neglects vertex corrections. Neither theory was so far rigorously proven to give exact results even at infinitesimal coupling, and the respective dc resistivity results differ greatly. In this work we develop, cross-check and apply two state-of-the-art methods for obtaining dynamical response functions. We compute the optical conductivity at weak coupling in the Hubbard model in a fully controlled way, in the thermodynamic limit and without analytical continuation. We show that vertex corrections persist to infinitesimal coupling, with a constant ratio to the Kubo bubble. We connect our methods with the Boltzmann theory, and show that the latter applies additional approximations, which lead to quantitatively incorrect scaling of $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ with respect to the coupling constant.

Title: Extended string-net models with all anyons at finite temperature
Authors: André O. Soares, Anna Ritz-Zwilling, Jean-Noël Fuchs
Abstract: The string-net model describes a vast family of topological orders in two spatial dimensions. Here, we consider the effect of thermal fluctuations on these topological phases. In the original string-net model, the description of charge (vertex) excitations can be problematic. Therefore, in order to describe all anyon excitations, we study an extended model [Y. Hu et al., Phys. Rev. B 97, 195154 (2018)]. Building on recent methods, we compute the spectral degeneracies of excited states and obtain the exact partition function. In the thermodynamic limit, the latter is dominated by the trivial (vacuum) anyon, so that topological order is destroyed at any nonzero temperature. In contrast, in a finite-size system, order survives up to a finite temperature, revealing a nontrivial scaling between temperature and size similar to that of the one-dimensional classical Ising model. We confirm this scaling by computing the thermal average of several observables such as Wegner-Wilson loops and topological mutual information.

Title: Revealing isotropic abundant low-energy excitations in UTe$_2$ through complex microwave surface impedance
Authors: Arthur Carlton-Jones, Alonso Suarez, Yun-Suk Eo, Ian M. Hayes, Shanta R. Saha, Johnpierre Paglione, Nicholas P. Butch, Steven M. Anlage
Abstract: The complex surface impedance is a well-established tool to study the super- and normal-fluid responses of superconductors. Fundamental properties of the superconductor, such as the pairing mechanism, Fermi surface, and topological properties, also influence the surface impedance. We explore the microwave surface impedance of spin-triplet UTe$_2$ single crystals as a function of temperature using resonant cavity perturbation measurements employing a novel multi-modal analysis to gain insight into these properties. We determine a composite surface impedance of the crystal for each mode using resonance data combined with the independently measured normal state dc resistivity tensor. The normal state surface impedance reveals the weighting of current flow directions in the crystal of each resonant mode. For UTe$_2$, we find an isotropic $\Delta \lambda(T) \sim T^\alpha$ power-law temperature dependence for the magnetic penetration depth for $T\le T_c/3$ with $\alpha < 2$, which is inconsistent with a single pair of point nodes on the Fermi surface under weak scattering. We also find a similar power-law temperature dependence for the low-temperature surface resistance $R_s(T) \sim T^{\alpha_R}$ with $\alpha_R < 2$. We observe a strong anisotropy of the residual microwave loss across these modes, with some modes showing loss below the universal line-nodal value, to those showing substantially more. We compare to predictions for topological Weyl superconductivity in the context of the observed isotropic power-laws, and anisotropy of the residual loss.

Title: Nonreciprocal field theory for decision-making in multi-agent control systems
Authors: Andrea Lama, Mario di Bernardo, Sabine H. L. Klapp
Abstract: Field theories for complex systems traditionally focus on collective behaviors emerging from simple, reciprocal pairwise interaction rules. However, many natural and artificial systems exhibit behaviors driven by microscopic decision-making processes that introduce both nonreciprocity and many-body interactions, challenging these conventional approaches. We develop a theoretical framework to incorporate decision-making into field theories using the shepherding control problem as a paradigmatic example of a multi-agent control system, where agents (herders) must coordinate to confine another group of agents (targets) within a prescribed region. By introducing continuous approximations of two key decision-making elements - target selection and trajectory planning - we derive field equations that capture the essential features of this distributed control problem. Our theory reveals that different decision-making strategies emerge at the continuum level, from average attraction to highly selective choices, and from undirected to goal-oriented motion, driving transitions between homogeneous and confined configurations. The resulting nonreciprocal field theory not only describes the shepherding problem but provides a general framework for incorporating decision-making into continuum theories of collective behavior, with implications for applications ranging from robotic swarms to crowd management systems.

Title: Is Triboelectricity Confusing, Confused or Complex?
Authors: Karl P. Olson, Laurence D. Marks
Abstract: In this report, we look at the fundamental physics of triboelectricity, charge transfer due to contact and sliding. While much of the report focuses upon recent advances such as the incorporation of flexoelectric contributions, we also include older work, some from centuries ago, which only now can be understood in a general sense. Basic concepts and theories ranging from elements of tribology and contact mechanics through semiconductor built-in potentials, electromechanical terms, mechanochemistry and trap states are briefly described, linking to established surface science and interface physics. We then overview the main models that have been proposed, showing that they all fall within conventional electrostatics combined with other established science. We conclude with some suggestions for the future. Based upon this overview, our conclusion is that triboelectricity is a slightly complex combination of standard electrostatic phenomena that can be understood using the generalized Ampere's law connecting the electric displacement field with both Coulomb and polarization contributions, and the free carrier density, that is Grad.D=rho. Triboelectricity may be confusing, it is not really confused if care is taken, but it is complex.

Title: Wyckoff Transformer: Generation of Symmetric Crystals
Authors: Nikita Kazeev, Wei Nong, Ignat Romanov, Ruiming Zhu, Andrey Ustyuzhanin, Shuya Yamazaki, Kedar Hippalgaonkar
Abstract: Crystal symmetry plays a fundamental role in determining its physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. However, this is often inadequately addressed by existing generative models, making the consistent generation of stable and symmetrically valid crystal structures a significant challenge. We introduce WyFormer, a generative model that directly tackles this by formally conditioning on space group symmetry. It achieves this by using Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer encoder and an absence of positional encoding. Extensive experimentation demonstrates WyFormer's compelling combination of attributes: it achieves best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, incorporates a physics-motivated inductive bias, produces structures with competitive stability, predicts material properties with competitive accuracy even without atomic coordinates, and exhibits unparalleled inference speed.

Title: Modified large-$N$ approach to gapless spin liquids, magnetic orders, and dynamics: Application to triangular lattice antiferromagnets
Authors: Anjishnu Bose, Kathleen Hart, Ruairidh Sutcliffe, Arun Paramekanti
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the triangular lattice spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg and XXZ antiferromagnets may exhibit coplanar or supersolid orders proximate to a gapless Dirac spin liquid phase. We explore a distinct $SU(2N)\!\!\times\!\!SU(M)$ fermionic parton approach, complemented by variational Monte Carlo calculations for the spin-$1/2$ model, to study the phase diagram of these models. We also calculate their dynamical spin response including parton interactions within a random phase approximation, and discuss implications for neutron scattering on triangular lattice cobaltates Ba$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$, Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, and Yb-based magnet KYbSe$_2$.

Title: Emergent supercounterfluid and quantum phase diagram of two-component interacting bosons in one-dimensional optical lattice
Authors: Saisai He, Yang Liu, Bin Xi, Hong-Gang Luo, Qiang Luo, Jize Zhao
Abstract: Motivated by a recent experiment that realizes nearest-neighbor dipolar couplings in an optical lattice [C. Lagoin, $\textit{et al.}$, Nature $\textbf{609}$, 485 (2022)], we study a one-dimensional version of the two-component extended Bose-Hubbard model via the density-matrix renormalization group method. By using the nearest-neighbor and on-site interaction parameters from the experiment, we start by mapping the quantum phase diagram in the hopping parameters $t_{A}\mbox{-}t_{B}$ plane with boson densities $\rho_{A}=\rho_{B}=1/2$. In addition to the density wave phase reported in the experiment, we find several regimes of superfluidity when one or two hopping parameters are large enough, and interestingly there is a supercounterfluid phase at moderate and comparable hopping parameters. The universality classes of these phase transitions are analyzed from the correlation functions, excitation gaps, and entanglement entropy. In particular, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type is recognized several gapped-to-gapless transitions. In addition, we also study the quantum phase transitions when varying $\rho_{B}$ from 0 to 1 while keeping $\rho_A = 1/2$. We identify a supersolid phase in a wide range of $1/2<\rho_B<1$. Our work paves the way for realizing exotic many-body phases in cold atom experiments upon proper tuning of experimental parameters.

Title: Lorenz ratios of diagonal and Hall conductivities in a Dirac electron liquid
Authors: Alex Levchenko
Abstract: The magnetotransport properties of a two-dimensional electron liquid in graphene are analyzed in the hydrodynamic limit under isothermal conditions. It is shown that the Wiedemann-Franz law does not hold in this regime and that the Lorenz ratios constructed from the diagonal and Hall conductivities generally differ from each other. The breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law is most pronounced near charge neutrality, where the Lorenz ratio can exceed its nominal universal Sommerfeld value by an order of magnitude. The corresponding Lorenz ratios exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on the magnetic field, which is caused by emergent magnetic friction arising in liquids lacking Galilean invariance and possessing finite intrinsic conductivity.

Title: Superzone gap formation induced by ferroic orders

Abstract: We demonstrate that a superzone gap, typically associated with antiferroic ordering, can also emerge from ferroic orders in systems with sublattice degrees of freedom. By analyzing a $p$-orbital tight-binding model on a zigzag chain, we show that a Su--Schrieffer--Heeger-type gap is induced by ferroquadrupolar or ferromagnetic order or by applying an external magnetic field.

Title: Surface Structure and Surface State of a Tight-Binding Model on a Diamond Lattice
Authors: Katsunori Kubo
Abstract: Surface states of a tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping on a diamond lattice of finite thickness are investigated. We consider systems with (001), (110), and (111) surfaces. Even if the surface direction is fixed, there is freedom to choose the surface structure due to the two-sublattice nature of a diamond lattice. The existence of surface states is governed by the topology of the matrix elements of the bulk Hamiltonian. In this sense, the existence of surface states is determined by the bulk Hamiltonian. However, the matrix elements depend on the choice of the unit cell, which should be chosen to conform to the surface structure. Thus, the surface states depend on the surface structure. We find that for each surface direction, there are two choices of surface structure, and depending on the chosen structure, the corresponding surface states emerge in distinct regions of the surface Brillouin zone.

Title: Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics
Authors: Xiao-Dong Lin, Long Zhang
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.

Title: NCoder -- A Quantum Field Theory approach to encoding data
Authors: David S. Berman, Marc S. Klinger, Alexander G. Stapleton
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to interpretable AI inspired by Quantum Field Theory (QFT) which we call the NCoder. The NCoder is a modified autoencoder neural network whose latent layer is prescribed to be a subset of $n$-point correlation functions. Regarding images as draws from a lattice field theory, this architecture mimics the task of perturbatively constructing the effective action of the theory order by order in an expansion using Feynman diagrams. Alternatively, the NCoder may be regarded as simulating the procedure of statistical inference whereby high dimensional data is first summarized in terms of several lower dimensional summary statistics (here the $n$-point correlation functions), and subsequent out-of-sample data is generated by inferring the data generating distribution from these statistics. In this way the NCoder suggests a fascinating correspondence between perturbative renormalizability and the sufficiency of models. We demonstrate the efficacy of the NCoder by applying it to the generation of MNIST images, and find that generated images can be correctly classified using only information from the first three $n$-point functions of the image distribution.

Title: How Much Entanglement Is Needed for Topological Codes and Mixed States with Anomalous Symmetry?
Authors: Zhi Li, Dongjin Lee, Beni Yoshida
Abstract: It is known that particles with exotic properties can emerge in systems made of simple constituents such as qubits, due to long-range quantum entanglement. In this paper, we provide quantitative characterizations of entanglement necessary for emergent anyons and fermions by using the geometric entanglement measure (GEM), which quantifies the maximal overlap between a given state and any short-range-entangled states. For systems with emergent anyons, based on the braiding statistics, we show that the GEM scales linearly in the system size regardless of microscopic details. The phenomenon of emergent anyons can also be understood within the framework of quantum error correction (QEC). Specifically, we show that the GEM of any 2D stabilizer codes must be at least quadratic in the code distance. Our proof is based on a generic prescription for constructing string operators, establishing a rigorous and direct connection between emergent anyons and QEC. For systems with emergent fermions, despite that the ground state subspaces could be exponentially huge and their coding properties could be rather poor, we show that the GEM also scales linearly in the system size. Our analysis establishes an intriguing link between quantum anomaly and entanglement: A quantum state respecting anomalous 1-form symmetries, must be long-range-entangled and have large GEM. Our results also extend to mixed states, such as the $ZX$-dephased toric code, providing a provably nontrivial class of intrinsically mixed-state phases.

Title: Time-resolved Stochastic Dynamics of Quantum Thermal Machines
Authors: Abhaya S. Hegde, Patrick P. Potts, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing an exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We analyze the statistics of individual cycle types and their durations, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of a given type. Central to our analysis is the notion of intermittency, which captures the operational consistency of the machine by assessing the frequency and distribution of idle cycles. Our framework offers a novel approach to characterizing thermal machines with significant relevance to experiments involving mesoscopic transport through quantum dots.

Title: 1D Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in thermal equilibrium via Non-Hermitian Construction
Authors: Jia-Bao Wang, Zi-Hao Dong, Yi Zhang
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking generally circumvents one-dimensional systems with local interactions in thermal equilibrium. Here, we analyze a category of one-dimensional Hermitian models via local non-Hermitian constructions. Notably, spontaneous symmetry breaking and long-range order may emerge at finite temperatures in such systems under periodic boundary conditions, in sharp contrast to Hermitian constructions. We demonstrate clear numerical evidence, such as order parameters and specific heat, supporting phase diagrams with robust ordered phases. Non-Hermitian physics plays a vital role in prohibiting domain-wall proliferation and promoting spontaneous symmetry breaking. The fermions exhibit an exotic topological nature in their path-integral windings, which uphold nonzero integers -- commonly a non-Hermitian signature -- in the ordered phases, thus offering a novel and spontaneous origin for both symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.

Title: Generalized Statistics on Lattice
Authors: Ryohei Kobayashi, Yuyang Li, Hanyu Xue, Po-Shen Hsin, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: Statistics of excitations play an essential role in understanding phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a universal method for studying the generalized statistics of Abelian particles and extended excitations in lattices of any dimension. We compute the statistics using the Berry phase of a sequence of unitary operators that transports the excitations while canceling local ambiguities at each step. The sequence is derived from locality, using the Smith normal form. We show that the statistics are quantized invariants. Our method unifies the statistics for the braiding and fusion of particles and loops, and leads to the discovery of novel statistics for membrane excitations. The statistics can be interpreted as the quantum anomaly of a generalized global symmetry, which manifests as an obstruction to gauging the symmetry on lattices. Furthermore, we show that non-trivial statistics forbid short-range entangled states, establishing the dynamical consequence of anomalies in microscopic lattice models.

Title: Topology and Spectrum in Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions
Authors: Hisanori Oshima, Ken Mochizuki, Ryusuke Hamazaki, Yohei Fuji
Abstract: Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a wide variety of entanglement phases. Here, we propose a general framework based on Lyapunov analysis to characterize topological properties in monitored quantum systems through their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We illustrate this framework by analyzing (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which are known to exhibit topological and trivial area-law entangled phases as well as a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement. Through the Lyapunov analysis, we identify the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our framework thus provides a general route to extend the notion of bulk-edge correspondence to monitored quantum dynamics.

Title: A theoretical framework for overfitting in energy-based modeling
Authors: Giovanni Catania, Aurélien Decelle, Cyril Furtlehner, Beatriz Seoane
Abstract: We investigate the impact of limited data on training pairwise energy-based models for inverse problems aimed at identifying interaction networks. Utilizing the Gaussian model as testbed, we dissect training trajectories across the eigenbasis of the coupling matrix, exploiting the independent evolution of eigenmodes and revealing that the learning timescales are tied to the spectral decomposition of the empirical covariance matrix. We see that optimal points for early stopping arise from the interplay between these timescales and the initial conditions of training. Moreover, we show that finite data corrections can be accurately modeled through asymptotic random matrix theory calculations and provide the counterpart of generalized cross-validation in the energy based model context. Our analytical framework extends to binary-variable maximum-entropy pairwise models with minimal variations. These findings offer strategies to control overfitting in discrete-variable models through empirical shrinkage corrections, improving the management of overfitting in energy-based generative models. Finally, we propose a generalization to arbitrary energy-based models by deriving the neural tangent kernel dynamics of the score function under the score-matching algorithm.

Title: The anomalously slow dynamics of inhomogeneous quantum annealing
Authors: Mohammadhossein Dadgar, Christopher L. Baldwin
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum annealing (IQA), in which transverse fields are turned off one by one rather than simultaneously, has been proposed as an effective way to avoid the first-order phase transitions that impede conventional quantum annealing (QA). Here we explicitly study the dynamics of IQA, rather than merely the thermodynamics, and find that it is appreciably slower than the phase diagram would suggest. Interestingly, this slowdown manifests both when IQA succeeds in circumventing phase transitions and when it fails. Even in the absence of transitions, such as for the mean-field models that have been analyzed previously, IQA is slower than expected by a factor of the number of spins $N$. More significantly, we show that in non-mean-field models, first-order transitions are likely to be quite common, and the gap at such transitions is not merely exponential in $N$ but exactly zero. Thus IQA cannot reach the ground state on any timescale. Both of these results can be understood through the simple observation that a spin's magnetization becomes conserved once its field is turned off during the IQA protocol.

Title: Simulating non-Abelian statistics of parafermions with superconducting processor
Authors: Hong-Yu Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana modes, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose a novel experimental scheme for the quantum simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding statistics in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the topologically ordered ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding of parafermions, and show the application of this approach to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermions. We also examine the real experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility of our scheme in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulations of topological defects in SC qubits to qudit systems and opens up a promising way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.

Title: Comparing quantum complexity and quantum fidelity
Authors: Nadir Samos Sáenz de Buruaga
Abstract: Quantum complexity measures the difficulty of obtaining a given state starting from a typically unentangled state. In this work, we show that complexity, when defined through the minimization of a Riemannian cost functional over the manifold of Gaussian states, provides the same information as quantum fidelity and is therefore capable of detecting quantum phase transitions. However, it does not offer a more refined analysis than entanglement entropy for a given state. We conclude that incorporating a notion of spatial locality into the computation of complexity is essential to uncover new physics beyond what is accessible through entanglement entropy and fidelity.

Title: Characterization of the chaotic phase in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model
Authors: Pilar Martín Clavero, Alberto Rodríguez
Abstract: The chaotic phase of the tilted Bose-Hubbard model is identified as a function of energy, tilt strength and particle interaction, from the eigenstate structure and the statistical features of the energy spectrum. Our analysis reveals that the chaotic phase of the bare Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian can actually be enhanced by the presence of a moderate tilt. We further unveil the development and scaling of the chaotic regime from the perspective of a homogeneous density configuration typically used in cold atom experiments, providing a valuable phase diagram for future theoretical and experimental studies of this system.

Title: Computational Physics in the Advanced Lab: Experiment and Simulation of Thermal Diffusion in Metal Rods
Authors: Yash Mohod, Matthew C. Sullivan
Abstract: We present a simple experiment on thermal diffusion in metal rods that can be used to integrate computation into the advanced lab. An analytical solution exists for the transient heat conduction in an infinite rod with a delta function heat input, but no analytical solution exists for short rods or for long duration heat inputs. Our apparatus is a copper rod with a heater and thermometers attached to the rod. The temperature of the metal rod due to transient heat conduction can be modeled using a simple numerical simulation and the finite centered difference method. Using a 22 cm long copper rod with the ends thermally sunk in aluminum blocks, we show poor agreement between the experimental results and the infinite-rod analytical model, but excellent agreement between the experimental results and our numerical simulation. This experiment shows the power of a numerical simulation but also the limitations of the chosen model, which can be used as motivation for further exploration.

Title: Scrambling Dynamics with Imperfections in a Solvable Model
Authors: Nadie Yiluo LiTenn, Tianci Zhou, Brian Swingle
Abstract: We study how probes of quantum scrambling dynamics respond to two kinds of imperfections -- unequal forward and backward evolutions and decoherence -- in a solvable Brownian circuit model. We calculate a ``renormalized'' out-of-time-order correlator (ROTOC) in the model with $N$ qubits, and we show that the circuit-averaged ROTOC is controlled by an effective probability distribution in operator weight space which obeys a system of $N$ non-linear equations of motion. These equations can be easily solved numerically for large system sizes which are beyond the reach of exact methods. Moreover, for an operator initially concentrated on weight one $w_0=1$, we provide an exact solution to the equations in the thermodynamic limit of many qubits that is valid for all times, all non-vanishing perturbation strengths $p\gtrsim 1/\sqrt{N}$, and all decoherence strengths. We also show that a generic initial condition $w_0 >1$ leads to a metastable state that eventually collapses to the $w_0=1$ case after a lifetime $\sim \log(N/w_0)$. Our results highlight situations where it is still possible to extract the unperturbed chaos exponent even in the presence of imperfections, and we comment on the applications of our results to existing experiments with nuclear spins and to future scrambling experiments.

Title: Self-reorganization and Information Transfer in Massive Schools of Fish
Authors: Haotian Hang, Chenchen Huang, Alex Barnett, Eva Kanso
Abstract: The remarkable cohesion and coordination observed in moving animal groups and their collective responsiveness to threats are thought to be mediated by scale-free correlations, where changes in the behavior of one animal influence others in the group, regardless of the distance between them. But are these features independent of group size? Here, we investigate group cohesiveness and collective responsiveness in computational models of massive schools of fish of up to 50,000 individuals. We show that as the number of swimmers increases, flow interactions destabilize the school, creating clusters that constantly fragment, disperse, and regroup, similar to their biological counterparts. We calculate the spatial correlation and speed of information propagation in these dynamic clusters. Spatial correlations in cohesive and polarized clusters are indeed scale free, much like in natural animal groups, but fragmentation events are preceded by a decrease in correlation length, thus diminishing the group's collective responsiveness, leaving it more vulnerable to predation events. Importantly, in groups undergoing collective turns, the information about the change in direction propagates linearly in time among group members, thanks to the non-reciprocal nature of the visual interactions between individuals. Merging speeds up the transfer of information within each cluster by several fold, while fragmentation slows it down. Our findings suggest that flow interactions may have played an important role in group size regulation, behavioral adaptations, and dispersion in living animal groups.

Title: $C^\ast$-categorical prefactorization algebras for superselection sectors and topological order
Authors: Marco Benini, Victor Carmona, Pieter Naaijkens, Alexander Schenkel
Abstract: This paper presents a conceptual and efficient geometric framework to encode the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors of an algebraic quantum field theory on the $n$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. It is shown that, under certain assumptions which are implied by Haag duality, the monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of localized superselection sectors carry the structure of a locally constant prefactorization algebra over the category of cone-shaped subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Employing techniques from higher algebra, one extracts from this datum an underlying locally constant prefactorization algebra defined on open disks in the cylinder $\mathbb{R}^1\times\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. While the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ arises geometrically as the angular coordinates of cones, the origin of the line $\mathbb{R}^1$ is analytic and rooted in Haag duality. The usual braided (for $n=2$) or symmetric (for $n\geq 3$) monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of superselection sectors are recovered by removing a point of the sphere $\mathbb{R}^1\times(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\setminus\mathrm{pt}) \cong\mathbb{R}^n$ and using the equivalence between $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras and locally constant prefactorization algebras defined on open disks in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The non-trivial homotopy groups of spheres induce additional algebraic structures on these $\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal $C^\ast$-categories, which in the case of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is given by a braided monoidal self-equivalence arising geometrically as a kind of `holonomy' around the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$. The locally constant prefactorization algebra structures discovered in this work generalize, under some mild geometric conditions, to other discrete spaces and thereby provide a clear link between the geometry of the localization regions and the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors.

Title: Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories
Authors: Maarten Golterman, Yigal Shamir
Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase are ``kinematical'' singularities, which can be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we discuss the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. Finally, we elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models.

Title: Holographic Timelike c-function
Authors: Dimitrios Giataganas
Abstract: The integration of high-energy degrees of freedom along the renormalization group (RG) flow in Poincaré-invariant theories can be captured by a monotonic c-function. For such theories, holographic monotonic c-functions have been constructed using entanglement entropy. However, in theories with broken Lorentz invariance, such constructions generally fail, reflecting both the violation of the entanglement RG monotonicity and its limitations in capturing certain properties of non-relativistic RG flows. Since many quantum many-body systems lack Lorentz invariance, it is of significant importance to identify a quantity that reflects the decrease in degrees of freedom along non-relativistic RG flows. We show that the recently introduced holographic timelike entanglement entropy naturally gives rise to a new c-function applicable to all such theories. We further demonstrate the existence of this c-function in theories with Lifshitz and hyperscaling-violating fixed points, showing that, provided the null energy conditions and thermodynamic stability are satisfied, the proposed c-function exhibits the expected monotonic behavior along the RG flow.

Title: Mixed state concurrence for symmetric systems
Authors: S. H. Curnoe, D. Gajera, C. Wei
Abstract: We present a method to quantify entanglement in mixed states of highly symmetric systems. Symmetry constrains interactions between parts and predicts the degeneracies of the states. While symmetry alone produces entangled eigenstates, the thermal mixed state (density) which contains all of the eigenstate densities weighted by their Boltzmann factors is not necessarily as entangled as the eigenstates themselves because generally the mixed state can be re-expressed as a sum over densities which are less entangled. The entanglement of the mixed state is the minimum obtained by considering all such re-expressions, but there is no well-defined approach to solving this problem generally. Our method uses symmetry to explicitly construct unentangled densities, which are then optimally included in the thermal mixed state, resulting in a quantitative measure of entanglement that accounts for the reduction of entanglement arising from degenerate states. We present results for several small spin systems.

Title: Integrals of motion as slow modes in dissipative many-body operator dynamics
Authors: Tian-Hua Yang, Dmitry A. Abanin
Abstract: We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with one or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We demonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics, in the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic operators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.
