Title: Solving fractional electron states in twisted MoTe$_2$ with deep neural network
Authors: Di Luo, Timothy Zaklama, Liang Fu
Abstract: The emergence of moiré materials, such as twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),has created a fertile ground for discovering novel quantum phases of this http URL, solving many-electron problems in moiré systems presents significant challenges due to strong electron correlation and strong moiré band mixing. Recent advancements in neural quantum states hold the promise for accurate and unbiased variational solutions. Here, we introduce a powerful neural wavefunction to solve ground states of twisted MoTe2 across various fractional fillings, reaching unprecedented accuracy and system size. From the full structure factor and quantum weight, we conclude that our neural wavefunction accurately captures both the electron crystal at $\nu = 1/3$ and various fractional quantum liquids in a unified manner.

Title: Spin and Charge Transport Mediated by Fractionalized Excitations
Authors: Alexey Ermakov, Alessandro Principi
Abstract: We study charge and spin transport in systems composed of itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments of a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. For example, $\alpha-{\rm RuCl}_3$ either intrinsically doped or in proximity to graphene. Our analysis reveals distinct temperature-dependent transport behaviors due to the QSL gap and the Majorana excitation spectrum, which are greatly enhanced when the velocities of itinerant-electrons and QSL excitations become comparable. These transport characteristics could potentially be employed to reveal the fractionalized excitations of the spin liquid.

Title: Critical spin fluctuations across the superconducting dome in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$
Authors: Jacopo Radaelli, Oliver J. Lipscombe, Mengze Zhu, J. Ross Stewart, Aavishkar A. Patel, Subir Sachdev, Stephen M. Hayden
Abstract: Overdoped cuprate superconductors are strange metals above their superconducting transition temperature. In such materials, the electrical resistivity has a strong linear dependence on temperature ($T$) and electrical current is not carried by electron quasiparticles as in conventional metals. Here we demonstrate that the strange metal behavior co-exists with strongly temperature-dependent critical spin fluctuations showing dynamical scaling across the cuprate phase diagram. Our neutron scattering observations and the strange metal behavior are consistent with a spin density wave quantum phase transition in a metal with spatial disorder in the tuning parameter. Numerical computations on a Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model yield an extended `Griffiths phase' with scaling properties in agreement with observations, establishing that low-energy spin excitations and spatial disorder are central to the strange metal behavior.

Title: Universal dynamics of a pair condensate
Authors: Qing Huang, Hao Zhang, Yiqing Hao, Weiliang Yao, Daniel M. Pajerowski, Adam A. Aczel, Eun Sang Choi, Kipton Barros, Bruce Normand, Haidong Zhou, Andreas M. Läuchli, Xiaojian Bai, Shang-Shun Zhang
Abstract: Pair condensates appear in multiple branches of physics, always introducing exotic phenomena. The pair condensate in quantum magnetism is the spin nematic, whose static (quadrupolar) order is difficult to access, favoring dynamical probes. Here, we perform high-resolution neutron spectroscopy to obtain direct evidence for the presence of two spin-nematic phases induced in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na2BaNi(PO4)2 by controlling the applied magnetic field. By combining precise experiments with quantitative theoretical and numerical analysis, we identify universal dynamics arising from the pair condensate. We show explicitly how the gapless Goldstone mode influences the dispersion and induces Cherenkov-like velocity-selective decay of the gapped single-quasiparticle band. These common spectral features shed new light on spin-nematic dynamics and underline the universal phenomenology shared by pair condensates across different physical systems.

Title: Exciton-polaritons and exciton localization from a first-principles interacting Green's function formalism
Authors: Zachary N. Mauri, Christopher J. Ciccarino, Jonah B. Haber, Diana Y. Qiu, Felipe H. da Jornada
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons -- hybrid states of photons and excitons -- offer unique avenues for controlling electronic, optical, and chemical properties of materials. However, their modeling is mostly limited to formalisms that wash out atomistic details and many-body physics critical to describing real systems. Here, we present an ab initio Green's function formalism based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) wherein exciton-polaritons naturally emerge through an attractive, dynamical electron-hole exchange interaction. In MgO and crystalline pentacene, this attractive interaction dramatically reduces exciton Bohr radii and increases, by one order of magnitude, transition dipole moments of exciton-polaritons. Our calculations are in good agreement with experimental polariton dispersions in wurtzite CdS, and allow one to capture how electronic and collective excitations in materials are qualitatively modified through polaritonic effects.

Title: Atomic dynamics and local structural disorder during ultrafast melting of polycrystalline Pd
Authors: Adam Olczak, Ryszard Sobierajski, Przemyslaw Dziegielewski, Salman Ali Kahn, Zuzanna Kostera, Kirill P. Migdal, Igor Milov, Klaus Sokolowski-Tinten, Peter Zalden, Vasily V. Zhakhovsky, Jerzy Antonowicz
Abstract: The primary distinction between solid and liquid phases is mechanical rigidity, with liquids having a disordered atomic structure that allows flow. While melting is a common phase transition, its microscopic mechanisms still remain unclear. This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate ultrafast melting in polycrystalline palladium, focusing on the relationship between atomic dynamics quantified by the root-mean-squared displacement (RMSD) and local structural disorder characterized by the deviation from centrosymmetry. In the crystal bulk, melting is preceded by a gradual rise in the RMSD and local disorder. As the Lindemann limit for the RMSD is approached, the increasing concentration of lattice defects is manifested by a discontinuous rise in disorder. On melting, the rise is followed by a rapid increase in displacement, indicative of atomic flow. In contrast, the grain boundaries undergo melting through a continuous increase of both the displacement and the disorder, resembling a glass transition on heating.

Title: A scalable, reproducible platform for molecular electronic technologies
Authors: Seham Helmi, Junjie Liu, Keith Andrews, Robert Schreiber, Jonathan Bath, Harry L Anderson, Andrew J Turberfield, Arzhang Ardavan
Abstract: Molecular electronics and other technologies whose components comprise individual molecules have been pursued for half a century because the molecular scale represents the limit of miniaturisation of objects whose structure is tuneable for function. Despite the promise, practical progress has been hindered by the lack of methodologies for directed assembly of arbitrary structures applicable at the molecular this http URL nanotechnology is an emerging framework that uses programmed synthetic oligomers to encode the design of self-assembling structures with atomic precision at the nanoscale. Here, we leverage DNA-directed self-assembly to construct single-molecule electrical transport devices in high yield, precisely positioning a metal-porphyrin between two 60 nm gold nanoparticles. Following deposition on SiO2 substrates, we image and establish electrical contact via established nanofabrication techniques. Each step of the process has a high probability of success and we demonstrate device yields dramatically better than is possible using conventional approaches. Our approach is inherently scalable and adaptable to devices incorporating multiple heterogenous functional molecular components, finally offering a realistic framework for the realisation of classical and quantum molecular technologies.

Title: Plasmon-Plasmon Interaction in Nanoparticle Assemblies: Role of the Dipole-Quadrupole Coupling
Authors: Olivier Masset, Roland Bastardis, Francois Vernay
Abstract: The synthesis of metallic nanoparticle assemblies is nowadays well-controlled, such that these systems offer the possibility of controlling light at a sub-wavelength scale, thanks, for instance, to surface plasmons. Determining the energy dispersion of plasmons likely to couple to light within these nanostructures is, therefore, a necessary preliminary task on the way to understanding both their photonic properties and their physical nature, namely the role of the quadrupole contribution. Starting with a general model that takes account of all energy modes, we show that its low-lying energy dispersion gained numerically, can be compared to that of a minimal model that treats dipoles and quadrupoles on the same footing. The main advantage of the latter relies on the fact that its formulation is tractable, such that a semi-analytical Bogoliubov transformation allows one to access the experimentally relevant energy bands. Based on this semi-analytical derivation, we determine quantitatively the limit of validity of the dipole-only model, the presently proposed dipole and quadrupole model, compared to a full-plasmon-mode Hamiltonian. The results show that the dispersion relation, which includes dipoles and quadrupoles, is sufficient to capture the low-energy physics at play in most experimental situations. Besides, we show that at small lattice spacing, the contribution of quadrupoles is dominant around the Brillouin zone center.

Title: Quantized Magneto-Terahertz Effects in the Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ Thin Films
Authors: Xingyue Han, An-Hsi Chen, Matthew Brahlek, Liang Wu
Abstract: MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) is an ideal platform for studying the interplay between magnetism and topology. Many exotic topological phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator, have been observed in few-layer MBT. A key feature in MBT is the emergence of the surface exchange gap, which lies in the milli-electron-volt range (1 THz corresponds to 4.14 meV). This makes THz spectroscopy a powerful tool to probe the associated topological physics. In this study, we report the THz spectra of Faraday and Kerr rotations in MBT thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By varying the external magnetic field, we observe three magnetic states: the antiferromagnetic state, the canted antiferromagnetic state, and the ferromagnetic state. Our terahertz results show a quantized Hall state under 6 T in both 6 SL and 7 SL samples without gate voltage. These findings provide new insights into the magneto-terahertz properties of MBT and its potential for topological spintronic applications.

Title: Graphene-hBN interlayer interactions from quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: Kittithat Krongchon, Tawfiqur Rakib, Elif Ertekin, Harley T. Johnson, Lucas K. Wagner
Abstract: The interaction between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic and structural properties of graphene-based devices. In this work, we employ quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to study the interlayer interactions and stacking-fault energy (SFE) between graphene and hBN. We generated QMC energies for several rigid bilayer stacking configurations and fitted these data to the Kolmogorov-Crespi type interlayer potential (ILP) model. Our QMC-derived potential offers a more reliable alternative to conventional density functional theory methods, which are prone to errors in predicting properties in van der Waals materials. This study enables highly accurate predictions of structural and electronic properties in graphene hBN heterostructures. The resulting ILP-QMC potential is made available for further use in simulating complex systems, such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) on hBN.

Title: Effects of Strain-Induced Pseudogauge Fields on Exciton Dispersion, Transport, and Interactions in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Shiva Heidari, Shervin Parsi, Pouyan Ghaemi
Abstract: We study the effects of strain on exciton dynamics in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Using the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, we derive the exciton dispersion relation in strained TMDs and demonstrate that strain-induced pseudo-gauge fields significantly influence exciton transport and interactions. Our results show that low-energy excitons occur at finite center-of-mass momentum, leading to modified diffusion properties. Furthermore, the exciton dipole moment depends on center-of-mass momentum, which enhances exciton-exciton interactions. These findings highlight the potential of strain engineering as a powerful tool for controlling exciton transport and interactions in TMD-based optoelectronic and quantum devices.

Title: Resolving space-time structures of quantum impurities with a numerically exact few-body algorithm
Authors: Yuriel Núñez-Fernández, Maxime Debertolis, Serge Florens
Abstract: Taking advantage of time-dependent rotations of electronic orbitals, we introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopic bath, revealing that almost all rotated orbitals can be made inactive (in a trivial product state). Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimension saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow precisely the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the temporal and spatial domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.

Title: Sn-InAs nanowire shadow-defined Josephson junctions
Authors: Amritesh Sharma, An-Hsi Chen, Connor P. Dempsey, Amrita Purkayastha, Mihir Pendharkar, Susheng Tan, Christopher J. Palmstrøm, Sergey M. Frolov, Moïra Hocevar
Abstract: Interest in hybrid electronic devices for quantum science is driving the research into superconductor-semiconductor materials combinations. Here we study InAs nanowires coated with shells of $\beta$-Sn. The wires grow via the vapor-liquid-solid mechanism out from (001) InAs substrates along two orientations, forming a criss-crossing landscape. This allows us to define nanowire-shadow junctions during the low temperature Sn shell deposition by carefully choosing the deposition angle. We find that the Sn shells are uniform in thickness and the grains have a preferential in-plane epitaxial relationship with InAs. The interface between Sn and InAs is abrupt and we do not observe interdiffusion. In our nanowire devices, Sn induces a superconducting gap of order 600 $\mu$eV, switching currents reaching values up to 500 nA, and critical magnetic fields along the nanowire of up to 1.3 T. These characteristics can be leveraged in the design of superconducting transmon qubits, parametric microwave amplifiers as well as for the investigation of triplet and topological superconductivity.

Title: Mechanical Performance Database for Low-Temperature Alloys
Authors: Haoxuan Tang, Zhiyuan Chen, Xin Yao, Zhiping Xu
Abstract: Low-temperature alloys are important for a wide spectrum of modern technologies ranging from liquid hydrogen, and superconductivity to quantum technology. These applications push the limit of material performance into extreme coldness, often demanding a combination of strength and toughness to address various challenges. Steel is one of the most widely used materials in cryogenic applications. With the deployment in aerospace liquid hydrogen storage and the transportation industry, aluminum and titanium alloys are also gaining increasing attention. Emerging medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) demonstrate excellent low-temperature mechanical performance with a much-expanded space of material design. A database of low-temperature metallic alloys is collected from the literature and hosted in an open repository. The workflow of data collection includes automated extraction based on machine learning and natural language processing, supplemented by manual inspection and correction, to enhance data extraction efficiency and database quality. The product datasets cover key performance parameters including yield strength, tensile strength, elongation at fracture, Charpy impact energy, as well as detailed information on materials such as their types, chemical compositions, processing and testing conditions. Data statistics are analyzed to elucidate the research and development patterns and clarify the challenges in both scientific exploration and engineering deployment.

Title: Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz and immiscible to miscible quenching instabilities in binary Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: R. Kishor Kumar, S. Sabari, Arnaldo Gammal, Lauro Tomio
Abstract: We investigate three kinds of instabilities in binary immiscible homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, considering rubidium isotopes $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb confined in two-dimensional circular box. Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability types are studied under strong perturbations. Without external perturbation, instabilities are also probed by immiscible to miscible quenching transition (IMQT), under two different initial configurations. Our numerical simulations show that all such instability dynamics are dominated by large vortex productions and sound-wave (phonon) propagations. For long-term propagation, vortex dynamics become dominant over sound waves in the KH instability, while sound wave excitations predominate in the other cases. For all the dynamical simulations, the emergence of possible scaling laws are investigated for the compressible and incompressible parts of the kinetic energy spectra, in terms of the wave number $k$. The corresponding results are compared with the classical Kolmogorov scalings, $k^{-5/3}$ and $k^{-3}$, for turbulence, which are observed in the kinetic energy spectra at some specific time intervals. Deviating from the classical scaling, a kind of ``Bottleneck effect" is noticed in the IMQT spectra.

Title: Jamming of Elastoviscoplastic fluids in Elastic Turbulence
Authors: Christopher S. From, Vedad Dzanic, Vahid Niasar, Emilie Sauret
Abstract: Elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluid flows are driven by a non-trivial interplay between the elastic, viscous, and plastic properties, which under certain conditions can transition the otherwise laminar flow into complex flow instabilities with rich space-time-dependent dynamics. We discover that under elastic turbulence regimes, EVP fluids undergo dynamic jamming triggered by localised polymer stress deformations that facilitate the formation of solid regions trapped in local low-stress energy wells. Below the jamming transition $\phi<\phi_J$, the solid volume fraction $\phi$ scales with $\sqrt{Bi}$, where $Bi$ is the Bingham number characterizing the ratio of yield to viscous stresses, in direct agreement with theoretical approximations based on the laminar solution. The onset of this new dynamic jamming transition $\phi\geq\phi_J$ is marked by a clear deviation from the scaling $\phi \sim \sqrt{Bi}$, scaling as $\phi \sim \exp{Bi}$. We show that this instability-induced jamming transition -- analogous to that in dense suspensions -- leads to slow, minimally diffusive, and rigid-like flows with finite deformability, highlighting a novel phase-change in elastic turbulence regimes of complex fluids.

Title: High emissivity surfaces stable at high temperatures
Authors: Minok Park, Shomik Verma, Alina LaPotin, Dustin P. Nizamian, Ravi Prasher, Asegun Henry, Sean D. Lubner, Costas P. Grigoropoulos, Vassilia Zorba
Abstract: Thermal radiative energy transport is essential for high-temperature energy harvesting technologies, including thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) and grid-scale thermal energy storage. However, the inherently low emissivity of conventional high-temperature materials constrains radiative energy transfer, thereby limiting both system performance and technoeconomic viability. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast femtosecond laser-material interactions to transform diverse materials into near-blackbody surfaces with broadband spectral emissivity above 0.96. This enhancement arises from hierarchically engineered light-trapping microstructures enriched with nanoscale features, effectively decoupling surface optical properties from bulk thermomechanical properties. These laser blackened surfaces (LaBS) exhibit exceptional thermal stability, retaining high emissivity for over 100 hours at temperatures exceeding 1000°C, even in oxidizing environments. When applied as TPV thermal emitters, Ta LaBS double electrical power output from 2.19 to 4.10 W cm-2 at 2200°C while sustaining TPV conversion efficiencies above 30%. This versatile, largely material-independent technique offers a scalable and economically viable pathway to enhance emissivity for advanced thermal energy applications.

Title: Reversing Neel Vector in PT-Antiferromagnets by Nonreciprocal Light Scattering
Authors: Q. Xue, J. Zhou
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics has been receiving tremendous attention due to their ultrafast kinetics, zero stray field, immune to external magnetic field, and potential to minimizing magnetic storage devices. The optical control of AFM Neel vector has become a hectic topic during recent years, which could facilitate the AFM utilization in practical systems. In this work, we propose a nonreciprocal light scattering mechanism to flip the Neel vector in parity-time (PT) combined AFM multilayers, by estimating the energy contrast between the bistable Neel polarization configurations. We illustrate our theory using a low energy kp model, and perform ab initio calculations on two typical A-type AFM materials, MnBi2Te4 and CrI3 thin films. We show that varying incident photon frequency could modulate the relative stability between the bistable Neel vector state, which also depends on the light handedness. According to this theory, our parameter-independent calculations on the Neel vector diagram shows consistent predictive results with recent experimental observations. This mechanism provides an effective route to controlling the AFM order parameter through photo-magnetic interaction.

Title: Dynamics and stability of U(1) spin liquids beyond mean-field theory
Authors: Josef Willsher, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are long-range entangled phases of frustrated magnets exhibiting fractionalized spin excitations. In two dimensions, there is limited analytical understanding of their excitation spectra beyond parton mean-field theories, which fail to capture many features of the finite frequency dynamical response from recent experimental and numerical works. We use a self-consistent random phase approximation (RPA) for the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heiseneberg model on the triangular lattice to describe the strong spinon-spinon interactions of the U(1) Dirac QSL. We obtain quantitative results for the dynamical spin structure factor and phase diagram compatible with comprehensive numerical efforts. We extend the method to chiral QSLs, and discuss its broad range of applicability to other models and for describing inelastic neutron scattering experiments.

Title: Causal Discovery from Data Assisted by Large Language Models
Authors: Kamyar Barakati, Alexander Molak, Chris Nelson, Xiaohang Zhang, Ichiro Takeuchi, Sergei V. Kalinin
Abstract: Knowledge driven discovery of novel materials necessitates the development of the causal models for the property emergence. While in classical physical paradigm the causal relationships are deduced based on the physical principles or via experiment, rapid accumulation of observational data necessitates learning causal relationships between dissimilar aspects of materials structure and functionalities based on observations. For this, it is essential to integrate experimental data with prior domain knowledge. Here we demonstrate this approach by combining high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) data with insights derived from large language models (LLMs). By fine-tuning ChatGPT on domain-specific literature, such as arXiv papers on ferroelectrics, and combining obtained information with data-driven causal discovery, we construct adjacency matrices for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that map the causal relationships between structural, chemical, and polarization degrees of freedom in Sm-doped BiFeO3 (SmBFO). This approach enables us to hypothesize how synthesis conditions influence material properties, particularly the coercive field (E0), and guides experimental validation. The ultimate objective of this work is to develop a unified framework that integrates LLM-driven literature analysis with data-driven discovery, facilitating the precise engineering of ferroelectric materials by establishing clear connections between synthesis conditions and their resulting material properties.

Title: Multiferroic Tunnel Junction Based on above-Room-Temperature Altermagnetic CrSb, Ferroelectric In2Se3 and Ferromagnetic Fe3GaTe2
Authors: Long Zhang, Guoying Gao
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) with non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered profound fascination. Their idiosyncratic electronic structures facilitate spintronics and electronics, yet room-temperature (RT) AM-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with versatile tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and tunneling electroresistance (TER) regulated by multiferroics remain uncharted frontiers. We herein construct an experiment-fabricable above-RT MTJ, comprising altermagnetic metal/ferroelectric barrier/magnetic metal epitomized by CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2. Magnetism- (Ferroelectricity-) manipulatable TER (TMR) and both approaches-controllable spin filtering are attained. Non-ferroelectric Sb2Se3 and vacuum layer are exploited as counterpoints to discern the roles of ferroelectric and tangible barrier, respectively. High TMR, TER and spin filtering efficiency of 1031/2308 %, 328 % and ~100 % (near-perfect) can be accomplished, respectively. Our results of the initial investigation for above-RT multiferroic AM-based MTJs avail the evolution of advanced spin transport, sensing and logic nano-devices.

Title: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations for three-terminal systems with broken time-reversal symmetry
Authors: Yanchao Zhang, Shanhe Su
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in steady-state transport for three-terminal systems within the linear response regime, specifically in the presence of broken time-reversal symmetry. To quantify the TUR, we introduce a dimensionless trade-off parameter $Q_J$, and derive new bounds of $Q_J$ for both particle and heat currents under a strong constraint on the Onsager coefficients. Furthermore, we determine a universal lower bound $Q_J^{bound}\geq1.5$ for three-terminal systems in the linear response regime when the time-reversal symmetry is broken.

Title: Advances and challenges of SCAN and r2SCAN density functionals in transition-metal compounds
Authors: Yubo Zhang, Akilan Ramasamy, Kanun Pokharel, James W. Furness, Jinliang Ning, Ruiqi Zhang, Jianwei Sun
Abstract: Transition-metal compounds (TMCs) with open-shell d-electrons are characterized by a complex interplay of lattice, charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom, giving rise to a diverse range of fascinating applications. Often exhibiting exotic properties, these compounds are commonly classified as correlated systems due to strong inter-electronic interactions called Hubbard U. This inherent complexity presents significant challenges to Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), the most widely used electronic structure method in condensed matter physics and materials science. While KS-DFT is, in principle, exact for the ground-state total energy, its exchange-correlation energy must be approximated in practice. The mean-field nature of KS implementations, combined with the limitations of current exchange-correlation density functional approximations, has led to the perception that DFT is inadequate for correlated systems, particularly TMCs. Consequently, a common workaround involves augmenting DFT with an on-site Hubbard-like U correction. In recent years, the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) density functional, along with its refined variant r2SCAN, has achieved remarkable progress in accurately describing the structural, energetic, electronic, magnetic, and vibrational properties of TMCs, challenging the traditional perception of DFT's limitations. This review explores the design principles of SCAN and r2SCAN, highlights their key advancements in studying TMCs, explains the mechanisms driving these improvements, and addresses the remaining challenges in this evolving field.

Title: Electron-Chiral Phonon Coupling, Crystal Angular Momentum, and Phonon Chirality
Authors: Tomomi Tateishi, Akihito Kato, Jun-ichiro Kishine
Abstract: We explicitly derive the wavefunctions of chiral phonons propagating along the helical axis in chiral crystals and clarify the characteristics of electron-phonon interactions in chiral helical crystals. In particular, we elucidate how the conservation of not only the crystal momentum (CM) but also the crystal angular momentum (CAM) manifests in the interaction vertex. This formulation provides a microscopic framework for describing physical processes involving chiral phonons. Furthermore, we construct a phononic analogue of Zilch, a known measure of chirality carried by light, and discuss its relationship with phonon angular momentum.

Title: Autocatalysis due to combinatorial enhancement
Authors: Nanako Hirano, Akira Yoshida, Takenobu Nakamura, Naoko Nakagawa
Abstract: We demonstrate that autocatalytic reactions, where a product catalyzes its own formation, can be significantly accelerated when the product molecules are indistinguishable from each other. This ``combinatorial enhancement," analogous to the driving force of osmotic pressure, arises from the increased multiplicity of microscopic configurations. We quantify this effect with a free-energy gain, Fgain, and validate our theoretical predictions using molecular dynamics simulations. We also propose an experiment to directly test this phenomenon, potentially providing new insights into self-assembly, biomolecular binding, and other cooperative processes.

Abstract: Point defects in complex oxide thin films play a critical role in determining material properties but remain challenging to control with precision. This study introduces metal-organic pulsed laser deposition (MOPLD) as a novel synthesis technique for the precise manipulation of these defects, using LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) as a model system. By employing titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) as the titanium precursor, MOPLD achieves refined stoichiometric control in STO layers while preserving their structural integrity, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Depth-resolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that increasing TTIP flux during STO growth enhances the [TiSr]/[VSr] ratio and reduces the [VO] concentration. These defect modifications lead to a significant improvement in the low-temperature mobility of the two-dimensional electron gas at the LAO/STO interface, evidenced by distinct Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. This work underscores the potential of MOPLD to advance defect engineering in complex oxide heterostructures, opening new avenues for quantum material research.

Title: Unveiling the Quadrupole Waves in Spin Nematics

Abstract: Discovery of new states of matter is a key objective in modern condensed matter physics, which often leads to revolutionary technological advancements such as superconductivity. Quantum spin nematic, a "hidden order" that evades conventional magnetic probes, is one such state. Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$ is a potential spin nematic material, suggested by the observation of a 2-magnon Bose-Einstein condensation from above the saturation field. However, direct confirmation of the spin nematicity remains elusive. This paper presents inelastic neutron scattering spectra from the putative spin nematic phases of Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$, revealing low-energy quadrupole waves that are absent in the neighboring conventional magnetic phases. A spin-$1$ model quantitatively captures the full details of the spin excitation spectra across all low-temperature phases, providing direct evidence of the spin nematic orders. Additionally, we show evidence of the 3-magnon continuum and 2-magnon bound states in the $1/3$-magnetization plateau, revealing condensation of the 2-magnon bound state as the origin of the low-field spin nematic supersolid phase.

Title: Spontaneous Partial Order Driven by Intermolecular Interactions -- Structure and Dynamics of Ice
Authors: Tianran Chen, D. Jonathan P. Morris, Anjana Samarakoon, Isaac C. Ownby, Arnab Banerjee, Feng Ye, Douglas L. Abernathy, Zachary J. Morgan, Joseph Lanier, Konrad Siemensmeyer, Bastian Klemke, D. Alan Tennant
Abstract: Water ice's remarkable properties make it an important material across a range of disciplines. The combination of covalent and hydrogen bonds form a long-range lattice of oxygens, which hosts a disordered yet correlated hydrogen network. We observe hidden strings of 1D order within the disordered manifold of hydrogen atoms - revealed via optical phonons within a large multi-dimensional neutron scattering dataset. Our analysis shows that nearest-neighbor intermolecular interactions drive partial ordering, rather than dipole interactions, and hints at a mechanism for ice Ih's transition into ordered ice XI that may extend to other disordered phases. These insights have broader implications for non-periodic systems exhibiting local-symmetry, while enhancing our knowledge of lattice dynamics of this most intriguing material.

Title: Impact of Cooperativity on the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of the Light-induced Spin-State Switching of the Fe(phen)$_2$(SCN)$_2$ Spin-Crossover Complex
Authors: Chetana Badala Viswanatha, Johannes Stöckl, Benito Arnoldi, Johannes Knippertz, Florian Haag, Hauke Paulsen, Juliusz A. Wolny, Martin Aeschlimann, Volker Schünemann, Benjamin Stadtmüller
Abstract: Spin crossover (SCO) complexes are highly flexible bistable molecular switches with two distinct spin states that can be switched into each other by external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, or light. In the condensed phase, this spin switching phenomenon is determined not only by the chemical and structural properties of the SCO compound but also by intermolecular interactions within the SCO material and their coupling to surfaces. These interactions lead to cooperative effects in the spin switching behavior that are, for instance, reflected in the thermal hysteresis of the spin switching or determine the speed of the thermal and optical spin transition within a thin film of SCO complexes. In this study, we shed new light on the cooperativity-driven spatial and temporal dynamics of the collective light-induced spin switching of thin SCO films on a gold single crystal. We quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of the transition between the low-spin and high-spin light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST) states of the Fe(phen)$_2$(SCN)$_2$ compound. Using real-time photoemission electron microscopy with millisecond time resolution, we uncover spectroscopic signatures of the light-induced spin state switching to the LIESST state even $200\, \mu$m outside the spot of direct optical excitation. This observation is identical for both continuous wave and femtosecond laser light excitations in the visible spectral range. The timescale of the spin-switching dynamics is indicative of a photothermal process in which molecules far from the laser spot relax back to the low-spin ground state faster than those within the directly illuminated region. All of these observations highlight the crucial role of cooperative interactions in the spin state switching of the SCO thin film.

Title: Time-domain identification of distinct mechanisms for competing charge density waves in a rare-earth tritelluride

Abstract: Understanding the origin of phase transitions and the interactions between distinct phases remains a central task in condensed matter physics. Charge density wave (CDW) systems provide an ideal platform for investigating these phenomena. While the dominant CDW phases in many materials can be explained through Fermi surface nesting or electron-phonon interactions, certain CDW phase transitions remain poorly understood, challenging conventional paradigms. One notable example is rare-earth tritelluride ErTe3, which hosts two competing CDW orders. While the dominant CDW phase fits within the electron-phonon coupling framework, the formation mechanism of the subdominant CDW remains enigmatic. In this study, we combine time-and-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory to establish a time-domain approach for probing phase transitions in solid-state systems. By analyzing the distinct recovery dynamics of the two CDW orders in ErTe3 following light excitation, we reveal a novel nucleation-like growth mechanism that likely drives the secondary CDW phase transition. This work not only uncovers a previously unknown CDW formation mechanism in rare-earth tritellurides but also introduces a non-equilibrium framework for understanding phase transitions and phase competition in quantum materials.

Title: Hot-carrier thermal breakdown and S-type current-voltage characteristics in perforated graphene structures
Authors: V. Ryzhii, C. Tang, M. Ryzhii, M. S. Shur
Abstract: We investigate the carrier transport characteristics of perforated graphene layer (PGL) composed of arrays of interdigital coplanar graphene microribbons (GMRs) connected by graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. We analyze their operation at room-temperature. Under an applied bias voltage, two-dimensional electron and hole systems (2DES and 2DHS) form in adjacent GMRs. The terminal current in these PGL structures is primarily governed by thermionic transport across the GNR bridges. As electrons and holes traverse the GNRs, they induce heating in the 2DES and 2DHS, creating a positive feedback loop between carrier heating and thermionic emission. This phenomenon, characterized as hot-carrier thermal breakdown, can give rise to S-shaped inter-GMR current-voltage characteristics. These unique transport properties make PGLs promising candidates for fast, voltage-controlled room-temperature switches and electromagnetic radiation detectors.

Title: Competing Quantum Orders in 6R-TaS$_2$: Unconventional Superconductivity, Charge Order, and an Anomalous Hall Effect phase
Authors: V. Sazgari, J.N. Graham, S.S. Islam, 1 P. Král, O. Gerguri, A. Achari, J.N. Tangermann, H. Gopakumar, G. Simutis, M. Janoschek, M. Bartkowiak, R. Khasanov, H. Luetkens, F.O. von Rohr, R.R. Nair, Z. Guguchia
Abstract: The transition metal dichalcogenide 6R-TaS$_{2}$ offers a natural platform for studying the interplay among charge density wave (CDW) order, superconductivity, and transport anomalies. Recent findings reveal that, in the intermediate temperature range between charge order and superconductivity, a hidden order emerges around $T^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 35 K-as evidenced by strong magnetoresistance and an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). However, the nature of the superconducting pairing, the hidden order, and their relationship with the CDW remain unclear. Using ${\mu}$SR, magnetotransport, susceptibility, and hydrostatic pressure techniques, we identify a nodal superconducting state with low superfluid density at ambient pressure, with no spontaneous magnetic order detected below $T^{*}$. This indicates that the AHE originates from the band structure rather than magnetism. Under pressures up to 2 GPa, the superfluid density rises markedly in correlation with the superconducting transition temperature, the nodal pairing shifts to a nodeless state, and the CDW onset is reduced by half. Notably, AHE is fully suppressed and magnetoresistance drops by 50${\%}$ within just 0.2 GPa, highlighting the fragility of the hidden order. These results reveal an unconventional superconducting pairing in 6R-TaS$_{2}$, competing with both CDW and hidden orders through weakened interlayer coupling and competition for the same electronic states. With a multifaceted approach, we establish a comprehensive phase diagram that reveals the intricate interplay and competition between the intertwined quantum orders in 6R-TaS$_{2}$.

Title: Nonresonant Casimir-Polder repulsion with a monolayer topological insulator
Authors: Bing-Sui Lu
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force acting on a metastable right-circularly polarized state of a two-level atomic system in the presence of a monolayer topological insulator inhabiting an anomalous quantum Hall insulator state with a negative Chern number, finding that the force can be repulsive for a certain range within the far-field region. By considering stanene irradiated by circularly polarized monochromatic laser light as a material example of a monolayer topological insulator, we study the effect of the frequency dispersion in the conductivity tensor on the force behavior, finding that the dispersion generally leads to a slight downward shift of the force relative to that predicted by a nondispersive approximation, as well as a slight reduction of the range over which the force is repulsive.

Title: Dynamical Classification of Supercooled Liquids: Critical Cooling Rates and Entropic Signatures
Authors: B Zhang, M. Zhang, D. Y. Sun, X. G. Gong
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate supercooled liquids formed at cooling rates below and above the critical cooling rate (CCR). By analyzing the distribution of short-time averaged potential energies (DoPE) and crystallization behaviors, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes in supercooled liquids: the glass-forming regime (GFR) and the crystal-forming regime (CFR). For systems cooled below CCR (CFR), the DoPE exhibits a sharp peak, indicative of reduced configurational entropy. In contrast, liquids cooled above CCR (GFR) display a broad DoPE distribution, reflecting higher configurational entropy. These findings establish a robust classification framework for supercooled liquids. Further analysis reveals a crossover temperature (T_x) in both regimes, consistent with the freezing temperature (T_f). Near T_x, crystallization barrier-temperature relationships exhibit abrupt changes. Below T_x, CFR crystallizes marginally faster than GFR, whereas above T_x, the influence of cooling rates on crystallization rates diminishes. These results further categorize GFR and CFR into high and low-temperature sub-regimes, highlighting the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics in supercooled liquids.

Title: Comment on Unusual violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law at ultralow temperatures in topological compensated semimetals
Authors: Kamran Behnia, Shiyan Li, Johnpierre Paglione, Louis Taillefer
Abstract: Recently, Wang et al. [1] reported on an unusual violation of Wiedemann-Franz law in three semimetals. We compare their observations to our observations in a variety of systems, where the apparent WF law violations in the same temperature range arise as a consequence of electron-phonon decoupling. Given the empirical similarity of their data with these cases, the most plausible explanation for the reported violation is an experimental artefact.

Title: Complexity of Bose-Einstein condensates at finite temperature
Authors: Chang-Yan Wang
Abstract: We investigate the geometric quantum complexity of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at finite temperature. Specifically, we use the Bures and Sjöqvist metrics -- generalizations of the Fubini-Study metric for mixed quantum states, as well as the Nielsen geometric complexity approach based on purification of mixed states. Starting from the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian of BEC, which exhibits an $SU(1,1)$ symmetry, we explicitly derive and compare the complexities arising from these three distinct measures. For the Bures and Sjöqvist metrics, analytical and numerical evaluations of the corresponding geodesics are provided, revealing characteristic scaling behaviors with respect to temperature. In the Nielsen complexity approach, we rigorously handle the gauge freedoms associated with mixed state purification and non-uniqueness unitary operations, demonstrating that the resulting complexity aligns precisely with the Bures metric. Our work provides a compara

Title: Flexible manipulation of chiral spin state by chemical bond in Mn triangular lattice magnet
Authors: Jiyuan Xu, Xin Liu, Li Ma, Guoke Li, Dewei Zhao, Congmian Zhen, Denglu Hou
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of chemical bonds on the magnetic structure of materials, a less explored area compared to their effect on crystal stability. By analyzing the strength and directionality of chemical bonds using the electron localization function (ELF) and charge density difference (CDD) methods, we examine their impact on magnetic exchange interactions and magnetocrystalline anisotropy under specific interstitial conditions in Mn4X compounds. Our findings indicate that these properties can effectively modulate the magnetic ground state. This work not only elucidates the varied magnetism observed in Mn triangular lattice magnets but also proposes an approach for engineering chiral spin states through chemical bonding manipulation.

Abstract: The beauty of snowflakes, the fractal patterns with the hexagonal symmetry, reflects the crystal structure of ice. The honeycomb network of H2O molecules stacks along the perpendicular direction, composing the hexagonal crystalline ice (ice Ih phase). What can one see if one layer of ice is extracted and confined to a two-dimensional (2D) sheet? Martyite Zn3(V2O7)(OH)2 2H2O, a mineral with the honeycomb lattice of H2O in the porous framework, is an ideal system to study such monolayer ice. Due to the geometrical frustration and 2D nature of the honeycomb lattice, H2O molecules are dynamically disordered at room temperature, and the most stable molecular arrangement is nontrivial. In this study, we reveal disorder-order transitions of H2O in martyite using the single-crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The XRD results visualize the formation of hydrogen-bonded toroidal H2O hexamers, leading to the electric ferrotoroidal order below 200 K. Combined with the MD simulations, we discuss the formation process of the H2O hexamers and how they compromise the molecular arrangement towards lower temperatures. Our results unveil the ground state of monolayer ice, a fundamental knowledge to understand the polymorphism of H2O.

Title: Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing
Authors: Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention to establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has proposed the entropic quantum gravity approach that proposes an action for gravity given by the quantum relative entropy between the metrics associated to a manifold. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the entropic quantum gravity action. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and open new avenues for establishing fundamental relations between brain research, machine learning and entropic quantum gravity.

Title: ARPES studies of Hf(0001) surface: flat bands formation in the dice lattice
Authors: Laxman Nagireddy, Saleem Ayaz Khan, Maria Christine Richter, Olivier Heckmann, Mauro Fanciulli, Natalia Olszowska, Marcin Rosmus, Weimin Wang, Laurent Nicolaï, Ján Minár, Karol Hricovini
Abstract: We present the first electronic structure measurements of the Hf(0001) single-crystal surface using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The ARPES results are supported by theoretical calculations performed using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) method and the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green function method. In addition to insight into the electronic structure of Hf(0001), our results reveal the impact of surface contamination, particularly oxygen and carbon, on the predicted surface state. Moreover, we observe a flat band induced by both, the presence of oxygen and the dice structure of the surface. The orbital texture of Hf bands is confirmed by linear dichroism studies

Title: High-efficiency computational methodologies for electronic properties and structural characterization of Ge-Sb-Te based phase change materials
Authors: Shanzhong Xie, Kan-Hao Xue, Shaojie Yuan, Shengxin Yang, Heng Yu, Rongchuan Gu, Ming Xu, Xiangshui Miao
Abstract: Theoretical simulation to phase change materials such as Ge-Sb-Te has suffered from two methodology issues. On the one hand, there is a lack of efficient band gap correction method for density functional theory, which is suitable for these materials in both crystalline and amorphous phases, though the computational complexity should be kept at the local density approximation level. On the other hand, analysis of the coordination number in amorphous phases relies on an integration involving the radial distribution function, which adds to the complexity. In this work, we find that the shell DFT-1/2 method offers an overall band gap accuracy for phase change materials comparable to HSE06 hybrid functional, though its computational cost is around three orders of magnitude lower. Moreover, the mixed length-angle coordination number theory enables calculating the coordination numbers in the amorphous phase directly from the structure, with definite outcomes. The two methodologies could be helpful for high throughput simulation of phase change materials.

Abstract: To sustainably support the ongoing energetic transition, we need functional metal oxides capable of converting energy, and produce storage, and sensing devices. However, these materials suffer from a high economic cost of manufacturing, and their production in a sustainable way is, to date, a milestone. Additionally, the technical challenges, such as scalability and integration of silicon for industrial processing using microelectronic technologies, impose strict conditions for the entire materials process. In this work, we engineer {\alpha}-quartz virtual substrates up to 4 inches facilitating the large-scale and sustainable integration of multifunctional epitaxial ZnO metal oxide microwire films on silicon. These materials are exclusively manufactured on silicon using solution chemistry, providing single-chip solutions that can meet strict economic constraints for developing sustainable devices at a lower cost. Through this integrative technology, we demonstrate the microfabrication of epitaxial (110)ZnO/(100){\alpha}-quartz/(100)silicon piezoelectric membrane resonators at the wafer-scale with potential applications in energy conversion and sensing. We combined four dimensional (4D)-STEM diffraction technology and Piezoelectric Force Microscopy (PFM) to establish a correlation between out of plane crystalline strain and piezoelectric response in epitaxial (110) ZnO at the microscale. Finally, we proved the fabrication of 800 nm thick (110) ZnO suspended membranes that can be transferred to flexible substrates, making them suitable for flexible devices.

Title: The effect of a band gap gradient on the radiative losses in the open circuit voltage of solar cells
Authors: Sevan Gharabeiki, Francesco Lodola, Tilly Schaaf, Taowen Wang, Michele Melchiorre, Nathalie Valle, Jérémy Niclout, Manha Ali, Yucheng Hu, Gunnar Kusch, Rachel A. Oliver, Susanne Siebentritt
Abstract: The radiative open circuit voltage loss in a solar cell occurs because the absorptance spectrum near the band gap shows gradual increase rather than sharp step function like transition. This broadening effect has been attributed to band gap fluctuations and or to Urbach tails. In this report, we use modelling based on Planck s generalized law to distinguish between these two effects. Our results demonstrate that Urbach tails have only a minimal effect on the absorptance edge broadening and clarify that even an ideal direct semiconductor with no band gap fluctuations shows broadening at the absorptance onset. Furthermore, state of the art inorganic thin film solar cells often incorporate a band gap gradient across their thickness, which can further contribute to absorptance broadening. Using Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) absorbers as a case study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of voltage losses through absolute photoluminescence and electroluminescence spectroscopy, combined with photospectrometry and high-spatial-resolution cathodoluminescence measurements. We find that the loss analysis based on the combination of radiative, generation and non-radiative losses is complete. Samples with a graded band gap profile show more pronounced broadening of the absorptance onset and up to 16 mV higher radiative losses compared to the samples with uniform band gap. There is indication, that band gap-graded samples also have larger lateral band gap inhomogeneity.

Title: Finite-time performance of a cyclic 2d quantum Ising heat engine
Authors: S. P. Katoorani, C. Kohlfürst, F. Queisser, G. Schaller, R. Schützhold
Abstract: We discuss the limit cycle regime of a finite-time quantum Otto cycle with a frictionless two-dimensional anisotropic Ising model as the working fluid. From Onsagers exact equilibrium solution, we first find optimal parameters for the operational modes of work extraction and cooling for infinitely slow cycles. The equilibrium points in these optimal cycles correspond to different phases of the model, such that the non-equilibrium dynamics during the cycle bypasses the phase transition. Finite-time cycles allow for finite power extraction or cooling currents, but for such cycles we point out that -- already within the regime of weak system-reservoir coupling -- energetic changes of the system during dissipative strokes may contain a significant portion of coupling and decoupling control work and should thus not be directly identified with heat. For ultrafast cycles, the required control work spoils performance, such that to maximize work extraction or cooling heat per cycle time, there is an optimal cycle duration. We also find that net zero-energy transitions may lead to undesired reservoir heating.

Title: Raman Circular Dichroism and Quantum Geometry of Chiral Quantum Spin Liquids
Authors: Eduard Koller, Valentin Leeb, Natalia B. Perkins, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: We show that Raman circular dichroism (RCD) is a powerful probe of chiral quantum spin liquids (QSL) governed by the topology of fractionalized spin excitations. Starting from the Loudon-Fleury formalism of Mott insulators, we compute the RCD and demonstrate that it is identical to the result obtained from a direct light-matter coupling to effective spinon bands. The RCD signal originates from contributions of Berry curvature and quantum metric. To illustrate this, we apply our approach to two examples - the Kitaev honeycomb model in a magnetic field and a chiral $U(1)$ QSL on the triangular lattice - and discuss its experimental relevance for candidate materials.

Title: Machine Learning-Integrated Modeling of Thermal Properties and Relaxation Dynamics in Metallic Glasses
Authors: Ngo T. Que, Anh D. Phan, Truyen Tran, Pham T. Huy, Mai X. Trang, Thien V. Luong
Abstract: Metallic glasses are a promising class of materials celebrated for their exceptional thermal and mechanical properties. However, accurately predicting and understanding the melting temperature (T_m) and glass transition temperature (T_g) remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach that integrates machine learning (ML) models with theoretical methods to predict and analyze these key thermal properties in metallic glasses. Our ML models using distributional data derived from elemental composition-based features obtain high accuracy while minimizing data preprocessing complexity. Furthermore, we explore the correlation between T_m and T_g to elucidate their dependence on alloy composition and thermodynamic behavior. When the T_g value of metallic glasses is known, further analysis using the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory provides a deeper understanding of structural relaxation dynamics. This integrated framework establishes a quantitative description consistent with experimental data and previous works and paves the way for the efficient design and discovery of advanced materials with tailored thermal properties.

Title: PET-MAD, a universal interatomic potential for advanced materials modeling
Authors: Arslan Mazitov, Filippo Bigi, Matthias Kellner, Paolo Pegolo, Davide Tisi, Guillaume Fraux, Sergey Pozdnyakov, Philip Loche, Michele Ceriotti
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have greatly extended the reach of atomic-scale simulations, offering the accuracy of first-principles calculations at a fraction of the effort. Leveraging large quantum mechanical databases and expressive architectures, recent "universal" models deliver qualitative accuracy across the periodic table but are often biased toward low-energy configurations. We introduce PET-MAD, a generally applicable MLIP trained on a dataset combining stable inorganic and organic solids, systematically modified to enhance atomic diversity. Using a moderate but highly-consistent level of electronic-structure theory, we assess PET-MAD's accuracy on established benchmarks and advanced simulations of six materials. PET-MAD rivals state-of-the-art MLIPs for inorganic solids, while also being reliable for molecules, organic materials, and surfaces. It is stable and fast, enabling, out-of-the-box, the near-quantitative study of thermal and quantum mechanical fluctuations, functional properties, and phase transitions. It can be efficiently fine-tuned to deliver full quantum mechanical accuracy with a minimal number of targeted calculations.

Title: Quantum transport in the presence of a chiral molecular potential
Authors: Ragheed Alhyder, Mikhail Lemeshko, Alberto Cappellaro
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in a two-dimensional electron system coupled to a chiral molecular potential, demonstrating how molecular chirality and orientation affect charge and spin transport properties. We propose a minimal model for realizing true chiral symmetry breaking on a magnetized surface and show, with a crucial role played by the tilt angle of the molecular dipole with respect to the surface. For non-zero tilting, we show that the Hall response exhibits clear signatures of chirality-induced effects, both in charge and spin-resolved observables. Concerning the former, tilted enantiomers produce asymmetric Hall conductances and, even more remarkably, the persistence of this feature in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) signals how the enantiospecific charge response results from electron scattering off the molecular potential. Concerning spin-resolved observables where SOC plays a relevant role, we reveal that chiral symmetry breaking is crucial in enabling spin-flipping processes.

Title: Complex spin-density-wave ordering in La$_4$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$
Authors: Yantao Cao, Andi Liu, Bin Wang, Mingxin Zhang, Yanpeng Qi, Thomas J. Hicken, Hubertus Luetkens, Zhendong Fu, Jason S. Gardner, Jinkui Zhao, Hanjie Guo
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in layered nickelates under pressure has recently triggered enormous interest. Studies of these compounds have revealed a density-wave-like transition at ambient pressure, though its connection with superconductivity is still not well understood. Here, we report a detailed \msr\ study on single crystals of trilayer nickelate \LNO\ at ambient pressure. We have identified a spin-density-wave (SDW) transition at the temperature of $T_\mathrm{N} \sim$130 K, as well as a broad crossover around 70 - 100 K. Based on the temperature dependence of the muon precession amplitudes, we attribute this additional crossover either to a spin reorientation, or to an inhomogeneous SDW ordering.

Title: Spinor ice correlation in flat-band electronic states on kagome and pyrochlore lattices with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Hiroki Nakai, Masafumi Udagawa, Chisa Hotta
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and transformation of pinch-point singularities in the excitation spectrum of electronic flat band systems on kagome and pyrochlore lattices with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Coulomb interactions. While pinch points are widely recognized as signatures of classical spin liquids, they also appear in electronic flat-band systems when there exists a singular band-touching point to dispersive bands. We explore how SOC modifies the pinch-point structure in the chiral spin flat-band metallic state, which we term spinor-ice. The pinch point profile can rotate or redistribute its spectral weight, governed by a prefactor in the spectral function that primarily depends on the direction of the ground-state spin polarization, where we show that SOC flat bands could be experimentally probed by rotating the spin polarization of the injected electron to infer internal magnetic structures. These observations are discussed in conjunction with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and the application to the potential SOC flat-band material $\rm CsW_2O_6$. We also demonstrate the persistent residual pinch-point features under Coulomb interactions and deviations from the ideal flat-band limit.

Title: Enhancing Swelling Kinetics of pNIPAM Lyogels: The Role of Crosslinking, Copolymerization, and Solvent
Authors: Kathrin Marina Eckert, Jelisa Bonsen, Anja Hajnal, Johannes Gmeiner, Jonah Hasse, Muhammad Adrian, Julian Karsten, Patrick A. Kißling, Alexander Penn, Bodo Fiedler, Gerrit A. Luinstra, Irina Smirnova
Abstract: Stimuli-responsive lyogels are known for their ability to undergo significant macroscopic changes when exposed to external stimuli. While thermo-responsive gels, such as poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM), have been extensively studied across various applications, solvent-induced swelling has predominantly been investigated in aqueous solutions. This study explores the tailoring of lyogel formulations for future applications by controlling their solvent-induced swelling behavior, comparing both homopolymeric and semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (semi-IPNs). For the first time, the impact of chemical and physical crosslinking, as well as copolymer inclusion, on the swelling behavior and mechanical properties of lyogels in organic solvents is examined and compared with solvent-induced swelling kinetics measurements. The results demonstrate that increasing chemically crosslinking in homopolymers and physically crosslinking in semi-IPNs enhances mechanical stability, while improving mass transport properties and solvent exchange kinetics. However, an increase in crosslinking results in a prolonged response time and a reduction in the overall swelling capacity of the lyogels. Furthermore, variations in solvent properties, including molecular size and diffusion rates, significantly influence the swelling kinetics, whereas smaller, faster-diffusing solvents leading to more pronounced solvent spillage effects. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between gel formulation, network structure, and solvent nature in determining the solvent-induced swelling kinetics of lyogels, providing insights into how these materials can be tailored for specific applications especially those requiring short response times and optimized mechanical properties.

Authors: Vincenzo Calabrese, Silvia Nardone, Amy Q. Shen, Simon J. Haward
Abstract: Capillary thinning of polymeric fluids is central to biological and industrial processes, yet the mechanisms governing thinning dynamics remain unresolved, especially for semi-flexible polymers. Using ideal solutions of semi-flexible DNA, we validate a predictive model for exponential capillary thinning that accounts for each polymer in the molecular weight distribution. For semi-flexible polymers, self-selection of the exponential time constant occurs by a fundamentally different mechanism than for highly flexible systems, and is not simply governed by the longest polymer relaxation time.

Title: Visualizing isospin magnetic texture and intervalley exchange interaction in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene

Abstract: Multilayer rhombohedral graphene offers a rich platform for strong electron interactions without a moire superlattice. The in situ tunable band structure and nontrivial topology lead to a variety of novel correlated electronic states with isospin order dictated by the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and Hunds exchange interactions. However, versatile methods for mapping local isospin textures and determining the exchange energies are currently lacking. Utilizing a nanoscale superconducting quantum interference device in a vector magnetic field, we image the magnetization textures in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene. We reveal sharp magnetic phase transitions marking spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking. In the quarter metal phase, the spin and orbital moments align closely, providing a bound on the spin-orbit coupling energy. The half metal phase is shown to have a very small magnetic anisotropy, providing the first experimental lower bound on the intervalley Hunds exchange interaction energy, which is found to be close to its theoretical upper bound. By contrasting to magnetotransport measurements, we show that high-field electronic states are governed by unique topological magnetic band reconstruction. The ability to resolve the local isospin texture and the different interaction energies, paves the way to a better understanding of the phase transition hierarchy and the numerous correlated electronic states arising from spontaneous and induced isospin symmetry breaking in graphene heterostructures.

Title: Occupation deficiency in layered structures of UNi$_{x}$Sb$_2$ ($ 0 \leq x \leq 1 $) studied by density functional theory supercell calculations
Authors: Mirosław Werwiński, Andrzej Szajek (Institute of Molecular Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznań, Poland)
Abstract: The five crystal structures of selected UNi$_{x}$Sb$_2$ compositions are investigated by density functional theory supercell calculations. The considered phases are USb$_2$, UNi$_{0.33}$Sb$_2$, UNi$_{0.5}$Sb$_2$, UNi$_{0.66}$Sb$_2$, and UNiSb$_2$ ($x$ = 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 1). The occupation deficiency of Ni is modeled by removing the Ni layers from constructed supercells, followed by relaxation of the structures. A linear dependence of the lattice parameter $c$ versus Ni concentration $x$ is observed, same, fulfilling the empirical Vegard's law. The agreement between results of our calculations with the empirical data from literature confirms the validity of our approach of supercells with empty Ni layers, at least in predicting of lattice parameters. The calculated with orbital polarization magnetic moments on uranium atoms decrease from 1.70 $\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ to 1.61 $\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ with increasing Ni concentration $x$. In comparison to available empirical data of USb$_2$ and UNi$_{0.5}$Sb$_2$, the magnetic moments calculated with orbital polarization are less than 10% smaller.

Title: Analyzing Defect Complex Structures of PL6 in SiC: Insights from First-Principles Screening
Authors: Xin Zhao, Mingzhe Liu, Chang-Kui Duan
Abstract: The PL6 color center in 4H-SiC has attracted significant research attention owing to its remarkable spin and optical properties at ambient temperatures. Unlike many color centers that require cryogenic conditions to function, the PL6 center maintains optical activity even at room temperature or higher, benefiting from the material's high thermal conductivity and chemical stability. To elucidate the origin of PL6's distinctive characteristics and clarify its microscopic structure in the crystal, this study conducts a comprehensive investigation of potential defect complexes through systematic first-principles calculations. Our computational approach rigorously evaluates the electronic structures and spin-related properties of various defect configurations, enabling reasonable identification of the most probable atomic arrangement responsible for the observed characteristics of PL6. Our analysis identifies a limited set of candidate structures with ${\rm C_{3v}}$-like symmetry consistent with known experimental signatures. Among these, two defect complexes emerge as the most likely PL6 candidates. The findings suggest that targeted experimental studies, such as electron spin resonance and optically detected magnetic resonance, could further clarify the nature of the PL6 center, while additional theoretical investigations on transition matrix elements and defect formation dynamics are warranted.

Title: In situ vs ex situ: Comparing the structure of PNIPAM microgels at the air/water and air/solid interfaces
Authors: Hayden Robertson, Joanne Zimmer, Anuar Sifuentes Name, Cassia Lux, Sebastian Stock, Regine von Klitzing, Olaf Soltwedel
Abstract: The paper addresses the vertical and lateral structure of microgels (MGs) layers at the air/water interface and the effect of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) transfer on solid substrates on the structure. The MGs are based on poly($N$-isopropylacrylamide) networks. For studying the structure at the air/water interface specular and off-specular X-ray reflectivity (OSR/XRR) allows in situ measurements without any labelling techniques. The initial ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) scans of LB-transferred MGs at the air/solid interface reveal strong lateral 2D hexagonal ordering across a broad range of lateral surface pressures at the air/water interface before LB-transfer. Notably, for the first time, these results were confirmed by OSR, demonstrating the existence of the long-range hexagonal ordering at low and intermediate surface pressures. For in situ conditions and upon uniaxial compression at the air/water interface, the MG lattice constant decreases non-monotonically. This indicates the formation of domains at low pressures, that approach each other and only compress when the surface isotherm reaches a plateau. Comparing results of in situ and ex situ measurements, our study clearly shows a transfer effect during the LB-deposition on the lateral ordering of the MGs: The distance between the particles decrease during LB-transfer and at high pressures ($\Pi\,>\,22\,\mathrm{mNm^{-1}}$) a second distance occurs indicating small domains with hexagonal internal ordering. The novel surface characterisation approaches here highlight the use of both XRR and OSR to probe the vertical and lateral structure of adsorbed MGs, offering in situ, non-invasive insights without the need for doping or transfer-induced artefacts.

Title: Curie temperature study of the Y(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ and Zr(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ systems using mean-field theory and Monte Carlo method
Authors: Bartosz Wasilewski (1), Wojciech Marciniak (2), Mirosław Werwiński (1) ((1) Institute of Molecular Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznań, Poland, (2) Institute of Physics, Faculty of Technical Physics, Poznań University of Technology, Poznań, Poland)
Abstract: The cubic Laves phases including YFe$_2$, YCo$_2$, ZrFe$_2$, and ZrCo$_2$ are considered as promising candidates for application in hydrogen storage and magnetic refrigeration. While YFe$_2$ and ZrFe$_2$ are ferromagnets, alloying with Co decreases magnetic moments and Curie temperatures ($T_\mathrm{C}$) of pseudobinary Zr(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ and Y(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ systems, leading to the paramagnetic states of YCo$_2$ and ZrCo$_2$. The following study focus on the investigation of Curie temperature of the Y(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ and Zr(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ system from first principles. To do it, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and the mean field theory (MFT) based on the disordered local moments (DLM) calculations are used. The DLM-MFT results agree qualitatively with the experiment and preserve the characteristic features of $T_\mathrm{C}(x)$ dependencies for both Y(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ and Zr(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$. However, we have encountered complications in the Co-rich regions due to failure of the local density approximation (LDA) in describing the Co magnetic moment in the DLM state. The analysis of Fe-Fe exchange couplings for YFe$_2$ and ZrFe$_2$ phases indicates that the nearest-neighbor interactions play the main role in the formation of $T_{\mathrm{C}}$.

Title: Inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation and entropy production
Authors: Van Tuan Vo, Andreas Dechant, Keiji Saito
Abstract: Nonequilibrium current fluctuations represent one of the central topics in nonequilibrium physics. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is widely acclaimed for rigorously establishing a lower bound on current fluctuations, expressed in terms of the entropy production rate and the average current. In this study, we focus on an upper bound for the fluctuations, referred to as the inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation (iTUR). We derive a universal iTUR expression in terms of the entropy production rate for continuous-variable systems governed by over-damped Langevin equations, as well as for discrete-variable systems described by Markov jump processes. The iTUR establishes a no-go theorem prohibiting perpetual superdiffusion in systems with a finite entropy production rate and a finite spectral gap. The divergence of the variance of any current becomes possible only when the spectral gap vanishes or the entropy production rate diverges. As a relevant experimental scenario, we apply the iTUR to the phenomenon of giant diffusion, emphasizing the pivotal roles of the spectral gap and entropy production.

Title: Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered Critical Spin Chain
Authors: Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.

Title: In situ engineering hexagonal boron nitride in van der Waals heterostructures with selective SF6 etching
Authors: Hitesh Agarwal, Antoine Reserbat-Plantey, David Barcons Ruiz, Karuppasammy Soundarapandian, Geng Li, Vahagn Mkhitaryan, Johann Osmond, Helena Lozano, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Petr Stepanov, Frank. H. L. Koppens, Roshan Krishna Kumar
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures are at the forefront in materials heterostructure engineering, offering the ultimate control in layer selectivity and capability to combine virtually any material. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), the most commonly used dielectric material, has proven indispensable in this field, allowing the encapsulation of active 2D materials preserving their exceptional electronic quality. However, not all device applications require full encapsulation but rather require open surfaces, or even selective patterning of hBN layers. Here, we report on a procedure to engineer top hBN layers within van der Waals heterostructures while preserving the underlying active 2D layers. Using a soft selective SF6 etching combined with a series of pre and post-etching treatments, we demonstrate that pristine surfaces can be exposed with atomic flatness while preserving the active layers electronic quality. We benchmark our technique using graphene encapsulated with hBN Hall bar devices. Using Raman spectroscopy combined with quantum transport, we show high quality can be preserved in etched regions by demonstrating low temperature carrier mobilities of 200,000 cm2Vs-1, ballistic transport probed through magnetic focusing, and intrinsic room temperature phonon-limited mobilities. Atomic force microscopy brooming and O2 plasma cleaning are identified as key pre-etching steps to obtaining pristine open surfaces while preserving electronic quality. The technique provides a clean method for opening windows into mesoscopic van der Waals devices that can be used for local probe experiments, patterning top hBN in situ, and exposing 2D layers to their environment for sensing applications.

Title: Extrinsic Geometry and Gappable Edges in Rotationally Invariant Topological Phases
Authors: Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn
Abstract: Recent work on Abelian topological phases with rotational symmetry has raised the question of whether rotational symmetry can protect gapless propagating edge modes. Here we address this issue by considering the coupling of topological phases to the extrinsic geometry of the background. First, we analyze an effective hydrodynamic theory for an Abelian topological phase with vanishing Hall conductance. After integrating out the bulk hydrodynamic degrees of freedom, we identify charge neutral, rotationally invariant mass terms by coupling the propagating boundary modes to the extrinsic geometry. This allows us to integrate out the edge modes and we find a gapped theory described by a local induced action that depends on the extrinsic geometry of the boundary, regardless of the shift. Finally, we apply these ideas to a microscopic theory and find the explicit bulk terms which respect gauge and rotational symmetry and open a gap in the edge spectrum.

Title: Classes of non-Gaussian random matrices: long-range eigenvalue correlations and non-ergodic extended eigenvectors
Authors: Joseph W. Baron
Abstract: The remarkable universality of the eigenvalue correlation functions is perhaps one of the most salient findings in random matrix theory. Particularly for short-range separations of the eigenvalues, the correlation functions have been shown to be robust to many changes in the random matrix ensemble, and are often well-predicted by results corresponding to Gaussian random matrices in many applications. In this work, we show that, in contrast, the long-range correlations of the eigenvalues of random matrices are more sensitive. Using a path-integral approach, we identify classes of statistical deviations from the Gaussian Orthogonal random matrix Ensemble (GOE) that give rise to long-range correlations. We provide closed-form analytical expressions for the eigenvalue compressibility and two-point correlations, which ordinarily vanish for the GOE, but are non-zero here. These expressions are universal in the limit of small non-Gaussianity. We discuss how these results suggest the presence of non-ergodic eigenvectors, and we verify numerically that the eigenvector component distributions of a wide variety of non-Gaussian ensembles exhibit the associated power-law tails. We also comment on how these findings reveal the need to go beyond simple mean-field theories in disordered systems with non-Gaussian interactions.

Title: Analyzing Heat Transport in Crystalline Polymers in Real and Reciprocal Space
Authors: Lukas Reicht, Lukas Legenstein, Sandro Wieser, Egbert Zojer
Abstract: Heat transport can be modelled with a variety of approaches in real space (using molecular dynamics) or in reciprocal space (using the Boltzmann transport equation). Employing two conceptually different approaches of each type, we study heat transport in crystalline polyethylene and polythiophene. We find that consistent results can be obtained when using highly efficient and accurate machine-learned potentials, provided that the physical intricacies of the considered materials and methods are correctly accounted for. For polythiophene this turns out to be comparably straightforward, while for polyethylene we find that the inclusion of higher-order anharmonicities is crucial to avoid a massive overestimation of the thermal conductivity. The responsible long-lived phonons are found at relatively high frequencies between 11 THz and 16 THz. This complicates the use of classical statistics in all molecular-dynamics-based approaches.

Title: An empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics for simulating and predicting microstructure evolution in materials
Authors: Liang Wan, Qingsong Mei, Haowen Liu, Huafeng Zhang, Jun-Ping Du, Shigenobu Ogata, Wen Tong Geng
Abstract: Despite its widespread use in materials science, conventional molecular dynamics simulations are severely constrained by timescale limitations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics method, adapted from a collective-variable-based extended system dynamics framework. While this framework is originally developed for efficient free energy sampling and reaction pathway determination of specific rare events in condensed matter, we have modified it to enable accelerated molecular dynamics simulation and prediction of microstructure evolution of materials across a broad range of scenarios. In essence, the nearest neighbor off-centering absolute displacement (NNOAD), which quantifies the deviation of an atom from the geometric center of its nearest neighbors in materials, is introduced. We propose that the collection of NNOADs of all atoms can serve as a generalized reaction coordinate for various structural transitions in materials. The NNOAD of each atom, represented by its three components, is coupled with three additional dynamic variables assigned to the atom. Time evolution of the additional dynamic variables follows Langevin equation, while Nosé-Hoover dynamics is employed to thermostat the system. Through careful analysis and benchmark simulations, we established appropriate parameter ranges for the equations in our method. Application of this method to several test cases demonstrates its effectiveness and consistency in accelerating molecular dynamics simulations and predicting various microstructure evolutions of materials over much longer timescale. We also provide a preliminary theoretical analysis and qualitative justification of the method, offering insights into its underlying principles.

Title: A novel method for quantifying enzyme immobilization in porous carriers using simple NMR relaxometry
Authors: M. Raquel Serial, Luca Schmidt, Muhammad Adrian, Grit Brauckmann, Stefan Benders, Victoria Bueschler, Andreas Liese, Alexander Penn
Abstract: Enzyme immobilization plays a crucial role in enhancing the stability and recyclability of enzymes for industrial applications. However, traditional methods for quantifying enzyme loading within porous carriers are limited by time-consuming workflows, cumulative errors, and the inability to probe enzymes adsorbed inside the pores. In this study, we introduce Time-Domain Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (TD-NMR) relaxometry as a novel, non-invasive technique for directly quantifying enzyme adsorption within porous carriers. Focusing on epoxy methyl acrylate carriers, commonly used in biocatalysis, we correlate changes in T2 relaxation times with enzyme concentration, leading to the development of an NMR-based pore-filling ratio that quantifies enzyme loading. Validation experiments demonstrate that TD-NMR-derived adsorption curves align closely with traditional photometric measurements, offering a reliable and reproducible alternative for enzyme quantification. The accessibility of tabletop TD-NMR spectrometers makes this technique a practical and cost-effective tool for optimizing biocatalytic processes. Furthermore, the method holds promise for real-time monitoring of adsorption dynamics and could be adapted for a wider range of carrier materials and enzymes.

Title: Frustration-free free fermions
Authors: Seishiro Ono, Rintaro Masaoka, Haruki Watanabe, Hoi Chun Po
Abstract: We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive their necessary and sufficient conditions. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that the possible band touching between the valence bands and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompany work [arXiv:2503.12879].

Title: Fragility of local moments against hybridization with singular baths
Authors: Max Fischer, Arianna Poli, Lorenzo Crippa, Sergio Ciuchi, Matthias Vojta, Alessandro Toschi, Giorgio Sangiovanni
Abstract: The Kondo screening of a localized magnetic moment crucially depends on the spectral properties of the electronic bath to which it is coupled. While textbook examples typically assume a hybridization being constant in energy, realistic systems as well as dynamical mean-field theories of correlated lattice models force us to consider also sharp features in the hybridization function near the Fermi energy $\varepsilon_\text{F}$. A case currently under the spotlight is twisted bilayer graphene where strongly correlated bands and their coupling to more itinerant ones make the effective hybridization function diverge at Dirac-point energies. To clarify the fundamental screening mechanisms at play in these less conventional impurity models, we consider a minimal Anderson impurity model featuring a bath density of states consisting of a regular part plus a tunable $\delta$-function. Our analysis unveils an unexpectedly big impact on the physics of the Kondo screening already for a parametrically small weight of the $\delta$-function contribution.

Title: Upper critical magnetic field and multiband superconductivity in artificial high-Tc superlattices of nano quantum wells
Authors: G. Campi, A. Alimenti, G. Logvenov, G. A. Smith, F.F. Balakirev, S.-E. Lee, L. Balicas, E. Silva, G. A. Ummarino, G. Midei, A. Perali, A. Valletta, A. Bianconi
Abstract: Artificial high-Tc superlattices (AHTS) composed of quantum building blocks with tunable superconducting critical temperature have been synthesized by engineering their nanoscale geometry using the Bianconi-Perali-Valletta (BPV) two gaps superconductivity theory. These quantum heterostructures consist of quantum wells made of superconducting, modulation-doped Mott insulators (S), confined by a metallic (N) potential barrier. The lattice geometry has been carefully engineered to induce the predicted Fano-Feshbach shape resonance between the gaps, near a topological Lifshitz transition. Here, we validate the BPV theory by providing compelling experimental evidence that AHTS samples, at the peak of the superconducting dome, exhibit resonant two-band, two-gap superconductivity. This is demonstrated by measuring the temperature dependence of the upper critical magnetic field,Bc2, in samples with superlattice periods 3.3<d<5.28 nm and L/d ratios close to the magic value 2/3 (where L is the thickness of the superconducting La2CuO4 layer and d is the superlattice period). The data reveal the predicted upward concavity in Hc2(T) and a characteristic kink in the coherence length as a function of temperature, confirming the predicted two-band superconductivity with Fermi velocity ratio 0.25 and significant pair exchange term among the two condensates.

Abstract: We systematically explore a pathway for generating nonlinear charge and spin photocurrents using spin-orbit-split surface states. This mechanism enables net charge and spin flow along the surface plane even in centrosymmetric bulk environments like the Rashba prototype Au(111), where we establish the key principles by combining model predictions with density functional calculations. We further identify the Tl/Si(111) surface, characterized by strong non-Rashba spin-orbit coupling, as a prime candidate for experimental validation; with slight doping, it develops metallic spin-orbit-split states featuring remarkable relativistic properties while the bulk remains semiconducting. Our non-linear simulations reveal distinct angular signatures and magnitudes comparable to bulk ferroelectrics, highlighting the potential of surface-state photocurrents for low-bias optoelectronic applications. Moreover, the intricate spin polarization of surface states opens new possibilities as a nonlinear spin filter, providing a far more versatile platform than the spin Hall effect.

Title: Localization and entanglement entropy in the Discrete Non-Linear Schrödinger Equation
Authors: Martina Giachello, Stefano Iubini, Roberto Livi, Giacomo Gradenigo
Abstract: In this work we perform an accurate numerical study of the very peculiar thermodynamic properties of the localized high-energy phase of the Discrete Non-Linear Schrödinger Equation (DNLSE). A numerical sampling of the microcanonical ensemble done by means of Hamiltonian dynamics reveals a new and subtle relation between the presence of the localized phase and a non-trivial behaviour of entanglement entropy. Our finding that the entanglement entropy grows as $S_{\text{ent}}(N) \sim \log(N)$ beautifully encodes the lack of additivity in the DNLSE non-thermal localized phase and reveals how a property so far believed peculiar of purely quantum systems may characterize even certain classical frameworks.

Title: Odd electrical circuits
Authors: Harry Walden, Alexander Stegmaier, Jörn Dunkel, Alexander Mietke
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions in elastic media give rise to rich non-equilibrium behaviors, but controllable experimental realizations of such odd elastic phenomena remain scarce. Building on recent breakthroughs in electrical analogs of non-Hermitian solid-state systems, we design and analyze scalable odd electrical circuits (OECs) as exact analogs of an odd solid. We show that electrical work can be extracted from OECs via cyclic excitations and trace the apparent energy gain back to active circuit elements. We show that OECs host oscillatory modes that resemble recent experimental observations in living chiral crystals and identify active resonances that reveal a perspective on odd elasticity as a mechanism for mechanical amplification.

Title: Universal scaling in one-dimensional non-reciprocal matter
Authors: Shuoguang Liu, Ryo Hanai, Peter B. Littlewood
Abstract: Unveiling universal non-equilibrium scaling laws has been a central theme in modern statistical physics, with recent attention increasingly directed toward nonequilibrium phases that exhibit rich dynamical phenomena. A striking example arises in nonreciprocal systems, where asymmetric interactions between components lead to inherently dynamic phases and unconventional criticality near a critical exceptional point (CEP), where the criticality arises from the coalescence of collective modes to the Nambu-Goldstone mode. However, the universal scaling behavior that should emerge in this system with full consideration of many-body effects and stochastic noise remains largely elusive. Here, we establish a dynamical scaling law in a generic one-dimensional stochastic nonreciprocal $O(2)$-symmetric system. Through large-scale simulations, we uncover a new nonequilibrium scaling in the vicinity of transition, distinct from any previously known equilibrium or nonequilibrium universality classes. In regimes where the system breaks into domains with opposite chirality, we demonstrate that fluctuations are strongly suppressed, leading to a logarithmic scaling as a function of system size $L$, in contrast to the conventional power-law scaling expected from dynamical scaling theory. This work elucidates the beyond-mean-field dynamics of non-reciprocal matter, thereby sheding light on the exploration of criticality in nonreciprocal phase transition across diverse physical contexts, from active matter and driven quantum systems to biological pattern formation and non-Hermitian physics.

Title: Nonequilibrium Spectral Evolution of Sub-Kondo Resonance
Authors: Jong E. Han
Abstract: Numerical renormalization group (NRG) is formulated for nonequilibrium steady-state by converting finite-lattice may-body eigenstates into scattering states. Extension of the full-density-matrix NRG for a biased Anderson impurity model reveals the sub-Kondo spectral evolution in the zero-temperature limit, exposing the double-resonance structure at bias of the Kondo energy scale $T_K$. The sub-Kondo peaks result in population inversion due to the lead-resolved resonance and the negative differential conductance regime at temperatures $T\ll T_K$, which revert to the conventional thermal behavior at $T\lesssim T_K$.

Title: Effects of time-periodic drive in the linear response for planar-Hall set-ups with Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a time-periodic drive on three-dimensional Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals in planar-Hall/planar-thermal-Hall set-ups. The drive is modelled here by circularly-polarized electromagnetic fields, whose effects are incorporated by a combination of the Floquet theorem and the van Vleck perturbation theory, applicable in the high-frequency limit. We evaluate the longitudinal and in-plane transverse components of the linear-response coefficients using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism. We demonstrate the explicit expressions of these transport coefficients in certain limits of the system parameters, where it is possible to derive the explicit analytical expressions. Our results demonstrate that the topological charges of the corresponding semimetals etch their trademark signatures in these transport properties, which can be observed in experiments.

Title: Frustrated Frustration of Arrays with Four-Terminal Nb-Pt-Nb Josephson Junctions
Authors: Justus Teller, Christian Schäfer, Kristof Moors, Benjamin Bennemann, Matvey Lyatti, Florian Lentz, Detlev Grützmacher, Roman-Pascal Riwar, Thomas Schäpers
Abstract: We study the frustration pattern of a square lattice with in-situ fabricated Nb-Pt-Nb four-terminal Josephson junctions. The four-terminal geometry gives rise to a checker board pattern of alternating fluxes f, f' piercing the plaquettes, which stabilizes the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition even at irrational flux quanta per unit cell, due to an unequal repartition of integer flux sum f+f' into alternating plaquettes. This type of frustrated frustration manifests as a beating pattern of the dc resistance, with state configurations at the resistance dips gradually changing between the conventional zero-flux and half-flux states. Hence, the four-terminal Josephson junctions array offers a promising platform to study previously unexplored flux and vortex configurations, and provides an estimate on the spatial expansion of the four-terminal Josephson junctions central weak link area.

Title: Magnetotransport of tomographic electrons in a channel
Authors: Nitay Ben-Shachar, Johannes Hofmann
Abstract: Hydrodynamics is a new paradigm of electron transport in high-mobility devices, where frequent electron collisions give rise to a collective electron flow profile. However, conventional descriptions of these flows, which are based on the fluid equations for a classical gas extended to include impurity scattering, do not account for the distinct collisional relaxation in quantum-mechanical systems. In particular, by dint of Pauli blocking even modes of the distribution function relax over significantly shorter length scales than odd modes (dubbed the ``tomographic'' effect). We establish an analytical description of tomographic electron flow in a channel, and find four new distinguishing features: (i) Non-equilibrium effects from the boundaries penetrate significantly deeper into the flow domain; (ii) an additional velocity slip condition leads to a significant increase in the channel conductance; (iii) bulk rarefaction corrections decrease the curvature of the velocity profile in the channel center; and (iv) all these anomalous transport effects are rapidly suppressed with magnetic fields. The latter effect leads to a non-monotonic magneto-conductance, which can be used to measure both the even- and odd-mode mean free paths. Our asymptotic results unveil the underlying physics of tomographic flows and provide an alternative to numerical solutions of the Fermi-liquid equations.

Title: Spin-orbit coupling effects on orbital-selective correlations in a three-orbital model
Authors: Yin Chen, Yi-Heng Tian, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: In ruthenate materials, non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phases have been observed. We used the natural orbitals renormalization group (NORG) method as an impurity solver for dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to study a three-orbital Kanamori-Hubbard model with crystal field splitting, set at a specific filling of 2/3, which serves as a minimal Hamiltonian for the ruthenates. We find that without spin-orbit coupling (SOC), increasing the electron interactions results in an orbital-selective Mott (OSM) state, where the half-filled $d_{xy}$ orbital becomes a Mott insulator (MI) while the three-quarter-filled $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals form a singular Fermi liquid (SFL). The OSM state is destroyed by the small SOC, which causes the small hybridization between the $d_{xy}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals, resulting in both the orbitals exhibiting an NFL behavior. The $d_{xy}$ orbital is close to an MI and the $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals are close to an SFL state. They exhibit distinct electronic scattering rates.

Abstract: The large van der Waals gap in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offers an avenue to host external metal atoms that modify the ground state of these 2D materials. Here, we experimentally and theoretically address the charge correlations in a family of intercalated TMDs. While short-range charge fluctuations develop in Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_{2}$ and Fe$_{1/3}$TaS$_{2}$, long-range charge order switches-on in Fe$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ driven by the interplay of magnetic order and lattice degrees of freedom. The magnetoelastic coupling is demonstrated in Fe$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ by the enhancement of the charge modulations upon magnetic field below T$_\mathrm{N}$, although Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) calculations predict negligible electron(spin)-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we show that Co-intercalated TaS$_2$ displays a kagome-like Fermi surface, hence opening the path to engineer electronic band structures and study the entanglement of spin, charge, and spin-phonon mechanisms in the large family of intercalated TMDs.

Title: Flux trapping in NbTiN strips and structures
Authors: Ruiheng Bai, Aliakbar Sepehri, Yen-Lee Loh, Anne-Marie Valente-Feliciano, Anna Herr, Quentin Herr, Katja C. Nowack
Abstract: We use scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy to image vortices in superconducting strips fabricated from NbTiN thin films. We repeatedly cool superconducting strips with different width in an applied magnetic field and image the individual vortices. From these images we determine the threshold field at which the first vortex enters a strip, as well as the number and spatial configuration of vortices beyond this threshold field. We model vortex behavior with and without considering the effect of pinning by numercially minimizing the Gibbs free energy of vortices in the strips. Our measurements provide a first benchmark to understand the flux trapping properties of NbTiN thin films directly relevant to NbTiN-based superconducting circuits and devices.

Title: Tomographic electron flow in confined geometries: Beyond the dual-relaxation time approximation
Authors: Nitay Ben-Shachar, Johannes Hofmann
Abstract: Hydrodynamic-like electron flows are typically modeled using the Stokes-Ohm equation or a kinetic description that is based on a dual-relaxation time approximation. Such models assume a short intrinsic mean free path $\ell_e$ due to momentum-conserving electronic scattering and a large extrinsic mean free path $\ell_\text{MR}$ due to momentum-relaxing impurity scattering. This assumption, however, is overly simplistic and falls short at low temperatures, where it is known from exact diagonalization studies of the electronic collision integral that another large electronic mean free path $\ell_o$ emerges, which describes long-lived odd electron modes -- this is sometimes known as the tomographic effect. Here, using a matched asymptotic expansion of the Fermi liquid kinetic equation that includes different electron relaxation times, we derive a general asymptotic theory for tomographic flows in arbitrary smooth boundary geometries. Our key results are a set of governing equations for the electron density and electron current, their slip boundary conditions and boundary layer corrections near diffuse edges. We find that the tomographic effect strongly modifies previous hydrodynamic theories for electron flows: In particular, we find that (i) an equilibrium is established in the bulk, where the flow is governed by Stokes-Ohm like equations with significant finite-wavelength corrections, (ii) the velocity slip conditions for these equations are strongly modified from the widely-used hydrodynamic slip-length condition (iii) a large kinetic boundary layer arises near diffuse boundaries of width $\sim\sqrt{\ell_e \ell_o}$, and (iv) all these effects are strongly suppressed by an external magnetic field. We illustrate our findings for electron flow in a channel. The equations derived here represent the fundamental governing equations for tomographic electron flow in arbitrary smooth geometries.

Title: Surface phonons in MoS2
Authors: Aleksandar Radic, Boyao Liu, Andrew Jardine, Akshay Rao, Sam Lambrick
Abstract: The thermal and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors is underpinned by their vibrational dynamics, yet surface phonons in layered materials remain poorly understood due to limitations in conventional experimental techniques. We employ helium-3 spin-echo (HeSE) spectroscopy to resolve the lowest energy (<10 meV) dispersions of surface phonons on bulk molybdenum disulfide (MoS\textsubscript{2}) with sub-meV energy resolution near $\Gamma$. We identify two low-energy optical modes, E_2g and A_1g, exhibiting unexpected quasi-acoustic dispersion, and crucially do not find evidence of an acoustic mode at the surface. A_1g follows a purely quadratic dispersion (\(\omega_{A_{1g}} \propto q^2\)), while \(E_{2g}\) displays quartic behaviour (\(\omega_{E_{2g}} \propto q^4\)), indicative of strong anharmonicity. These modes, absent in inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) measurements and theoretical predictions of the bulk, exhibit finite-layer confinement equivalent to 4.5 and 6 layers, respectively. Their rapid dispersion yields substantial group velocities at small wavevectors, suggesting a dominant role in surface and few-layer thermal transport. This work establishes optical surface phonons as key drivers of thermal management in 2D materials and highlights the necessity of understanding surface phononics for designing next-generation optoelectronic devices.

Title: Inescapable anisotropy of non-reciprocal XY models
Authors: Dawid Dopierala, Hugues Chaté, Xia-qing Shi, Alexandre Solon
Abstract: We investigate non-reciprocal XY (NRXY) models defined on two-dimensional lattices in which the coupling strength of a spin with its neighbors varies with their position in the frame defined by the current spin orientation. As expected from the seminal work of Dadhichi et al., Phys. Rev. E 101, 052601 (2020), we first show that non-reciprocity is akin to a self-propulsion: we derive a mean-field continuous theory identical to that of constant-density flocks. Like the latter, NRXY models exhibit a long-range ordered phase that is metastable to the nucleation of topological defects, and their asymptotic state is a dynamic foam of asters. We then show that in the metastable ordered phase, the lattice always induces anisotropy on large scales, pinning the direction of order and imposing a finite correlation length. Crucially, we demonstrate that this anisotropy is inescapable since, even when not explicitly present in the model, it is generated by fluctuations. In short, the ordered phase of lattice NRXY models is that of active clock models.

Title: Stabilizer Rényi Entropy and Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Masahiro Hoshino, Masaki Oshikawa, Yuto Ashida
Abstract: Understanding universal aspects of many-body systems is one of the central themes in modern physics. Recently, the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) has emerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial resource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical results suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal behavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a $(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using boundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a participation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can be calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the interlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This identification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE on the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the replicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a universal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state degeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE exhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the scaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates the origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a concrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising criticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary Rényi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing tensor network methods. These results establish a field-theoretical approach to understanding the universal features of nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Quantum geometry of non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Jan Behrends, Roni Ilan, Moshe Goldstein
Abstract: The Berry curvature characterizes one aspect of the geometry of quantum states. It materializes, among other consequences, as an anomalous velocity of wave packets. In non-Hermitian systems, wave packet dynamics is enriched by additional terms that can be expressed as generalizations of the Berry connection to non-orthogonal eigenstates. Here, we contextualize these anomalous non-Hermitian contributions by showing that they directly arise from the geometry of the underlying quantum states as corrections to the distance between left and perturbed right eigenstates. By calculating the electric susceptibility for a single-band wave packet and comparing it with the wave packet's localization, we demonstrate that these terms can, in some circumstances, lead to a violation of fluctuation-dissipation relations in non-Hermitian systems. We discuss experimental signatures in terms of response functions and transport signatures.

Title: Reshaping the Quantum Arrow of Time
Authors: Luis Pedro García-Pintos, Yi-Kai Liu, Alexey Gorshkov
Abstract: The microscopic laws of physics are symmetric under time reversal. Yet, most natural processes that we observe are not. The emergent asymmetry between typical and time-reversed processes is referred to as the arrow of time. In quantum physics, an arrow of time emerges when a sequence of measurements is performed on a system. We introduce quantum control tools that can yield dynamics more consistent with time flowing backward than forward. The control tools are based on the explicit construction of a Hamiltonian that can replicate the stochastic trajectories of a monitored quantum system. Such Hamiltonian can reverse the effect of monitoring and, via a feedback process, generate trajectories consistent with a reversed arrow of time. We show how to exploit the feedback process to design a continuous measurement engine that draws energy from the monitoring process, or to simulate the backward-in-time dynamics of an open quantum system.

Title: Braidings on topological operators, anomaly of higher-form symmetries and the SymTFT
Authors: Pavel Putrov, Rajath Radhakrishnan
Abstract: The anomaly of non-invertible higher-form symmetries is determined by the braiding of topological operators implementing them. In this paper, we study a method to classify braidings on topological line and surface operators by leveraging the fact that topological operators which admit a braiding are symmetries of their associated SymTFT. This perspective allows us to formulate an algorithm to explicitly compute all possible braidings on a given fusion category, bypassing the need to solve the hexagon equations. Additionally, using 3+1d SymTFTs, we determine braidings on various fusion 2-categories. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the fusion 2-categories $\Sigma \mathcal{C}$, 2Vec$_G^{\pi}$ and Tambara-Yamagami (TY) 2-categories TY$(A,\pi)$ to admit a braiding.

Title: Dynamics of defects and interfaces for interacting quantum hard disks
Authors: Fabian Ballar Trigueros, Vighnesh Dattatraya Naik, Markus Heyl
Abstract: Defects and interfaces are essential to understand the properties of matter. However, studying their dynamics in the quantum regime remains a challenge in particular concerning the regime of two spatial dimensions. Recently, it has been shown that a quantum counterpart of the hard-disk problem on a lattice yields defects and interfaces, which are stable just due to quantum effects while they delocalize and dissolve classically. Here, we study in more detail the properties of defects and interfaces in this quantum hard-disk problem with a particular emphasis on the stability of these quantum effects upon including perturbations. Specifically, we introduce short-range soft-core interactions between the hard disks. From both analytical arguments and numerical simulations we find that large classes of defects and interfaces remain stable even under such perturbations suggesting that the quantum nature of the dynamics exhibits a large range of robustness. Our findings demonstrate the stability and non-classical behavior of quantum interface dynamics, offering insights into the dynamics of two-dimensional quantum matter and establishing the quantum hard-disk model as a platform for studying unconventional constrained quantum dynamics.

Title: Non-Bloch edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices
Authors: Wen-Tan Xue, Fei Song, Yu-Min Hu, Zhong Wang
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of nominally bulk modes, not only drastically reshapes the spectral properties of non-Hermitian systems, but also dramatically modifies the real-time dynamics therein. Here we investigate the time evolution of waves (or quantum-mechanical particles) initialized around the edge of non-Hermitian lattices. The non-Hermitian skin effect tends to localize the wave to the edge, meaning that the real-time dynamics differs from the Bloch-theory picture. We focus on the long-time decay or growth rate of wave function, which is quantified by the Lyapunov exponents. These exponents can be obtained from the saddle points in the complex momentum space. We propose an efficient yet unambiguous criterion for identifying the dominant saddle point that determines the Lyapunov exponents. Our criterion can be precisely formulated in terms of a mathematical concept known as the Lefschetz thimble. Counterintuitively, the seemingly natural criterion based on the imaginary part of the energy fails. Our work provides a coherent theory for characterizing the real-time edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices. Our predictions are testable in various non-Hermitian physical platforms.

Title: Topological Holography for 2+1-D Gapped and Gapless Phases with Generalized Symmetries
Authors: Rui Wen
Abstract: We study topological holography for 2+1-D gapped and gapless phases with generalized symmetries using tools from higher linear algebra and higher condensation theory. We focus on bosonic fusion 2-category symmetries, where the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) are 3+1D Dijkgraaf-Witten theories. (1). Gapped phases are obtained from the sandwich construction with gapped symmetry and physical boundaries. A gapped boundary of the 3+1D SymTFT is called minimal if it has no intrinsic 2+1-D topological order. We derive the general structure of a sandwich construction with minimal gapped symmetry and physical boundaries, including the underlying topological order and the symmetry action. We also study some concrete examples with 2-group or non-invertible symmetries. (2). For gapless phases, we show that the SymTFT provides a complete description of the \textit{topological skeleton} of a gapless phase. The topological skeleton of a gapless phase is the higher categorical structure of its topological defects. We rigorously establish this relation for 2+1-D gapless phases with finite group symmetries. For a gapless phase with a finite group symmetry, its topological skeleton(also known as gapless SPT(gSPT)) can be characterized by the decorated domain wall construction. We give a precise formulation of this using spectral sequence. We show that certain class of condensable algebras in the SymTFT $\mathcal{Z}_1[2\mathbf{Vec}_G]$, which we call minimal condensable algebras, has exactly the same structure. We further give a cohomological classification of minimal condensable algebras, which enables us to compute the classification of 2+1-D $G$-gSPTs via ordinary group cohomology. Finally we use SymTFT to construct 2+1-D gSPT with generalized symmetries, including an intrinsically gSPT(igSPT) with exact non-invertible fusion 2-category symmetry and anomalous 2-group IR symmetry.

Title: Highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation in single conjugated polymer chains
Authors: Nicola J. Fairbairn, Olga Vodianova, Gordon J. Hedley
Abstract: The number of excitons that conjugated polymers can support at any one time underpins their optoelectronic performance in light emitting diodes, concentrating photovoltaic cells and as laser gain media, as it sets a natural limit on exciton density. Here we have measured the time-resolved photon statistics of single chains of polyfluorene to extract the absolute number of independent emitting sites present and how this changes with respect to both the time in the excited state of the exciton and its energy. We find that after 100 ps each chain can only support 1 or 2 independent excitons, and that even at the earliest times this number only rises to 4, suggesting a high degree of electronic coupling between chromophoric units that facilitates highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation. In circumstances where a low density of low-energy sites is present, annihilation between them still dominates. Our results indicate that achieving high exciton densities in conjugated polymers is naturally difficult, and in applications where it is desirable new strategies should be devised that control exciton-exciton annihilation.

Title: Eph-ephrin-mediated differential persistence as a mechanism for cell sorting
Authors: Marius Bothe, Eloise Lardet, Alexei Poliakov, Gunnar Pruessner, Thibault Bertrand, Ignacio Bordeu
Abstract: The phenomenon of cell sorting/segregation, by which cells organise spatially into clusters of specific cell type or function, is essential for tissue morphogenesis. This self-organization process involves an interplay between mechanical, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms that act across various spatial and temporal scales. Several mechanisms for cell sorting have been proposed; however, the physical nature of these mechanisms and how they lead to symmetric or asymmetric cell sorting remains unclear. Here, using experimental data from cocultures of genetically modified Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells and numerical simulations, we show the existence of a cell sorting mechanism based on transient increases in the persistence of motion of cells. This mechanism is activated on cells overexpressing the ephrinB1-related receptor EphB2 after their interaction with cells overexpressing ephrinB1. We show that this mechanism is sufficient to cause cell sorting, breaking the symmetry of the sorting dynamics, and show that the duration of this transient differential persistence state is optimal for enhancing sorting. Furthermore, we show that in combination with other interaction mechanisms, such as changes in direction-also known as contact inhibition of locomotion-and adhesion forces, differential persistence significantly reduces the timescale of sorting. Our findings offer insights into the behaviour of cell mixtures, the relevance of non-reciprocal interactions, and may provide insight into developmental processes and tissue patterning.

Title: Macroscopic Particle Transport in Dissipative Long-Range Bosonic Systems
Authors: Hongchao Li, Cheng Shang, Tomotaka Kuwahara, Tan Van Vu
Abstract: The inevitable loss of particles in quantum many-body systems provides a more general and experimentally realistic perspective on particle transport. In this work, we determine the maximal speed of macroscopic particle transport in dissipative bosonic systems featuring both long-range hopping and long-range interactions. By developing a generalized optimal transport theory for open quantum systems, we rigorously establish the relationship between the minimum transport time and the source-target distance, and investigate the maximal transportable distance of bosons. We demonstrate that optimal transport exhibits a fundamental distinction depending on whether the system experiences one-body loss or multi-body loss. Furthermore, we present the minimal transport time and the maximal transport distance for systems with both gain and loss. We observe that even an arbitrarily small gain rate enables transport over long distances if the lattice gas is dilute. Moreover, we generally reveal that the emergence of decoherence-free subspaces facilitates the long-distance and perfect transport process. We also derive an upper bound for the probability of transporting a given number of particles during a fixed period with one-body loss. Possible experimental protocols for observing our theoretical predictions are discussed.

Title: The effect of variable fibre diameters in unidirectional fibre-reinforced bundles on stress redistributions around fibre breaks
Authors: Milad Jafarypouria, Stepan Lomov, Sergey Abaimov
Abstract: Finite element modelling is conducted to simulate the stress redistribution around a broken fibre (BF) in a bundle with experimentally measured fibre diameter distributions (FDD), followed by a parametric study of the influence of the FDD coefficient of variation on the stress concentration factor (SCF) and ineffective length (IL). Two variants of the SCF definition are considered: based on average and maximum stress in the fibre cross-section. Results demonstrate that bigger fibre diameters show higher SCF and clustering of such fibres increases SCF in nearest neighbour fibres (NNFs). Critically, maximum stress-based SCF (maxSCF_max) significantly exceeds average stress-based SCF (maxSCF_avg), with differences about 40 to 75% in NNFs for FDD bundles compared to FCD bundles. This emphasises the necessity of prioritizing maximum stress criteria over conventional average stress models in failure predictions. The findings challenge benchmark models that rely on averaged SCF values, offering critical insights for improving accuracy in predicting fibre break propagation and composite strength.

Title: Carbonic anhydrase II simulated with a universal neural network potential
Authors: Timothy T. Duignan
Abstract: The carbonic anhydrase II enzyme (CA II) is one of the most significant enzymes in nature, reversibly converting CO$_2$ to bicarbonate at a remarkable rate. The precise mechanism it uses to achieve this rapid turnover remains unclear due to our inability to directly observe or simulate the full process dynamically. Here, we use a recently developed universal neural network potential (Orb) to simulate the active site of CA II. We reproduce several known features of the reaction mechanism, including the proton relay that conducts protons out of the active site to the His64 residue. Additionally, we observe a new reaction pathway where CO$_2$ reacts with a water molecule in the active site, which donates a proton to the zinc-bound hydroxide. This differs from the established mechanism where CO$_2$ directly reacts with hydroxide. Existing experimental data and independent quantum chemistry calculations are used to support the plausibility of this new mechanism. This demonstrates the potential of Orb to efficiently generate novel insights into important molecular scale processes that can potentially be harnessed to improve CO$_2$ capture technologies and drug design.

Title: Engineering anisotropic Dicke model with dipole-dipole interaction for Rydberg atom arrays in cavity
Authors: Bao-Yun Dong, Yanhua Zhou, Wei Wang, Tao Wang
Abstract: The anisotropic Dicke model reveals the important role that counter-rotating wave terms play in the coupling between light and two level atoms. It is intriguing to generate the model to the strongly correlated many body case, where the competition between atomic interaction and light-atom coupling will induce exotic phenomenon. In this paper, we provide a periodically driving method for engineering an anisotropic Dicke model with strong dipole-dipole interaction between atoms based on Rydberg atom arrays in cavity. By modulating the pumping laser, the ratio of counter-rotating wave terms to rotating ones could be tuned from zero to infinity. As an illustrative example, the superiority of this tunability in the adiabatic state preparation is revealed. Our engineered model provides an extensive foundation for subsequet research of quantum simulation, many-body physics and even information processing.

Title: Flexible BiSel/NiO-based X-ray synapses bridging the functions of detection and memory
Authors: Qiao Wang, Pengfei Li, Yushou Song, Jalu Li, Haiying Xiao, Yuqing Wang, Guoliang Ma, Hsu-Sheng Tsai, Ping-An Hu
Abstract: Currently, the X-ray detectors are widely used in medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace, and other fields, as the market demand for high-efficiency, flexible, and low-power detectors is increased. Although the traditional inorganic X-ray detection materials have achieved great success and effectiveness, they have their own limitations and let alone flexibility/bendability and memory function. In this study, we present the design of a BiSeI/NiO-based X-ray synaptic detector and its application in the simulation of biological synaptic processes. Herein, the BiSeI, a quasi-1D inorganic semiconductor, stands out as an ideal choice for the X-ray detectors, especially for flexible and portable devices due to its large atomic number, large photoelectric absorption coefficient, and mechanical plasticity. Meanwhile, the NiO-based materials provide the memory function required for the intelligent detection systems. Moreover, our devices offer notable advantages in terms of low power consumption, compared with traditional X-ray detectors. The BiSeI/NiO detectors demonstrate advanced features with an ultrahigh sensitivity, an ultralow detection limit, and include the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the transition from short- to long-term memory, maintaining the functionality on flexible substrates. This design represents a significant step toward the development of intelligent and flexible X-ray detectors.

Title: A Set of Tutorials for the LAMMPS Simulation Package
Authors: Simon Gravelle, Jacob R. Gissinger, Axel Kohlmeyer
Abstract: The availability of open-source molecular simulation software packages allows scientists and engineers to focus on running and analyzing simulations without having to write, parallelize, and validate their own simulation software. While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the `black box' nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of MD simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol. In addition, we introduce LAMMPS-GUI, an enhanced cross-platform graphical text editor specifically designed for use with LAMMPS and able to run LAMMPS directly on the edited input. LAMMPS-GUI is used as the primary tool in the tutorials to edit inputs, run LAMMPS, extract data, and visualize the simulated systems.

Title: Quantum correlations in a cluster spin model with three-spin interactions
Authors: Sadaf F, V. Subrahmanyam
Abstract: An exactly solvable cluster spin model with three-spin interaction couplings J_x (for XZX spin components) and J_y (for YZY spin components) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field $h$ for a spin chain is investigated. For $h=0$, and with only one nonzero interaction strength, the ground state is the cluster state. Through the Jordan-Wigner fermion mapping, the odd sites and the even sites form two separate transverse-XY chains, connected only through the boundary terms. Consequently, all measures of quantum correlations for nearest neighbour spins, the concurrence, the quantum mutual information and the quantum discord are all zero in the ground state. The dynamics is spin conserving for J_y=J_x, exhibiting a line of critical points for |h/J_x| < 2, with an uncorrelated direct product ground state for |h/J_x|>2. There are several quantum critical points in the parameter space, with multi-fold degenerate ground states. The magnetisation and the global entanglement measure exhibit strong singular features for the spin conserving case. The next-neighbour quantum correlation measures are investigated analytically, which exhibit singular features in the vicinity of degeneracy critical points. The $J_y$- and $h$- derivatives of the concurrence exhibit singular peak behaviour near the degeneracy critical points, except in the spin conserving case where the derivatives are zero.

Title: Fundamental Limits of Matrix Sensing: Exact Asymptotics, Universality, and Applications
Authors: Yizhou Xu, Antoine Maillard, Lenka Zdeborová, Florent Krzakala
Abstract: In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions. We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension.

Title: Fluid mechanics of sarcomeres as porous media
Authors: John Severn, Thomas Vacus, Eric Lauga
Abstract: Muscle contraction, both in skeletal and cardiac tissue, is driven by sarcomeres, the microscopic units inside muscle cells where thick myosin and thin actin filaments slide past each other. During contraction and relaxation, the sarcomere's volume changes, causing sarcoplasm (intra-sarcomeric fluid) to flow out during contraction and back in as the sarcomere relaxes. We present a quantitative model of this sarcoplasmic flow, treating the sarcomere as an anisotropic porous medium with regions defined by the presence and absence of thick and thin filaments. Using semi-analytic methods, we solve for axial and lateral fluid flow within the filament lattice, calculating the permeabilities of this porous structure. We then apply these permeabilities within a Darcy model to determine the flow field generated during contraction. The predictions of our continuum model show excellent agreement with finite element simulations, reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude while maintaining accuracy in modelling the biophysical flow dynamics.

Title: Quantum thermal machines in BTZ black hole spacetime
Authors: Dimitris Moustos, Obinna Abah
Abstract: We investigate an Otto thermodynamic cycle with a qubit Unruh-DeWitt detector as the working medium, coupled to a massless, conformally coupled scalar quantum field in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum in a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole spacetime. We employ the thermal properties of the field to model heat and cold reservoirs between which the thermal machine operates. Treating the detector as an open quantum system, we employ a master equation to study its finite-time dynamics during each cycle stroke. We evaluate the output performance of the Otto heat engine and refrigerator by computing, respectively, the total work output and the cooling power for each of the Neumann, transparent, and Dirichlet boundary condition cases satisfied by the field at spatial infinity. Furthermore, we evaluate the optimal performance of the thermal machine by analyzing its efficiency at maximum power output and ecological impact. Our study presents a general framework for understanding the finite-time operation of relativistic quantum thermal machines, focusing on their energy optimization.

Title: Role of symmetry-forbidden transitions in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering emission from materials with trapped molecular O$_2$
Authors: Maxwell D. Radin, Alexander Kunitsa
Abstract: Oxygen resonant inelastic X-ray scattering has become a prominent tool for unveiling the electronic structure of solids, especially redox mechanisms in Li-rich cathode materials. A number of studies have observed a strong absorption feature at 531 eV associated with the anomalous capacity of Li-rich cathodes. The most prominent emission feature arising from absorption at 531 eV occurs at 523 eV and has been attributed to the $^3\Pi_\text{g}$ final state of molecular O$_2$. However, in many materials, this feature exhibits a secondary emission peak at a loss of 4.3 eV loss which is not seen in the spectrum of gas-phase oxygen. This study revisits the spectra of these materials and investigates transitions that are forbidden for an isolated O$_2$ molecule as a possible explanation for the secondary emission peak. A group theoretic analysis and simulation of RIXS cross-sections suggest that this feature is consistent with molecular oxygen in a low-symmetry environment owing to final states descending from the $^3\Sigma_\text{u}^+$ and $^3\Delta_\text{u}$ states of isolated O$_2$. Vibronic coupling and multi-molecule transitions are also discussed as possible mechanisms for enabling transitions to these final states even in a high-symmetry environment. These results support the assignment of the 531 eV absorption peak in these materials exclusively to molecular oxygen and suggest that in materials exhibiting the secondary emission peak, these molecules may reside in low-symmetry environments.

Title: Landscape Complexity for the Empirical Risk of Generalized Linear Models: Discrimination between Structured Data
Authors: Theodoros G. Tsironis, Aris L. Moustakas
Abstract: We use the Kac-Rice formula and results from random matrix theory to obtain the average number of critical points of a family of high-dimensional empirical loss functions, where the data are correlated $d$-dimensional Gaussian vectors, whose number has a fixed ratio with their dimension. The correlations are introduced to model the existence of structure in the data, as is common in current Machine-Learning systems. Under a technical hypothesis, our results are exact in the large-$d$ limit, and characterize the annealed landscape complexity, namely the logarithm of the expected number of critical points at a given value of the loss. We first address in detail the landscape of the loss function of a single perceptron and then generalize it to the case where two competing data sets with different covariance matrices are present, with the perceptron seeking to discriminate between them. The latter model can be applied to understand the interplay between adversity and non-trivial data structure. For completeness, we also treat the case of a loss function used in training Generalized Linear Models in the presence of correlated input data.

Title: Local formation of knotted screw dislocations in smectic liquid crystals
Authors: Robert Cardona, Andreu Vega
Abstract: Given a configuration of a smectic liquid crystal, we show that a new screw dislocation loop can be introduced along any knot or link transverse to the regular layers through a purely local modification. We define a topological invariant of screw dislocation loops, the multiplicity, and show that it can be explicitly prescribed in our construction. Finally, we apply this method to establish that any link type can be locally introduced within the set of screw dislocations of a smectic configuration modeled by an open book decomposition.

Abstract: The Superconducting Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center, a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center, has conducted a comprehensive and coordinated study using superconducting transmon qubit chips with known performance metrics to identify the underlying materials-level sources of device-to-device performance variation. Following qubit coherence measurements, these qubits of varying base superconducting metals and substrates have been examined with various nondestructive and invasive material characterization techniques at Northwestern University, Ames National Laboratory, and Fermilab as part of a blind study. We find trends in variations of the depth of the etched substrate trench, the thickness of the surface oxide, and the geometry of the sidewall, which when combined, lead to correlations with the T$_1$ lifetime across different devices. In addition, we provide a list of features that varied from device to device, for which the impact on performance requires further studies. Finally, we identify two low-temperature characterization techniques that may potentially serve as proxy tools for qubit measurements. These insights provide materials-oriented solutions to not only reduce performance variations across neighboring devices, but also to engineer and fabricate devices with optimal geometries to achieve performance metrics beyond the state-of-the-art values.

Title: Precise Quantum Chemistry calculations with few Slater Determinants
Authors: Clemens Giuliani, Jannes Nys, Rocco Martinazzo, Giuseppe Carleo, Riccardo Rossi
Abstract: Slater determinants have underpinned quantum chemistry for nearly a century, yet their full potential has remained challenging to exploit. In this work, we show that a variational wavefunction composed of a few hundred optimized non-orthogonal determinants can achieve energy accuracies comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach exploits the quadratic dependence of the energy on selected parameters, permitting their exact optimization, and employs an efficient tensor contraction algorithm to compute the effective Hamiltonian with a computational cost scaling as the fourth power of the number of basis functions. We benchmark the accuracy of the proposed method with exact full-configuration interaction results where available, and we achieve lower variational energies than coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) for several molecules in the double-zeta basis. We conclude by discussing limitations and extensions of the technique, and the potential impact on other many-body methods.

Title: Magneto-optics of a charge-tunable quantum dot: Observation of a negative diamagnetic shift
Authors: Giora Peniakov, Ayal Beck, Eilon Poem, Zu-En Su, Boaz Taitler, Sven Hoefling, Garnett. W. Bryant, David Gershoni
Abstract: We present magneto-optical studies of a self-assembled semiconductor quantum dot in neutral and positively charged states. The diamagnetic shifts and Zeeman splitting of many well-identified optical transitions are precisely measured. Remarkably, a pronounced negative diamagnetic shift is observed for spectral lines resulting from a doubly positively charged excitonic complex. We use the Hartree - Fock approximation for describing the direct Coulomb and exchange interactions between the quantum dot confined carriers in various configurations. A simple harmonic potential model, which we extend to capture the influence of an externally applied magnetic field in Faraday configuration, is then used to quantitatively account for all the measured diamagnetic shifts. We show that the negative shift is due to the change in the hole-hole exchange interaction energy induced by the magnetic field. Using this model and the measured shifts we extract the dielectric constant of the quantum dot material and get a decent estimate of the quantum dot dimensions. Further, the measured Zeeman splitting of the various spectral lines are also explained by a simple model using algebraic sums and differences of the $g$-factors of the confined charge carriers in their respective first and second discrete energy levels. Finally, the obtained values of the electronic $g$-factor and that of the dielectric constant are independently used to determine the effective composition (x) of the ternary In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As quantum dot. Both agree to within the experimental uncertainties.

Title: Spin pumping effect in non-Fermi liquid metals
Authors: Xiao-Tian Zhang, Yi-Hui Xing, Xu-Ping Yao, Yuya Ominato, Long Zhang, Mamoru Matsuo
Abstract: Spin pumping effect is a sensitive and well-established experimental method in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials. We propose that spin pumping effect can be a valuable probe for non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behaviors at the 2D interface of magnetic heterostructures. We show that the modulations of ferromagnetic resonance exhibit power-law scalings in frequency and temperature for NFL metals induced near a quantum critical point (QCP). At the Ising nematic QCP, we demonstrate that the enhanced Gilbert damping coefficient $\delta \alpha$ acquires negative power-law exponents in distinct frequency regimes. The exponents convey universal parameters inherited from the QCP and reflect the non-quasiparticle nature of the spin carriers in the NFL metal. At finite temperature, we show that the Gilbert damping mechanism is restored in the quantum critical regime and $\delta \alpha$ measures the temperature dependence of the correlation length. Our theoretical proposal has the potential to stimulate the development of an interdisciplinary research domain where insights from non-equilibrium spin physics in spintronics are integrated into strongly correlated matter.

Title: Designing Moire Patterns by Shearing
Authors: Pierre A. Pantaleon, Hector Sainz-Cruz, Francisco Guinea
Abstract: We analyze the elastic properties, structural effects, and low-energy physics of a sheared nanoribbon placed on top of graphene, which creates a gradually changing moire pattern. By means of a classical elastic model we derive the strains in the ribbon and we obtain its electronic energy spectrum with a scaled tight-binding model. The size of the sheared region is determined by the balance between elastic and van der Waals energy, and different regimes are identified. Near the clamped edge, moderate strains and small twist angles lead to one-dimensional channels. Near the sheared edge, a long region behaves like magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), showing a sharp peak in the density of states, mostly isolated from the rest of the spectrum. We also calculate the band topology along the ribbon and we find that it is stable for large intervals of strains and twist angles. Together with the experimental observations, these results show that the sheared nanoribbon geometry is ideal for exploring superconductivity and correlated phases in TBG in the very sought-after regime of ultralow twist angle disorder.

Title: Non-Reciprocal Interactions Reshape Topological Defect Annihilation
Authors: Ylann Rouzaire, Daniel JG Pearce, Ignacio Pagonabarraga, Demian Levis
Abstract: We show how non-reciprocal ferromagnetic interactions between neighbouring planar spins in two dimensions, affect the behaviour of topological defects. Non-reciprocity is introduced by weighting the coupling strength of the two-dimensional XY model by an anisotropic kernel. As a consequence, in addition to the topological charge $q$, the actual shape of the defects becomes crucial to faithfully describe their dynamics. Non-reciprocal coupling twists the spin field, selecting specific defect shapes, dramatically altering the pair annihilation process. Defect annihilation can either be enhanced or hindered, depending on the shape of the defects concerned and the degree of non-reciprocity in the system. We introduce a continuous description -- for which the phenomenological coefficients can be explicitly written in terms of the microscopic ones -- that captures the behaviour of the lattice model.

Title: Pressure-enhanced splitting of density wave transitions in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-δ}$

Abstract: The observation of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ under pressure, following the suppression of a high-temperature density wave state, has attracted considerable attention. The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.

Title: Spectral Density and Sum Rules for Second-Order Response Functions
Authors: Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte
Abstract: Sum rules for linear response functions give powerful and experimentally-relevant relations between frequency moments of response functions and ground state properties. In particular, renewed interest has been drawn to optical conductivity and density-density sum rules and their connection to quantum geometry in topological materials. At the same time, recent work has also illustrated the connection between quantum geometry and second-order nonlinear response functions in quantum materials, motivating the search for exact sum rules for second-order response that can provide experimental probes and theoretical constraints for geometry and topology in these systems. Here we begin to address these questions by developing a general formalism for deriving sum rules for second-order response functions. Using generalized Kramers-Kronig relations, we show that the second-order Kubo formula can be expressed in terms of a spectral density that is a sum of Dirac delta functions in frequency. We show that moments of the spectral density can be expressed in terms of averages of equal-time commutators, yielding a family of generalized sum rules; furthermore, these sum rules constrain the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the second harmonic generation rate. We apply our formalism to study generalized $f$-sum rules for the second-order density-density response function and the longitudinal nonlinear conductivity. We show that for noninteracting electrons in solids, the generalized $f$-sum rule can be written entirely in terms of matrix elements of the Bloch Hamiltonian. Finally, we derive a family of sum rules for rectification response, determining the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the time-independent response to a harmonic perturbation.

Title: Pivoting through the chiral-clock family
Authors: Nick G. Jones, Abhishodh Prakash, Paul Fendley
Abstract: The Onsager algebra, invented to solve the two-dimensional Ising model, can be used to construct conserved charges for a family of integrable $N$-state chiral clock models. We show how it naturally gives rise to a "pivot" procedure for this family of chiral Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians have an anti-unitary CPT symmetry that when combined with the usual $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock symmetry gives a non-abelian dihedral symmetry group $D_{2N}$. We show that this symmetry gives rise to symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order in this family for all even $N$, and representation-SPT (RSPT) physics for all odd $N$. The simplest such example is a next-nearest-neighbour chain generalising the spin-1/2 cluster model, an SPT phase of matter. We derive a matrix-product state representation of its fixed-point ground state along with the ensuing entanglement spectrum and symmetry fractionalisation. We analyse a rich phase diagram combining this model with the Onsager-integrable chiral Potts chain, and find trivial, symmetry-breaking and (R)SPT orders, as well as extended gapless regions. For odd $N$, the phase transitions are "unnecessarily" critical from the SPT point of view.

Title: Hierarchy construction for non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states via anyon condensation
Authors: Carolyn Zhang, Ashvin Vishwanath, Xiao-Gang Wen
Abstract: For a given parent fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state at filling fraction $\nu$, the hierarchy construction produces FQH states at nearby filling fractions $\{\nu_n\}$ by condensing minimally charged quasiholes or quasiparticles of the parent state into their own FQH states. The hierarchy construction has been useful for relating families of FQH states and for the experimental identification of the topological order of parent states via the presence of daughter states. We reinterpret the hierarchy construction as a two-step procedure: stacking with a second FQH state and condensing a condensable algebra of bosons. This two-step procedure can be applied to both abelian and non-abelian FQH states, and it does not require calculations with a wavefunction. We show this construction reproduces the hierarchies for the Laughlin and Pfaffian states, and can be applied further to propose hierarchies for various non-abelian FQH states.

Title: Theory of Intrinsic Phonon Thermal Hall Effect in $α$-RuCl$_3$
Authors: Ramesh Dhakal, David A. S. Kaib, Kate Choi, Sananda Biswas, Roser Valenti, Stephen M. Winter
Abstract: We apply a recently developed first-principles based approach for treating generic spin-phonon couplings in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling to study $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Of particular focus is the potential for this material to exhibit a phonon thermal Hall effect induced by spin-phonon interactions. We find that spin-orbit coupling significantly enriches the form of these interactions, and imbues them with chirality that is conducive to generating finite phonon Berry curvatures. We show that this leads to a phonon thermal Hall effect that qualitatively reproduces the measured field dependence of $\kappa_{xy}$ without requiring a field-induced spin liquid.

Title: Disorder Induced Superconductivity in TiSe_1.2S_0.8
Authors: M. Singh, P. Saha, A. Chahar, B. Birajdar, D.K. Shukla, S. Patnaik
Abstract: Disorder can be utilized as an effective parameter to probe the interplay between two long range orders such as superconductivity and charge density wave. In the present work, we report on the experimental evidence for filamentary superconductivity in polycrystalline TiSe1.2S0.8 with superconducting transition Tc ~ 7K. This is validated from magnetization and magneto-transport measurements. Strain induced dislocations, substitutional defects, and randomly distributed Ti ions (with local moments) are considered as possible sources of disorder. A detailed analysis of the temperature dependent resistivity evaluates the degree of disorder and the consequent localization effects. The findings are in striking contrast to the fact that superconductivity has not been reported in single crystals of TiSe2-xSx system. It is established that disorder serves as a stabilizing factor for the superconducting phase due to in-commensuration of the charge density wave.

Title: Spontaneous magnetic field and disorder effects in BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with honeycomb network

Abstract: Chiral superconductivity exhibits the formation of novel electron pairs that breaks the time-reversal symmetry and has been actively studied in various quantum materials in recent years. However, despite its potential to provide definitive information, effects of disorder in the crystal structure on the chiral superconductivity has not yet been clarified, and therefore the investigation using a solid-solution system is desirable. We report muon-spin-relaxation (muSR) results of layered pnictide BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with a honeycomb network composed of Pt and (As, Sb). We observed an increase of the zero-field muon-spin relaxation rate in the superconducting (SC) state at the Sb end of x=1.0, suggesting the occurrence of spontaneous magnetic field due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the SC state. On the other hand, spontaneous magnetic field was almost and completely suppressed for the As-Sb mixed samples of x=0.9 and 0.2, respectively, suggesting that the time-reversal symmetry breaking SC state in x=1.0 is sensitive to disorder. The magnetic penetration depth estimated from transverse-field muSR measurements at x=1.0 and 0.2 behaved like weak-coupling s-wave superconductivity. These seemingly incompatible zero-field and transverse-field muSR results of BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with x=1.0 could be understood in terms of chiral d-wave superconductivity with point nodes on the three-dimensional Fermi surface.

Title: Thermalization is typical in large classical and quantum harmonic systems
Authors: Marco Cattaneo, Marco Baldovin, Dario Lucente, Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi, Angelo Vulpiani
Abstract: We establish an analytical criterion for dynamical thermalization within harmonic systems, applicable to both classical and quantum models. Specifically, we prove that thermalization of various observables, such as particle energies in physically relevant random quadratic Hamiltonians, is typical for large systems ($N \gg 1$) with initial conditions drawn from the microcanonical distribution. Moreover, we show that thermalization can also arise from non-typical initial conditions, where only a finite fraction of the normal modes is excited. A different choice of initial conditions, such as all the initial energy localized in a single particle, instead leads to energy equipartition without thermalization. Since the models we consider are integrable, our findings provide a general dynamical basis for an approach to thermalization that bypasses chaos and ergodicity, focusing instead on the physical requirement that thermodynamic observables depend on a large number of normal modes, and build a bridge between the classical and quantum theories of thermalization.

Title: Theory of Casimir Forces: A Unified Approach Using Finite-Temperature Field Theory
Authors: P.E. Brandyshev, Yu.A. Budkov
Abstract: We present a quantum theory of Casimir forces between perfect electrical conductors, based on quantum electrodynamics and quantum statistical physics. This theory utilizes Kapusta's finite-temperature quantum field theory, combined with the Faddeev-Popov ghost formalism. This approach allows us to calculate Casimir forces at finite temperatures, providing both previously known and new physical insights from a unified perspective. Furthermore, our method enables us to compute the stress tensor associated with Casimir forces, in accordance with the Helmholtz free energy of an equilibrium quantum electromagnetic field. Using this methodology, we calculate the excess surface tension on the walls of slit-like pores due to the Casimir effect.

Title: Quantum entanglement and quantum geometry measured with inelastic X-ray scattering
Authors: David Bałut, Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte
Abstract: Using inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS), we experimentally investigate the quantum geometry and quantum information in the large-gap insulator, LiF. Using sum rules for the density-density response function measured in IXS, we compute the quantum Fisher information of the equilibrium density matrix of LiF associated with density perturbations. Next, by exploiting universal relations between the quantum Fisher information, the optical conductivity, and the quantum metric tensor, we extrapolate the diagonal $(h,k,l) = (1,0,0)$ component of the quantum metric of LiF, known as the quantum weight. We compare our results to recently-proposed bounds on the quantum weight and find that the quantum weight in LiF comes close to saturating a theoretical upper bound, showing that quantum-mechanical delocalization plays an important role even in ionic insulators. Our work serves as a proof-of-principle that IXS techniques can be used to quantify state-of-the-art quantum geometric quantities of materials, and establishes the quantum Fisher information as an experimentally-accessible generalization of quantum geometry to real materials.

Title: Influence of oxygen orbitals and boundary conditions on the pairing behavior in the Emery model for doped ladders
Authors: Gökmen Polat, Eric Jeckelmann (Institute of Theoretical Physics, Leibniz Universität Hannover)
Abstract: We investigate the Emery model on several ladder-like lattices including two legs of copper d-orbitals and various numbers of oxygen p-orbitals. Pair binding energy, pair spatial structure, density distribution, and pairing correlation functions are calculated using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We show that a Luther-Emery phase with enhanced pairing correlations can be found for hole doping as well as for electron doping with realistic model parameters. Ladder properties depend sensitively on model parameters, the oxygen p-orbitals taken into account, and boundary conditions. The pair binding energy is a more reliable quantity than correlation functions for studying pairing in ladders. Overall, our results for two-leg Emery ladders support the possibility of superconductivity in the hole-doped 2D model. The issue is rather to determine which of the various ladder structures and model parameters are appropriate to approximate the two-dimensional cuprates.

Title: Statistical Mechanics of Heteropolymers from Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Veronica Panizza, Alessandro Roggero, Philipp Hauke, Pietro Faccioli
Abstract: Lattice models are valuable tools to gain insight into the statistical physics of heteropolymers. We rigorously map the partition function of these models into a vacuum expectation value of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT), with both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. Because the associated path integral expression is not affected by a sign problem, it is amenable to Monte Carlo (MC) sampling in both the sequence and structure space, unlike conventional polymer field theory. At the same time, since the LGT encoding relies on qubits, it provides a framework for future efforts to capitalize on the development of quantum computing hardware. We discuss two illustrative applications of our formalism: first, we use it to characterize the thermodynamically stable sequences and structures of small heteropolymers consisting of two types of residues. Next, we assess its efficiency to sample ensembles of compact structures, finding that the MC decorrelation time scales only linearly with the chain length.

Title: Measurement of the dynamic charge susceptibility near the charge density wave transition in ErTe$_3$

Abstract: A charge density wave (CDW) is a phase of matter characterized by a periodic modulation of the valence electron density accompanied by a distortion of the lattice structure. The microscopic details of CDW formation are closely tied to the dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi(q,\omega)$, which describes the behavior of electronic collective modes. Despite decades of extensive study, the behavior of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the vicinity of a CDW transition has never been measured with high energy resolution ($\sim$meV). Here, we investigate the canonical CDW transition in ErTe$_3$ using momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), a technique uniquely sensitive to valence band charge excitations. Unlike phonons in these materials, which undergo conventional softening due to the Kohn anomaly at the CDW wavevector, the electronic excitations display purely relaxational dynamics that are well described by a diffusive model. The diffusivity peaks around 250 K, just below the critical temperature. Additionally, we report, for the first time, a divergence in the real part of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the static limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), a phenomenon predicted to characterize CDWs since the 1970s. These results highlight the importance of energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of electronic susceptibility and demonstrate the power of M-EELS as a versatile probe of charge dynamics in materials.

Title: On the Hidden Transient Interphase in Metal Anodes: Dynamic Precipitation Controls Electrochemical Interfaces in Batteries
Authors: Stephen T. Fuller, J.-X. Kent Zheng
Abstract: The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, SEI, formed on a battery electrode has been a central area of research for decades. This thin, complex layer profoundly impacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of the metal in battery anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal dissolution, the reverse reaction of deposition, in battery environments using a state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode and in-operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a Transient Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, T-SEI, that forms during fast discharging at high dissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to transient local supersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI fundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface, leading to a self-limiting morphological evolution and eventually yielding a flat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte decomposition, the T-SEI is fully relaxable upon removal of the enforced dissolution current. The formation of T-SEI, surprisingly, plays a critical role in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a fully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that deposited on pristine or low-rate discharged metal electrodes. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggests the deposition occurs via growth of the original grains. This is in stark contrast to the isolated, particulate nuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Our findings provide important insights into the electrochemical kinetics at the metal-electrolyte interface, particularly in concentrated or water-in-salt electrolytes that are close to the salt saturation limit. The results suggest a new dimension for electrochemical engineering in batteries.

Title: Designing Flat Bands and Pseudo-Landau Levels in GaAs with Patterned Gates
Authors: Pierre A. Pantaleon, Zhen Zhan, Siddhartha E. Morales, Gerardo G. Naumis
Abstract: We investigate the electronic properties of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a periodic patterned gate. By incorporating the superlattice (SL) potential induced by patterning into the Schrodinger equation, we develop a methodology for obtaining exact analytical solutions. These solutions enable us to construct a comprehensive phase diagram illustrating the emergence of narrow bands and pseudo-Landau levels driven by the SL potential. To complement the analytical approach, we employ a standard plane-wave formalism to track the evolution of the band structure as the SL strength increases. By breaking the inversion symmetry of the SL potential, we found a nontrivial band topology. Furthermore, we introduce a self-consistent Hartree screening to account for the interplay between the SL potential and electronic interactions. Our findings not only reveal the emergence of a non-trivial band topology and a competition between SL strength and electron-electron interactions, but also highlight the value of exact analytical solutions for understanding and engineering electronic phases in patterned 2DEG systems.

Title: Efficiency and Mechanism of Heat Flux Rectification with Non-Reciprocal Surface Waves in Weyl-Semi-Metals
Authors: A. Naeimi, S.-A. Biehs
Abstract: We reinvestigate the mechanism of near-field heat transfer rectification between two Weyl semimetal nanoparticles and a planar Weyl semimetal substrate via the coupling to non-reciprocal surface modes. We first show that the previously predicted rectification ratio of 2673 is incorrect and should rather be 1502. Furthermore we show that depending on the distance between the nanoparticles there can be a much more efficient heat flux rectification with ratios of about 6000. Furthermore, we identify a previously overlooked range of forward rectification and a range of strong backward rectification with rectification ratios larger than 8000 for relatively small Weyl node separations. We investigate the mechanism behind this large heat flux rectification and study its sensitivity with respect to certain material parameters and temperature showing that even larger rectification ratios up to 15000 are possible highlighting that certain Weyl semimetals are strong candidates for highly efficient heat flux rectification.

Title: Topological phase transition in monolayer 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$
Authors: Mohammad Mortezaei Nobahari, Mahmood Rezaei Roknabadi
Abstract: 1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. We theoretically prove the topological behavior and phase transition of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ using $k.p$ Hamiltonian and linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a strong spin-momentum locking with different orientations for the valence and conduction bands. Also, Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha<1$ the spin Hall conductivity is the only non-zero term $(C_s=1$ and $C_v=0)$, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha>1$, valley Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI). Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of non-trivial and trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices.

Title: Fluctuations of topological charges in two-dimensional classical Heisenberg model
Authors: Shan-Chang Tang, Yu Shi
Abstract: Binding and unbinding of vortices drives Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in two-dimensional XY model. Here we investigate whether similar mechanism works in two-dimensional Heisenberg model, by using the fluctuation of skyrmion number inside a loop to characterize the nature of binding versus unbinding of defects. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the fluctuation is proportional to the perimeter of the loop at low temperatures while it is proportional to the area of the loop at high temperatures, implying binding of the defects at low temperatures and unbinding at high temperatures.

Title: Critical relaxational dynamics at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional spin models with ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge symmetry
Authors: Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We characterize the dynamic universality classes of a relaxational dynamics under equilibrium conditions at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional (3D) spin systems with a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge symmetry. In particular, we consider the pure lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge model and the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, which present various types of transitions: topological transitions without a local order parameter and transitions characterized by both gauge-invariant and non-gauge-invariant XY order parameters. We consider a standard relaxational (locally reversible) Metropolis dynamics and determine the dynamic critical exponent $z$ that characterizes the critical slowing down of the dynamics as the continuous transition is approached. At the topological ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge transitions we find $z=2.55(6)$. Therefore, the dynamics is significantly slower than in Ising systems -- $z\approx 2.02$ for the 3D Ising universality class -- although 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge systems and Ising systems have the same static critical behavior because of duality. As for the nontopological transitions in the 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, we find that their critical dynamics belong to the same dynamic universality class as the relaxational dynamics in ungauged XY systems, independently of the gauge-invariant or nongauge-invariant nature of the order parameter at the transition.

Title: Iterative charge equilibration for fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potentials
Authors: Emir Kocer, Andreas Singraber, Jonas A. Finkler, Philipp Misof, Tsz Wai Ko, Christoph Dellago, Jörg Behler
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLP) allow to perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation MLPs need to be used, which take global information about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be achieved in a charge equilibration (QEq) step, but the direct solution (dQEq) of the set of linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size, in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended to be used in combination with the n2p2 library. The method itself is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs. An assessment of the accuracy and the efficiency is presented for a benchmark system of FeCl$_3$ in water.

Title: The diffusive dynamics and electrochemical regulation of weak polyelectrolytes across liquid interfaces
Authors: Giulia Laura Celora, Ralf Blossey, Andreas Munch, Barbara Wagner
Abstract: We propose a framework to study the spatio-temporal evolution of liquid-liquid phase separation of weak polyelectrolytes in ionic solutions. Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation.

Title: Investigation of O interstitial diffusion in $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$: direct approach via master diffusion equations
Authors: Grace McKnight, Channyung Lee, Elif Ertekin
Abstract: Monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, a promising wide band gap semiconducting material, exhibits complex, anisotropic diffusional characteristics and mass transport behavior as a results of its low symmetry crystal structure. From first-principles calculations combined with master diffusion equations, we determine three-dimensional diffusion tensors for neutral ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$) and 2- charged oxygen interstitials ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$). Systematic exploration of the configurational space identifies stable configurations in these two dominant charge states and their corresponding formation energies. By connecting every pair of low-energy configurations considering both interstitial or interstitialcy hops, we construct three-dimensional diffusion networks and evaluate hopping barriers of all transition pathways in networks. Combining the collection of (i) defect configurations and their formation energies and (ii) the hopping barriers that link them, we construct and solve the master diffusion equations for $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ separately through the Onsager approach, resulting in respective three-dimensional diffusion tensors D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{0}$ and D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{2-}$. Both $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ present the fastest diffusion along the $b$-axis, demonstrating significant anisotropy. The predicted self-diffusivities along [100] and [$\overline{2}01$] align well with previously reported values from isotopically labeled oxygen tracer experiments, highlighting the reliability of the approach in capturing complex diffusion mechanisms.

Title: Amorphous to Crystalline Transformation: How Cluster Aggregation Drives the Multistep Nucleation of ZIF-8

Abstract: Nucleation, the pivotal first step of crystallization, governs essential characteristics of crystallization products, including size distribution, morphology, and polymorphism. While understanding this process is paramount to the design of chemical, pharmaceutical and industrial production processes, major knowledge gaps remain, especially with respect to the crystallization of porous solids. Also for nanocrystalline ZIF-8, one of the most widely studied metal-organic frameworks, questions regarding the species involved in the nucleation pathway and their structural and chemical transformations remain unanswered. By combining harmonic light scattering, inherently sensitive to structural changes, with NMR spectroscopy, which reveals molecular exchanges between particles and solution, we were able to capture the crystallization mechanism of ZIF-8 in unprecedented detail. This dual approach provides concurrent structural and chemical insights, revealing key processes not previously observed in ZIF crystallization. Upon mixing small charged prenucleation clusters (PNCs) are formed, exhibiting an excess of ligands and net positive charge. We show that nucleation is initiated by aggregation of PNCs, through the release of ligands and associated protons to the liquid. This leads to the formation of charge neutral amorphous precursor particles (APPs) which incorporate neutral monomers from solution, and crystallize ZIF-8. Our work highlights chemical dynamics as a vital, yet often overlooked, dimension in the multi-stage structural evolution of MOFs. By establishing the critical role of PNCs in the nucleation of ZIF-8, new pathways open up for controlling crystallization of metal-organic frameworks through targeted chemical interactions with these species.

Title: Current Flow Mapping in Conducting Ferroelectric Domain Walls using Scanning NV-Magnetometry
Authors: Conor J. McCluskey, James Dalzell, Amit Kumar, J. Marty Gregg
Abstract: The electrical conductivity of parallel plate capacitors, with ferroelectric lithium niobate as the dielectric layer, can be extensively and progressively modified by the controlled injection of conducting domain walls. Domain wall-based memristor devices hence result. Microstructures, developed as a result of partial switching, are complex and so simple models of equivalent circuits, based on the collective action of all conducting domain wall channels acting identically and in parallel, may not be appropriate. Here, we directly map the current density in ferroelectric domain wall memristors in-situ, by mapping Oersted fields, using nitrogen vacancy centre microscopy. Current density maps were found to directly correlate with the domain microstructure, revealing that a strikingly small fraction of the total domain wall network is responsible for the majority of the current flow. This insight forces a two order of magnitude correction to the carrier densities, previously inferred from standard scanning probe or macroscopic electrical characterisation.

Title: A high-throughput ab initio study of elemental segregation and cohesion at ferritic-iron grain boundaries
Authors: Han Lin Mai, Xiang-Yuan Cui, Tilmann Hickel, Jörg Neugebauer, Simon Ringer
Abstract: Segregation of alloying elements and impurities at grain boundaries (GBs) critically influences material behavior by affecting cohesion. In this study, we present an ab initio high-throughput evaluation of segregation energies and cohesive effects for all elements in the periodic table (Z: 1 to 92, H to U) across six model ferritic iron GBs using density functional theory (DFT). From these data, we construct comprehensive elemental maps for solute segregation tendencies and cohesion at GBs, providing guidance for segregation engineering. We systematically assess the cohesive effects of different elements in all segregating positions along multiple fracture paths with a quantum-chemistry bond-order method as well as a modified Rice-Wang theory of interfacial cohesion. The effects of segregants on the cohesion of GBs are shown to vary drastically as a function of site character, and hence their induced cohesive effects must be considered as a thermodynamic average over the spectral energy distribution. Thus, models that overlook these aspects may fail to accurately predict the impacts of varying alloying concentrations, thermal processing conditions, or GB types. The insights presented here, along with our accompanying dataset, are expected to advance our understanding of GB segregation in steels and other materials.

Title: Materials Map Integrating Experimental and Computational Data through Graph-Based Machine Learning for Enhanced Materials Discovery
Authors: Yusuke Hashimoto, Xue Jia, Hao Li, Takaaki Tomai
Abstract: Materials informatics (MI), which emerges from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to greatly streamline material discovery and development. The data used for MI are obtained from both computational and experimental studies, while their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that captures trends hidden in the experimental datasets to compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained data to construct materials maps, which visualize the relation in the structural features of materials, aiming to support study by the experimental researchers. The map is constructed using a MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements the graph-based representation of material structures, deep learning, and dimensional reduction for map construction. We evaluate the obtained materials maps through statistical analysis and found that MDL using message passing neural network (MPNN) architecture enables efficient extraction of features that reflect the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we found that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in the prediction of material properties. We assume this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.

Abstract: Non-diffusive, hydrodynamic-like transport of charge or heat has been observed in several materials, and recent, pioneering experiments have suggested the possible emergence of electron-phonon bifluids. Here we introduce the first-principles theory and computational framework to describe these phenomena, showing that the viscosity of electron-phonon bifluids is microscopically determined by composite ``relaxon'' electron-phonon excitations that also describe electron-phonon drag effects on thermoelectric transport coefficients. We show that these composite excitations emerge from the microscopic coupled electron-phonon Boltzmann transport equation, and demonstrate that the latter can be coarse-grained into a set of mesoscopic Viscous Thermoelectric Equations (VTE). The VTE unify the established hydrodynamic equation for electrons derived by Gurzhi [Sov. Phys. Usp. 11 1968], and the recently developed Viscous Heat Equations for phonons [PRX 10, 2020], while also extending them to cover the mixed electron-phonon bifluid regime. We employ this framework to elucidate from first principles the conditions under which electron and phonon fluids can coexist and mix, as well as to rationalize experimental signatures of electron-phonon drag in graphite.

Title: Uncovering Local Integrability in Quantum Many-Body Dynamics
Authors: Oles Shtanko, Derek S. Wang, Haimeng Zhang, Nikhil Harle, Alireza Seif, Ramis Movassagh, Zlatko Minev
Abstract: Interacting many-body quantum systems and their dynamics, while fundamental to modern science and technology, are formidable to simulate and understand. However, by discovering their symmetries, conservation laws, and integrability one can unravel their intricacies. Here, using up to 124 qubits of a fully programmable quantum computer, we uncover local conservation laws and integrability in one- and two-dimensional periodically-driven spin lattices in a regime previously inaccessible to such detailed analysis. We focus on the paradigmatic example of disorder-induced ergodicity breaking, where we first benchmark the system crossover into a localized regime through anomalies in the one-particle-density-matrix spectrum and other hallmark signatures. We then demonstrate that this regime stems from hidden local integrals of motion by faithfully reconstructing their quantum operators, thus providing a detailed portrait of the system's integrable dynamics. Our results demonstrate a versatile strategy for extracting the hidden dynamical structure from noisy experiments on large-scale quantum computers.

Title: Digital-analog quantum computing of fermion-boson models in superconducting circuits
Authors: Shubham Kumar, Narendra N. Hegade, Enrique Solano, Francisco Albarrán-Arriagada, Gabriel Alvarado Barrios
Abstract: We propose a digital-analog quantum algorithm for simulating the Hubbard-Holstein model, describing strongly-correlated fermion-boson interactions, in a suitable architecture with superconducting circuits. It comprises a linear chain of qubits connected by resonators, emulating electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-p) interactions, as well as fermion tunneling. Our approach is adequate for a digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) of fermion-boson models including those described by the Hubbard-Holstein model. We show the reduction in the circuit depth of the DAQC algorithm, a sequence of digital steps and analog blocks, outperforming the purely digital approach. We exemplify the quantum simulation of a half-filling two-site Hubbard-Holstein model. In such example we obtain fidelities larger than 0.98, showing that our proposal is suitable to study the dynamical behavior of solid-state systems. Our proposal opens the door to computing complex systems for chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics.

Title: Existence of solution to a system of PDEs modeling the crystal growth inside lithium batteries
Authors: Omar Lakkis, Alexandros Skouras, Vanessa Styles
Abstract: We study a model for lithium (Li) electrodeposition on Li-metal electrodes that leads to dendritic pattern formation. The model comprises of a system of three coupled PDEs, taking the form of an Allen--Cahn equation, a Nernst--Planck equation and a Poisson equation. We prove existence of a weak solution and stability results for this system and present numerical simulations resulting from a finite element approximation of the system, which illustrate the dendritic nature of solutions to the model.

Title: On the role of geometric phase in the dynamics of elastic waveguides
Authors: Mohit Kumar, Fabio Semperlotti
Abstract: The geometric phase provides important mathematical insights to understand the fundamental nature and evolution of the dynamic response in a wide spectrum of systems ranging from quantum to classical mechanics. While the concept of geometric phase, which is an additional phase factor occurring in dynamical systems, holds the same meaning across different fields of application, its use and interpretation can acquire important nuances specific to the system of interest. In recent years, the development of quantum topological materials and its extension to classical mechanical systems have renewed the interest in the concept of geometric phase. This review revisits the concept of geometric phase and discusses, by means of either established or original results, its critical role in the design and dynamic behavior of elastic waveguides. Concepts of differential geometry and topology are put forward to provide a theoretical understanding of the geometric phase and its connection to the physical properties of the system. Then, the concept of geometric phase is applied to different types of elastic waveguides to explain how either topologically trivial or non-trivial behavior can emerge based on the geometric features of the waveguide.

Title: Low-overhead non-Clifford fault-tolerant circuits for all non-chiral abelian topological phases
Authors: Andreas Bauer
Abstract: We propose a family of explicit geometrically local circuits on a 2-dimensional planar grid of qudits, realizing any abelian non-chiral topological phase as an actively error-corrected fault-tolerant memory. These circuits are constructed from measuring 1-form symmetries in discrete fixed-point path integrals, which we express through cellular cohomology and higher-order cup products. The specific path integral we use is the abelian Dijkgraaf-Witten state sum on a 3-dimensional cellulation, which is a spacetime representation of the twisted quantum double model. The resulting circuits are based on a syndrome extraction circuit of the (qudit) stabilizer toric code, into which we insert non-Clifford phase gates that implement the ``twist''. The overhead compared to the toric code is moderate, in contrast to known constructions for twisted abelian phases. We also show that other architectures for the (qudit) toric code phase, like measurement-based topological quantum computation or Floquet codes, can be enriched with phase gates to implement twisted quantum doubles instead of their untwisted versions. As a further result, we prove fault tolerance under arbitrary local (including non-Pauli) noise for a very general class of topological circuits that we call 1-form symmetric fixed-point circuits. This notion unifies the circuits in this paper as well as the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, measurement-based topological quantum computation, or the (CSS) honeycomb Floquet code. We also demonstrate how our method can be adapted to construct fault-tolerant circuits for specific non-Abelian phases. In the appendix we present an explicit combinatorial procedure to define formulas for higher cup products on arbitrary cellulations, which might be interesting in its own right to the TQFT and topological-phases community.

Title: Strong coupling non-Markovian quantum thermodynamics of a finite-bath system
Authors: Devvrat Tiwari, Baibhab Bose, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: The focus is on understanding the quantum thermodynamics of strongly coupled non-Markovian quantum systems. To this end, a non-trivial, non-Markovian model of a central spin surrounded by a spin bath is taken up, and its exact evolution is derived for arbitrary system-bath couplings. The fundamental quantum thermodynamic quantities, such as system and bath internal energies, work, heat, entropy production, and ergotropy, are calculated using the dynamics and original system (bath) Hamiltonian. An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. The thermodynamic entropy of the system at thermal equilibrium is studied using the Hamiltonian of mean force in the strong coupling regime. The role of a canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the above thermodynamic quantities, a recently developed technique, is also investigated. Further, an interesting observation relevant to the spin bath acting as a charger is made in a scenario where the central spin is envisaged as a quantum battery.

Title: Dipole-dipole interactions mediated by a photonic flat band
Authors: Enrico Di Benedetto, Alejandro Gonzalez-Tudela, Francesco Ciccarello
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) are energy bands with zero group velocity, which in electronic systems were shown to favor strongly correlated phenomena. Indeed, a FB can be spanned with a basis of strictly localized states, the so called "compact localized states" (CLSs), which are yet generally non-orthogonal. Here, we study emergent dipole-dipole interactions between emitters dispersively coupled to the photonic analogue of a FB, a setup within reach in state-of the-art experimental platforms. We show that the strength of such photon-mediated interactions decays exponentially with distance with a characteristic localization length which, unlike typical behaviours with standard bands, saturates to a finite value as the emitter's energy approaches the FB. Remarkably, we find that the localization length grows with the overlap between CLSs according to an analytically-derived universal scaling law valid for a large class of FBs both in 1D and 2D. Using giant atoms (non-local atom-field coupling) allows to tailor interaction potentials having the same shape of a CLS or a superposition of a few of these.

Title: Topological transitions in quantum jump dynamics: Hidden exceptional points
Authors: Andrei I. Pavlov, Yuval Gefen, Alexander Shnirman
Abstract: Complex spectra of dissipative quantum systems may exhibit degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs). At these points the systems' dynamics may undergo drastic changes. Phenomena associated with EPs and their applications have been extensively studied in relation to various experimental platforms, including, i.a., the superconducting circuits. While most of the studies focus on EPs appearing due to the variation of the system's physical parameters, we focus on EPs emerging in the full counting statistics of the system. We consider a monitored three level system and find multiple EPs in the Lindbladian eigenvalues considered as functions of a counting field. These "hidden" EPs are not accessible without the insertion of the counting field into the Linbladian, i.e., if only the density matrix of the system is studied. Nevertheless, we show that the "hidden" EPs are accessible experimentally. We demonstrate that these EPs signify transitions between different topological classes which are rigorously characterized in terms of the braid theory. Furthermore, we identify dynamical observables affected by these transitions and demonstrate how experimentally measured quantum jump distributions can be used to spot transitions between different topological regimes. Additionally, we establish a duality between the conventional Lindbladian EPs (zero counting field) and some of the "hidden" ones. Our findings allow for easier experimental observations of the EP transitions, normally concealed by the Lindbladian steady state, without applying postselection schemes. These results can be directly generalized to any monitored open system as long as it is described within the Lindbladian formalism.

Title: Scalable parallel measurement of individual nitrogen-vacancy centers
Authors: Matthew Cambria, Saroj Chand, Caitlin Reiter, Shimon Kolkowitz
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a solid-state spin defect that has been widely adopted for quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Typically, experiments are performed either with a single isolated NV center or with an unresolved ensemble of many NV centers, resulting in a trade-off between measurement speed and spatial resolution or control over individual defects. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform that bypasses this trade-off by addressing multiple optically resolved NV centers in parallel. We perform charge- and spin-state manipulations selectively on multiple NV centers from within a larger set, and we manipulate and measure the electronic spin states of over 100 NV centers in parallel. We show that the high signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements enables the detection of shot-to-shot pairwise correlations between the spin states of 108 NV centers, corresponding to the simultaneous measurement of 5,778 unique correlation coefficients. We discuss how our platform can be scaled to parallel experiments with thousands of individually resolved NV centers. These results enable parallelized high-throughput sensing experiments that retain the nanoscale spatial resolution of single defects, and will thereby help to unlock advances in applications such as single-molecule NMR and characterization of integrated circuits. In addition, our approach to multiplexing provides a natural platform for the application of recently developed correlated sensing techniques.

Title: Ab initio machine learning simulation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solutions to the solid state
Authors: Pablo M. Piaggi, Julian D. Gale, Paolo Raiteri
Abstract: A first principles machine learning model has been developed aimed at studying the formation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solution using molecular dynamics simulations. The model, dubbed SCAN-ML, reproduces accurately the potential energy surface derived from ab initio density-functional theory within the SCAN approximation for the exchange and correlation functional. A broad range of properties have been calculated relevant to ions in solution, solid phases, and the calcite/water interface. Careful comparison with results from experiments and semi-empirical force fields shows that SCAN-ML provides an excellent description of this system, surpassing state-of-the-art force fields for many properties, while providing a benchmark for many quantities that are currently beyond the reach of direct ab initio molecular dynamics. A key feature of SCAN-ML is its ability to capture chemical reactions, which reveals that calcium carbonate ion pair formation occurs predominantly via binding of calcium to bicarbonate, with the subsequent loss of a proton to water, rather than by direct association. Our model thus paves the way for the study of reactive crystallization pathways in calcium carbonate, which are currently poorly understood.

Title: Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits
Authors: Menghan Song, Zhaoyi Zeng, Ting-Tung Wang, Yi-Zhuang You, Zi Yang Meng, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.

Title: Optimal Conversion from Classical to Quantum Randomness via Quantum Chaos
Authors: Wai-Keong Mok, Tobias Haug, Adam L. Shaw, Manuel Endres, John Preskill
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems provide a unique platform for exploring the rich interplay between chaos, randomness, and complexity. In a recently proposed paradigm known as deep thermalization, random quantum states of system A are generated by performing projective measurements on system B following chaotic Hamiltonian evolution acting jointly on AB. In this scheme, the randomness of the projected state ensemble arises from the intrinsic randomness of the outcomes when B is measured. Here we propose a modified scheme, in which classical randomness injected during the protocol is converted by quantum chaos into quantum randomness of the resulting state ensemble. We show that for generic chaotic systems this conversion is optimal in that each bit of injected classical entropy generates as much additional quantum randomness as adding an extra qubit to B. This significantly enhances the randomness of the projected ensemble without imposing additional demands on the quantum hardware. Our scheme can be easily implemented on typical analog quantum simulators, providing a more scalable route for generating quantum randomness valuable for many applications. In particular, we demonstrate that the accuracy of a shadow tomography protocol can be substantially improved.

Title: The spectrum of perturbed (3, 10) minimal model
Authors: Andrei Katsevich
Abstract: We study RG flows between non-unitary minimal models and massive quantum theories using Truncated Conformal Space Approach (TCSA). We consider the integrable non-unitary Yang-Lee model perturbed by $i\phi$ and the $D$-series version of $M(3,10)$ which is a product of two Yang-Lee models, perturbing the latter by relevant operators $\phi_{1,3}$ and $i\phi^+_{1,5}$. Utilizing the quasi-primary fields we find, TCSA is performed up to the level $N=15$ for $M(2,5)+i\phi$. The conjecture about the $M(3,10)$ perturbed by $\phi_{1,3}$ is stated: this theory flows to a massive phase; its spectrum contains a kink and two breathers, whose masses we find. Our TCSA results support the conjecture.

Title: Geometric constructions of generalized dual-unitary circuits from biunitarity
Authors: Michael A. Rampp, Suhail A. Rather, Pieter W. Claeys
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing solvable lattice models of chaotic many-body quantum dynamics with multiple unitary directions using biunitary connections. We show that a network of biunitary connections on the Kagome lattice naturally defines a multi-unitary circuit, where three `arrows of time' directly reflect the lattice symmetry. These models unify various constructions of hierarchical dual-unitary and triunitary gates and present new families of models with solvable correlations and entanglement dynamics. Using multilayer constructions of biunitary connections, we additionally introduce multilayer circuits with monoclinic symmetry and higher level hierarchical dual-unitary solvability and discuss their (non-)ergodicity. Our work demonstrates how different classes of solvable models can be understood as arising from different geometric structures in spacetime.

Title: Stabilization of macroscopic dynamics by fine-grained disorder in many-species ecosystems
Authors: Juan Giral Martínez, Silvia de Monte, Matthieu Barbier
Abstract: A central feature of complex systems is the relevance and entanglement of different levels of description. For instance, the dynamics of ecosystems can be alternatively described in terms of large ecological processes and classes of organisms, or of individual species and their relations. Low-dimensional heuristic 'macroscopic' models that are widely used to capture ecological relationships -- and commonly evidence out-of equilibrium regimes -- implicitly assume that species-level 'microscopic' heterogeneity can be neglected. Here, we address the stability of such macroscopic descriptions to the addition of disordered microscopic interactions. We find that increased heterogeneity can stabilize collective as well as species fluctuations -- contrary to the well-known destabilizing effect of disorder on fixed points. We analytically find the conditions for the existence of heterogeneity-driven equilibria, and relate their stability to a mismatch in microscopic time scales. This may shed light onto the empirical observation that many-species ecosystems often appear stable at aggregated levels despite highly diverse interactions and large fluctuations at the species level.

Title: Devil's staircase inside shrimp-shaped regions reveals periodicity of plateau spikes and bursts
Authors: Luiz F. B. Caixeta, Matheus H. P. Gonçalves, M. H. R. Tragtenberg, Mauricio Girardi-Schappo
Abstract: Slow-fast dynamics are intrinsically related to complex phenomena and are responsible for many of the homeostatic dynamics that keep biological systems healthy functioning. We study a discrete-time membrane potential model that can generate a diverse set of spiking behavior depending on the choice of slow-fast time scales, from fast spiking to bursting, or plateau action potentials -- also known as cardiac spikes since they are characteristic in heart myocytes. The plateau of cardiac spikes can lose stability, generating early or delayed afterdepolarizations (EADs and DADs, respectively), both of which are related to cardiac arrhythmia. We show the periodicity changes along the transition from the healthy action potentials to these impaired oscillations. We show that while EADs are mainly periodic attractors, DADs usually come with chaos. EADs are found inside shrimp-shaped regions of the parameter space. However, in our system, multiple periodic attractors live within a shrimp-shaped region, giving it an internal structure made of infinite transitions between periodicities forming a complete devil's staircase. Understanding the periodicity of plateau attractors in slow-fast systems could be useful in unveiling the characteristics of heart myocyte behaviors that are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.

Title: Zero energy modes with Gaussian, exponential, or polynomial decay: Exact solutions in hermitian and nonhermitian regimes
Authors: Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro
Abstract: Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as Gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schrödinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.

Title: Mean-Field Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model in High Dimension
Authors: Shahnaz Farhat, Denis Périce, Sören Petrat
Abstract: The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schrödinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.

Title: Aging in coevolving voter models
Authors: Byungjoon Min, Maxi San Miguel
Abstract: Aging, understood as the tendency to remain in a given state the longer the persistence time in that state, plays a crucial role in the dynamics of complex systems. In this paper, we explore the influence of aging on coevolution models, that is, models in which the dynamics of the states of the nodes in a complex network is coupled to the dynamics of the structure of the network. In particular we consider the coevolving voter model, and we introduce two versions of this model that include aging effects: the Link Aging Model (LAM) and the Node Aging Model (NAM). In the LAM, aging is associated with the persistence time of a link in the evolving network, while in the NAM, aging is associated with the persistence time of a node in a given state. We show that aging significantly affects the absorbing phase transition of the coevolution voter model, shifting the transition point in opposite directions for the LAM and NAM. We also show that the generic absorbing phase transition can disappear due to aging effects.

Title: Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains
Authors: Dragan Marković, Mihailo Čubrović
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.

Title: Probing non-equilibrium steady states of the Klein-Gordon field with Unruh-DeWitt detectors
Authors: Albert Georg Passegger, Rainer Verch
Abstract: We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The NESS arises from bringing two semi-infinite heat baths into thermal contact along a hypersurface. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the resulting transition rates with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not properly couple to the heat flow, resulting in the detector to merely register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.

Title: Compactifying Electronic Wavefunctions I: Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG
Authors: Bruna G. M. Araújo, Antonio M S Macedo
Abstract: Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.

Title: When Can You Get Away with Low Memory Adam?
Authors: Dayal Singh Kalra, John Kirchenbauer, Maissam Barkeshli, Tom Goldstein
Abstract: Adam is the go-to optimizer for training modern machine learning models, but it requires additional memory to maintain the moving averages of the gradients and their squares. While various low-memory optimizers have been proposed that sometimes match the performance of Adam, their lack of reliability has left Adam as the default choice. In this work, we apply a simple layer-wise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis to quantify when second-moment tensors can be effectively replaced by their means across different dimensions. Our SNR analysis reveals how architecture, training hyperparameters, and dataset properties impact compressibility along Adam's trajectory, naturally leading to $\textit{SlimAdam}$, a memory-efficient Adam variant. $\textit{SlimAdam}$ compresses the second moments along dimensions with high SNR when feasible, and leaves when compression would be detrimental. Through experiments across a diverse set of architectures and training scenarios, we show that $\textit{SlimAdam}$ matches Adam's performance and stability while saving up to $98\%$ of total second moments. Code for $\textit{SlimAdam}$ is available at this https URL.

Title: Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Multiwavelets and DMRG
Authors: Martina Nibbi, Luca Frediani, Evgueni Dinvay, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.
